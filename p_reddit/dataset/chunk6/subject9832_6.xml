	<TEXT> "You're a murderer?"

"Yes."

"I don't believe you."

"Why?"

Sara paused, her mouth slowly dropped in disbelief from the words David spoke.

"Um, because you just don't tell people that you're a murderer."

"I wanted you to know, I really like where this is going."

"Well, now this is going nowhere because now I don't even know who you are, is your name really David?"

"No."

Sara eyes got wide. "You're name. Is not fucking David?"

"Okay, well, maybe I should have added some context before I would lay something that heavy on you. My name isn't David. It's Dave."

Sara paused and leaned forward, her eyes spoke loud but she decided to use her words. 

"David, Dave is the same exact fucking thing."

"Actually, no, it's one less syllable."

"David and Dave are the same thing!" Sara voice boomed in the crowed restaurant. 

"Look!" David shouted, throwing the napkin that rested on his lap on the table in front of him. "I was trying to be honest! It's people like you that make the world impossible to live in!"

"Oh really, Jeffery Dahmer, please continue! Tell me it's impossible when you're so willing to admit you're a murderer. You know what." Sara pushed her chair out from underneath her and slammed a bundle of bills on the table. 

"This is for my half, please, don't follow me or I'll call the police." Sara stormed out of the restaurant, all eyes gazed on Dave as he sat by himself. 

"Fine! I didn't even want to kill you anyways! Waiter, can I have a pepsi please?

the waiter came forward slowly, leaned down and whispered. 

"Is coke okay?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "How are you going to do it?" 

It was the 5th time he asked me. I didn't know. I paced in my apartment with my hands behind my back. It was a delicate matter. I had to be careful. 

"We can call the news?" I asked my friend Jeff. Jeff took a bite of his pizza and put it back in the box below him. 

"No, we can't do that. They'll try to twist and manipulate the story to make you sound like a evil warlock or something. And we're white, why would they care?"

Damn. He was right. We couldn't trust the news let alone get their attention. We had to think. I paced back and forth. Back. and forth. 

"YouTube video?" I suggested. 

"No. Wouldn't work. Dude. It's magic. People are just going to think you're using Sony Vegas or Final Cut pro." Jeff picked up another piece of pizza, taking another bite, chewing with his mouth open. "Dude we live in a different time. We need to find that smart black dude, what's his name? Neil Mike Tyson mows grassy or somethin?" 

"Neil Degrasse Tyson."

"Yes him! If we find him. We can prove that we found magic spells. And we know how they work. "

I thought for a moment. He was high profile. He was smart. Jeff was on to something. 

"We have to be careful man." I said. "I don't want to be the reason the world ends because Neil Degrasse Tyson becomes an evil spell casting mage."

Jeff took another bite of his pizza and stood up from the couch coming over to me with pizza still in his teeth. 

"Well Stephen, there's only one way to find out. "  </TEXT>

"Daddy. Daddy? What's wrong? Daddy? 

I felt my heart pounding. I stepped slowly closer towards the bed. 
.
"Penny, this is what we are going to do." I gestured with my hands to reach for her.

"NOOOOOOO!" the thing under her bed boomed shaking the bed violently. Penny fell to the floor. I fell back toward the door. I saw penny grasping at her leg. "Daddy! Daddy! Help!" He has her. 

"What are you!" I screamed. I grabbed Penny and I pulled. I pulled hard. It was so strong. So strong. I saw its black skelton hand with long fingers wrapped around her leg tightly. 

"Daddy! Daddy! it hurts!"

"Sweetie baby please hold on."

"SHE'S MINE!"

I almost lost my grip. It was so strong. I pulled and pulled. My feet slipping. I pulled and pulled. 

"Daddy. Please! I don't want to go with him! DADDY PLEASE MAKE HIM STOP."

"Honey! Sweetie I'm trying! " I gave it everything I had. I pulled Penny. I pulled hard. He was so strong. 

"MINE!" 

I lost my grip of Penny. I saw her hit the floor and vanished under the bed. 

"No!" I went to the bed and lifted it up with everything I had. I flipped the bed over. He was gone. They where gone. I fell to my knees and bent over to the floor. 

"Penny, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. "

He was just so strong. He was so strong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saint Peter looked down at Stephen, his glasses on his nose. He exhaled and continued. 

"Okay, Stephen. You do understand where you are?"

"Yes, Yes I do. "

"Okay, so you know, and understand we know everything, ever, in the history of ever, correct?" 

"Yes, I do."

"Okay, so we're going over your behaviors you exhibited in video games, and you are denying, that you've never harmed a single thing in a video game. Ever. "

Saint Peter and looked down to Stephen. Stephen looked around confused, shrugging his shoulders. 

"Not a single soul."

Saint Peter huffed . He clicked underneath his pottium and descending from above a large screen made it's way besides Saint Peter. Another button clicked and a video started playing. Saint Peter continued. 

"So you don't remember hitting this man of color with a baseball bat for 7 straight minutes?" asked Saint Peter pointing to a screen that showed a man being another with a baseball bat. 

"No, I don't recall." said Stephen. 

Saint Peter growled. "You don't remember this, where you got into a motor vehicle engaging in a pursuit with local law enforcement after you mowed down who knows how many people! You don't recall?" 

"Nope."

"What about this, here's another clip where you're just watching a video of one of the characters removing articles of their clothing to reveal large amounts of their skin. Do you remember?"

"No. I don't recall."

Saint Peter looked in awe. He hung his head and brought it back up, his eyes gazing at Stephen. 

"Stephen, we have everything recorded. I don't even want to go into the details of what you did with dogs. Or your family. Look Stephen, you're going to hell regardless."

Saint Peter clicked a button, a opening opened up beneath Stephen, dropping him from the cloud he stood upon. Saint Peter jotted onto a notebook, putting his pen down he reach over for a Xbox controller. 

"Ah, time to relax and play some Grand Theft Auto. "

	<TEXT> Angela,

You know that I have a way with words and when I need to say something, I say it. This is just one of these times where my voice wouldn't be able to articulate the things I want to say, so I'll leave it here for words for you to read. This isn't the end, but the beginning. Shakespear once said "Nothing is good or bad, but thinking makes it so." I don't know how you're going to feel, but I hope you keep in mind that right now, this moment I'm happy. You have brought so much color to my life, I don't want you to blame yourself for anything I do. I just cannot even put you, who you are, who you come to be, into words. I would be sitting here writing this all day. I'm happy we shared moments. I'm happy for the life we lived and how we grew together.

Forever is a hard concept to grasp or imagine. For me I'm ready to see what forever it feels like, like our love it is never ending. And like our love it never will. 

I love you, from here to the moon.

	<TEXT> "Hi. I'll be your guide on your trip. Have we secured payment?" A man asked with a stretched smile. 

"Yes, I paid. "

The man continued to smile, looked down and up at me again. 

"Alrighty, this way." The man walked away, I slowly followed. I had to stay focused. I needed my mind to be relaxed if this was going to work. 

"Where you from stranger? " the man asked. 

"Colony North of here, in the mountains, I heard of this place though a passing salesman." 

"How nice of that man to educate you of our utopia. " The man stop and faced me." How the air? "

"Bad." It was an understatement. I used the last of the clean air I had to make the trip here. To use the machine. Just one last time. 

The man gestured me to follow. We walked down an endless hallway passing door after door. 

"You've been here before, yes? "

"That's correct." 

"Do you know what memory you'll be visiting?"

"The same. It's always the same."

"Ah. " The man stopped in front of a door. 
"You paid for 30 minutes. In turn the machine will give you 30 hours of time with your chosen memory. You may feel free to manipulate the world, it is your head. Feel free to repeat the memory as often as you like. Remember to give full concentration to the memory so the machine can find it. If you let your mind wonder you run the risk of being dropped off in the wrong memory, and theres no refund as you understand. We will again give you a sign, a blue sunset, when you are on your last cycle. Thank you for your business, and enjoy."

The man walked away and down the hall. I entered the room and sat into the machine. I put the helmet on and relaxed. I had to keep my head clear. I felt the machine kick on. I felt the mask slightly tighten. I thought about the memory. I had to make it vivid. Think about her. I thought about her body. Her name. Her smell. Her everything. I thought about the day at the beach. I thought about that whole day. I thought. I had to think clear. I saw the beach. I felt the sun. I felt the ocean. I felt her hand. I saw the pier. I saw her crying. Oh no. 

The machine kicked on. Oh no. That's not the right memory. I struggled against the machine. I felt myself beginning to slip. It was the wrong memory. Wrong one.

I woke up on my feet. I looked up and around a room. I was standing before her, her bags in her hands. She was crying. She spoke. "I'm leaving you." 

Wrong memory.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Hello." 

I stared. I held my door open looking at a familiar face.

"Is this real. " I said as I stared.  "You're Natalie Portman." 

She smiled and laughed. "Yes. Yes Stephen. I'm Natalie Portman." 

There was a small silence. She continued to stare at me. I found it hard to make words which I was guessing my eyes were eating all my energy from the sheer amount of beautiful they were injesting. I broke the silence. 

"What are you doing here? " I asked 

"You Stephen. I want you." she spoke soft. 

My eyes lids hit the roof. Me? Why me. I didn't understand. 

"Why do you want me, we've never met."

"I know, but, I've seen a couple of YouTube videos, I went to your instagram and saw the adorable cat pictures you have and I just fell in love."

"Stephen, whats taking so long?" A voice rung out from behind me. Shit. Jennifer is calling. I noticed Natalie heard the voice, she started to walk slowly towards me, she spoke. 

"She doesn't have to know about us. Stephen. Please. I want you. Stephen. Please. "

I put my hands on her shoulders, and exhaled. "Natalie, I'm sorry, but, for you to do that research on me, and show up at my doorstep, you're a fucking psycho." 

"What. "

"How the fuck did you find my address? Look, you're a crazy bitch I understand, but please, please, please, don't ever come back. I'm so freaked out right now, the billboard bitch is confessing her love for me, this is insane! Please Natalie, please go please if you don't leave I'm going to hit you. " 


I shut the door slowly. The door shut and I exhaled deeply. I just could not believed that happened, I turned and shouted at Jennifer. 

"You'd never guess who was just here at the door."

	<TEXT>  300 years ago I was human. My heart would beat. I would bleed if you cut me. I thought about death. I often contemplated many hours the day it would visit, and what it would be like to slip from this life and move onto the next-- if there was one. 

I remember the night I made the transition from expecting death to having never to worry about it. 

I met a young gypsy woman on my travels through Europe. She had a kiss I wouldn't forget. A kiss that not only passed on the light that now carries my body until the end of time,  but a kiss that ensures I remember every moment of it. 

And now, I sit here today. It's the year 2014. Im 300 years old. I want those to understand that if you do succumb to a young woman on your travels that passes on a curse that I have, please understand you live not only in a time of abundance but in a time where technology can help bring meaning back into your own existence. 

What I mean is during the first half of my 300 years, you can imagine I lived in a time that was simple. You read books when you were bored, you visited family, friends, for conversation, and you did your part. I was a blacksmith. That's it. I eventually ran out of books to read, I had to quit my job at the time due to my lack of aging, and eventually all my family died. I was left alone. And then technology hit the human race like a bomb. 

I watched it grow, and grow, and grow. I remember the first car. I remember the first computer. I remember the first cell phone. Now, it's the year 2014. I remember a time where it took weeks, even months to travel to places that now only takes an hour or two via aircraft. I enjoy life, because I'm finally living it. Life will lose it's meaning, I think it's supposed to. I spend my time now traveling. I sell my art, thanks to the wonders of the internet.  I play against teenagers online with video games; the other day I play Grand Theft Auto and made friends with a man, Jerry was his name. We have a clan. I will continue to watch technology grow, and I will grow with it, because I feel both technology and I need each other. Both of us will be here for a very, very, long time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Okay, so if I can understand you correctly, and forgive me if I talk slow, 
it will help me and the rest of us, humans, understand your request."

General Hamilton paused. He looked up at the waiting the tall black faceless 
figures that stood before him. He then looked behind at the wide eyed blank faces composed of top Nasa scientist, waiting.  

"Yes, human, please explain our request so that everyone here, has a full understanding." said the tall dark figure.

"So, that we're all the same page, you and your group, come from the a planet, some couple thousand light years away. And the reason you come all this way is because ,out of all the signals that earth sends out at any possible second, your, race, pick up a signal from Earth, and if I'm saying this right, you picked up a signal, that was a game of, what we call on here on earth, American football?"

"Yes!" The tall figure replied excitingly. "Please continue!"

General paused again, he looked around room again exhaling softly. 

"And because you picked up this signal, you're entire society became enticed by the idea that is American football, and then since, since your race obviously have the technology we have yet to possess, you, all, traveled here, to earth, thousands of light years from your home planet, not because of our resources, not because you want to study us as a species or a planet, you simply came, all this way, such a far, far, far distance, because you all, want to form a team?"

There was another pause. General Hamilton looked up at the tall dark figure. Is that correct?

Precisely! the tall dark figure exclaimed. We want to form a team and play, I believe you humans call them the Raiders of Oakland?

General Hamilton looked again around the room, blank faces stared back at him, General Hamilton aughed to himself, and responded.

I dont see a problem with that, as a team they have trouble beating other human teams, lets see how the Raiders fair against our extraterrestrial friends. Are you guys free Thursday?

"We hold it."

"Sir- "

"I won't repeat myself Sixsmith." 

Sixsmith swallowed deeply. 

"We hold the town!" Sixsmith shouted loudly to the surrounding forces. The rain pounded hard on the men as the night began to introduce itself to the skies. 

"Sixsmith!" Augustine shouted from his horse. "Gather everyone in the town, bring them here." Augustine turned his horse towards his men. 

"Gather everyone! I want them all here, now! " Augustine boomed loudly, wanting the towns people that took refuge in the buildings were aware of his presence.

Going to building to building. Screaming slowly becoming the evening ambiance as the soldiers took the towns people from their homes. 

Men gathered the towns people in the street. They hurdled together in the thick mud, the rain continue to poor as the night continued. 

Augustine came forward, scanning the towns people. 

"They are merely flesh. They go over. " Augustine pointed west. 

Sixsmith stepped forward. "Sir-" 

"I will not repeat myself Sixsmith . They go over." Augustine pointed again west. 

"They will not survive the fall, sir." Sixsmith softly spoke. It grew quiet. Augustine paused, turned his horse and slowly unmounted from it. Augustine walked slowly towards Sixsmith. 

"I'm simply giving them a chance to see if they can fly Sixsmith." Augustine smiled. "If I have to repeat myself again Sixsmith, we will also test to see if you have wings." Augustine patted Sixsmith on the shoulder and turned. "They go over, now!"

Sixsmith swallowed hard, he turned to the men. The towns people began to cry and scream as the soldiers forced them to their feet. Pushing hundreds forward, walking slowly towards the west.

	<TEXT> "Jeff."

"Death."

"What did you bring this time?"

Death raised his hands, revealing a bottle in each hand. 

"Jeff, it's your choice,bourbon or whiskey?"

Jeff smiled, laughing. "Death my man, the bourbon! Come in friend!"

Death followed Jeff into the house, Watching Jeff walk slowly into the living room, stepping over a black cat licking his paws on the wooden floor. Jeff approached his red leathered recliner, softly wincing in pain as he descended onto it.

"Death my friend, man, How you been? Been busy?"

"Yes, Jeff, I have."

"I saw you visited Joan Rivers, was that personal?"

Death laughed as he opened the bottle of bourbon, pouring it into the glasses that waited on the table.

"Well, yes. She has evaded me for so long, thought I would get her right after a surgery, I'm sure have my head when I get back to the hell."

The two laughed and sipped the bourgan softly.

"Ah, Now this, this is good bourbon, where did you get this?" Jeff asked as he leaned back into his recliner. 

"Robin Williams."

"You take from everyone you take?" 

"Yes, also, this is a special visit."

Jeff paused looking at Death. Taking another sip of his bourbon he set it back onto the table, the sound from the glass hitting the wood echoed in the living room. 

"We've been seeing each other for a long time death, ever since you took mom."

"Yes Jeff."

"And Dad."

"Yes."

"Why do you visit me?"

Death put his glass down, Leaning forward resting his elbows down on his knees, looking down at the ground. 

"What I do, isn't easy Jeff, I don't have anyone to talk to. I don't love what I do, I'm just doing my part, you understand." he looked back up at Jeff who was nodding his head softly.

"I take people. When I took your parents, I left you alone. I remember you standing there after the crash, crying."

"I was 8, it was a big loss." Jeff leaned forward and pick up his glass again, finishing what was left inside, setting it back down leaning back against the recliner. 

"Yes, but you could see me. I don't know why. You saw me. There's some rules I don't understand myself to what I do, I just follow orders, but I took upon myself to make a friend. To make the best of the worst possible situation."

"Are you going to take me."

"Not today."

Jeff leaned back into his chair resting his hands on his lap. 




"Jeff! Did you want anything from the store?" Jeffs wife voice jolted Jeff out of the recliner, turning himself in the direction of his wife. 

"No sweetie I'm fine."

"Honey, Who are you talking to?"

"Oh, its the darn cat, He's meowing at me so I'm just throwing some words back at him."

Jeffs wife looked around the room, seeing Bubba on the floor, cleaning himself. 

"Okay, I'll be back shortly, I love you." Walking closer to Jeff giving him a peck on the check. 

"Please don't forget. She pointed at Jeff. Your pills at 9 o'clock okay?" she smiled as she reminded Jeff.

"Yes, sweetie."



Jeff heard the door shut, he returned to his recliner sitting down, facing death again. 

"Don't worry." Death spoke softly. "She still has plenty of time left."

"And me." Jeff asked.

There was a silence. Death pick up his glass and took a small sip. 

"Jeff, you know this isn't easy."

"You seemed to be acting different, it's okay.

Jeff looked over at Bubba who was playing with his tail.

 


Is it going to hurt?" Jeff asked.

"No."

"Is it because of." Jeff paused,swallowing hard. "Is it the sickness that gets me?"

"Yes."

"Can you make sure Betty be the first one to know, it can't be at work."

"Yes, I can do that."

Jeff exhaled, grasping the arms of the recliner he looked around the room. Looking back at death,

"Let's do this." Jeff leaned forward, smiling. 

"Let us chat for a bit more , you can continue with your stories about taking great leaders, I can continue my mad rambles about the neighbors,and hey, maybe finally convince you to take Bob who hasn't returned my lawn mower."

Death and Jeff Chuckled. Jeff continued. 

"Make sure when you come next time, you bring that bottle of whiskey you hear?"

Death nodded. Jeff leaned back into his recliner. 

"Okay, now, last time you left off on how you convinced Hitler to shoot himself."

	<TEXT> One day, two buildings stood tall

two buildings stood proud and tall, side by side.

two buildings that stood so wonderfully tall, with nowhere to hide

they stood together with pride,with thousands of people inside.



One day two wonderfully tall buildings watched the September sun.

As inside the two buildings was working everyone.

working was everyone inside two buildings that stood so wonderfully tall

not even to entertain the thought that they, someday, might fall.




One day two wonderful buildings were greeted with a boom

greeted with a big boom and a flash

greeted with a big boom and a crash

greeted with a big boom and a smash.

There stood the wonderfully tall buildings,

both sporting fire and smoking gash.



Fire ablaze there stood two buildings with people inside

people inside that tried to hide 

people inside that screamed and cried

people inside that hoped,prayed, and cried not to die. 



One day and one by one

two building stood tall, so wonderfully tall in the september sun

there they stood being watched by everyone

there they stood and one by one, they fall

at the end of the day

no longer will two wonderful buildings stand tall.

	<TEXT> "Jim." 

"Yes. "

"Are you listening." 

"Yes. "

" Okay, can you please hand me the good saw. "

"Yes, Master" 


Today is my first day. Brand new. I'm what you say right off the boat in the field of torture. Can't explain why I'm so attracted to it, I guess it started when I was younger, torture was something as I found as a form of beautiful justice. I saw my first live.. 

"Jim, please, the good saw! "

Damn, lost in my mind again, I drift a lot. Okay. The good saw is always so close, why does he need me to get it. I went over to the wall where it rested, previously used, bloody, It's an art. I grabbed the saw and rushed it back to master.

"Here is the good saw Master."

"Thank you, anyways, please pay attention. What is the goal. "

"Information." 

"No, The goal is to force information. Imagine him like a balloon That's it. He's a balloon, filled with hot air, and when they yell and cry, it's all just hot air. Remember. He's a balloon." 

Master pointed over at the next person we would be squeezing justice from. He rested on a chair. Naked. Confused. He panted heavy, his feet were raised exposing his shins as they rested size by side. 

"Jim, are you paying attention. "

" Yes. "

" 
Okay, have you heard of this technique before? "


Yes. I have. I've read this before, this is a tactic torturers have used for years. I love it. I couldn't wait to see it live. Okay, so, People might have a tendency to cry and moan. I'm aware of this. It's awful. Telling us about their families. How they want to live. Blah. Blah. Blah. If we see this human differently, torturing is fun. It's exciting. Master leads me over to the balloon that looked at us wide eyed. He began to shake. 

"Now, Jim, this is just scratching the surface of what are we going to do. This balloon you see in front of you has no information, we're to just show you how to properly extract it if this was a situation that, well, information was needed."


"So, what are we doing?"


"Watch. "

Master puts a black cloth over the balloons head. And rest the saw on his shins. The balloon begins to scream loudly. 

"We're going to do this slowly, I want you to know, answers will always after to come after the pain, not during. You don't stop. You finish the job. You show him his leg. You ask the question. If he refuses. The next leg."

Please can we do this already. Master hands me the saw. I feel the power I adjust myself over the shins, and press gentley. The balloon squirms. I begin sawing. I saw. And saw. I can feel the heat from the blood. Yes. Justice. I keep sawing and look over at master. 

"Yes, hold. Tightly, wait, stop. "


Master comes to me and motions me aside and takes the saw. The balloon is screaming but it has no effect on us. It's just all hot air. 


"You need to make sure you use proper form. You need to motion with your elbow. Push with the elbow. Forward." 
 
There was a scream as Master moved the saw forward into the shin. 

"And hold for one Mississippi, and then back, again, make sure to now pull with the elbow." another scream. Hot air escaped the balloon. Master continued with the pull, push, pull, push, pull, push. Until the balloons legs both laid still with no body attached. 

"You see. " said Master. "You need to make sure you focus on proper form. We don't get the health benefits like we used to so make sure you remember form, so you don't have to retire in your 30's. You understand?" 

"Yes Master. "


"Okay, next, let me show you how we deal with the eyeballs, can you hand me that screwdriver."

	<TEXT> I don't know how I do it. I really don't. I'm just on my bed. I close my eyes. I hear the silly hippie music my friends suggested my ears ingest while I do thing called "meditation." I listen. I listen to my breathing. I focus on my breathing. Concentrating on my breathing. Just focus.

It's this focus that propels me out of this 214 pound body, don't ask me where I go. I have no fucking idea. I'm like a 4 year old on a road trip, I don't understand what's around me but the colors are bright and I'm surrounded by geometric shapes I don't recognize but their fun to look at. 

I know when I'm gone. I'm traveling fast, seeing things that were and could be. It's exciting now, obviously. The first couple times, yeah, not so much fun. I'm hurling though infinity, scary the first couple times. It's like a boat. I had to get used to the motions before I could actually enjoy the trip. 

I don't know how to navigate. There no maps, mostly colors. I think the colors are my own thoughts. I'm being vacuumed though what I think is my own reality, again, I don't really know. I'm just trying to enjoy the trip. I can feel my body still, I need to. It's like a rope. A lifeline. 

When I get back. I open my eyes. I don't usually remember much. I think I'm back in my own reality. I think. I'm not sure. There's no way to test. I know I'm on my bed. I know I'm in my room. I can see my text books I take with me to school. I know I'm home. The problem. When I stand up I walk. I walked around my room, I stare in the mirror.  I look on my stomach. Everytime I go on these trips, I notice a  new scar. I have 8 now. I appreciate that I have the opportunity to go on these trips, I just want to know  who's been counting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "So, David." The door slammed shut as Ryan came though, standing and staring at his roommate. Ryan huffed.

"Hey, David."

"Yes, Ryan?"

"I actually have a question about rent."

"I just paid you."

"Yes, you did, um, can I ask you a question?"

"Yes."

"Have you been looking for a job?"

"Yes, I've been on craigslist all day."

"Yeah, Um, remember how you told me you had a job interview at a bank last week?"

David turns off the TV, setting down the burrito he was eating adjusting himself toward Ryan.

"Yes, I remember."

"Well, I don't know if you watched the news recently, but do you remember how Dr. Fingertoes recently just got away with robbing a bank downtown? Um, wasn't that about the same time you had your job interview?"


David began to sweat, his face becoming pale, he rested his hands on his knees, he looked down on the floor.


"Yes, Actually I did, and how Captain Heelhook almost stop him, but Dr. Fingertoes hit him over the head with a fire hydrant." David looked back up at Ryan, who had just began to remove the bandage from his head. 

"Why the bank."


"I didn't have money for rent, I didn't want you to be mad at me." </TEXT>
