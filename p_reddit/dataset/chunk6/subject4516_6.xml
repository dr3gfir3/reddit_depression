	<TEXT> I've had to re-read your comment a few times to try and make sense of it. It's a red herring, the exception does not make the rule, because you found one example of a woman being given a lenient sentence for sexual violence among countless examples of men being given lenient sentences does not suddenly make sexual violence a non gendered issue.  </TEXT>

It's a slippery slope when you begin using these types of examples because they are so few, and examples of men fucking women without their consent are so so great.

Also, the reason that mother made that decision was because there were men who were willing consumers. This doesn't prove a damn thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That practice is more often employed in terms of minor crimes, driving an unregistered car for example. It is sad that in certain countries a woman's life and autonomy is viewed in much the same light as that of a motor vehicle. It is troubling that the same precedents that have excused men of traffic violations have also excused them of fucking women without their consent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My only advice is to never ever make her feel ashamed about her sexuality and to be clear when communicating that you do or do not want to have sex. And to be free with the cuddles and fondling on days and nights when you don't want to fuck. A lot of the time a person might just want physical closeness, but the partner will think they want to fuck, because they usually do and because they aren't into it they will physically push their lover away. That kind of rejection becomes soul destroying after a decade or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By publishing the guy's swimming times in the story about him raping a woman, basically the media is excusing the rape, they aren't saying rape is ok, but what they are saying is tantamount to that, they are saying that his sporting prowess should excuse the fact he raped an unconscious person. 

This is what the young lady's protest signs was alluding to.

I stopped them and screamed at them, they ran off but people around looked at me with disapproval and then when I went to a teacher they didn't believe us and the three men followed us and taunted us the whole day.

	<TEXT> I have a number of friends who have received frottage from random men in public. In the era I grew up in we were supposed to have already been emancipated, but we were also brought up to be sugar and spice and all things nice, not to be loud or make a scene. And we were told "boys will be boys" I think that's why for so long I haven't even thought about the things men have done to me as assault. When I was a kid, the boy next door used to hold me down and pee on me while I was playing with his sisters. It was so degrading, but when I told his mum about it she just said, "that's his way of showing that he likes you"  </TEXT>

I guess I have always viewed it with incredulity, and almost humour, black humour, trying to even remember it all in context now, it's so strange. The sad part is that that was not the only time in my life that I was fingered without consent. Not to mention other things that have happened without consent. The happy part is that currently this attitude is changing, I have a lot of hope for the future for women. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can define rape. The definition of rape or sexual assault used in NSW: Rape is a term used in the community which describes the forced penetration of the vagina or anus of any person with any part of the body of another person, or any object, against their will or consent.  It also includes oral sex. In NSW Criminal Law, the term rape is no longer used. It has been replaced by the unisex term, sexual intercourse without consent.

	<TEXT> Unfortunately in our society we tend to see crying as a sign of weakness and we are scared of big emotions. It's natural to be emotional at certain times of your cycle when hormone levels change, although socially this has become something of a joke, a way of denigrating women and putting them down "She must be on her period" because of patriarchal ideals. It's actually the opposite, crying is a sign that you are emotionally well connected, feel empathy for others, feel strongly about things. Instead of trying to figure out how to stifle your emotions, maybe figure out ways to be more comfortable with them and to care less what our society thinks about them? Just a thought - I work in the human services industry so emotions are welcomed in my workplace, I'm not sure how things would pan out if I worked in finance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Big time. My greatest annoyance while studying was when people would misinterpret his theories, I'd be like "OMG it's an ANALOGY!" I too dislike when he is brushed off as a weird perverted misogynist. I feel like he felt it very keenly in his own time and retracted some of his early work on trauma because of the backlash from his peers, but he had the right idea from the beginning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Freud's defence, he was the first psychoanalyst to suggest that trauma could be a precipitating and maintaining factor in psychological disorders (being sexually abused as a child might be why this person is having trouble sleeping and maintaining personal relationships, not the fact they have a vagina) and came up with his talking cure in a time when doctors were performing surgery on women's noses to deal with their "hysteria". It was just that at the time this was a really way out concept and he was ridiculed for it. Then he came up with all the wacky ideas (Oedipus complex, penis envy et al.) and got a wicked cocaine habit. Neurobiology is currently proving what he originally suspected, that complex trauma actually changes the brain and causes all manner of behavioural and adjustment issues. His talking cure might not be the best  treatment for issues relating to trauma, but props to him for considering it in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so one time I was sharing a hotel room with my friends. There was only one key so we had to leave the door on the latch. I had been out shopping and was super hung over so I came back for a shower and a nap and walked in on my friends having sex. Like legs in the air super passionate sex. I was mortified and closed the door super quick and they were like "Desire, are you just running in to get something? We can stop for a bit" and I was like "Nah, I just need a shower" they told me to run through real quick. I had the longest shower of my life, singing loudly the whole time, I mean like a 30min shower and at the end when I turned off the faucet, I heard my friend shout out "5 more minutes!" So I turned the water back on and sat in the bathtub brushing my teeth for a further 20mins. Afterwards my friend apologised for the awkwardness and when her BF went out to go drinking with his mates, she ordered us some pizza and wings and got some wine, then confided in me that she still didn't finish. I went to sleep with my fingers in my ear just in case she decided to go solo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to sound weird but maybe drink more water and eat a banana every now and then and you could try taking magnesium supplements.

Maybe I'm taking this too literally, perhaps a man would give better advice. </TEXT>
