	<TEXT> I totally agree. I don't have a problem with paying for the expansions that come out. I do have a problem when they charge us for this stuff. They say it helps them keep making free content like Festival of the Lost and SRL, but that stuff isn't new and I already paid for a full year of content when Rise of Iron came out.  </TEXT>
