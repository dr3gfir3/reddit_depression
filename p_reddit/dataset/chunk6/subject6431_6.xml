	<TEXT> Should have come up at the debates, but unsurprisingly it didn't. Perhaps that's because their are loads of vested interests who donate to the private company that puts on the debates who don't want anyone thinking about or talking about an end to the incredibly destructive federal prohibition of marijuana. Anything polling at 60% should be seized upon, but they're both making bank of big pharma who are terrified of losing their stranglehold on the addictive disorders of millions of Americans whose voracious appetites for altered states are utterly unprecedented.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What DC needs is a personality who gets their IP and who gets film and who can guide a creative vision across multiple properties. ZS is okay but his vision is a little long in the tooth and the overall scheme seems unfocused. Marvel made a jigsaw puzzle, DC is doing ego knows what.

Haven't seen SS but from all opinions seems like it is a great marketing success (great trailers) but not so good overall. Kinda like much of ZS's work...

WB should bring someone else in to oversee the execution of their cinematic universe </TEXT>
