	<TEXT> To clarify, I call them rumors because obviously we don't know yet how long it actually lasts, since it came out this year and we have no way of knowing. Hardware experts say it can. Some say it can't. What gives? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I got The Wicther 3 and Dragon Age Inquisition. I should play Dragon Age first, yes? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-27 23:03:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a sucker for RPGs, and as soon as I pour at least 300 hours into Fallout 4 I plan to take on another RPG game. Bought Inquisition for $12 and The Wicther 3 used on Amazon. I know that The Wicther 3 is probably the better game, so should I play Inquisition first, as I've read is also pretty good? 

Also, do I need to play Dragon Age 1 and 2 before Inquisition? 

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was lagging pretty bad on Battlefield until I noticed that it happened after recording a clip, and since I have it set to 5 minutes and my internet is pretty slow (5 mps) could that be the source of my lag?

	<TITLE> Do the Overwatch controls feel weird to anyone else? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-25 00:22:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Overwatch feels weird for me, like there's some input lag or something when I move the camera around. I play on a monitor and have no problems on games like Battlefield 1. I was reading some forums and it seems like other people had some issues with the controls on console, but the most recent thread I find is months old. I can play fine with some characters but some of them like Hanzo, the cowboy or the snipers are difficult to use. 

 If someone could give me their thoughts on this it would be great. Thanks and Merry Christmas </TEXT>

I was wondering if you guys could watch this video and tell me if this amount of input lag is acceptable for an FPS game like BF1. I seem to notice it more on Overwatch. It is on Game Mode

	<TEXT> I don't think the writers are all that bad. Sure, they aren't perfect, but in my opinion they are very good at building up plotlines and suspension. Also the character changes and developments in this show are among the best I've ever seen. Not many other show make me emotionally invest in characters like this show does. They just seem to struggle a lot with pacing the episodes.  </TEXT>
