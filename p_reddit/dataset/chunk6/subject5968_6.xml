	<TEXT> word. This is good advice. 
I'm an A2A specialist; any map where it's majority air enemies, I'm pretty much a lock for MVP or at least top 2. I'll stick to B7R and Moscow missions from now on. I've been trying to jump in a lot on Dubai but I consistently get outscored there because of how many ground targets there are.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The highway you're most likely referring to is US167S that cuts almost due south through the central part of the state of Arkansas. I've driven it several times on trips to Louisiana and your friend is not mistaken in relating how desolate and secluded some stretches of that road can be.

Even during the day time there are few cars on that stretch and at night you *must* drive with your high-beams on because there is so little illumination. It is *not* the kind of road where you'd want to have car troubles.  </TEXT>

It's the one that came with the Special Edition version of the game in Japan. Can't remember where I found it, but I can dropbox it to you; I have it saved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> real world definition of a *confirmed* A2A kill is: verifiable evidence of complete destruction of any enemy aircraft. Kills can be verified by sources such as recorded video feeds, wingman visual confirmation, aircrew verification (RIO/backseat), enemy admission of loss of aircraft. 

The "kill" is on the aircraft, not the pilot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it sounds like bs but I had no idea what was happening. Last time I played a SOLG mission was AC5 on "normal" difficulty.

On "Ace" difficulty in AC5 do you end up flying through the body of it too? Because that's what happened on the multiplayer of ACI and I actually got the missile kill on the warhead or whatever was inside of it. 

TL;DR: Cool mission, S ranked it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a couple weird ones from Ft. Jackson, SC as well, one of which I documented in a story on this sub. 

Army posts are very old and the amount of significant things that occur on a daily basis are enough to leave palpable imprints on the world long after the people who caused or saw the original event have moved on. 

You likely won't find the stories on this sub any longer, due to some choices by the mods, but I submit FiftyFootAnt and HumperMonkey's stories as perfect examples that places, especially military posts, can absolutely retain the fear, stress, and heartache of all the bad things that happened on their grounds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> because it's not the SAR post that everybody's piggy-backing off of. 

Don't get me wrong, there's some good shit on this subreddit, but when someone writes a "nosleep hit", motherfuckers come out of the woodwork (quite literally, this time) to put their own spin on an already good story. 

This story and a couple others have been legitimately good, yet they're getting downvoted because they aren't the fad of the week. </TEXT>
