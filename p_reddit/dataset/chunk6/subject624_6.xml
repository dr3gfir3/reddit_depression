	<TEXT> Happy Tuesday, 

I'm in the market for a travel case such as this incase.  

https://www.incase.com/shop/apple-watch-cases/travel-kit-for-apple-watch/black/

The ideal case would be able to hold the charger, watch, and a extra band (silicon for exercising). Price point 40 or less. 

I have repurposed an old sun glass case to hold my spare bands and charger if needed. However this does not provide adequate protection/separate compartment for the actual watch in a travel situation. 

Any suggestion is appreciated!  </TEXT>
