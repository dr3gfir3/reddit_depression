	<TITLE> I just watched 13 Reasons Why </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-06 12:02:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> New Netflix show about a young girl who takes her own life  and what's left when she's gone  I don't know if I recommend it or not, really. It's well-done in that it's infuriating and heartbreaking and brought back all the worst feelings from the first few weeks after I lost my best friend ten months ago. It really hit home for me, and I almost couldn't get through it. 

It's one of those things where if you think you're up to it, maybe check it out. But it gets graphic and it's jarring at times. I think it's only something you should watch if you're willing to cry and hurt and maybe learn a little about where someone's head might've been when they did it. I'm also not sure how much of it is specific to young women who take their own lives, but it was very relevant to my experience and my friend's death.  

I don't know if this will be an even remotely helpful review or recommendation but those are my two cents.

Important edit: considering I spent the hour immediately after finishing the series sobbing uncontrollably, it may be more emotionally packed than I thought when I first wrote this. I still think it is a good, illuminating series, but I have to stress the "make sure you're ready" part of the post. I was not as ready as I thought.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your dad and my dad would get on like brothers. 

My dad is one of 5, born into a poor family in a poor town. He had to drop out of college because he wanted to make sure he sent money to host mother every month and couldn't afford both, so he enlisted in the Marines and became an advanced aircraft electrician. Then he worked at a military proving ground, but felt he had to quit when GWB invaded Iraq because he refused to contribute to the murder of Iraqi civilians. He owned an antique furniture refinishing business for awhile, but it closed when the markets crashed. So now he is an assistant manager at a home improvement store. 

He's got some nasty things to say about the state of Arizona's politics, never mind the clusterfuckery that's happening on the national stage. As for Jimmy Carter, he was the first president my dad ever voted for who won, and he still considers Carter to be the most criminally underrated president in recent US history. 

Meanwhile, I still learn new, amazing things he's said and done from my mom every once in awhile. He never talks about himself. 

I feel like our dads are cut from the same cloth.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Deniers must have lived blessed lives if they've never experienced something so horrible that their minds  protected them by shutting down all feeling or rational reaction. 

When my other closest friend called and told me that our sister was dead, my first thought (which, thankfully, I did not vocalize) was, "well, at least now we know for sure who my maid of honor will be someday." It's not rational to crack a joke immediately after being told horrific news, but my mind was protecting me from it. I was in shock immediately, and it was only hours later, as I was trying on pants in a department store dressing room, that the loss hit me. I lost all composure and cried violently for the first time that day. 

I'm so happy for deniers - they've never been hurt badly enough to know what it feels like (or, rather, *doesn't* feel like) to go into shock.    </TEXT>

My parents are both technically Boomers (very tail end of the Boomer timeline), and they're both incredibly progressive. It's hardly as if the subsequent generations are a wonderful group of generous empaths, and I speak from personal experience as a progressive millennial who grew up in a red state. 

I'll absolutely agree that some Boomers have made shitty choices and caused many a mess, but pitting generations against each other is hardly what we need to focus on right now.  </TEXT>

I maintain that the people who believe in false flag conspiracies, at their very core, are just incapable of believing that bad things happen to innocent people for no reason. They'd rather believe that the government is an entity of pure, conniving evil than accept that children were murdered in their classrooms. 

That level of innocence and optimism is almost sweet, until you see the damage these people do to the survivors and those who lost loved ones in tragedy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My best friend died this past summer, at a month shy of 21. It was completely unexpected - she was young and physically healthy. In the nearly ten years I'd known her, we had spent probably more than half of our weekends at either my parents' house or hers. Her parents were like a second family to me, and mine to her. 

When I got the call that she was gone, I saw my own father cry for the second time in my life - the first was when his dad passed- and my mother shut down emotionally. I myself felt detached from reality and more like an observer than a living person. It was like losing a sister. 

The funeral was worse. Her mother was more broken than I ever knew a person could be without dying. When I approached her in the pew, she stood and embraced me, sobbing, but could only hold herself up for a few seconds before collapsing into my arms in pain. She had just lost her youngest child, and there is no pain like that of losing your baby. 

Fuck Sandy Hook deniers. The experience of losing my best friend and sister and watching her family crumble into pieces as I tried to hold myself together only added to my anger at these people. It hardly helps that I come from a long family line of educators and myself work with elementary school kids, any of whom I'd take a clip of bullets for.  

I'm very sorry about your brother. I hope you're well.   </TEXT>

It's just another concept that has been twisted beyond recognition by right-wing propagandists as a means of demonizing the left.  </TEXT>

If a teacher were to talk about condoms, and a student told their parents, their parents could likely get the teacher fired. The switch to abstinence-only was precipitated by parental outrage at the concept of teenagers having teenaged hormones. 

Another fun fact: my home state has the 6th-highest rate of teen pregnancy in the country, and my hometown has the highest rate in the state. 

No way those are connected though, right? /s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in Arizona. Our government seems to think that, either education does not matter, or taking money away from the Dept. of Ed. will magically improve our rankings. Meanwhile, the turnover rate for teachers is unreasonably high, no one will fill the vacancies that open mid-year (so the rest of the teachers have to fill in for no extra pay, giving up their prep and lunch periods), and our teacher : student ratio makes classroom management and one-on-one time basically impossible. 

Not only is my mother's district in one of the worst ed. states, it's also in a poor county, and her school is in a poor part of town. She's been at that school for 20 years and has only held on these last few because doing so guarantees her a state pension. 

She is an excellent teacher (I was in her class, and she's adored by most of her students), and she loves her students. Helping kids learn is in our blood, but the shit Republican government and asshole district admin have nearly broken her spirit. It's awful. I'm not a certified teacher (I'm a SPED and general classroom aide while I'm at university), nor will I ever be, because I've seen how terribly teachers are treated in this country. I plan on going into politics and advocating for education reform so maybe we can build a better system. 

I am so sorry to hear that your wife is having such a hard time. I hope it gets better for her, and I hope she can keep going. Teaching is a hard goddamned job, and, to me, it's the most important job in the world. The fact that the people in charge of our children's futures are treated like their work doesn't matter boils my blood. 

Wish your wife the absolute best for me, and let her know that an internet stranger is rooting for her. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just watched her speech and the little Q A after it and I thought it was great. She gets a lot of flak for being "disingenuous," but I didn't doubt her genuineness there at all. It was a forum on women's issues, which she has always been passionate about, and she spoke from personal experience.

My perception of her sincerity might be influenced by my own experiences - considering I was born forty-some years later than her, much of our backgrounds and experiences are remarkably similar. I've been told since middle school that I can come across as fake or unnatural, even when I'm speaking openly. So it may just be a matter of perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only 200 thousand years of humans raising their own young have gotten us this far.  But sure, now, NOW is when we decide that no parents are capable to raising their own children.

Raising a child and knowing what's best for a child's education are two very, *very* different things. 


I know, we should set up a plutocracy, where only a few elites get to have a say on how children are raised.

That's not what OP said at all. 

First off, I'd hardly call educators "a few elites." 

Second, and I repeat myself, educating =/= raising. 

And third, is it plutocratic to entrust doctors with diagnosis and treatment of illness rather than, say, parents who have not studied medicine?

	<TEXT> It varies state to state and even district to district. Where I grew up, you could enroll in any public school as long as you had transportation, but it didn't much matter because Arizona's education system is broke and teachers don't even bother applying because the state doesn't think competitive salaries are a worthwhile investment.

Tl;dr American education needs a complete overhaul pretty much everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beautifully put. 

My dad is severely dyslexic, so when he started school, he struggled and had to repeat kindergarten. My grandma was a single mother supporting five kids on a waitress's earnings. She had no way to get him specialized help, nor did she have the tools to recognize his disability for what it was. The local school district was underfunded, so resources were basically nonexistent.

His second kindergarten teacher was the only reason my dad made it through school. She recognized the problem, offered her time and worked with him. If she hadn't noticed how hard he struggled, understood the cause, and found a way to make things better, I never would have been born. 

Meanwhile, my mother, grandmother, great-grandfather, great-great-grandmother, and at least ten members of my extended family have spent their lives teaching public school. My mother earned her master's degree while pregnant with me, for Christ's sake. I learned at an early age to respect and value education, and to trust my teachers until they give sound reason to doubt their judgement. I've only had to doubt two (one told my parents I was on drugs because my grades slipped - I'd been gone for two weeks because my grandpa was hospitalized and died in that time; the other blew me off when I explained that *Of Mice and Men* was named after a poem by Robert Burns and told the class it was"because Lennie liked mice" instead). 

Teachers are literally trained to know better than parents about the best educational options for students. I've heard many a story about parents who think they're smarter than teachers, and seriously, you don't want to be that parent. Not only do you make a fool of yourself, you do harm to your child's future.

Fuck Betsy DeVos. She knows nothing about education.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can confirm. The stories my mother has told about some of her students' parents are infuriating. 

Parents are irrational, protective, and emotional where their kids are involved. They routinely make decisions based on nothing but their gut, and they blame everyone but their child for any issue involving education. 

Of course, there are some reasonable, realistic parents who understand that their children are not perfect and make decisions based on logic, but their children are rarely as entitled or poorly-behaved, so teachers don't often get to deal with them.

	<TEXT> It's also the candidate's job to make that platform known. She talked about actual policy less than any presidential candidate ever. 

Can you please source that? Because she talked about policy all the time, but was ignored by the media.


And that gave off the ruse that either she was bullshitting about her progressive platform or she considered the voters too stupid to understand it. 

Her platform was literally the most progressive in history, and her policy proposals were available to the public at all times. The problem wasn't that she underestimated the people's intelligence, it was that she overestimated how much they cared about facts and policy. 


THEN WHY WOULD YOU THINK SHE WOULD WIN? 

Maybe because she was highly qualified and accomplished in her own right? Once again, the Democrats had too much faith in the media and public  to vote with their brains, rather than vote based on who was more entertaining.  </TEXT>

Ugh. I'm the fifth generation of educators in my family, and my grandparents would be absolutely flabbergasted at the current state of public education, not to mention what apparently lies ahead. My mother has been teaching in one of the bottom 5 states in education for nearly three decades. She's got a master's degree and 27 years of experience, yet she hasn't gotten a raise in nearly ten. Her benefits, planning time, and supply stipend have been chipped away to near nonexistence, and she's watched helplessly as standardized testing performance quotas have demoralized students and stifled what little funding her district was given. 

She told me, a few years back, "I don't know if it can get any worse than it is now." Little did she fucking know. Ffs.   </TEXT>

A certain amount of personal responsibility, i.e. fact-checking and understanding candidate platforms, that is expected of the voters, and rightfully so. It's not Hillary's fault that so many of the public don't bother to do their due diligence.

It's v weird that this wasn't a problem under Obama but all of a sudden happened when the democrats elected someone that half the country hated. I don't understand why people didnt vote for her.  

Obama wasn't on the recieving end of a decades-long smear job by Republicans, nor was he being attacked by a Russian psyop/disinformation campaign.  Could that maybe have something to do with it? </TEXT>
