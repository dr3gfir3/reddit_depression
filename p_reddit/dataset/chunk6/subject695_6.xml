	<TEXT> That is not a gamble I would want to take. If you you get in an accident without car insurance in New Hampshire where it's not required, you still would have to prove that you can pay for personal injury damages of up to $50,000 (if two or more people are injured) or $25,000 for property damage, or you risk losing your license and registration.

	<TEXT> My juvenile record was expunged after I faced a judge. I'm not sure if saying the record is sealed is correct or not. I was told that expunged means that it was pretty much erased from the record like it didn't happen. I work for the military and I had to agree to an security clearance investigation and my juvenile crime didn't come up. The reason I think a sealed record is not good enough is because during the investigation I was told they would not have difficulty finding sealed records and demand them to be turned over.  </TEXT>

Edit: I was wrong, Stephen Colbert said, "Reality has a well-known liberal bias". Rachel Maddow changed it to facts had a liberal bias.
