	<TEXT> My name is Bowie and I dont know what to do now. Im trapped in a game that I cannot escape. Before I get started I want you guys to put yourself in my shoes. Ignore all of the dumb shit I did. Ignore the fact that I decided to quit the game as soon as I lost my right ring finger. Just try your very hardest to understand why I am now at the predicament I am in now. 

It started two days ago. Two close friends of mine, Angelo and Sen, and I were on vacation in Seoul, South Korea. We had about 3 hours to kill before our favorite night club opened so we were all messing around with our phones. Out of the blue, Sen looked up and grinned while saying, So, you guys want to relive our childhood with a board game? It actually kinda reminds me of [life] (http://web-vassets.ea.com/Assets/Richmedia/Image/Screenshots/game-of-life-playbook-screen02_656x369.jpg?cb=1412974586), but you have to deposit 50 bucks to get started and you can either make more or lose it all. So a gambling version of Life?

I told Sen it was probably a scam, but he tapped away on his phone without giving me a single response. With a sigh, I scrolled through r/funny. Ten minutes go by, and I notice that Sen was tapping on the screen with a huge grin on his face. I walked up behind him and glanced over his shoulder at the phone. On the screen, I saw a board game made up of 20 total tiles. He rolled tapped on a box and it scrolled quickly and stopped on the number 3. His character, a foot, moved up 3 spaces and landed on a tile with a question mark on it. A card came out and slowly flipped over to show $40 dollars written on the middle of it. 

I didnt really think much of it until his phone vibrated and a notification from his bank popped up alerting him of a recent 40 dollar deposit. Now filled with curiosity, I tapped on Sens shoulder and asked him where he found the game. He looked back at me and told me to look up A Life of Luck on Google and it would show me the page where I could download the APK of the game. Seven minutes later, I downloaded the game and made my deposit of 50 bucks using my paypal account. 

The payment screen closed down and a game board filled the screen. A metal hand floated around the middle of the screen and floated down to the tile that said Start Your Luck. I tapped on the same small box Sen did and numbers started to spin inside of the box. The first spin was a 4. It was a blank yellow tile, but when the hand landed on it $3 appeared and a text from my bank came for a deposit alert for $3. I should have forgotten about the game, but my mind was clouded by the potential money to even think about how the game somehow knew which bank account to send the money to. 

Over the next hour I made back the initial 50 dollars back 3 folds. To say that I was hooked was an understatement. Within the short time span, that game had become the best thing that ever happened in my life. Angelo tried to get us to go with him to the club two hours after that, but we were both far too into the game to even get up from the couch we were sitting on. Angelo started to tug on my arm, but I ripped my arm out of his grip and sat back down. Defeated, he sat down next to me and glanced at my phone. 

After a couple of rolls and $80 more dollars in my bank account Angelo sat in between us and quickly lost himself in the game. I wanted to quit and go to the club, but for some reason everything about the game drew me back. The cheesy background music, the bright colors on the board, and the potential money kept my eyes and hands glued to my phone. 

None of us slept that night. I dozed off a couple of times, but every time I fell asleep a slow voice would wake me back up and I would find myself tapping on the box once again. I finally fell asleep around 8 yesterday morning and woke up to the sound of Angelo screaming, What the fuck does that mean? I looked up from the couch and saw Angelo standing up and pointing his screen at me. It was one of the cards you got from the question mark tile and it said, Cut Sens finger off and you can keep playing. Dont cut it. You quit.

I tried to think up of something to say, but Angelo exited out of the app and deleted it before walking into the bathroom. 

This is where I want you to not judge me. I was obsessed along with Sen. You can say that you would have deleted it along with Angelo, but you just havent experienced something as addicting as the game. 

It took us four hours to realize that Angelo never came out of the restroom, and another 2 hours before I managed to get out of the couch to check up on him. When I walked in I saw Angelos head was turned towards me but the rest of his body was turned the other way. He stared at me with a blank stare and I felt my blood run cold. Sen walked up behind me and started to laugh. He showed me his screen when I turned around to look at him and he had a mystery card on his screen as well. 

Fuck the corpse in the bathroom.
 
I started to shake my head no at him, but he tried shoving past me. Once he got in, he slammed the bathroom door shut.

He dropped his phone while going into the restroom. 

I dont know why.

It was just a mixture of rage for the app, the situation I found myself in, Angelos death, and Sens willingness to fuck the corpse of our once good friend. I exited out of the game on his phone and deleted it. 

I walked back to the couch and fell asleep. Every time I woke up I forced my eyes closed and continued to sleep until this morning. When I checked my phone I saw a notification on my phone from A Life of Luck two hours ago.

Delete it you will die. Ignore a challenge you will die. Eat the hands of your friends and you will live. You have 5 hours.

Like I said before. Please ignore the judgment you want to give me. I know I fucked up. I know I screwed over Sen, but please help me. I dont know how they killed them, but when I walked back into the restroom Sen had his head turned the same way as Angelo, but their hands were lying on the ground in [front of them] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/messages/?threadid=100001640267603 timestamp=1489329738637).

	<TITLE> An App Called "Time is Money" Gives you More than Just Money </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-11 15:22:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the past three days I have lost my best friend since I was seven and I am 30k richer. 

It all started when I was sitting on my bed in my dorm room. My best friend, Alex, ran into our room and excitedly said, Dude, take your phone out. I thought it was a joke, but man I just made 300 dollars in 10 minutes. Intrigued, I asked him, Wait. Slow down. What the fuck are you talking about? He grabbed my phone out of my hand and threw it back at me after a couple of taps. I picked my phone up and saw a treasure chest in the middle of my screen. **Tap Continue to Participate in the Greatest Money Scavenger Hunt of All Time.**

Before I could think about it Alex tapped the continue button and the screen bounced to my home screen. An app called Time is Money was placed in the middle of an otherwise blank screen. The icon was solid yellow with a small treasure box [in the middle] (https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/g1F4xCR4/IMG_8656.PNG).

I looked back up at Alex and he gave me a nod. Once I opened up the app it went to a solid blue screen with two options. 

*Scavenger* and *Quitter* were the two options with **Decisions are Irreversible** written underneath. I tapped on Scavenger and it took me to a white page with 8 nearby locations listed. One of them was the sandwich shot I was going to so I tapped on Gregs Sandwich and Homemade Soups. The app closed down and my navigation app came up. Alex and I rushed out and when we got close to the sandwich shop the navigation closed out and Time is Money opened back up and showed a picture of a red brick underneath a water hose. 

I walked to the side of the building where the hose was and saw a red brick. When I picked it up I saw 5 $100 bills underneath with a note that said, Well done. I dont know why I didnt think something was off, but this was the first time I had extra money. With a smile, I handed Alex a hundred, but he placed the money back into my hand and said, This is change for us. We will be rich soon man. I laughed and put the money in my pocket and walked into the sandwich shop for my first stress free lunch in a long time.

The next day we spent the whole day on the app and went to every single place the list showed us. Twelve hours of running/walking and a combined total of 9k later we ran into our room with exhausted breaths but a permanent smile on our faces. We split the cash evenly, but reached a mutual agreement that searching on our own would allow us to make even more money. 

Yesterday was beyond productive for me in the morning. I ran around the town like a madman and made a total of 21k bringing my total to 25.5k. At 2pm I tapped on the option for the campus library. When I got there a picture of the librarians desk filled my screen. With a mental nod of confirmation, I ran inside and saw that the librarian wasnt behind the desk. There was a small box in the second drawer of the shelf. When I opened I saw the biggest stack of money I had seen so far. I dug my hand into the box and grabbed the cash, but I felt something thin and hard on the bottom. 
 
Out of instinct, I jerked my hand out of the box to see that my hand was covered in thick red liquid. Swallowing back the vomit that started to come out, I took out the cash and shoved it into my pocket. In the bottom of the box there was a severed finger. Disgusted, I threw the box back in the drawer and rushed out. 

I know. I know I should have quit right then, but the thought of more money filled my mind and I kept going back to the app for my next location. It took me three more trips to realize I needed to quit. In the next three locations I have found a toe, another finger, and a heart hooked up to a car battery. It was still beating when I grabbed the money it was on top of. 

Last night Alex never came back into the room. 

I started to panic when it was 3 am and he hadnt come back yet. I grabbed my phone out of my pocket and saw that I had an unread text message. It was from an hour ago. 

It was from Alex and it said, Man I have been finding some weird shit. Not normal weird. Fucking fingers and other body parts I dont even know. I deleted the app and downloaded it again. This time I chose Quitter. You might want to do the same thing. This shit. Its not cool man.

I stayed up for another 2 hours waiting on Alex, but as exhaustion from the day hit me I fell asleep. 

I woke up at 10 am this morning. Despite the money I earned, I woke up scared and helpless. Alex wasnt in the room. I tried calling him seven times, but each time I called him it went straight to voicemail.

My phone vibrated three times and I picked it up and tapped the power button. 

There was a notification from Time is Money.

Alex Jameson Has Volunteered to be a Donator of the game. 

My fingers shaking and my forehead drenched in sweat, I tapped on the notification and a picture of my best friend was on the screen. The friend that beat up my first bully and the one that prepped me up for my first date was lying on the bottom of the picture. There was a hole where his chest once was. 

With tears rolling down my cheeks, I screamed out a mixture of pain, hurt, and absolute fear.

I dont know who to turn to. I went to the local police station and tried to show them the app, but it disappeared from my phone.

I made more money than I ever thought I would make during college, but I would give back every single cent and my life for Alex to breathe [just one last time] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TITLE> My Son is Seeing Things I Can't on His New Tablet </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-09 15:21:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Being a single father has always been hard for me, but it has been even harder for my son. My wife passed away when my son was 3. She was admitted into the hospital for pains in her midsection. Three days later, she passed away in her sleep. My son never received the attention he needed. Since he was three, I had to send him to my parents house while I worked and picked him up around 7. We would eat dinner and watch a couple of shows with him, but I would sometimes catch him looking at the empty seat next to him. Whenever he did that I would always feel my eyes start to tear up. It really felt like he knew that was where his mother used to sit. 

Until he turned 4, he would go into my room and open up a heart shaped jelly and place it on top of his sippy cup and place it on the desk my wife bought me for our [5th anniversary] (https://scontent-icn1-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/17155379_225604794579068_5697166437193041000_n.jpg?oh=a3104fade43fc870ea5871c1dcf1b4cf oe=59611B99). The last anniversary we spent together. 

When he stopped doing his nightly ritual he started to grow more and more distant with me.

It broke my heart, but I continued to work and spend less and less time with him. By the time he was five he started to scream and shout whenever I picked him up. My breaking point came when my father walked out of the house to wave goodbye to my son and he yelled, Take me back to daddy. I want daddy. Let me go. Let me go! With tears welling up in my eyes I got him into the car seat and took him home. 

I had money I saved up to start up my own restaurant, but I didnt want to lose my son. He was the remaining part of my wife I had left, and he meant more to me than my life did. The first week of keeping him home with me was rough. They were filled with my son constantly asking me when I would take him to mommy and daddy, but I told him that we were going to stay at home for a little while. He would scream and cry for almost for the remainder of the day until I fed him his dinner and put him to bed.

Three days ago we went to Wal-Mart together to pick up some groceries. While we were there I went into the electronics section to get a phone charger. My son was standing close to me the whole time, but when I finally picked out a charger I looked around and saw that he vanished. I started to run around the electronics section until I saw him standing in front of a tablet. When I walked up to him I saw that all of his attention was on the tablet. I looked at the price tag and without a second thought flagged a worker and told him I wanted to buy one. My son looked at me, and for the first time, he was smiling at me. 

While I was purchasing the tablet the man that was ringing me up said, Man, this is the best tablet for the money. I bought it for my son, and he has been learning so much from it. Now, I swear hes teaching me stuff I never knew! I chuckled and handed him my card. 

The entire car ride back my son begged me to take the tablet out of the box, but I told him to wait till the morning. He huffed and sighed, but I could tell he was excited for the morning.

After my son went to bed I spent about and house setting up the tablet. Its one of those kid safe tablets that allow the parents to restrict apps, amount of usage time, and websites. Once I was satisfied with the restrictions I plugged the phone and tablet up and went to bed. 

I woke up the next morning to my son bouncing on my chest. Teasingly, I asked him, What do you want? He started to scream out tablet while I laughed and unplugged the tablet and handed it to him. With a squeal of delight, he ran out of my room. The distant sound of clicking from the tablet made me smile as I fell asleep again. At 9:45 I woke back up again and walked out into the living room to see my son was working on a little puzzle on the tablet. 

The day went by smooth. When the 4 hour mark hit my sons tablet locked up and he brought it to me. I told him that he would have to play with something else for 5 hours before he could play with the tablet again. I readied myself for a fit, but he just smiled and said, Okay! before running off into his room. 

Three hours later, I heard the sound of sirens coming from a distance and stopping close to my house. I peeked out the house and saw two cops running into my neighbors house. I opened the door and stepped out and saw my neighbor open the door and walk outside with his arms up. My son walked out the door and stood beside me. Before I could get him back inside he said, He fucked his dead wife. Did it after her skull with a hammer while she slept. 

I turned around and stared at him before asking, You dont say stuff like that, Eric, who taught you that? With a smile he looked up at me and asked, Taught me what, Jared? While I tried to think of what to say he ran into the house and into his room.

The entire time we ate dinner I tried talking to him, but he would just look up at me and say, Tablet before resuming his meal. When he ate all that he wanted he got off of his chair and went to his room. When I finished my dinner I went up to his room and saw that he was already asleep. With a sigh, I walked in and took his socks off before tucking him and giving him a kiss on his cheek. 

I plugged up his tablet and my phone and attempted to sleep, but I couldnt keep my eyes closed. The concern for my son overwhelmed me, and after several hours of tossing and turning I got out of bed and went through the entire tablet. Two hours later, I finally plugged the tablet back up to the charger and went back to bed. 

Yesterday morning, I woke up to the sound of voices coming from the living room. When I walked out to the living room my son pointed at the tv and said, Told you. Our local news channel was talking about what my neighbor did. He was convicted of murdering his wife and storing her body in his wine cellar. I felt the blood rush from my face while I turned the tv off. My son got off the couch and ran into my room. He came back out with his tablet and started messing around with a couple of games on it. 

I looked over his shoulder the entire time he was on the tablet. The only odd thing he did was clicking on the browser and stayed on the page the front page while staring at the screen with more fascination than the entire time he was on his tablet. He kept staring at it until the screen blacked out and went to the lock screen. Without a word, he handed the tablet back to me, but before he ran off he looked at me and said, Grandma and Grandpa killed my mom. They poisoned her, but you were too stupid to know. 

I picked the tablet up and begged for it to tell me. When I unlocked the tablet it just went to a black screen before white letters appeared on the screen. It said, Stupid Man.

My son and I went back to Wal-Mart to return the tablet, but when they tried to process the refund they told me that the tablet was never on their system. I took the receipt out of my pocket and gave it to them, but the girl looked at me and said, You need to leave. When I tried to reason with her she just got madder and said, Im tired of people thinking they can say whatever they want to me just because I work here. My son loves me. He will always love me. Fuck off, you piece of shit. She threw my receipt back at me. When I picked it up off of the ground I noticed that the receipt now only said one thing, Just accept it. Youre a sad excuse of a parent. Your son will never love you.

After I put my son to bed I tried sleeping, but every time I started to fall asleep I would hear my wifes voice say, You could have saved me, but you were just too foolish. Every time I looked up I would see my son standing at the doorway. 

I woke up this morning after sleeping for just two hours. I dont know who to turn to. This is my last hope, Please guys. Help me. Im scared, and for the first time in my life I truly dont know [what to do] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TITLE> An App Called "New Eyes" Has Taken Over Our Town </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-08 15:09:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I dont remember what my wife and I were arguing about, but it lasted for more than three days. About three weeks ago, I came home from work and prepared myself for the incoming argument, but when I walked in through the door my wife jumped into my arms and planted me with kisses. Pleasantly surprised by the change of pace, I started to relax and asked her what the kisses were all about. 

While rushing back to the kitchen she yelled out, Ill tell you after dinner, honey! She brought out a large pizza from Papa Johns and I let out a quiet chuckle. She was never much of a cook. I couldnt blame her. She was the towns only dentist so she was almost always busy. We watched a little bit of tv while we ate, but my mind was distracted. It wasnt like her to end an argument so abruptly.

As soon as I finished off the last slice of pizza my wife put her phone on my lap. The screen was filled with a pink background and little blue dots that floated around the screen leaving trails that vanished after a second. I looked at her, but with a soft voice she whispered, *Tap the screen three times and dont take your eyes off of the phone.*

Feeling curious, I tapped the screen three times and the screen went dark for a couple of seconds. I started to look back at my wife, but the screen flashed a white light twice and bounced to a park. 

It was the park that I used to go to with my mother and father, but the park was demolished 7 years ago and both of my parents passed away while the park was still standing. On the phone screen I saw myself walking around the park looking depressed, but a smile quickly took over my face when my mother and father walked up to me. Both of them looked like the last time I saw them, but they looked perfect. 

My father didnt have a limp on his right leg, and my mother didnt need a cane to walk. We all walked around the park while we walked around and I could hear, inside of my head, my mother talking about how proud of me she was. My father kept making the same corny little jokes he used to make. As we made our way around the park for the fifth time the screen shut off and I noticed that I had a smile on my face. 

It was only for a short time, but I was completely at peace for the first time in my life. I looked at my wife and she asked, What did you see? 

With a teasing voice I said, Dont tell me you didnt look at what I was watching. She laughed and scooted up closer to me while saying, It doesnt show the other person what you are watching. If someone tries to see what you are looking at they will only see a black screen. 

After I told her about seeing my parents and the park I asked her where I could get the app. She told me that a friend of hers gave it to her because it was still in development, but she could send it to me through Bluetooth. I dont really know much about phones so I let her handle that when we walked back into our room. After she put the app on my phone I put it on my side table and plugged the charger in. The app was called New Eyes. The icon for the app was a bright pink box with a small pair of eyes inside. I thought about opening up the app, but something in my mind stopped me from clicking it. That night I fell asleep to the sound of my wife letting out happy sighs. 

I woke up three times that night, and each time I woke up I saw my wife glued to her cell phone. I tried asking her what she was doing, but she didnt respond to any of my questions. When I woke up the next morning she was still asleep. I gently shook her till she woke up and I noticed instantly that she barely got any sleep at all the night before. Her eyes were bloodshot red and her face was a lot more pale than usual. I asked her if she was okay and she just nodded at me before going into the restroom and got ready. 

It was the same thing every single night after that. Last week, she started to refuse to eat or drink any water. I tried to take her to the doctor, but she refused to go with me. 

I couldnt take it anymore. Five days ago I called 911 and silently waited next to my wife while she kept staring at the black screen on her phone. When the paramedics arrived they quickly picked her up and managed to strap her onto the gurney while she screamed and flailed her arms and legs around.

Two days ago, I noticed something that has made me start to panic. I work at the local bakery as the cashier. When I walked into work both of the bakers were standing together and staring into their phones. When I walked up to them to see what they were looking at I only saw a solid black screen. They were both smiling, but their smiles quickly vanished when I snatched their phones from their hands and placed them on the counter.  I gave the phones back to them a couple minutes later, but I told them to not use them out in the open while we worked. 

Almost all of the customers that walked into our store were glued to their phone. When I asked for their order they would respond back in monotone voices. Even the repeat customers that always asked how my day was would just come up and slam money on the counter while telling me what they wanted. If I asked them a question they would ignore me. 

Stressed and scared out of my mind, I went home as soon as my shift ended at 4 pm. 

I called out of work yesterday. I just couldnt handle whatever was going on. I thought about visiting my wife in the hospital, but I decided to just go the next day. My phone buzzed twice, but when I clicked the power button there wasnt a notification. It was New Eyes blinking from a bright pink to a deep red. Disgusted, I shut my phone off and fell asleep before the sun went down. 

I woke up today at 10:45 and prepared myself to go see my wife since it was an off day. After I got dressed, I went to my car and drove to the hospital. The first thing I noticed was the lack of cars in the parking lot. When I walked inside and up to the front counter there was no one there. Ten minutes of waiting later, I lost my patience and checked the log book behind the counter. My wife was in room 203. 

Once I found the room I walked inside and saw two nurses sitting in the corner of the room staring into their phones. My wife was lying on the bed staring into her phone. Her cheeks were sunken in and the skin on her face has started to sag. I greeted her, but she did not respond. With tears of stress rolling down my cheeks, I grabbed at my wife and begged her to speak to me, but like the lifeless doll she has become, she did not respond back with a single word. 

Only when I grabbed the phone out of her hand did she acknowledge my existence. She pointed her finger at me and began to scream. With a raspy voice I never heard her speak in she yelled, You are not real life. This is not real life. Before I could stop them the nurses ran up to my wife and repeatedly stabbed her with their knives. The whole time my wife laughed while saying, This is not real life. I know. I know. Im coming. Accept me with open arms. 

After my wife went silent they turned to me and started walking towards me while chanting, You arent. No. You arent part of the new world. 

I ran out of the hospital before they could reach me. I got into the car and drove like a madman until I pulled into my driveway. I tried calling the police, but every time they answer I hear someone breathing heavily into the phone while whispering, New world is coming. You arent one of use. Give yourself up. We will accept you [with open arms.] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/)

	<TEXT> yes:/ but if you think about it. in a town as close as it is. 

We have to think about the OOC community and not NoSleep. It is exactly like someone trying to open a bar in a town that already has one, but the response would be the same. 

People would still go to the original bar, and the other guy would get constantly shamed until either 

1) He gives up quickly and leaves town.

2) He doesn't learn and continues to stay falling deeper and deeper into bankruptcy.

Granted the responses were hostile, but it is just a prime example of how much we really care about the work that others do here. They defend us as writers, and we defend them as people that help us grow. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Interviews With 5 Unwilling E-mail Scammers [Part 1] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-07 14:09:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello my name is Mark Smalls, and I have a total of 5 people to interview. These are people that would be hated in every other situation, but what they have gone through will make you think otherwise. 

When the cops entered into the house they found three men and two women huddled up together in the middle of the floor and stared intently into the laptops that were placed in front of them. They were completely naked and noticeably malnourished. You would think this only happens in third world countries, but this took place in the heart of Raleigh, North Carolina. 

Currently, they are living in a small building in Fort Bragg, North Carolina. We were given a small building to house them in. They each have a room and we provide all of them 3 meals a day. The only person to eat all of the meals and show any type of improvement is Klay White. 

That is why I took him to the local park to interview him first today.

I have logged in the interview for you guys because I really dont know what to make out of his answers, and weird shit has started to happen during and after the interview. 

Date: **March 6th, 2017**.

Name of Interviewee: **Klay White** Will refer as **KW**

Me- What exactly happened in the house we found you in? What were you doing in there?

KW- Well, we were given laptops when we arrived in the house. We were each given a script that we could use.

Me- How did you end up at the house?

KW- Four months ago, while I was walking around and picking up applications for a new job a man approached me and asked if I needed to make some quick cash. Normally, I would just ignore someone like that, but he seemed different. He spoke with such confidence, and he was wearing a nice suit. I nodded at him and he told me that I could work from home. He would provide a place for me to stay, food for me to eat, and enough cash to make me happy. 

*Klay White was quiet after that for about 6 minutes. He kept staring at the basketball court while rubbing his hands together.*

Me- So, um. How did they take you to the house?

KW- Oh, right. Sorry. After I told him I was interested he pointed at a building that was a couple of feet from where we were standing. As soon as I followed him inside I felt something hit the back of my head and everything went black. When I woke up I found myself sitting alone in a room. 

Me- Were there any more people in the house before we got to you?

KW- Yes, just a month ago we had 14 people in our room. Seven of them decided to group up and escape, but right as they opened the door we heard the sound of gun shots and the bodies were covered in blood before they fell to the ground. 

Me- What did you guys do in there? All we got from the laptops were just e-mails you guys sent out. 

KW- Did you look at the e-mails? Thats all we did. Every day when we wake up we go to our laptop and find a new list of e-mails we have to contact. We would then act like a prince with too much diamonds in his inventory for the next 4 to 5 hours. When we finished the list of e-mail addresses we sat around and waited till we got a response back.

Me- What if you dont get a response back? You were sending what seemed to be scam e-mails. 

KW- I was getting to that. 

Me- Sorry.

KW- We had quotas we had to meet. We needed to get at least 8 people to send us the money each month. If they sent us any less than $500 then it would not count. If we managed to get them to send us $1000 or more we would get a hot meal the next day. If we only met half of the quota for the month we would receive 2 meals a day. If we failed to reach half we would get 1 meal a day. If we continuously underachieved we would be taken outside. I dont know what they did, but they never came back again. Happened to a woman and a man.

Me- Never learned what they did to them?

KW- Nope.

Me- What was a regular meal? 

KW- It was the same for every meal. Two pieces of bread and half a fish.  I have received 9 hot meals while I was there and that was the same every time too. A small piece of steak and two slices of toast with butter.  It doesnt seem like much, but to us that felt like a meal fit for a king.

Me-Did anyone else come into the room?

KW- Well, the man that brought me here would bring us our food. He would occasionally come in to bring a new worker into our room. Besides him, we would get a couple of people come in from time to time to look at us, but they always had a mask over their heads.

Me- What kind of mask? Could you describe their height or something unique about their body?

KW- It looked like an infants face, but red marks were drawn underneath the eyes. They were all pretty much the same height. I would say around 510. If they had anything specific about them I wouldnt be able to tell you. They all wore the same gray suit and white button down shirt.

Me- Is there anything else you could tell me? Anything that you think would help us catch the men that trapped you guys?

*Klay White has started to laugh uncontrollably. He grabbed my shoulder, but I managed to pull out of his grip. While I tried to settle him down I saw a man in a gray suit watching us through what looked like a mask from the other side of the park. I tried calling out to him, but he ran off.*

KW- Catch them? You plan on catching hundreds to maybe thousands of people? Haha. Im sorry, but thats just not possible. This house wasnt the only one. How do I know? The man would gloat about his operation every single day. He would brag about having over 300 buildings with workers all around the East Coast. Sorry man. You saved us, but you really fucked yourself over on this one.

*Klay has started laughing again. I tried speaking to him several times after, but he will not settle down.*

**End Interview**

Its now 1:45 at night and I cant go to sleep. I kept tossing and turning on my bed, but nothing worked. So I wrote this out to you guys for a cry for help. Every time I look out the window I keep seeing the man in the gray suit and the bloody infant mask. I called the military police twice tonight, but each time they came out [they didnt see anyone there] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

	<TEXT> After a long and thoughtful sigh my boyfriend asked me, Babe, look at the stars. Do you see anything that reminds you of, you know, us? I looked long and hard at the stars, but after searching for an answer in the stars I drew a blank. When I gave him a look of confusion he laughed and grabbed my chin while saying, I love it when you look confused. It makes it seem like I can teach you something new. He pointed at the skies and I stared at the direction he pointed and after a couple of seconds of complete focus I managed to see a girl and boy lying on what seemed like a blanket.

The boy was laughing, but the girl looked like she was scared. The eyes on her face were wide open and the lips were opened up as if it were screaming. I felt the blood rush from my face and into my heart causing it to beat faster when my boyfriend looked deeply into my eyes and stuck his hand into my shirt and his fingers crept towards my bra. With a layer of fear clearly in my voice I said, Henry, please. I dont want it right now. He just laughed and said, Cmon its not like its the first time. He ripped my bra off and before I knew it his lips were on mine with his tongue halfway into my mouth.

I screamed and shoved him off of me. He fell off of the top of his car and landed on the ground. When he didnt move for a couple of seconds I slid from the roof of his car and onto the ground before I took off running. While I was running I felt the tears of betrayal spill from my chin and onto the soft ground my feet slammed on.

In the distance, I heard Henry call out, Emma come back! I was just teasing babe. We can work it out. Please. I swear I was just kidding!

Swallowing the snarky remark I had for him, I kept running towards the direction to where my house was.

Henry picked me up from my house, but we drove into a spot in the woods that was only 2 miles away from our house. My father was not happy about me having a date, but I begged him enough to the point to where he just told me to go as long as I could give him a couple of hours of peace. As I am running I start wishing my father just never let me leave. I wish he told Henry that I wasnt ready to go on a date with. With the thought of being at home encapsulated into my heart I held my pace and kept running towards my house.

Henry kept yelling at me while he ran towards me. Every time he yelled at me his voice seemed closer. Right as I reached the end of the woods I felt a hand grab my shirt and I fell backwards onto the soft earth. I tried squirming out of his grasp, but he placed his two hands on each of my shoulders and started to yell at me. We were meant to be together babe. I dont care you keep running away from me. I know. I just know. You and I were meant to be together. He tried to bend down to give me a kiss, but I shoved his face away from mine with the palm of my hand and got to my knees.

Before I started to run away from him again I looked back and saw that he was lying on the ground sobbing quietly into the grass that surrounded him. Scared and desperate, I kept running away from the moon and towards me house. Henry still tried to get to me, but before he got to me I managed to get back into my house. I used all three locks on the door, double checked and made sure that door couldnt be opened, ran to my room, locked the door to my room, and dove under my covers.

After a couple of minutes I heard knocking at the door. When I saw my father walk out of his room and towards the door I tried to call out to him to keep the door closed, but my throat wouldnt cooperate with me. Before I surpassed my fear and started to call out to my father, he opened the door and Henry started to talk to my father. I couldnt really hear anything. I pressed my ear up to the door and heard my father tell Henry, Yeah, shes in her room right now. Go talk to her or whatever you have to do. Im too tired to even protect her anymore. Do whatever you have to do.
Henry started going up the stairs to my room.

As the steps grew louder with each passing second I grabbed the knife from my desk and waited on my bed.

He came inside my room with a smile on his face. Before he could get any closer to me I let out a scream and plunged the knife into his face. I kept slamming the knife into his face until he stopped breathing.

A total of 10 times.

My dad came up and started screaming and ran up to Henrys fallen body. He asked me, How could you do this to your husband? What the fuck is wrong with you. I got you out of the psychiatric hospital because we trusted you. Henry convinced me, but he shouldnt have. Your ass should have just stayed th-.
His sentence was cut off by the knife that entered into the right side of his throat. My father took 14 stabs before he stopped breathing.

Im tired of people controlling my life. I know that I was never married. I know that my father was always a piece of shit. He was the one that laughed when he learned about the death of my mother 10 years ago. Henry was just like my father. I knew him before. I dont know how I knew him, but Im almost completely sure I never married him </TEXT>

Of course, i would love the thought of making extra money on the side, but the publicity makes it w9rth it to me.

I have yet to finish my first book, but when i do i can at least know some of the followers i gain from the narrations will provide just that many more book sales. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so here goes.

I am a 17 year old working as an apprentice in a computer repair shop, and my life has been great. 

Until yesterday.

So, for a little context, this computer repair store is in a little village a few miles away from my town, only me and my mentor( the store owner) Mike works here, and we are struggling with customers. 

Not for the normal reasons of no customers mind you, Mike offers a free 3 year warranty on all repairs we do, because we are truly the best around.

However, as it is only us two working, it takes a lot longer to test and repair systems, so customers often get annoyed and agitated at our lackluster speed. Anyway, enough back story, time to get into this tale.

	<TEXT> Team: **Constipated Monsters With a Dish Full Of Green Meat** Working Title: **I Have Fallen Into Some Sketchy Debt**

Being a college dropout and working at an office supply store makes it pretty obvious that I do not make a lot of money. Even with being promoted to Assistant Manager I can hardly meet ends meet while paying for my single bedroom apartment, utilities, and the ramen noodles and occasional TV dinners I eat for the month. 

Though I can never spoil myself or necessarily eat 3 meals a day; I have learned to adapt to it, and still managed to remain happy to have finally moved out of the hotel I was living in 2 years before. Though it put a strain on me financially I was just glad to be able to bring friends and family over without having everyone constantly worry about where I am living. Of course, I really do wish I could get a credit card so that I can manage to raise my credit score and start utilizing my money better, but due to people taking advantage of me when I was eighteen my credit is completely unsalvageable.

One day last month when I went to work I finally received my first chance at having my own credit card. I woke up, got dressed, and ate a snack cake just like any other day, but when I got to work I saw a man standing outside with a table and a sign that read Credit Approved for Everyone!!! Well, that grabbed my attention instantly because unlike most 100% credit approvals this was actually for a card and not some payday loan. So I walked up to the table and checked out of one of the many pamphlets that littered his table.

After talking to the man, which had a voice of a basketball game announcer, I realized that this card seemed like it was simply too good to be true. They do not pay attention to your credit score, no security deposit, there was only one catch, and that was that you have to use a minimum of 250 dollars on the card and there is an automatic 4.5% interest fee. So they make money from you every single month you have the credit card, but I dont mind since I can finally try to start raising my credit score up!

After I am done filling out my information the man tells me that I will get my card shipped to my address within the next 3 days. So with excitement flowing through every part of my body, I practically jumped into work and got through the day in the best mood I had been in years. While I was walking home I decided to treat myself and got myself some Lasagna at the local Italian restaurant and enjoyed every last bite on the plate. 

When I got home I noticed that there was a letter in my mail slot so I grabbed it and walked upstairs to my room. Once inside, I tossed the letters on the coffee table and watched some TV. When that got boring I looked around the room to find something else to do and realized I had completely forgotten about the mail. The only thing was, there were 2 letters when I know for a fact that I only grabbed one. I dismissed it off by blaming being over excited about the new credit card and check the letters.

The first letter just contained a cheesy flyer from my landlord telling me that my rent is due next week and to remember about the New Tenant party he is having for all of us on Friday evening. After throwing the letter in the trash can I flipped the other letter over and notice there was absolutely nothing written on it. I tore open the letter to find a single piece of paper and a card inside. 

The writing on the paper was handwritten and stated *unlimited credit limit. 250 dollar minimum spending limit. Automatic 4.5% interest. You do not want to make a late payment. Enjoy.*

	<TITLE> If You Find A Man Name Double M At A Rave Please Don't Buy Molly Off Of Him </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-02 14:04:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When you go to an all ages rave you go in with minimal expectations. You dont really wanna hit on a girl and find yourself leaving a two story house with a cop leading you out. Handcuffs digging into your skin while you try to avoid the stares of rage from the parents of the underage girl that seduced you with her night stick tricks the night before. Thats not my story though. That was Jeremy 3 weeks ago. 

I was smarter than him. I just go to these raves to enjoy the music. This time I went alone for the first time. As I walked into the club I was hit by the smell of sweat and alcohol. I flashed my id to the bouncer and walked up to the bar. Once I got my screwdriver I made my way into the middle of the floor and closed my eyes while feeling the bass that the dj was sending my way. 15 minutes later a man tapped on my shoulder. I turned around and saw a guy in a Pink Floyd shirt. He mouthed out looking? 

With a smile I put up two fingers and he put two capsules in my hand while I handed him a twenty. I popped the first capsule of molly in my mouth and after 20 minutes I lost myself in a sea of euphoria and perfect rhythms. 

A girl started dancing on me. I tried to stop her, but she stuck even closer to me. With a couple of pushes I finally managed to get away from her and ran to the water fountain in the back. The guy I bought the molly from was standing next to the fountain and staring into the rave with a small smile on his face. After I drank enough water to counteract the cotton mouth I was experiencing I asked the guy if he was alright. He turned to me and took out a pack of cigarettes and pointed to the smoking area. I nodded my head.

Once we got out there he turned to me and held out of his hand while saying, Name is Mike but people call me Double M. I took his hand and told him my name was Gregg. After a couple of drags from his cigarette he asked, So were you trying to get some more? I shook my head no and said, Nah man, just wanted a second away from the rave. Some chick force grinded me and Im trying to lay low until she finds another guy. He let out a short laugh and slapped my back. Yo man, if you wanna chill sometime hit me up. Mike handed out his hand and I handed him my phone and waited while he put in his number.

After our second cigarette he said, You might wanna get back in cause it looks like youre about to peak like a mother fucker. I noticed I started to breathe really heavily and nodded at him before walking back inside and in front of the stage. The song started to progress and my deep breathing transitioned to short breaths that matched the rhythm of the song. Right as the beat dropped I instinctively lurched my chest out and got on my tiptoes before jumping up and down to the drop. 

This was unlike any experience I have ever felt in my life. Every single worry dripped away from me and was soon replaced about thoughts of just absolute happiness. 

Nothing in particular.

Just plain happiness. 

A huge smile formed on my face and I let out a cry of absolute bliss. People around me started to join in and we were harmoniously exclaiming our love for the moment we were in. 

The next 2 hours, were the happiest moments of my life, but as the roll started to fade away I noticed that the people that surrounded me were still smiling while occasionally screaming out in glee. I started to make my way to the back to get an orange juice to take my next capsule with before noticing that the screams were starting to change. A couple of screams went from absolute happiness to complete pain, agony, and fear. The type of screams you would expect to hear from the depths of hell. I ran back into the crowd and noticed that several people were lying on the ground and clawing at their faces. 

The bartender ran up next to me and dialed 911 on his phone while shouting that he needed several ambulances. One girl in particular stood out to me. Her lips were starting to rip at the sides. She was screaming in agony but her smile was getting wider every single second. She started to cry as the people around her looked at her desperately while they continued to jump up and down with their fists in the air and a smile on their face. 

The paramedics rushed into the rave less than 10 minutes later. They started to pick up the bodies from the floor and onto the gurneys. 

When they picked up the girl and carried her outside I followed them and stayed close to her. They asked her what her name was. In between her sobs she managed to spit out, Chey before her body started to contort in unnatural positions. They tried to get her into the ambulance, but before they got her inside bubble purple liquid started to froth out of her mouth. Cheys body started to contort into unnatural positions before I heard a loud crack and she stopped moving. The paramedic to my right walked up to her and felt her neck. After a couple of seconds he tried reviving her with CPR. When that didnt work they shoved the gurney she was on into the ambulance and used the defibrillator three times before looking at each other and shaking their heads.

I managed to drive back home, but the smile wont leave my face. I tried to think of every single unhappy thought I could, but the smile keeps slowly growing. 

This is a warning. If you meet a man named Mike or goes by the name Double M please do not talk to him. Above all else do not buy [anything from him] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).

[2nd Part] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5wgvoc/i_wish_i_was_never_unknowingly_recorded_for_a/)

When the final bell rang I stayed in the school restroom for 30 minutes before taking a couple of deep breaths and took out my fathers pistol. I stuck the pistol in the back of my pants and walked out of the restroom. My body wouldnt stop shaking the whole walk there, but I managed to walk to Mr. Smiths classroom. As I got up to the classroom I heard shuffling inside. When I tried peeking through the small window on his door Mr. Smiths face smashed into it. I jumped back and watched his face get sliced up by the glass it went through. 

I turned around and started to run towards the front doors of the school but halfway there I was lifted up by the back of my shirt. I tried kicking and punching the man that grabbed me, but he was far too strong. He ran all the way to the back of the parking lot and threw me in his car. Before I could even open the door and run away he got into the car and held on to my arm while he started up the car and started driving. 

For the next 5 minutes I couldnt say anything. I tried thinking of something, anything, to say, but the words just wouldnt come out of my mouth. A cough came from the back seat and I turned around and saw a little kid sitting in the car seat. He was staring at me, but he didnt say anything. After a couple of seconds the kid held out his hand and instinctively I grabbed his hand and held it. 

The man looked over at me and tears were running down his chin and onto his shirt. He patted my shoulder before saying, Im sorry. Im so sorry. Three days ago I found a letter in my mailbox. There wasnt an address on it or anything. The only thing written on the envelope was my name. The letter inside told me there was a way I could get my son back. I love my son, and by that time I was desperate to try anything. You gotta understand man. He means more to me than even my own life or anyone elses life. They gave me a facebook account I could upload a video I took of you. They didnt tell me what you would do, but just that I would know what to record. 

He wiped his tears with his sleeve and the kid let go of my hand before he continued. That man. You called him Mr. Smith, but to me he is just a piece of shit. He owns a daycare center with his wife. The same daycare that I sent my son to. They have a creature down there. Call me crazy if you want. Anyone else would. They have some fucking creature down there that eats children. Children like mine. Children that they think are imperfect. My son is just a shell of what he once was. The way he just held your hand. Thats how he used to hold mine when he was scared.

Silence filled the car until the boy in the back asked, Where is my plane daddy? The man let out a sob, but he remained silent for the next couple of minutes. 

After a deep sigh the man said, My name is George, by the way, and little mans name is Henry. I took the hand he stuck out and shook it while telling him my name was Martin. He asked me if I had family, and I told him that I had a mother and father but they never really talked to me or gave me attention. George slowly nodded his head and stared at the road as he kept driving and I looked over at Henry. The little kid started fidgeting and grabbed at his stomach. I turned to George to tell him that Henry seemed to be having stomach problems, but before I opened my mouth Henry started to scream. A scream that was filled with more anguish and torture I had ever heard in my life. 

When I turned back around and looked at Henry I saw that his midsection was torn opened and what seemed like miniature pale people started to crawl out. They were around 3 to 4 inches tall and slid around Henrys body while leaving a line of slime. I cried out in shock and fear, but George stared at the road while tears continuously dripped down his cheeks. 

After a couple of minutes George stopped the car and dragged Henrys body out of the car seat and shook the little creatures off of his. As they dropped from the toddlers body they started to move towards the direction of where the sun was. A couple of them exploded on impact and left a mixture of green sludge and tiny broken bones. 

Curiosity got the best of me and I bent down to take a better look at one of them. They had every characteristic of a full grown human despite the size, but the face looked like a face a baby would have. The creature turned around and stared me down before jumping up and latching onto my right cheek. I screamed out in pain as the creature started to bite a chunk off of my cheek. George quickly grabbed the creature and threw it into the woods. 

He grabbed me and threw me back into the car before getting into the drivers side and drove off. I looked at my face in the mirror and saw that there was a dime size chunk ripped off of my cheek. Blood was pouring down my face, but the pain was gone. Even when I dabbed at the gash on my face I did not feel anything. 

I looked at Henry and my mouth dropped as I saw his midsection mending itself. In a matter of seconds he was sitting up in his chair and continued to stare at me. 

When I looked back at the mirror I saw that my face was perfectly fine. The gash was gone and a layer of perfect skin was surrounded by my acne filled face.

After four hours of the quietest car ride I had ever been on George parked in front of an old log house. We got out and I checked my phone. There was no service, but there was wifi here. I looked around my facebook when we got inside. A bunch of kids were talking about how Mr. Smith was killed. There were various rumors floating around but none of them were true. I checked the news and saw nothing interesting. Just whatever the fuck Trump was doing, who won the Oscars, but somewhere around the third page of the news there was a news story that caught my eye.

Several kids have gone missing. Some of them were found several hours later, but several parents were saying that the kids that came back home were different. They didnt show any emotions. There have been sightings of those creatures that I saw exit Henrys body, but there has not been a clear picture that has been taking. It is talked about the same way people would talk about Bigfoot. Just a mythological creature, but what confuses me is those creatures were tiny, but the people that were closer at describing out the creature said they were over 10 feet tall. They laughed like an infant and had a face of an infant, but was taller than anything they had ever seen. 

I dont even know if I can trust George or Henry, but after reading what George wrote to you guys. I cant help it. I just have to trust him, but I am scared. Henry could easily give birth to more of those fucked up creatures and I wouldnt be able to do anything when I fall asleep. 

Give me help guys. This shit is just not [getting any better] (https://www.facebook.com/subject8631NoSleep/).
