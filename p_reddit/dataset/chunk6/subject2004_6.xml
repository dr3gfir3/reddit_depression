	<TEXT> We're all HD at my company, I love it. I can zoom right in on someone's face, screen shot that bitch and have it to the police in under 5 minutes. One of my favorite things at work is when they call and say they caught someone who stole from us, makes me warm inside.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really is. And interestingly, drug problems are increasingly being linked to boredom. So if you're creating areas where you can live AND have fun without having to travel very far, if it all. I've got an area close to my house where there's 100 or so apartments, a dog park, half a dozen restaurants, a little movie theater, etc... Everything is surprisingly pretty affordable too. I think that's the direction the towns in Maine need to move in, so that everyone doesn't migrate South.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd be surprised what these new economic development counsels can do once they set a plan in motion. Look up Deep Ellum in Dallas, or the Bishop Arts district. 5 years ago they were areas I wouldn't ever go to and I'm a big guy who can defend himself. Now? There's dog parks, food trucks, concert venues, etc. It was a complete night and day transformation.

At some point I'll come back home and I plan on taking part in a few revitalization projects. It honestly just takes a few competent people to change the situation, especially if you've got a foundation to build from which Lewiston does have believe it or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're getting prioritized at 5GB then you need to contact Verizon tech support and they can and will send a technician out to the closest tower to you, just FYI. Customer service can't do shit. If you're using an iPhone you can also reset your network settings and if you're using an Android make sure your network settings are set to LTE/CDMA, not global mode. If you have a weak signal you can also get a signal booster for your residence and that will help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it doesn't. You get *prioritised* after 22GB. That means if you are watching a video and you're on a congested tower, after 22GB it will prioritize the newest person on that tower. All of this takes place in less than 5 seconds typically and is not a constant throttle like you're suggesting. Sorry to burst the bubble. Source: Have worked in the industry for 8 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do something similar every year! This year we have 2 guys from Maine, 5 from Canada, 1 from Scotland, 2 from Boston, 1 from San Diego, 1 from Austin and me from Dallas. We go for my birthday and I tell everyone to bring their best friend. Last year there were almost 20 of us. The year before that my we lost my friend and he came back to us the next day minus all of his personal belongings, but unharmed. He said he woke up naked being put on a gurney by EMT'S in the back hall of Caesers Palace. He escaped the hospital in nothing but a gown and those slipper socks and made his way back to the hotel on foot. We still aren't sure what happened to him.

The year before that, our friend Dusty went out to try and find cocaine to experiment with and came back 2 days later with no money and only one sock on. Las Vegas brings out the best in people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He decided it would be a good idea to stay in our small ass hometown and work at a potato processing plant instead of going to school or moving to a city. He got involved with pills, meth and started smoking cigarettes within 2 years of being out of high school. I've talked to him maybe 5 times in 12 years, and we were at each other's house every day in high school. I've offered to help him multiple times and he either doesn't respond or refuses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds spectacular. I'm from Maine originally. We had the ocean literally in our back yard. I would cook steak and lobsters out on the deck, listening to the waves crash and smell that good salty air...When someone tells me they know of a great seafood restaurant in Dallas I'm very skeptical lol. The environment is half of the experience sometimes. 

That being said, I've hit Rudys in Allen, they're VERY good for a chain BBQ restaurant. I haven't been to spring Creek because I always hear really mixed reviews. I've got to hit Cooper's and the Rail one though, always hear good things.  </TEXT>
