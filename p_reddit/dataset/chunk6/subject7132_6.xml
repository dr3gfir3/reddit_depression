And we are deeply embarrassed.

Part of my hope comes from knowing the world still counts among America a clear division of crazy and sane, and that the sane are right now a live wire of activism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If our brains were binary, we would of course have all of this Black History data always factored in to an algorithm to safeguard the continued transcendence over our more primal / tribal / xenophobic directives. 

But we are of course not binary. Our brains sort by stimuli, and we are constantly bombarded by stimuli. The only way for the brain's neural network to ingest non-mission-critical data is to have it highlighted and categorized in some fashion. 

Black history is a subset of American history (categorization). One month per year distinguishes this subset from, say, the Industrial Revolution - and aligns it with, say, certain other subsets, like the Holocaust - and in doing so, pays homage to victims and heroes, and also mitigates the potential for a repeat of history (lest we forget the lesson). Culturally, there is also a tertiary effect of having this month profiled at the federal level...as it sends the message from the top of our rather racially divided nation: Black history matters.

No, I was sharing...I walked in from a long day at the office, started reading today's endless succession of crazy-becoming-America, and was like, fuck it, Double Stuff, let's blast through one full row like it's an ear of corn...and then I hit the PAX 2.0.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exceptionally well articulated. I am an atheist and yet have still chosen to share this essay with my audience.

I'll pull the lense back from American civil religion and digress: it pains me to see the lengths to which his erstwhile Christian fan base will go to brandish him as one of them. Their pivot to forgiveness for his rampant and belligerent "moral" transgressions barely qualifies as a cheap parlor trick. The very valid analysis laid out in this essay leaves Christians even less wiggle room to deny his heresy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Between Trump's association with that group and his dubious and possibly financial ties to Russia, I can see that being fairly high on the list of why or what would start the impeachment process.

Yes: Pressure. In its myriad forms. And proven. And the faster it builds, the better, as per your observation that they are rushing to jam everything through as we speak. (Apprentice archives would help, too).

	<TITLE> An engineer and a scientist walk into a dive bar.... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-23 00:52:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Smiling, happy, the engineer says, "Bartender, shots for everyone!"

The bartender leans in, confused, "I can tell you're not from around here. Are you sure you want to buy these people drinks?"

The scientist retorts with, "Make 'em doubles!"

The bartender deploys the drinks to everyone around the smoky bar, the newcomers raise their glasses, and everyone drinks.

The scientist and the engineer then pay their substantial tab, leave a generous tip, and pull away in a Tesla. Naturally, everyone is a bit confused about what just happened, but before long everyone gets back to NASCAR, NFL, Fox, country music, cigarettes, cheap beer, Trump, and arguing about Ford versus Chevy.

While the engineer sets the car to autopilot, the scientist pulls up this very joke, half composed, on his iPad, and with furrowed brow says, "We still need a punch line."

The engineer nods in affirmation, and says, "Look in the rear view mirror."

He looks. The small dive bar recedes into the darkness as the Tesla picks up speed, rapidly and silently.

"They don't even remember us. We worked our asses off, moved away to the city, competed with the brightest kids from around the globe, earned advanced degrees, and now we challenge global warming by designing advanced battery systems for electric cars. We have made a fortune along the way. I am 28. You are 29. Those townies will live and die back there. By choice. 14 mile per gallon trucks. Shit beer. Staying, sitting, stewing, and waiting for progress to come to them.

"There's your f-ing punch line." </TEXT>
