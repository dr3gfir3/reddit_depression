	<TEXT> Okay so if you want to discuss using this kind of rhetoric I want to show you something. Couple of days ago this article was upvoted to /r/all: https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/691z4x/woman_found_guilty_and_faces_year_in_jail_for/. Title of this article is stating a factually untrue statement and its inherently poor quality because its a lie. Objectively speaking this article is founded upon lies that is contradicted by the truth. Actually, title is debunked within the article itself! Here is a quote "She did not get convicted for laughing. It was her actions as she was being asked to leave, the foreperson said. We did not agree that she should have been removed for laughing.. 

I can find you a ton of other articles that have loaded title that are false and make to /r/all very frequently.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. Unless young conservatives takeover the party it will continue that way. As a person with very right-wing look on economy I'm sad that my party can't get back on tracks. </TEXT>
