	<TEXT> No... I was replying to /u/graebot and you jumped in.

Do you even read my comments, or even yours? Do you know how you sound to people? You are misrepresenting my claim which leads me to believe that you aren't really interested in what other people are saying. So why are you here? Just to tell everyone what you think and how your way is the only way? Grow up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The guy I replied to said bullets should be traceable back to the owner, he said nothing about removing guns. If you're going to take the time to argue with people you should at least know what the argument is. After that, maybe think about some better examples(drunk driving is more akin to murder, which is already illegal, than simply owning a gun)and try a tactic different than "if you don't agree with my opinon on this issue then you must not care about these people." Have a great day.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not ignoring. I feel like my suggestions actually address the underlying issues and the other suggestions are a poor attempt to slap a band-aid on the symptom.   

Why would you assume my reasoning is irrational? Why are you irrationally scared of something that is a statistical minority of total deaths? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems like way too much money considering you aren't going to charge suicides with a crime and criminals already don't care about owning guns illegally.

Why not try to increase mental health care outreach, fix insurance and improve quality of life for low income areas? </TEXT>
