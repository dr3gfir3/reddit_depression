	<TEXT> Dude I have been working PC since we had 386's. ('96) I have worked for microscopic companies when I built my own systems and I have worked for massive companies the have over 17k people just in in the IT.  I have yet to see a capacitors had leaked.  Now friends that overclocked their gaming rigs sure, but that is expected. The main problems they had were hard drives going bad laptop batteries going bad and power supplies.  To be honest I would say the biggest problem we had coffee/soda being spilled or laptop being dropped.  I have worked on Dells, eMachines, packard bells, HP, Compaqs, Compudynes, Goldstars. I have also hundreds of computers.  I take fucking eMachine before I would buy a Mac. They are overpriced and under powered. You can even use a Oculus on their most powerful mac available. You can't even run a full version AutoCAD. You have to use a Lite version. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The mammoth budget blueprint under consideration in the Illinois Senate changed shape yet again Tuesday, with lawmakers floating the idea of applying a higher state sales tax to food and drugs.

The change allows backers to shelve a proposed "opportunity tax" that would charge companies for the "privilege" of doing business in the state. That ran into opposition from business groups. But the broad nature of the sales tax expansion is likely to spawn arguments that it hits hardest those least able to afford the increase." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A nonpartisan budget watchdog group is calling for dramatic action to get the states budget back on track, saying Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and Democrats are out of easy choices and need to consider raising taxes, among other things.

A five-year plan to be released Friday by the Civic Federation calls for a strict spending limit that caps growth at 1.7 percent a year, hiking the personal income tax rate from 3.75 percent to 5.25 percent, eliminating Illinois' tax exemption on retirement income and lowering the sales tax rate from 6.25 percent to 5.5 percent but expanding it to apply to more services.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> he surgical device, called a power morcellator, has been on the market since 1991 and is FDA-approved for use in minimally invasive gynecological surgeries, including removing benign uterine tumors (fibroids). The device shreds tissue into small pieces so it can be removed from the body through small incisions. But in the event that a patient has an undiagnosed cancer, the device can fling cancer cells throughout the body, where they can seed new tumors. The first time the FDA got a report of this happening was in 2013and it was from a patient, not a doctor or hospital using the device. By that time, at least 50,000 US women were having surgery with the device a year, The New York Times reports. </TEXT>

A decision by Foxconn to give Sharp the lead would come as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe prepares to travel to the United States to meet U.S. President Donald Trump, who in his inauguration speech vowed to put "America first." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> source one: Travel ban is an terrible but far from fascism

Source two: is not even news it a blog about someone worried that the Trump admin might manipulate numbers like every other presidency has.

Source three: Again, the travel ban is not not fascism

Source four: is article about Steve Bannon speaking about a war with ISIS.

Source five: Huff Post is far from a creditable source and again, the travel ban is not not fascism

Source Six: is an article about who trump is handing over his company too. If he was a fascist then he would refuse to turn over his company and arrest anyone that complained about it.

Source Seven:  Again I HATE how trump did this ban but again that is not fascism.

Source eight: again this is about the ban. CEOs being afraid  to speak out about the ban.  Sound like the CEOs are cowards. Many others spoke out and nothing happened. If Trump was a fascist he would have put all the CEO and media outlets in work camps.  

source nine:  A badly written speech is far from fascism.

source ten: is about a missing link on the whitehouse website that was restored 

Source eleven: is a  blog article from the observer(not news
) that compares trump to Hitler so that prove how unreliable the article is.  There was no coup

source 12: Again, the travel ban is not not fascism

source 13: Again, the travel ban is not not fascism

source 14: Is an interview with a angry bitter buthurt old man who said his new Prime Minister and Trump are walking hand in had with fascism.  If either were then he would be in jail or dead.  He is still angry about Brexit and his party losing power. 

So what else do you have? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Democratic Senate President John Cullerton and Minority Leader Christine Radogno told the Chicago Tribune editorial board last week, that they plan to put the proposal to a floor vote Wednesday. It would raise income taxes, borrow to pay off overdue bills, expand casino gambling, and freeze local property taxes. Cullerton said "the Senate must act quickly in part to fend off lobbyists lining up to kill parts of the plan."

Sounds like the lobbyists won. </TEXT>
