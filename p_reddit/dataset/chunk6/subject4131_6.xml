	<TITLE> Why can't Dota players be happy for others success? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-20 01:05:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I enjoy playing Dota but I've taken issue with how few players are genuinely happy when others do well. When another player, my team or the enemy, makes a great play, I congratulate him, even if I died! Likewise, if another player has success in life, I congratulate him. I'm not interested in trying to tear them down. Yet when I play, I hardly ever get congratulated. Whether I made a great play or reveal my great new job(6 figures), all i get is shade. It's gotten to the point that I don't even want to tell other players about myself, my car (new black benz, fully loaded), or the girls I get. When will the average player learn to not be jealous but instead to be happy for others? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I throw matches, an open and honest discussion </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-18 14:46:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why I and others throw matches. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

I occasionally throw matches. I admit it and I'm not proud of it. However, I have my reasons. You see by skill I'm a 5k mmr player, but I like to play at the lower brackets. So for me to maximize my fun and not advance to the higher brackets, I have to purposefully lose some time. So usually I'll play a game for real and have a great time crushing scrubs, and I'll play a second game, and have a great time doing something silly, like fight for mid with someone else, feed the courier, carry kotl who pulls players back to base. Every game I play is fun. This is valves fault for not letting me choose my bracket. Since no one has reports anymore, there is no downside. So if this happens to you remember, don't hate the player, hate the game. Tell valve to let players choose their bracket. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Many people complain when I decide to go mid after someone else called it. I'm not stealing it! You see I play monkey king, and I turn in the courier! Then I bring the real courier out we both stand there. The enemy mid cannot help themselves, and he attacks either me or the real courier. That's when I stun him and the real mid attacks. After a few times, we get the kill! If the real courier is killed it is worth it to pull the trick off.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I very much enjoy playing dota 2 but I have an issue I was hoping somebody else may have worked out. I'm a very religious man and adhere strictly to the church's guidelines. However I am also a very skilled dota player, and through normal play, I often go on "godlike" streaks. This is of course blasphemy and not acceptable. I asked my priest and he said it was ok as long as when I get a godlike steak I say "praise Christ" over mic or chat. This makes the godlike comment about HIM and not me. However he also said at least 3 of the other 9 players must also say "praise Christ" for it to work. If they don't, I must immediately feed the courier. As you can imagine, most other players won't cooperate and flip out when I feed the courier. It's making it very difficult to play a full match and I'm getting a lot of reports. Had anyone else figured out a solution to a problem like mine? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was approached by the individual HapJak over Reddit who told me he was a pro scout and I should invite him over steam to watch me play a ranked match. I agreed. He told me he wanted to assess my leadership abilities by seeing if I could convince the other players to participate in my online persona. I was to say or chat "Am I original?" and all the other players had to say or chat "yeah yeah". Then I had to continue with all the lyrics to the chorus of the song backstreets back, e.g. "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The other players refused to cooperate and the situation deteriorated. Ending with me feeding the courier and my team losing, and me getting reported. I later found it through Reddit that he ISNT EVEN A PRO SCOUT. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why playing on other country's servers is the smart move, an open and honest discussion </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-15 22:24:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why using foreign servers is a good thing. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Some people get bent out of shape when players from other countries play on their home servers. This is foolish. I play on servers all over the world. It helps me experience another culture and meet new friends. Some guidelines to help you do the same are:

1.Pause early and pause often. Each pause is an opportunity for discussion and culture.

2.Use google translate. If you don't speak the language, pause every time someone chats and input it into google translate so you understand

3.Stay in the jungle. If your ping is too high to play effectively, stay in the jungle for easy xp.

4.Get to know the other players. Insist on discussion, if they don't answer consider grabbing their attention with pings.

5.Punish unwelcoming cultures. If ur teammates don't participate, send an message that Dota is a welcoming community by feeding the courier or gems to the other team.

Remember, playing dota can be a wonderful and cultural experience if you invest the time and energy to do it right! Thanks and good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about whether you should play music over the mic in ranked. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

Playing music over the mic is simply a good idea. If you have your own band, this is a great way to get exposure. When u r just starting out, it's hard to get people to hear ur stuff, but the other players in ranked will listen. If they criticize your work, ask them to be constructive and then take it to heart. If they tell you to stop, just tell them to shut it because the other players r enjoying it. Even if you don't have ur own band, play music that you enjoy. It will energize the team and let them know more about u as a person. All this adds up to better teammates and maybe, fans and friends. </TEXT>

If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is 6k MMR. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>
