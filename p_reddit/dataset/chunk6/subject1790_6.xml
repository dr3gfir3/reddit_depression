	<TEXT> I'd be very surprised by it after they handed Glennon all that money. I think going at a qb in this draft would have been wiser than signing Glennon. 

If they feel like he's a passable qb then chasing another qb would be dumb considering the holes on their roster  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn that is beautiful. Also I always like the language NR chooses to use in their articles 

The alt-right basement-dwellers and sundry knuckleheads beamed that Trump was going to be a nationalist, and that he would give the boot to coastal elitists, moderates, and Ivy League snoots. 

Edit 
That closing line

What Limbaugh and the rest of Trumps admirers missed is that it wasnt NATO and the Chi-Coms and Enrique Pea Nieto on the other side of the negotiating table getting hornswoggled. It was them.
