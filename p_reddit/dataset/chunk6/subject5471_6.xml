	<TEXT> I read Brief Interviews with Ugly Men and found it "eh". White Noise was kinda boring. Is Catch 22 continuously enjoyable?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello. I want to start reading Postmodernist literature but I can't find a good starting point. Everyone seems to just recommend their favorite not the easiest or most accessible.  Thanks ahead of time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually am using BN Classics' The Divine Comedy Translation (by Longfellow) for class rn. It is not a modern translation but we found in class that it is close to the original Italian. The endnotes and footnotes are essential for that translation.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Barnes and Noble Classics Editions: Good or Bad? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-01 02:37:25 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I have been reading the Barnes and Noble Classics Editions of different classics for my whole life. I started getting them as Christmas presents and now buy them because they are cheaper, have wonderful introductions, footnotes, and end notes. They also are aesthetically pleasing for the cover art is usually a beautiful painting. However, I have heard noticed while searching through "the best translation" discussions that a lot of the translations offered by the BN Classic Editions are either bad translations or are from centuries ago in which the text becomes more pretentious or clunky then it really is. Another thing I've noticed is the varying print sizes. This is weirdly important to me. I like normal to large size font which some of the editions offer while others have almost microscopic fonts. My final problem with the Editions Series as a whole is that they are inconsistent with author's work (probably because of copyright and publishing rights) or just do not have some wonderful authors. I'll continue buying them for the editions of English novels and stories but I'm wary for the translated texts. So what do you guys think about the BN Classics Editions?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Discussion: Short Books vs Long Books </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-30 03:54:11 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Over my reading career I have found that I have a preference for reading short books. But recently I have found myself reading longer books. There are perks to each. Short books are easier to read (and re-read) in terms of time spent, often pack a lot of emotion, plot development, etc in less pages, and feel better to finish more of them. However, longer books I feel are able to expand on themes, characters, etc, they also feel like a commitment, and also can pack a lot more in their pages by their lack of brevity. So what is subreddit community what do you think? What are your preferences and why? I'm looking forward to hearing the responses.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kinda agree with this. From the majority of White Noise I read, it seemed like DeLillo was trying to show how smart he is.  </TEXT>
