	<TEXT> Can you see the irony here? You are afraid of too many companies and too few, both at the same time. Do you think the government knows the right amount of companies to allow to dig up peoples property?

I think that's one of of the main responsibilities of a govt. I'm not saying that our govt currently has this under control but neither extreme is an ideal situation.

If a poor person can't afford to pay for it, then they will survive.Art is not an essential part of life. Can you walk me through what you think might happen if poor people didn't get free museums?

No art is not an essential part of life but it is a part of american culture and i just don't think we should be throwing that away. What will happen is art will eventually become a niche that only the rich can afford to view. 

I think you just want the things that you like and you're willing to enforce this with violence (i.e. government).

What violence? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if we eliminate government, we'll have solved that problem.

No we haven't. Who is going to stop companies from just going around tearing up streets laying fiber cables over eachother. You run into a lot more problems in the scenario.

Yes i can compare them. It's my life and you can't tell me what value to place on different things. If i like apples more than oranges, then it's not your place to tell me that I must value them equally.

What I'm saying is that they do not operate in the same way.

I know you are concerned about poor people visiting museums, but why aren't you concerned about them visiting NASCAR or disneyland? What makes looking at the mona lisa more important than going on a roller coaster?

Because the mona lisa is a part of history! Art has cultural impact. Disneyland while being entertaining has no cultural impact. If you could find a way to make a free disneyland id be all for it but it is not a priority because beyond a fun time there is nothing that disneyland can offer you. It is a For Profit business unlike museums which are not for profit and meant to be available to everyone no matter how much money you make.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not permitted by whom? Verizon, Time Warner or someone else?

The city. Laying fiber is a very difficult process so they made a contract with verizon to have verizon lay all fiber for NYC and have not permitted any other company to lay fiber since.

I'm not sure if you own any art, but is it fair that your art is locked away in your home? I want to see it just like you want to see the mona lisa.

That's the point of keeping museums open to make sure that everyone who wants to see it can!

I think you missed my point. People don't want museums, they want disneyland.

You cant compare a private business to a public company.

How about we at least take a vote, rather than you telling me what I should prioritize as important in my life? We agree ahead of time to respect the vote and we decide whether people would rather have free museum tickets or free disneyland tickets. I think you'll lose.

Ofc i would lose that vote! You're comparing a private entertainment company to a public museum. You're completely missing that point!

This whole discussion has turned into how you want me to pay for what you think is important. Sorry i hate museums, but if I have to pay for NASCAR or disneyland tickets, then you need to pay for museum tickets.

NASCAR and Disney are PRIVATE for profit businesses. You can't compare them to a public non profit museum. If Disney tickets were subsidized you'd be funneling money into the owners pockets. When museums are subsidized you're funneling money into keeping a building open. Those are VERY different things. </TEXT>

Why don't we get some of the people who actually work in these fields for a living look into what our issues are. As of right now all we have are corporate ceo's paying to make decisions. The corruption is blatant and if you want the same people to continue ruling then you're just giving into it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so would it be fair to say that you're not so much concerned about museums as you are with welfare for the poor? The rich can continue to pay for their museum experience.

No... I'm concerned about the museums staying around. Yes they are mostly populated by poorer Americans / children but there are still plenty of rich people who go. I just want them to be around and the culture of america to be accessible to anyone who wants to view it.

Monopolized how exactly?

I know particularly in NYC no other company is permitted to lay fiber cables. Laying fiber is a very difficult thing to do in a city since you have to rip up streets to get a lot of it underground. All fiber optic services in NYC are run through Verizon's cables. 

Are you concerned about having the Mona Lisa in private hands?

That would never happen but in a theoretical stance yes. I think it should be able to be seen by anyone instead of just locked up in some rich guys house.

Why not the same treatment for Disneyland?

Disney is a private company. They can do whatever they want and charge however much they want. This is about public services staying public not about what you personally value as more memorable. 

America = Disneyland, not an old painting.

This is a huge problem in America right now. We have come to relate our patriotism to companies and now aim to idolize them. This should not be the thought process of our future. </TEXT>

I don't know where you are seeing this. I have gone to many Art galleries and ive seen maybe 3 political pieces. Modern art has become more abstract then political. I do admit that i do see more libertarian artists than conservative artists but you cant blanket the entire community of artists as politically jaded leftists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Based on what evidence? I haven't visited a free museum in a long, long time. I have however visited several private museums and paid something like $20-$30 per person for tickets.

Mostly that free museums/libraries are often populated with lower income citizens who would not be able to spend $20-$30 on a day to a museum.

 I think you're forgetting that it was government that awarded these cable companies their monopolies.

Not really.... They made a deal with eachother to separate by counties. actually the govt recently stopped them from merging and becoming a true monopoly.

but given enough time there is nothing stopping them from expanding into each others current locations.

Actually Google fiber recently stopped expanding due to the cost of actually running fiber. In addition it will never spread to large cities as Verizon has monopolized Fiber in many areas.

You're calling government to force Time Warner to serve you chicken nuggets.

I'm not calling Govt to force anything. I clearly stated that i think they should stay out of businesses. 

Yes, absolutely. those are what anarchy is primarily focused on eliminating.

That would be chaos. Who do you call if you're getting robbed?

Yes, you're right I do assume that art is sold like cars. I have an art gallery in my local mall. You can walk in and spend a few thousand dollars to get a painting. I always wonder how they manage to stay afloat, since nobody is ever inside buying anything.

Art galleries in malls are very different then actual art galleries. Mall galleries are all for sale. Actual galleries are more for critiques and art enthusiasts.

Then they can charge $30 per person. Why do you insist on it being free?

I insist on it being free because its supposed to be a cultural experience that anyone should be able to see. I don't want a price point on it because i don't want the poor to be excluded from culture just because they are poor. There is no product to be sold here. This is not commerce. This is culture and I don't believe that you should be priced out of culture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whoa art is not politically based. Yeah sure sometimes art has a political theme but to jade the entire world of art as left leaning is absurd. Separation of art and state? What does that mean... Art has no bias.. how can you determine if something like the statue of liberty is left or right leaning? Not everything has to have a political stance. Plenty of the art community are republicans. I have never seen art in a way that is left or right leaning. Its supposed to be one persons view of the world. You don't need to stamp a political stance on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, of course. If someone is not willing to pay for something, then they don't really want it. I would like a trip to Japan for free, but I'm not willing to pay for it.

But you're not distinguishing luxury items from public knowledge. You can go without a trip to japan and it wont really effect your life. If you remove things like libraries and museums it will effect many peoples lives.

There are alternatives to cable internet, such as DSL, fiber, wireless and even dialup. What you're really saying is that you want an exact service delivered at an exact price and in an exact way.

Those are not the same product. When you switch to DSL, fiber, wireless your price goes up like 5x. Comcast and TWC have basically monopolized the industry. Without govt regulation whats to stop other companies from doing the same in different industries?

there was a crazy lady one time that called 911 to complain that McDonalds wouldn't serve her chicken nuggets. That is the equivalent of what you're doing here.

How is that what I'm doing? 

I apply this to everything.

So what about military? Police?

If this was 100 years ago, you'd be complaining that henry ford's new automobile would be destroying the buggy whip industry and insist that government should keep the buggy whip industry alive.

Not at all I'm 100% for a free market when it comes to businesses and products. If youre selling something for a profit the Govt should have not input on anything. No business should be kept artificially alive. That's where I make my distinction. Art is not the same. You seem to think that art galleries work in the same way that car shows do or boat shows but its not the same. Art is rarely sold and if it is the galleries make no profit. Galleries are much like libraries where people can go and view the current culture of America. They can go and study what is happening in the world of art. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The AHCA forces the insurance companies to cover everyone but allows them to provide nothing. If you look at the list of essential health benefits taken away this new bill is a shell of obamacare when it comes to basic plans. Also the money from the mandate under obamacare has been switched into a "newly insured" fee that is paid directly to the insurance companies. This bill basically funnels money into insurance companies pockets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when i say business, I don't mean todays corporate system

When you say business you imply for profit.

Absolutely! I can fire a large business, but I can't fire the government.

Go try to fire time warner cable or which ever cable provider monopolized your section of america. You have way more control over who is in your government then who is running the businesses.

 you said that private people fund the large galleries. Now you're saying the majority of people don't want to even pay a dime for them

Yes they are considered an educational resource just like a library.

If these types of culture can't spur anyones interest enough to support them, then they should die off.

Do you apply that for everything or do you just feel like that for "cultral" things? Is there anything you do believe everyone should pay for?

OK, so then offer copyrights to artists and the problem goes away.

How would you copyright art? You cant.... 

Yeah, just 90% is crap. So instead of the large galleries paying for it, taxpayers should. thereby increasing the profits of the large galleries.

Art galleries/museums rarely pull any profit. All donations are spent to keep the lights on and they rarely own any of the art pieces. Its supposed to be a Govt service into culture not a business for profit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah i know what Anarcho Capitalism is and i didn't come here expecting up votes. I usually end up in a lot of subs where my ideas are not so popular but i like to test my ideas against people who don't agree with me. You don't learn anything debating with someone who agrees with you on 90% of things.

Well the way to do it without putting a nuclear powered mafia in charge is to get scientists and free thinkers into the Govt scene. We need people who understand the problems of the world instead of people who just want to bomb everyone who disagrees with them. I hate the current military state of our Govt. I don't know where people got the idea that just because you were a good military leader means that you would be a good political leader.

	<TEXT>   Lets assume it dies, yet there are a bunch of people dying to pay to watch an NBA game. Well if that's true, then the business owners will find a way to remedy the lack of government schools teaching basketball to children.

So you'd rather have large business trying to interact with your child rather than them just learning through a govt funded program?

Well then the large galleries should charge more and feed that money back to the small galleries.

I think you have a big misunderstanding about how the art world works. Most art museums are free to enter. They are considered a public resource much like a library. Art museums often do not reach out to small galleries as the galleries contently move. They are often not a permanent location and they often rent out space to hold a function.

The difference is that only the people that like art will be paying for art. In the end the people that want art to survive apparently want the non-art lovers to subsidize it for them.

This makes no sense its culture not something to subsidize but something to keep alive.

Music is a form of art. If it works for one, then it works for them all.

Thats not true at all. Music has been cultivated by copyrights to make a profit. They also sell music under these copyrights. Imagine you had to pay to look at an image on google.

All the small gallery art you say we should be supporting is crap. That's why nobody wants to support it. All you're saying that the large galleries shouldn't be the ones paying for the crap, but instead the taxpayers should pay for crap.

Its not all crap! Small galleries are where most of the stuff from large art museums originates!

That's not how business works though. Businesses that produce crap risk only their own money, not taxpayer money.

Not everything is a business!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

	<TEXT> If it requires government and taxation to keep alive, then by definition it's not profitable. Profitable means that it stands on it's own without assistance.

I'm referring to how profitable the NBA is. College ball is also profitable. But without Elementary school / high school basketball (both not profitable) neither college nor nba would be a thing.

If I'm not willing to spend those dollars, then you're not going to appeal to my sense of emotion regarding it. So yes, the things that I am not willing to spend money on, I couldn't care less on.

This is exactly why we have the govt support it rather then citizens. Most people like large art museums and have no problem supporting them. But they do not realize that their large museums would not survive without small galleries...... so the govt supports the small galleries that keep the large museums alive.

You're separating parts of things when in reality those parts work together.

For example, I hate heavy metal music and i refuse to spend a second listening to it.

Music is a completely different culture than art. Music is 100% profit based. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So prior to government subsidies, how did big galleries find art? We should examine history to see how all the works of arts we see today in museums came about without government subsidies.

Sure if you want to delve into art history be my guest.

besides that, if the NBA can't survive without college basketball, then maybe that means that basketball should die off.

That's the problem with your thinking. You're willing to eliminate something that is extremely profitable and prosperous just because some of the steps below require funding. That's ridiculous.

How about the need for fighting small wars, is it the responsibility for government to fund periodic small wars or else we will get out of the habit of fighting large wars?

You cant compare wars to art or basketball come on.

If people don't step forward to support the small galleries, then the art community deserves to die off.

So you're willing to throw away part of the culture of America just because you don't want to spend a couple dollars? NOTHING in this world has ever started out prosperous. Everything takes investment of some form and if you are not willing to invest in something you will never profit from anything. </TEXT>
