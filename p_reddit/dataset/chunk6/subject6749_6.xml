	<TEXT> Yes, I made a small batch of caramel sauce and then added about a third to a batch of frosting. I put that in between the two cake layers and sort of just put about 1/2 and inch on top of the cake. Then I took a bunch more of the caramel and just poured it on top. Then just swirl away. I had a lot of the caramel left over so I'm not too sure how much I used for that. However swirly you want to make it I guess. Have fun!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I didn't think of that but total I believe it was 1 tablespoon vanilla, 1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon and maybe 1 cup of crushed walnuts. Add nutmeg in there too if you like. Or any other "typical" banana" bread additions. This cake is most defiantly on the super sweet side so don't go too crazy. </TEXT>

The cream cheese frosting was 4 cups cream cheese, 1 cup butter blended together with 3 cups powdered sugar. 
I mixed the caramel sauce in with a bit of the cream cheese mixture and then drizzled the rest on top then swirled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sort of was an accident as I didn't make enough cream cheese, but by doing a whipped topping as the outer layer it made this whole cake feel much lighter. Also cinnamon and honey in whipped cream is amazing. </TEXT>
