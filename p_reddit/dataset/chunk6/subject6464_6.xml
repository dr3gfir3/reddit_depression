	<TITLE> Recent Kitchen Nightmare Closures </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-01 02:57:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Speaking of Kitchen Nightmares, the show ended in 2014 when Chef Garden Ramsey called it quits. Currently, 72% of his restaurant closed.

The first resent restaurant to close down was Mojito in Brooklyn, New York. It closed last March. The Facebook post said that they are opening the new chapter and thanking their staff and patrons after 13 years in service. Looks like they don't want to continue the restaurant.

The second resent restaurant to close down was The Secret Garden in Moorpark, California. It also closed last March. It is possible that the restaurant closed due to declining customers and that he reverted back to the old menu after Ramsey left. Currently, he is suspected in working at Custom Pie in Moorpark.

The third recent restaurant that closed down was Nino's in Long Beach, California. This restaurant was a 54 years old restaurant when it was first introduced. The owner Nino just goes around tells every "My name is Nino!" It closed in August. The owners closed it in August due to the longing to retire than to pass it down.

The fourth recent restaurant that closed down was Barefoot Bob's in Hull, Massachusetts. The restaurant is busy during the Summer months while empty during the Winter months. Right after Ramsey left, the owners reverted back to the old styles. They closed in December possibly to poor reviews, piling debts, or wanting to close this chapter. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bernie Sanders vs. Saburo Kitajima </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-01 02:25:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Senator Bernie Sanders and singer-songwriter Saburo Kitajima are veteran characters of their respective careers. I appreciate these two for what they have contributed to society.

Bernie Sanders was from Brooklyn, New York born in 1941. I recently saw his hardships where he was part of the MLK civil rights march, which is unheard of. He represented the Liberty Union Party before becoming an independent, making him an underrated politician.

Saburo Kitjima was from Hokkaido, Japan born in 1936 before moving to Tokyo to start his singing career. He started his career at Nippon Columbia in 1962 before moving to Nippon Crown in 1963. In 1973 he started his music agency with 5 disciples, one of them being his son-in-law. Before his son and an Indian singer were disciples.

Sanders could have won if the DNC didn't cheat. If he won, we would expect his social programs implanted right away. He doesn't rule out running for 2020.

Kitajima retired from the New Year NHK Kohaku Gassen in 2013. In late August of last year, he fell down in the bathroom due to cervical spondylosis myelopathy. In November, he had a surgery. During his time in rehabilitation, he released two songs that he composed by himself and one being sang by himself and the other sang by one of his disciples. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Every year, we go out to have a fancy dinner every Chinese New Year Eve. We went to a restaurant in Flushing, Queens. By 6pm, getting there is slow due to heavy traffic.

My grandma makes the reservation. The reservation had to be done one month in advance. Originally we were a group of 11 but became a group of 6. When we entered, there were many waiting to be seated as they didn't have a reservation. 

We waited for a waiter to take our order. We wrote down a list items to be ordered beforehand. The first five order came right away, while the last three took a while to come out. When people who didn't have a reservation sat down. They waited a while for their food to come.

We also have a bad Chinese New Year Eve Dinner. Last year, we went to a restaurant in Elmhurst, Queens. The food took a while. We ended up having to cancel some of our orders. The waiters weren't serious in working. It turns out the owner whom my dad know had a stroke.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-27 02:59:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am unhappy with the Democrats. Some Senate Democrats have voted in favor of Trump's cabinet picks. This is why I can't trust them.

The Democrats are corporate Democrats, people who are backed by big donors. They believe what these companies believe in, not the people themselves. During the presidential run, I supported Hillary before supporting Sanders. Sanders gained support from the voters themselves.

In response of that, several alternative news networks like The Young Turks and Secular Talk created an anti-establish, populist third party called Justice Democrats, which is backed by Sanders supporters. In these three days, it became a real success. They have 90,000 supporters and have 90,000 candidates to be their party leaders. In my social media accounts, I added "Hail Sanders" and "Sanders Banzai()" in protest to the Trump presidency.

I nominated two candidates, one who is from Queens, NY and a progressive from Bethany, CN. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During Bush's tenure, we have seen 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, The Great Recession, the decay of civil rights, and the erosion of civil liberty.

We all felt that Bush was the worst president of all time due to his incompetence, corruption, and hubris. In the 2000 election, Bush won the electoral college, while losing the popular vote.. In the 2004 election, Kerry felt that Bush rigged the election.

In 2016, we saw Trump winning in a landslide. His rhetoric is more aggressive than Bush. His cabinet will be worst than Bush. We will see Trump's corruption, incompetence, and hubris. His policies will get dangerous worst than Bush.

If Trump wins 2020, the stock market bubble will burst and will blame others for the crash. He will implode and do more damage that previously thought. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Skipping the Inauguration in Protest </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-21 00:12:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I didn't turn on the tv for the day. I chose to synthesize with the representatives who will not attend the inauguration.

I am unhappy with what will be our new future in the next 4 years. I am seeing from a psychic that Trump may not get a second term, but the next president after him will be a hard-line conservative. By then, our states will ignore the Capitol and act autonomically when the cuts gets passed. Looks like Trump is more of a libertarian, more to the right than the GOP.

I am unhappy with Sanders attending the inauguration, but his jacket was appropriate for the occasion. I favor him over Clinton after Trump winning the election. I see that he is still popular among his supporters. He could have won if Hillary and the DNC didn't rig the primaries.

I have heard that if Trump get impeached or resign, Pence will replace him, which the GOP favors more. If he get assassinated, Pence will replace him and there will be a civil war.

Trump reminds Italians of Berlusconi. Berlusconi, like Trump, was a populist. They have conflicts of interest, scandals, and are unfavorable. We will likely see the same things all over again. I have seen YouTube videos of Berlusconi as a laughingstock. He has antagonizes others, i.e. calling Obama "suntanned", so have Trump during the presidential campaign.

Now that the mayoral election is this November, if Hillary runs, I will vote for her. She can deal with Trump better than de Blasio. If she wins, Trump will be walking on eggshells. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trump's Approval Rating </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As we all know, Trump's inauguration will be tomorrow. His approval rating is significantly lower than previous presidents.

During the presidential campaign, we see that Trump is running as a populist. He won the election, as Hillary was incompetent and Trump was like Sanders. However, now that he is adding alligators into the swamp, his approval rating dropped.

We will likely see our social and environment programs in the crossroads. This is when people will be outraged and local governments will divert tax money to create their own social programs. The states will run autonomically, not giving tax money to the federal government.

Trump is like the four horseman, where he have personal corruption (i.e. taking campaign money to put his sons into private schools), systemic corruption (i.e. having alligators in the swamp), incompetence (i.e. his father bailing him out), and hubris (i.e. claiming that shooting someone on 5th street will not losing supporters).

With this in mind, Trump's approval rating will plummet to 25% or less eventually. The Democrats and some moderate Republicans can use this to fight fire with fire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are at least 50 representatives who said they will not be in the inauguration. I myself will not watch on the day.

Trump isn't a popular president due to his conflicts of interest and his cabinet picks. This will threaten the supporters and national security. If a major attack happens due to Trump's neglect of security briefing, freedom can be compromised, but affect the red states, as the blue states are practicing autonomy from the union.

Trump can be easily be impeached. He is likely to be replace by Pence, whom the GOP favors. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Ideas of an Adult-themed Anpanman </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-18 04:23:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You may know who Anpanman is. If you didn't know, Anpanman is a bread-headed superhero who help others by giving a part of his head to them. However, this journal entry will be about this adult spin-off of this kid show.

Anpanman will be an anti-hero, who will have side jobs where he will spill blood that includes, but not limited to the executioner, hitman, assassin, and killer.


This spin-off will be called Anpanman and Friends(). Each episode doesn't have to center on the titular character Anpanman. In the possible Adult Swim dub, each episode will only have one word, even if the word is general.

The episodes are usually parodies of existing series or left-sided views of controversial topics, like abortion and political incorrectness. The show has various settings and possibly using the settings as a world battleground.

The first episode will be called "Honor." The first episode has contents of an honor killing. Mija's parents arranged her to stay with a boyfriend they found for her. After Mija found out, she then secretly has a lesbian relationship with a friend. Later Mija rejects the boyfriend. Her parents threaten her that if she rejects the next boyfriend she will die. Mija runs to her lesbian girlfriend. For the next few days, she stays at the lesbian girlfriend's place. Sensing something was suspicious, her parents hire Anpanman to spy on her. After knowing that Mija has a lesbian girlfriend, Anpanman informs Mija's parents about it. They ordered Anpanman to kill her. Later, she receives a message telling her to arrive at an alley. When Mija arrives at the alley, Shokupan and Currypanman grabs her arms. Anpanman kills her with a chainsaw.

The spin-off would include violence. In one episode, there is a setting in the show where two potential candidates to be president are selected. In this elections, whoever is able to kill 100 people first wins (WWII reference). The winner, who felt that the contest wasn't enough, goes on a killing spree, killing those who just committed a crime.

Sometimes, some episodes would use characters from other shows as guests. In one episode, Phineas will become a yakuza boss and ends up dying to the hands of Pyon-kichi, an anthropomorphic rabbit. Kabao, an anthropomorphic hippo, shoots Phineas during the turf war.

The shows will parody pop culture. In one episode, Anpanman is with Niyandar Kamen and Yanase Bunny, where they spoof Mito-komon(). Yanase Bunny takes the name of Otsu Kunimitsu() or Tosa-komon(), Anpanman takes the name of Oshima Saburobei(), and Niyandar Kamen takes the name of Ohama Saburoemon(). They suspect a highway magistrate operating an illegal whorehouse where kidnapped girls used as sex slaves. Saburobei pays for the tayu as to understand the working conditions of the whorehouse. In the end, the trio confronts the magistrate with a censor.

In another episode, Melonpanna gets neglected by her sister Rollpanna. She later seduces Ferb to seek love, which eventually cause Ferb to get a boner. Melonpanna pulls down her pants and starts rubbing her buttcracks on Ferb's boner. Rollpanna then caught Melonpanna in the act. Later that night, the Panna sisters lay on top of each other in a 69 style, licking each other's butt cracks (Rocko's Modern Life reference).

Margaret Smith comes to town to create the first news network. However, in one scene, Anpanman is peeping at Margaret in a shower with Creampanda scrubbing her boobs with a sponge (Ren and Stimpy Adult Party Cartoon reference).

The Pines twins arrive via a portal. During their time in the town, many misadventures happen. They include, but not limited to Horrorman fondling with Mabel, Cheese licking Dipper's ass in the night, Creampanda constantly screaming after seeing Anpanman and Mabel licking each other's asses in a 69 position (Family Guy reference), the dolphin Beso spewing cum on Dipper's ass, and Burger Kid's horse acting horny when he approaches Mabel on the beach.

Anpanman and his gang go to the Land of Ooo for vacation. In one scene, Fionna is see licking Mimi-sensei on her neck, with Mimi-sensei's students watching Fionna sexually stimulating Mimi-sensei. 

There will be an episode called "Elwood," where Anpanman and his gang goes to Arthur's hometown. One misadventure that will happen is when Baikinman imitating fellatio with Kate with a dildo and Arthur giving self-head.

Anpanman will have a homosexual relation with Niyandar Kamen. In one episode, Anpanman and Niyandar Kamen splash soapy water onto Baikinman, causing Baikinman to shrink, and insert him into Niyandar Kamen's anus. Inside the anus, Baikinman see's various items inside it.

The spin-off will include blasphemy. In one episode, Baikinman says "bismillah." Later that night, Allah appears and beats the shit out of him. Other characters start to have the same situation. In another episode, Shiva, the Hindu god of destruction, manifests in Godzilla form, destroying anything in its path. After every attempt to destroy the Godzilla Shiva fails, Anpanman asks God to sent out a death ray to destroy the Godzilla Shiva.

Whenever Anpanman is ordered to execute, he is paid by the cruelty of the methods he uses. In on instance, he uses a chainsaw to execute. An another instance, he throws an inmate into a helicopter's choppers. In a third instance, he uses a new sword to test on an inmate. In one case, he executes an innocent inmate. Later than night, he had a nightmare where he is escorted by the demonic Momotaro and Kintaro to Enma, the God of Death. He was forbidden to eat meat for seven days as punishment. After this, there is a priest at every execution to purify the inmate's souls.

The spin-off would have to air on YouTube or Hulu depending on the terms of use as the spin-off would's be suitable for TV. A typical season is from October 4 to August 1. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Ideas of an Adult-themed Niyandar Kamen </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-18 04:12:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mighty Cat Masked Niyandarn() is a kid show that aired on February 6, 2000, to September 30, 2001. The original creator is the late Anpanman creator Takashi Yanase. The show is about the anthropomorphic cat superhero Niyandar Kamen in Cat Town.

In this revival, three characters will get killed by the superhero: Jabu-jabu, the cleaner, Sarakichi, the kappa, and Demonga, the flying squirrel ninja.

Jabu-jabu gets a nightmare where the superhero beats the crap out of him with an oar (Ren and Stimpy reference) for sleeping with his sister Miko. After the nightmare, Jabu-jabu goes on a psychotic fit and goes on a killing spree. When he is about to kill Miko, Niyandar Kamen arrives duels him. For the last blow, Niyandar Kamen leaps into the sky and slices the cleaner in half from head to toe and splits in half.

Demonga steals Niyandar's magical sword and goes around the town killing random pedestrians, preferably schoolgirls (Abarenbo Shogun The Unruly Shogun reference). Niyandar's immortal mentor warned him that if he does not retrieve the sword within a week, he will stop to exist. Niyandar then seeks help from Anpanman. After catching up with the ninja, Niyandar slits his throat and inserts a C4 before Anpanman detonating the bomb, where Demonga's body blown up in half from the explosion, with blood splashing everywhere, even on Anpanman and Niyandar Kamen's bodies. Anpanman receives the sword. The mentor appears and congratulates Niyandar.

Sarakichi goes to town and molests girls in the night. When the kappa seen by Miko splashing cum on to her, she summons the superhero, where the superhero beats the crap out of the kappa with his hard katana sheath before beheading the kappa. Niyandar takes the head and drops it at Ginko's head.

Three characters I would add to replace the three Niyandar Kamen killed would be an adopted child who has down syndrome whose biological mother gave birth to her after she got raped by her brother, a BBW, and the mayor.

The mayor is authoritative social liberal, who have Sander-like policies and conducts Stalin-line executions. The laws enacted in the town are lax, where he legalizes incest, bestiality, necrophilia, drug use, prostitution, and murder. He believes that sex crime are legal is a condom is used. Murder needs to have a eyewitness to be justifiable. In the mayor's office, there is an execution room, where conservatives are to be executed. After Niyandar Kamen helps the mayor behead 100 dissidents with his katana, he became the mayor's minion.

The mentor in one episode gives Niyandar the ability to detach his head from his shoulder at will. I have seen images of Anpanman without his head.

In a movie, several of his rivals wants to be the next mayor. He uses Niyandar Kamen as a hitman. When these deaths were noticeable, two constables were asked to find a killer. After confronting the mayor, Niyandar Kamen arrives in time to justify his motives. They later found out that the rivals create a nationalistic party and Niyandar Kamen needs to dissolve the party to prevent fascism.

The superhero Niyandar Kamen will be seen having a homosexual relationship with Anpanman. There will be a running gag where when Niyandar Kamen is with Anpanman, they act gay. In the first episode, Anpanman arrives in town. After he meets Niyandar Kamen after he summoned, they went to Niyandar Kamen's house. In the house, they were engaging in homosexual acts, i.e. kissing each other.

Nyago, Niyandar Kamen's alter ego, will become a sword tester, testing the sharpness of other people's sword by using them on unwanted children. In one episode, a police comptroller received a new sword and used it to kill a peddler, nicking it in the process (another Abarenbo Shogun The Unruly Shogun reference). The comptroller hired a polisher to polish the sword, who later saw the nick. Nyago got instructed by the comptroller to chop an unwanted baby in half to test the sword, which broke in the process. The comptroller kills the polisher. Niyandar helped the polisher's child to seek vengeance by having the child kill the comptroller with the broken sword.

Nyago is a student at the town's elementary school. His teacher will get a boob job, which will cause Nyago to get wet dreams from looking them. The teacher later uses her breasts to behead three robbers with her breast milk.

The first wet dream Nyago will have is where he is a peeping tom, peeping at his teacher zipping her dress, where her boobs slip out. The second wet dream Nyago will have is after seeing her teacher's boob bounce, he gets bounded on a bed and her teacher slaps his face with her boobs. The third wet dream Nyago will have is where he is a toddler in Gumball's clothing weeping. After his teacher appears, the teacher holds him and breastfeeds him.

In the original version, Nyago's mom is an off-screen character which his father is absent. In the revival, his mom is a hermaphrodite and his dad is a womanizer. His mom was born with a penis and two scrotums. After they became useless, Nyago cuts them off with a garden shear. Dad is a principal of Nyago's school. He once had a sexual relationship with Nyago's teacher.

Nyago has three friends, Nyako, Kyacchin, and Nyanta. Kyacchin is a child prodigy who can make sake in his house and can give abortions with a bayonet attached to a rifle (WWII reference).

After Sarakichi gets killed and Ginko, his friend, receives his severed head, she becomes a streetwalker. In one episode, she gets whored by Mordecai the blue jay. After CJ caught Mordecai whoring Ginko, she damages Nyago's house in a fit of rage.

Niyandar Kamen will own swords, which will be seen in Nyago's bedroom. The reason the superhero process a katana and wakizashi set is that I want to pay homage to jidaigeki samurai dramas.

In one episode, Rick and Morty end up here. Morty ends up being a pervert and eventually inserts his detached eye into Miko's anus to record her digestive system. The eye comes out the Miko's mouth the morning Rick and Morty are about to leave.

Dipper and Pines arrive here via a portal and various misadventures happen. In one episode, Miko gets kidnapped by the skeleton king so he can insert his pelvis bone into Mabel's anus. In another episode, Nyago caught Dipper pelvic thrusting on top of Miko.

In a special episode, Nyaon, a blue mountain cat, will be a caricature of Jirocho of Shimizu(), a famous yakuza boss, which Niyandar will be a caricature of Katsuzo of Kurokoma(), a rival of Jirocho. In the special, Nyaon will go by the name of Magopachi of Odawara(), which Niyandar will go by the name of Denji of Machida(). In the episode, Jiropachi ends up killing Denji in the turf war.

In another episode, Gumball hacks into Nyago's computer and recorded him masturbating in his nap. After the video got uploaded, Niyandar Kamen asks Kyacchin to find the uploader of the video. Later, Niyandar arrives at Elmore through a portal. When he caught Gumball hacking into Miko's computer and recording her undressing, Niyandar Kamen knocks Gumball unconscious with his hard katana sheath.

In a possible episode, the Berenstein Bears comes to town for vacations. However, during the vacations, Sister Bear goes into labor and have a baby with facial appearances similar to Brother Bear, which is later viewed that Brother Bear inseminated Sister Bear artificially. Brother Bear treats the newborn as an another sister and eventually kills Honey Bear by inserting Niyandar Kamen's katana up Honey Bear's anus.

In a possible movie, the events take place in New Cat City(parody of New York City).

Nyago was in a vacation when a family friend's spouse is suffering from tuberculosis. The doctor told the friend that to heal her fully, he has to do favors. Nyago later saw dead people on the streets and people committing suicide from taking loanshark-rate loans, which he suspects to be the family friend. Knowing that such actions are unforgivable, he transforms into Niyandar and slay the family friend and the doctor and healed the spouse. The immortal berated him for spilling blood.

The show would have to air on YouTube or Hulu depending on their Terms of Use as the show would not be suitable on TV. A season will be from February 22 until December 31. </TEXT>
