	<TEXT> Although your post was removed, I will answer your more pointed questions, lest you think I lack a response.

Where did I get that?  Years of professional HR experience.  I have seen countless employees shafted because they were operating from the premise that HR was on their side.

Grave repercussions such as what?  For example, if an employee isn't aware that HR is there to benefit the organization and not them individually, then they also wouldn't know that their internal EEO/fair practices office could possibly have a motivation to bury employee grievances and allegations of discrimination by intimidating, coercing, and threatening them...and that for this reason, should they make such a report, they should also *always* make a report to the external government body that oversees such matters.

One organization that I used to work for had an established practice of encouraging employees to come forward with grievances so that they could target those employees for termination on other grounds.  It was entrenched retaliatory activity as a systemic process, and it's lamentably common.  Colleagues of mine in similar departments have strikingly similar stories.  This is just one tiny example.  Other ways that employees get screwed involve benefits accrual, time and attendance, seniority calculations, use of FMLA, and on and on.

There is no nuance required whatsoever in order to correctly assert that HR departments -- as I said, from an organizational structure perspective -- exists to benefit and protect the organization, not the individual employee. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whew. For someone promoting the use of nuance and critical thinking, you sure were quick to erect that strawman.  No one here or anywhere else I have seen has said that "all HR and org. are bad and do not care about you."

What I *have* seen, though, is people reminding others that from a organizational structure standpoint, HR is there to help the company, not to help the individual employee.  That's flat-out true, and forgetting that detail can have grave repercussions.  Even though there are plenty of good people working in HR, it's simply naive not to understand what their objective is and the fact that their job is about protecting the organization, not the employee. That has nothing at all to do with nuance, critical thinking, or confirmation bias...just reality. </TEXT>

Imagine microwave popcorn, but with pork-y goodness the texture of hot rice krispies. They snap, crackle, and pop on your tongue as you eat them and are inexplicably not-greasy as they melt away into nothingness.

If that wasn't enough, then I had the brilliant idea to shake some Old Bay seasoning into the bag and shake it up to coat the pork rinds.  Oh. my. gawd. </TEXT>

But I would argue that if you consistently are awful to the people who are close to you--the very people you are supposed to love most--after a certain point, that speaks to your "goodness" as well as your "niceness."  Genuinely good people don't have a pattern and practice of treating the people they are supposed to love and respect like shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not gracious to petulantly refuse to accept the award in the first place, thereby drawing more "unwanted" attention to himself than he would have received had he just done it when they invited him initially.

And while "impossible to love" may be different from "not a good person" (because that's what I was arguing -- not that he is a *bad* person), it's really *not* too different if the reason people who have had intimate relationships with you feel that way is that you treated them cruelly.  Consistently disregarding the feelings of the people in one's life who are supposed to be important to you is absolutely one piece of evidence that someone is not a *good* person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not just talking about him being an edgy late adolescent during his early career.

I don't think anyone can make a serious argument that the common perception of him being a dick is related to his decision to plug in at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965.  Sure, many of his original fans were furious and felt utterly "betrayed" (their words) by that decision, but that has no connection to his reputation for being prickly, demanding, mercurial, and caustic on a one-on-one basis -- which is what his reputation *really* is.

Even people like Joan Baez, who have defended him and justified his behavior, have said that he is the sort of person who is impossible to love from up close -- at least for long.

This isn't about his exchange with his audience or some gadfly journalists 45 years ago.  This is about how many, many people who have known and worked with him intimately over the years seem to have a striking consensus about how a level of intimacy with Dylan eventually makes one feel.

Also, he's not young anymore.  If he weren't kind of a dick, he probably would have matured enough by now (age 75) to gracefully accept a truly prestigious honor. </TEXT>

Listen, if I had *any reason* to believe Bob Dylan was a just a good guy--a real mensch--I'd hop on that hero-worship train in a heartbeat.  I don't *want* to think ill of him.

	<TEXT> That's an interesting question, and I guess I would say maybe it comes down to how you differentiate between the definitions of "good" versus "great.  For the record, I'm not *necessarily* suggesting that *I* am either one.  Dylan has, indeed, done some not insubstantial philanthropy. In addition to all of his work during the civil rights and anti-Vietnam War eras of the '60s and '70s, [looktothestars.org reports that the supports Amnesty International, City of Hope, End Hunger Network, Feeding America, K9 Connection, and Music Rising.](https://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/bob-dylan)

I'm not attempting in any way to minimize how important any of that is.  It's just not what I meant when I said "good."  To me, good has a lot to do with how you treat people one-on-one.  It's certainly not the *only* measure, but is a person really good if everyone they interact with feels like shit afterwards?

  You can be a good person and still a condescending dick.

I'm not sure if I agree with that, is what I'm saying.

Bob Dylan is my personal example of "never meet your heroes."  I consider him to be one of the most important American artists; a truly outstanding talent who is properly regarded as belonging to a class above all but the most select few.

But everything I've ever read, heard, or seen about him on an interpersonal level says he's also a perfect example of how those people we consider "great" are very rarely "good." </TEXT>

I, for one, am not willing to let them off the hook like that.

It takes the cognitive ability of a preschooler to understand that there are some things we don't say to people because they are rude, unacceptable, and make other people feel terrible.

If a grown-ass adult is *literally* too dumb to know any better, then he is so developmentally delayed that he also shouldn't be able to feed/bathe/dress/toilet himself, and I don't think that's what's going on here.

I will grant you that many, many men are raised to believe that the behavior *is* "just being a man," but with exposure to the appropriate carrots and/or sticks, the vast majority are capable of learning and acting differently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're most welcome.

And as a lifelong MD resident and former MVA employee, I see your point about differences between the states from both sides.  

People complain a *lot* about vehicle taxes and inspection regulations in Maryland.  OTOH, the difference between the overall condition of PA and MD roadways is *striking* when crossing the Mason-Dixon, especially in western counties.  Personally, I am awfully glad to get home to non-pothole-rutted roads and I'm willing to pay my share of what that costs.  With regard to inspection, our checklist is nit-picky and much more comprehensive than many states -- but many states make you do an annual inspection, and MD only requires it when the vehicle changes ownership.  So, that part balances out easily, I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former long-time MVA employee here.

In general, the state is extremely strict about enforcing the 60-day rule, but in certain cases, if you can establish that you *attempted* to comply with the requirement but were unable to for reasons beyond your control, then you can be granted a waiver of the excise tax.

I don't think you are eligible, however.  Here's your problem, based on what I understand from your narrative:

Once your lien holder sent the title to the MVA, what you were "supposed" to do was immediately title the vehicle in MD and spend an extra $20 (in addition to the title fees and taxes) to put a temporary (30-day) tag on the vehicle that would have allowed you time to make the repairs it needed to pass inspection.

Instead, you kept it registered in PA, which is exactly what the MVA is trying to discourage you from doing.  So unless I'm misunderstanding the time frame/order in which this all occurred, I think you are, unfortunately, out of luck.

EDIT: Because I failed to answer this part of your question:  Your PA lease is **meaningless** to the MVA.  They know you have been here since *at least* the date your title arrived from the lien holder.  They may have proof that you've been here since before that, depending on when you first converted your driver's license or what service dates are shown on the utility bills you likely presented as proof of residence. </TEXT>

Thank you.  The way people dehumanize and demonize people with BPD makes me so sad.

I completely understand making the choice to set whatever boundaries/limits one feels are appropriate/healthy, even if that means ending a relationship because a person doesn't feel equipped to deal with the manifestation of a condition's symptoms within one's partner.  And I get that it can be daunting to think about living with someone who has an "incurable" illness.  But what I don't get is why people seem to have a tendency to single out and scapegoat people with BPD, when the reality is that *all* personality disorders are notoriously difficult to treat and have symptom clusters that can be very difficult for other people to constantly deal with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've worked in customer service in some capacity for over 20 years. People are entitled, irrational assholes and I've known people who pull off this exact scheme.  So on that front, I agree with you.

But my experience with the overall quality of their products is different from yours, I think.  You're right, the boots are still top notch.  But as I mentioned elsewhere, it's not just the clothing that's gone noticeably downhill.  For example, my backpack of theirs that I purchased in the '80s is still in near-perfect condition despite decades of heavy use, while the one I purchased for my son in the early '00s has fallen apart -- twice.

As I said, their quality is still better than the majority of their competitors, and I still have a lingering fondness for the brand --but it *isn't* what it used to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As others have mentioned, there is no definitively effective treatment for BPD.  For this reason, it tends to be among those diagnoses that make it most difficult to sustain intimate relationships with an individual.

However, if you are committed to the idea of making the relationship work, there are a number of resources that may be helpful to you.  One my therapist suggested to me when my ex and I were still together is a book called, *I Hate You--Don't Leave Me: Understanding the Borderline Personality* by Jerold Kreisman.  Another was *Stop Walking on Eggshells: Taking Your Life Back When Someone You Care About Has Borderline Personality Disorder* by Paul Mason and Randi Kreger.

IIRC, both of these books explore the strategies that /u/BadKarmaKitty lists in her (?) comment and give practical, as well as theoretical advice.  It's been awhile, so I have to admit that I don't remember the specifics in terms of comparing one to the other very well, but I *do* have a strong recollection of feeling like both of these titles were helpful to me. </TEXT>

Elizabeth Wurtzel's ability to so accurately put into words what I have felt and experienced (as a woman with depression of nearly exactly the same age and cultural upbringing) has been one of the most important factors in my perseverance in my own struggles against depression and anxiety.  Reading her books allowed me to know with certainty that I am not alone in this world; there have been nights when that knowledge saved my life.

OP, if you should happen to see this comment, I have one favor to ask of you.  Please read her book, *Bitch! In Praise of Difficult Women*.  While Prozac Nation resonated with me, *Bitch!* felt like Wurtzel had invaded my brain, siphoned my life story out of it, and told it back to me more beautifully, eloquently, and compassionately than I ever could have. 

If *Prozac Nation* was worthwhile to you, I urge you to grab a copy of *Bitch!*.  It's in the top 5 most influential books of my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is so, so much to thank you for in this post.  But more than anything, even more than standing up for women who choose to terminate their pregnancies, **thank you for being courageous enough to admit that motherhood, especially if you don't desperately want it, isn't all about fulfillment, reward, and nurturing, instinctive maternal warm fuzziness and rainbow-colored unicorns shitting glitter.**

In modern western culture, especially in the U.S., admitting to any emotions toward motherhood other than adoration, reverence, and deep gratitude is to reveal oneself as fundamentally flawed.  If one should -- heaven forbid!-- be deemed a "bad mother," it is tantamount to a formal adjudication that one has failed as a woman.

Thank you so much for being willing to speak honestly about this, because it has been my experience, unfortunately, that women are harshest with one another in terms of enforcing what's considered to be acceptable attitude and speech about the experience of motherhood.  It's one reason why so many women suffer needlessly with post-partum depression and even psychosis; they are reluctant to talk about how much they are struggling (either consciously or unconsciously) because of the stigma associated with not being 100% thrilled to be a mom 100% of the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not enough of an expert to help with identification based on a photo, but if what you have in your backyard in WV is a mature tree, especially if it bears fruit, it is almost certainly not American Chestnut (Castanea dentata), but another species.

You can check out the [American Chestnut Foundation (ACF)](https://www.acf.org/) for more info on identification.

	<TEXT> I didn't read the book, but I'm vaguely familiar with it.

The blight was introduced to the U.S. in 1904 and by the mid-'40s had nearly eradicated the American Chestnut in Appalachia.  Am I correct that the focus of *Hillbilly Elegy* is a far more current one?  I don't know how much regional history the book explored, but perhaps the issue of the chestnut's destruction was overlooked as a distant historical footnote? </TEXT>

No, actually.  I've taken basic macro and micro, but my official program is interdisciplinary social science, with concentrations in political science and geography. My understanding of this topic, however, came primarily from the sociology course: "Sociology of Appalachia."

At the risk of angering the reddit STEM-master race hordes, I'll mention that I learned all of this from a "useless" sociology course I took last year.

You seem to know more about forestry practices (and maybe the timeline of best practices in the industry?) than I do, so correct me if I'm wrong, but my impression was that, at the time, no one had the necessary information to stop or even slow what was happening.  Are the selective cutting and replanting techniques you're talking about something that would have been known to enough people at the turn of the 20th century in order to make use of them?

If so, that's even more tragic. </TEXT>

The loss of coal industry (and other manufacturing) jobs in the region also had an enormous effect, but the chestnut blight was introduced in 1904, well before those jobs were the true engine of the regional economy, let alone before they disappeared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a interesting point.

Of course an issue this big is always multifaceted, so yes, unsustainable harvesting practices certainly contributed to the devastation we've seen.  However, in *Appalachia* specifically, the reliance of virtually the entire population, in one way or another, on this single American Chestnut species, cannot be overstated.

When the blight arrived and the heart of the region's economy disappeared within 30-40 years, that had an impact that was much more severe than the impact of logging practices had been up until that point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trees are functionally extinct.  Saplings can be bred, but the blight is a canker that affects them *almost* universally and prevents them from growing to maturity.  As u/WaxyWingie mentioned, there is ongoing research in controlled environments at some universities, but none have had any widespread success in raising saplings to adulthood.

Check out the links in my reply to /u/wigg1es, but here's a little more from the Missouri Botanical Garden:


 The significance of chestnut blight is tied to the species it decimated- the American chestnut, Castanea dentata.

 Other species that are highly susceptible to chestnut blight are the Allegheny chestnut (C. pumila), the bush chinkapin chestnut (C. alnifolia) and the European chestnut (C. sativa). The last species, Castanea sativa, is not native to the U.S. and is restricted here. Some oaks are host to the disease; these include live, post, scarlet and white oaks. It is also occasionally found on shagbark hickory, red maple and staghorn sumac.

 Chinese and Japanese chestnuts have shown some resistance to chestnut blight; for these Cryphonectria parasitica is a stress pathogen only. No other species of chestnut, however, has the characteristics necessary to replace the American chestnut as a forest tree or as an ornamental. The European chestnut, Castanea sativa, does share some of these characteristics, but it is also susceptible to chestnut blight and its importation into this country is restricted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The blight that obliterated the American Chestnut is one of the most important, yet overlooked, factors in the deterioration of the Appalachian economy and the persistence of poverty in the region.

Prior to the fungus taking hold, the American Chestnut was central to the region's economy, its wood and nuts both being highly prized.  The eradication of the species abruptly severed one of the few tenuous lifelines Appalachia had to the larger national economy, further isolating it and driving up poverty rates among its people.

This is one of the saddest unknown stories of American history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prince William County, VA is the outer suburbs of Washington, DC.  Being a DC native, I'm pleasantly, yet extremely, surprised that his constituency in that area seems to be appropriately appalled by his use of the word, and recognize its implications.

The article mentions that PWC is one of Virginia's most diverse counties, but it doesn't mention that this is a fairly recent phenomenon, and one that is due in **large** part to an influx of Latino immigrant families into the community.  Not so many years ago, it was a far more White, blue-collar, homogeneous county.  The rapid demographic changes have brought with them (as they tend to do) a great deal of tension between the longer-term residents who tend to be older and white, and the primarily nonwhite newcomers.  The anti-immigrant sentiment that Stewart was playing to in using the word in question is quite strong among Republicans/conservatives in that county, so it's really interesting how much backlash he appears to be getting. </TEXT>
