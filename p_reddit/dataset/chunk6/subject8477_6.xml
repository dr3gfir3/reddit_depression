Enjoy your movie :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Where in the universe are we? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm curious to know if it is at all possible to determine our location in the universe. I'm expecting a resounding "No", but if that's the case, do we have any idea how large our universe is? Is science familiar with anything regarding its size and shape? So many question come to mind after typing that. I will end here and await a response. Thank you in advance for taking the time to answer. Whoever you are. :) </TEXT>
