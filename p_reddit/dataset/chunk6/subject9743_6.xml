	<TITLE> Got accepted to transfer to the Storrs campus this fall. Should I look into housing or live at home? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The deadline to apply for housing is May 17th, so I need to decide pretty soon. I'm pretty torn about it. I would love the independence that living away from home would give me, but the cost is putting me off. Is the cost worth it or should I just commute to save money? Also, I'm hoping to study abroad ASAP so I would only live on campus for 1-2 semesters max.
Thanks!

EDIT: many people are saying my social experiences will be limited by my father's schedule. I have my own means of transportation, and I would be able to drive myself there and back on days where I am attending social things. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for a good quality camera, but light weight and durable for hiking. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> *sorry if this has been covered, but I couldn't find it in the searches*

My father and my sister are going on a month long hiking trip in Yosemite. My father doesn't have a camera so he always borrows mine when he goes on hiking trips. His birthday is later this month, so I'm hoping to get him a camera for his trip. He is a bit technologically impaired, but my sister will be there to help him out. It doesn't have to be too expensive, I'm just looking for something that will get decent quality and had some durability to it. Also, good battery life is a plus. They have their packs carefully planned so it shouldn't weigh too much.

If anybody has any suggestions about the cameras they use on a hike I'd love to hear! Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking at past posts you seem to be going through some problems with your ex involving your daughter. She hasn't met him, and according to that post you don't ever want her to. I'm in no place to say that you should or should not let him into her life because that's a whole different story, but if you go now she will likely go to him. If he is as bad as you said in that post, why would you submit her to that? 

You're a mother now, you share your life with your little girl. Everything is not for yourself anymore, it's for her. Sometimes it hurts to keep going, but it'll be worth it because it's for her. You'll get to see her smile, you'll get to see her grow. Sure, you'll piss each other off and get into fights but she's your little girl and she needs to know you love her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Volcanoes. I live in an area where there are no volcanoes, at all. Nothing even resembling one, but every hill I saw was a volcano to me.

It started in Kindergarten when my teacher showed a video about them. All I can remember is a vague story about a tribe on an island in Hawai'i who got the shit burned out of them by lava. I couldn't stand the color red after that. My dad had fun with it, though. I would always ask if a hill or tiny mountain was a volcano and he'd say it was and watch me cry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not me, but my sister. 

When we were kids we shared a bunk bed, she slept on the top bunk and I slept on the bottom. One night I hear a loud thud and find my sister on the floor, still asleep. She had rolled over the barrier and on to the floor, about a 6 foot drop. The sound was loud enough to wake me up and send my mother running to our room. She was fine and didn't even realize what had happened.

As for me, I once went to a Bare Naked Ladies concert and I had seats maybe 20 rows from the front. I had a migraine so I fell asleep while the opener was playing and slept through the rest of the show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never understood why people are so terrified by him. Yes, he's eccentric and a little odd but he seems to genuinely want to help you. He teaches you the song of healing and frees you from you Deku form. Yes, he did have ulterior motives to get the mask back but it was because they had fallen into the wrong hands. If he wanted to take over the world with Majora's power, he would have done so long before Skull Kid ever robbed him. But that's just what I think.

	<TEXT> Idk OP's curvature, but usually if it's 25 degrees you should do occasional check ups and x-rays. 25-40 degrees you may need a brace. Anything more than 40 degrees and surgery is an option. Since you're over 30 and you've already stopped growing your spine likely won't worsen unless you have a curved spine 40 degrees or above. 

I'm around 27 degrees, and I stopped growing at 15 so there was nothing that could be done. Too late for a brace, and not severe enough for surgery.

	<TEXT> Agreed, saying this is just blaming the victims further. People should be able to go out in public without fear of assault or rape. It's the perpetrators that make this world a shitty place, not the decent people they attack. It's so terrible to think that innocent people constantly have to be aware of the shit that others do. We shouldn't have to fear every turn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BC - most often only people in relationships with active sex lives are on them ... I assume you're not her lover as well? Why worry about it? But you can get it at literally any pharmacy.

Birth control also helps to regulate excessively heavy periods and period complications. Some women take it even when not in a relationship to manage those problems, so even if she didn't have a boyfriend she might still need it.

Thank you, though! I'm pretty sure she's applying to Yonsei and I am applying to Korea U. </TEXT>
