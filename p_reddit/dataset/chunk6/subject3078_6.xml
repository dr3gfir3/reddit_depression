	<TEXT> That being said, I don't feel that a terrorists cache of chemical weapons being destroyed in an air strike equates to a government intentionally gassing an area with civilians. The outcome is equally bad, but the intentions don't offset.

I'd assume it is intended to suggest that the chemical attack from last week was not a government attack (a lot of the arguments seem to be that the Syrian government is the only group capable of launching such an attack if that isn't the case, you'd need to also look at who else could have, or would have wanted to carry out such an attack..).

It sort of broadly lines up with what the Russians are saying now in terms of evidence,  and so on, and frankly without external, independent verification it's all a bit of a shit show.  </TEXT>

To be honest, European values aren't really that well defined at all, we have a sort of 'western values' thing going on, but beyond some very vague notions there are exceptions to almost anything, including things like human rights and so on.. </TEXT>

You really need to pay attention.

Yes... You really do... Just do that anyway..

What I would like to know is what on earth those old French Renault Twingo's (like 2001 vintage) have under the bonnet, We got repeatedly overtaken by them on the French motorways (en route to Luxembourg and indeed on the way back after leaving Belgium etc..) when we really weren't going slowly.. at all.. The other common denominator was that the drivers all seemed to have their arms hanging out of their windows (and who has open windows when you are bombing down a motorway..?!) </TEXT>

The UK hasn't opposed closer military cooperation (in fact it has entered into bilateral defence agreements with other EU members....) it just doesn't see an EU Army, or the EU having a direct military component beyond the very minor one it has now.

I'm not sure there would be a lot of political fallout from China and Russia in this particular scenario, that said even if there were none, I doubt the US would want to use nuclear weapons simply because of the humanitarian impact, you can't exactly use them and not kill a huge number of people, and as much as Trump is a bit of a dick, I think he'd stop short of killing a vast number of people who are essentially victims of the same regime.

Well that and everyone would have pointed out that given that it was a referendum, leave couldn't deliver anyway.. Essentially the issue was that the government could make a plan both ways, and have the power and capacity to put it in place, leave could only advocate for a particular direction.

At the end of the day leaving the EU was such a stupid thing to do

	<TEXT> There's also a video from the U.K. Of police standing by and calling the higher police while a man hacks another mans head off with a machete though.

No.. There isn't... Or rather if there is, I'd love to see it because I haven't heard of it before.

I assume you are actually talking about the footage of the Lee Rigby attack in London, in which case you have footage of unarmed officers not approaching suspects (but essentially containing them) after they had attacked and killed Lee Rigby (first with a car, then a knife), and then armed police arriving and wounding both suspects.  It's worth noting that had the first officers on the scene been armed, it wouldn't have prevented the attack given that the two killers struck their victim with a car and then attacked him with knives well before the police were even notified..

	<TEXT> I don't know how hacking a site that helps people register would benefit any foreign nation, but I'm not an expert.

It wouldn't, unless they did it all the time and prevented a large number of people from registering, and even then it wouldn't really work (because most people are registered to vote anyway, and you get a letter regularly to keep that up to date that you post back...) and would be far more obvious and difficult than taking a site down for a few hours.

I'm probably a bit paranoid to be honest and the news about the Russians hacking the US elections don't help.

To be fair, the 'hacking' the US elections' essentially comes down to spreading disinformation and releasing information about candidates from hacked computer systems. It wasn't hacking in the sense that anyone interfered with the electoral count or registration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'd rather be bothered to go to a physical place to register to vote instead of doing it online if that's going to prevent Russian (or Chinese, American, German...) hackers change what the people voted.

I'm confused as to how voter registration would allow 'Russian (or Chinese, American, German...) hackers change what the people voted' though. It literally just allows you to register to vote (which you can do in other ways too..), it doesn't change what people vote for, impact the result or do anything else really.. 

Having a clean democracy it's worth our time and effort, imo.

Indeed, and having a site to allow people to register helps that rather than preventing it.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And here's the rub. In my view, a valuable skill is something that results in the holder working in a productive industry. You appear to think a valuable skill is some sort airy holistic "knowledge for knowledge's sake". I disagree - such pursuits are a luxury, and should not be the burden of the general taxpayer to afford.

Yeah, that's the disagreement, I don't think that skills and knowledge directly related to productive industry are valuable.  I can see the argument that some doing basic research in things like ancient Germanic languages can be beneficial in it's contribution to linguistics, and whilst it might not leave the person doing the studying with many prospects outside of academia, I'd argue that it is still beneficial (And may even provide a basis for some economic activity..). Essentially I don't see anything wrong with academic pursuits as long as they are actually exceptional.

We should be pushing more people through tertiary education, but that tertiary education should take a reformed approach. It should be spread across your lifetime; it should be bite-sized; it should be practical for economic ends; it should be part time. 40,000 spread across a 25 year career is 1,600 a year - that's a lot of courses, training material and certificates.

I'd mostly agree with you there, at least in part. I think there should be more focus on development and vocational training support for people, rather than narrowly trying to push people through university and an academic approach.  I mean, the opposite is currently happening (my eldest kid's school just dropped engineering because of cost concerns, so now we are looking at alternative.. you'd think that kind of thing would be important, but apparently not..).  Apprenticeships should be about real skills too, not a reduced income job that happens to provide qualifications in things that most people can do after a couple of hours of training, and do well after a few weeks of supervision..

The degree, as a pure academic pursuit should be the reserve of the few, genuinely brilliant. I could fully get behind comprehensive public funding of scholarships for such degrees, if only a few brilliant percent of people were entitled to them.

That's what I'd be aiming for (although brilliant may well be somewhat subjective), I'd certainly expect a smaller proportion than now to attend, and I'd hope that there would be equality of opportunity for those suited to and genuinely capable of advancing our understanding of.. stuff.

But I'd include musicians, artists and so on alongside engineers, scientists and mathematicians etc.. in that grouping.

	<TEXT>  He said the stupidity of the eurozones structure meant that the entire european project was structured to fail.

This is sort of the thing with quite a few EU projects, but I'd argue that they aren't structured to fail because people want them to fail, they are structured so that further integration that isn't possible initially and politically unpopular, becomes necessary and so the political pressures are reduced.  That doesn't seem to be happening in a number of areas though, so the EU and Eurozone are finding it much harder to carry out the reforms that they want..  Now that might simplify a little once the UK leaves, but this, and other positions (coming from the likes of Denmark, the Netherlands, the V4 and others) aren't going to simply disappear either.

It's arguably crisis based policy pushing, and I think it's really quite problematic in that it harms the perception of EU programmes and projects in the view of the public, and creates fuel for euroscepticism where there isn't actually a need for it.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of that is predicated upon having a wealthy tax-base to pay for such expenses.

Not really,  higher education isn't *that* expensive in the first place, shifting the cost on to a smaller group of people (graduates or students..) arguably relies more on having that group be able to pay given you'd be pushing the burden across a smaller population..

If every Tom, Dick and Harry can rack up bills for 40,000-50,000 on Underwater Wanking Science Studies, then it does nothing to improve the wealth of the tax base and becomes an extravagant expense.

Right, but what about if you have fewer people going to university for academically rigorous courses, rather than trying to push everyone through university by default? I have very little issue with people going to university purely to advance or understanding of things, whether it's science, engineering or art and music, I have far more of an issue with lots of people doing degrees they will get no benefit from because it is seen as something you have to do..

Do you think a poor country like Chad should be putting upwards of 2/3rds of its young people through tens of thousands of pounds worth of tertiary education in non-economically productive studies?

No, but it should be pushing it's best and brightest to go through tertiary education (Whether that is in economically productive studies or not) and pay for that if it can... Although priorities for countries are somewhat different depending on the issues they face too.

Why then should a wealthy country engage in such pursuits? Because we are wealthy? Well, that would come to a finish if we continue such opulent displays of endebting our future.

Having good higher education, that produces both academic and economic benefits is a positive thing for the country though, it becomes a problem when it ceases to provide value, when people are essentially paying a lot of money for a piece of paper, rather than for a set of valuable skills. </TEXT>

Now no doubt the US has other issues to deal with in terms of threats, especially given the prevalence of firearms, but there must be a mid-way point between an immediate response from a SWAT team and two unarmed police officers having a chat.  

And as you point out, the amount of force used when they do enter the situation is the police's responsibility, and it should be both reasonable and proportional..

In either case, the person making the call and the police have some responsibility, the police for their actions, and the callers for wasting police time and creating a potentially dangerous situation.  </TEXT>

Sort of (although I think it'd be hard to get people outside of the US to see that as valid, as there tend to be somewhat tighter rules of engagement for the police, not that that always prevents issues, but it mostly does..) I'd be worried that that shifts the blame away from the police and their responsibility to use reasonable force though..  SWAT teams aren't a weapon after all, they have the ability to make decisions on how much force is appropriate and so on. </TEXT>

There is almost no chance that the US would be able to defend against even a small launch from China or Russia because you'd be talking about an enemy capable of launching quite a few missiles, with quite a few modern, manoeuvrable warheads per missile, and incorporating penetration aids and decoys etc.. The various elements of the US missile defence system are great, but they don't come close to offering anything approaching blanket protection against ICBMs, in fact what there is is not really geared toward intercepting large numbers of modern ICBM's and has a low success rate against simpler targets...

Don't get me wrong, what the US has achieved is phenomenal, but it's a very long way away from being able to defend well against a modern threat.

It might however be quite successful against a launch from North Korea given you'd likely be talking about a vastly simpler threat.  </TEXT>

To be fair, it isn't really about the size of the air forces if you are talking about an ICBM, fighters and bombers aren't really relevant. The question would be whether US missile defence systems work against ballistic warheads, which is still questionable, but more likely against NK given the assumption that they are going to use a limited number of missiles with nothing complex in terms of anti-missile-defence capabilities.

If it were a few Russian or Chinese missiles, the US couldn't prevent a strike but with North Korea it's more likely, and will depend heavily on a huge range of factors.

That said, if it were to happen, the response would be pretty immediate and final for North Korea... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The government have no incentive to implement the kind of reforms you're talking about, because high university attendance masks youth unemployment figures. 

The incentive should be decent higher education, but again, I agree. We now essentially have mandatory education until 18, and an expectation that most people won't even attempt to enter the workforce until several years after that. It seems to be something of a trend to keep people in a strange in between category (not quite adults, not quite children) for a long time, and justifies things like reduced benefit and support availability, and reduced minimum wage brackets, and indeed apprenticeship pay rates...).

Not sure how sustainable all that is, or whether it'd be attractive to governments of all stripes, but it certainly isn't a good reason to support it.

It also gets young people into a lot of debt, which helps to prop up the student loans industry.

I'm not sure this is terribly accurate (they had to creat it and it'll make huge losses, but it does shove the costs off the balance sheet and create apparent liabilities owed to the government, so there is that, although it is a long way down the road, and some other government will have to deal with the fallout.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> no it doesn't. cars manage this all the time on residential roads.

To be fair, if I do it in my car, the drivers around me are still aware of where I am and won't suddenly pass me on the off chance that they can, I am not taking myself out of a lane that I would have to later re-enter against traffic that is passing and coming from behind me, so it's almost an entirely different scenario.  The risk to the cyclist is that they nip in and out, and someone doesn't see them or assumes they have priority so they have to either stop or slow down, or they end up being hit by a car.

Frankly when driving I'd much rather have a cyclist act in a predictable manner and hold their road position than nip in and out of gaps.  Granted there are situations where a cyclist may actively have to move out of the way to allow traffic to pass, but that's not really the issue most of the time, and it doesn't seem to be here given it's a two lane road.  At that point to give a cyclist a sensible amount of room, you essentially need to treat them as another car anyway (hell, most of the time you want to do that, otherwise you are either forcing them to drive at the curb, which can be nightmarish for cyclists, next to parked cars, which can be problematic, or you are passing them unsafely anyway..).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well you kind of answered your first paragraph in your second. I'd be livid, as it stands, if my taxes paid for people to go to university. At least half, if not more, of uni students sit around for 90% of the year doing nothing except getting drunk. Why should I pay for that?

You may or may not be more livid by my edit then....

But my answer would be that university should be hard to get into, and then paid for.  It shouldn't be something that everyone does by default, and where we try and throw as many people through the system as possible, so not so much about learning or education or furthering a field, but about having attended and gotten a piece of paper. 

I'd absolutely welcome funding a university system that delivers great education to people who can benefit from it, from taxation. I have a problem with pushing almost everyone through university, regardless of whether their degree will be useful, or is valuable,  essentially for the sake of it regardless of how we pay for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A graduate tax sounds like a far more straightforwards way of handling the whole system.

Or we could just fund it through the tax system, I really don't see the issue in a system with progressive taxation. Earn more because of your degree, pay more taxes, earn more because you can employ well educated people, pay more taxes, etc.. Education is something that should benefit society, so we should pay for it.

The problem I have right now is actually more with the direction we are going with university education generally, it is becoming essential for everyone not because people need a university education, or university education is particularly relevant to a lot of jobs, but because there has been a massive push to get people into university. I'd rather that were spread more across vocational and in work training and getting people into work that offers a career when they leave school, as well as having university push people into academia and research... Low level management doesn't and shouldn't require a degree, nor should a whole slew of jobs that up until recently were broadly vocational for the majority (with some people taking the degree route and going into research..).

*edit: Just realised I sort of missed the other side of my argument.. - I also don't think university should just be about jobs or about what you can earn with a given degree. I would prefer university to be an option for talented musicians and artists, for social scientists and people with an interest in the humanities and media, and that people can learn and develop for the sake of learning, not because they feel they have to, to be able to compete for work that doesn't have any relevancy to their degree anyway.*

My back of a fag packet maths would suggest that you'd have to earn more than 45k/pa just to hit a the point where you repay the interest a 40k loan would accumulate, so you'd essentially be paying forever at that point or lower (well, unless your income drops below 21000, at which point you wouldn't repay anything..). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, so I think I've come across this a couple of times, so I assume it's not new, but this gives a little more clarity as I had someone else available to confirm inconsistent results..

The bug is essentially not finding other submissions of the same url (not just the same article, but an identical url) within a specific subreddit, leading to duplicate submissions.

It also means that different users are getting different search results, hours after a submission, when searching by url.

Steps that are repeatable with the url in this report, and in /r/europe (haven't tried anywhere else..)

0) Someone else submits the story I'm will go to search for and submit later, it appears, isn't deleted or otherwise subject to moderation (I checked with the subreddit mods..) but doesn't show up in search results when searching for the url.

1) I then search globally and within a subreddit to see if a url has been submitted (url in question most recently was: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-39437388). 

*Global search returns results of the same submission to other subreddits, but not in the specific subreddit I'm looking to submit to.*

2) Go to the subreddit I want to submit to, search on the url, 

*The search returns no results within the subreddit and shifts to submit (so no, 'Post it again').*

3) Submit the article.

*The article submits as normal.  On the submitted article, the other discussions show other submissions in other subreddits ([see here](http://imgur.com/a/SixRk)) but not the first submission (step 0)*

4) A user suspects that the post is a duplicate, but can't by searching by the url, find the original.

5) I search by the title rather than url and it does find the submission to the same subreddit.  Still can't find it by url (but my submission is returned).

6) Some time later, both submissions are returned by search to the user at stage 4 (not me) on the same subreddit.

Obviously this is part of the search stuff, so I'm aware there are issues, but.. there you go anyway.  I think, but can't prove, that I've seen the same on /r/politics and  /r/worldnews and I think on /r/news, so I don't think it's sub specific (and wouldn't expect it to be..).

Other notes:

I deleted my submission to /r/europe (after notifying the mods it's a dupe, and after the above) to check if I could resubmit it without it being a duplicate and initially I could, now I can't.. So again, an inconsistency.

Anyway, there you go, cheers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the issue you're talking about only becomes salient if we're actually going to make policy.

It's salient that dealing with criminality is different from dealing with acts that are legal and can be positive or negative. It means you have different considerations and a different responsible party (the individual company or person for criminality, and the government for policy).  

 It's very easy to say that you only want to get rid of the bad tax avoidance, but it's not easy at all to make it any more concrete than that.

Sort of, various countries have started adding descriptive rules to tax policy (so they state why a rule is being implemented, so using it for something else is more obviously a breach of the rules) so it becomes easier to determine impact and potential for abuse without having to go into massive detail..  Still, you have to start somewhere.

That is why it took me so long to figure out what your point was.

To be fair, my point was simple enough, you can't treat evasion and fraud like avoidance. </TEXT>

No, someone said that tax evasion, tax fraud and tax avoidance were morally equivalent.. That's a bit different.

And you refuse to accept that when people say "cat", they don't really mean "lion" until they either quit or continue the conversation on your terms, which I can't imagine serves any purpose other than really lame trolling or some weird ego-boosting exercise. Whatever the case, it's really transparent and really annoying.

Except of course I've also discussed the issues around avoidance with people and why those issues, and then the solutions aren't the same as those related to fraud or evasion.

This is really simple, people here are lumping three things together that have a negative impact (or can have in the case of avoidance) that need to be dealt with separately.  That's not pedantry, that's discussing the actual issues.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may argue that your definition is better or even the only right one and you would be potentially justified in doing so, but right now you're just being wilfully obtuse.

I'm not though am I. The initial premise was that evasion, fraud and avoidance are the same ethically. They aren't, people evasion and fraud are criminal, avoidance isn't, and it takes many forms, some that people here would agree with, some that they don't.  If we start lumping them together, and taking 'avoidance' to mean 'things that I don't like about the tax system', we have a problem, because we are not talking about what those issues actually are and we are essentially throwing out a policy tool because governments sometimes don't use it terribly well.  We need to separate these issues because they require different approaches to solve, we can't do that if we lump them together, or if we misunderstand what they actually are.

Afford other people enough respect to engage with the substance of their arguments, even if you object to their wording. Otherwise you're just wasting everyone's time, including your own.

I am engaging with their arguments and not just one term though, the problem is the assumption that any tax benefit, credit or reduction is an abuse and that the scale of the issue is masked by not addressing the specificity.  You will note that I had a very productive conversation with /u/WhyYouShouldCare that resulted in a far clearer and more reasoned conclusion than simply 'fuck tax avoidance', that is the point of having the discussion isn't it? If people think avoidance, evasion and fraud are pretty much the same thing we have a problem, because avoidance is useful to society and anyone that looks at tax incentives when making a decision.

We need to attack on those fronts at the national level, within the EU, and probably also abroad to the extent that we can manage. With improved laws and new enforcement mechanisms we can do more to make everyone pay their fair share. I hope that doesn't lump them together too much for you.

To be honest I'd actually like to see the legislative aspect of avoidance being dealt with first (either through simplification or simply a review..), that way you would hopefully improve the success rate of your enforcement agencies when it comes to evasion and fraud, although that might throw up other issues around dealing with 'legacy' offences in the previous system.

I hope that doesn't lump them together too much for you.

Giveaway to the bankers, tax relief on mortgages, giveaway to homeowners etc..).

	<TEXT> Claiming deductions and tax credits as envisioned by the lawmaker is not what would be considered tax avoidance in the context of this video.

No, but that is what tax avoidance is.  The poster I replied to suggested that evasion, fraud and avoidance were ethically equivalent they aren't. 

The problems are also different, one is people acting illegally, the second would be issues around how governments legislate.

Under your definition, having a child and receiving a tax credit for that child is a form of tax avoidance, which, I'm not going to argue is not a possible definition, but it clearly isn't the definition used by anyone else in this conversation, so you're just arguing past everyone else.

It is however the actual definition of tax avoidance.  Moreover, people in this conversation and elsewhere are actually using avoidance to mean 'things we don't like', which then gets hard to pin down.  It also makes the figures involved horribly suspect when you include legal tax reduction, without defining what the hell that means, 1tn Euro's would represent 1/6^th of all taxation within the EU, at all levels, but I can't find a breakdown of what is avoidance and what is evasion and fraud (it also doesn't help that figures for things like VAT loss to the EU include loss due to evasion, avoidance, bankruptcies, insolvencies and miscalculation)..

Claiming that avoidance is ethically the same as fraud or evasion is simply not accurate and really quite problematic in the context of the debate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, if I were happy with the law then I would be.

Right..

So, we deal with evasion and fraud by using the law enforcement agencies we have and work to detect and prosecute criminality.. But when it comes to avoidance, it is not about stopping it, but making sure that governments do not take the piss when they write tax laws, it's essentially something you argue for or against (like the shape, scale and type of welfare payments or defence policy etc..) rather than fight against generally.

So lumping them all together is problematic, because you end up in a position where people equate evasion, with fraud and with avoidance (often whilst technically engaging in the latter to some degree).

I just think that much of the underpaid tax comes from people being able to abuse tax law that was poorly written or implement, if it isn't just out of date. 

Agreed, and that needs to be changed so that it reflects what governments and people want, there are also some balances to be met (arguments about certain tax offers that are current, but will depend on your view of their effectiveness and ongoing necessity for example).

So if we're going to bring the amount people pay into balance with the amount we as a society want them to pay, then we should move on all fronts at the same time. Not just by fighting what is criminal, but also by closing the loopholes that allow people to hide entire fortunes from the taxman.

Right, but they are very different things and shouldn't be lumped together because it misleads.  You can't include tax evasion, fraud and avoidance in the same figure, because the amount that is 'lost' on avoidance, isn't necessarily lost and much of it will be intentional.   It'd be a bit like reporting a total for the number of people who speed, to include everyone who has driven over 50mph, regardless of the speed limit where they were driving.. It'd inflate the number. </TEXT>

Your analogy doesn't really make any sense does it, it basically says, there are a load of things I want to kill, so I'll kill them.  Which is great and your prerogative, what I am saying is that when you justify killing both the ants and the worms because they bite then you have a problem, because worms don't.

 I say let's have less of all three, evasion, avoidance, fraud, as they constitute going against the will of the people to have a fairly distributed tax burden. You keep on saying that one isn't a crime and the others are. I don't see what that adds.

Fine, and great, but you still have to acknowledge that breaking the law to avoid paying taxes is very different from you not agreeing with the tax laws that someone is complying with. 

The question then would be, if you agreed entirely with every part of the tax legislation in your country, would you then be happy for people to ensure that they pay the amount required under the law and take advantage of any incentives and credits?  </TEXT>

You missed a rather important part of that quote before responding..

**when you lump fraud and criminal evasion of taxes into the same bracket**, you are pushing a bit of a false narrative meaning people aren't making an informed choice. 

The parent suggested that tax evasion, tax fraud and tax avoidance were morally equivalent, they aren't, as you point out, there are good reasons to allow avoidance where that is fair and incentivizes good behaviour. 

Sometimes things become a crime, sometimes they don't.

Yes.... But if you are breaking the law, you aren't engaged in avoidance anymore, you are engaged in evasion. That is a crime and not the same thing...

If you keep on taking a subsidy after we have gotten rid of it, then perhaps we should have a closer look at how you got your hands on government money for example.

Absolutely, as you are engaging in tax evasion, not taking a subsidy (as it doesn't exist..).

	<TEXT> It's not always a crime to contribute less than your fair share of the tax burden to society. 

The problem with your that position is that in terms of tax incentives, you would likely not be paying your fair share of the tax burden, but instead are spending money on something the government would have to spend tax money on (often more than what you would..). Take something like a tax credit for a hybrid, you'd be paying less than your fair share, but you are spending your money to aid the adoption of a technology. The alternatives would be a government subsidy to the manufacturers (actually, possibly not, because if it comes in the form of a tax incentive, it'd be more avoidance..) or you legislate to force people to adopt the new technology (which harms poor people..).

But that doesn't mean the rest of society can't have a problem with your behaviour, or that we shouldn't encourage our governments to do something about it.

Of course not, but when you lump fraud and criminal evasion of taxes into the same bracket, you are pushing a bit of a false narrative meaning people aren't making an informed choice.  I'd also argue that we should encourage our governments to make good policy choices, which would include incentivizing some activities through the tax system, largely because it's cheap and effective. </TEXT>

Is that the desired outcome? To give a concrete example, there are lots of government schemes that reduce or even remove the tax paid on electric or hybrid cars, someone who chooses to buy such a car would be depriving the government of tax, they would be engaging in tax avoidance by making a choice in how they spend their money in the most tax advantageous manner...

	<TEXT> The tension between tax policy and all three is the same. Those who wrote it wanted to distribute the burdens of our government spending fairly across society. Those who engage in any of those three are moving to contribute less than that agreed burden.

Except governments often use tax incentives to get companies to do things that they like, you get to avoid or reduce your taxes by doing something that the government wants doing, that is beneficial (hopefully..) to society.. Surely that still fits into that in terms of distributing burdens..

The solution is also the same, make it more difficult to engage in all three behaviors by tightening laws and strengthening oversight. So that we can surer that all contribute what we as a society have agreed on as being their fair share.


Two of them are illegal, the last one is a product of government policy, so I'm not sure how the approach is the same. Surely enforcing the law is what you need to do to fix evasion and fraud, and avoidance doesn't need fixing, although governments need to be held to account as to what they offer in terms of incentives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You aren't alone, its something that seems to have become more of an issue over the last few years, but the number of articles that imply one thing, often where the content of the article doesn't really justify it, is getting larger.. It's not alone in that (and not the worst by a long shot..),  I do wonder if it is because they had a very decent reputation.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah yes, the old, "If it's not broke don't fix it" fallacy. 

It's not a fallacy, but you do have to be aware what 'broke' means

you are spending a fortune on maintenance and downtime while you look for parts

That generally justifies an upgrade, when it costs more to run whatever you are running, than running an upgraded version, it's broken..

plus now it's a security nightmare

That also constitutes broken, although old doesn't always mean insecure, depends on the system and the threats

It will fucking break for good at some point and you'll be running around in panic mode for weeks or months and losing more money in the process.

And that's the drama you want to avoid.. 

It's basically balancing the impact of upgrades vs the impact of not upgrading, it can swing massively in both directions depending on the culture of the organisation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An FTA of any value will be so closely binding and so restrictive that I think many more people will start to rightly question why we left in the first place. A service deal without some from of freedom of movement and binding arbitration by an EU court would be completely out of character for the EU.

I don't think the UK will be looking to enter into an FTA that is seen to significantly restrict the actions of the UK in terms of non-EU trade and I seriously doubt that we'll agree to anything that imposes direct regulation on the domestic market. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thought I'd post this because it's interesting watching the redefinition..

The ~~byline~~ subheading alone is somewhat telling - *If what you mean by Brexit is the UK severing all ties to the EU to reclaim our sovereignty and take back control of our borders, then it isnt likely at all*

The idea that the UK has to sever all ties, and take some extreme position on everything in relation to the EU seems to be becoming more common, but it broadly doesn't seem to be coming from the bulk of people who voted leave.

Now granted the article does a bit to refight the referendum and immediate aftermath:

*The problem is that often when people talk about leaving the EU they confuse it with leaving the EEA (European Economic Area) and its single market  but not all EEA states are in the EU. It may be possible for the UK to leave the EU but remain in the EEA and follow the Norway model, an option many people think is preferable.*

I think the various conflicts that leaving the EU but remaining in the EEA have already been broadly discussed, and indeed the government has been somewhat clear on both leaving the single movement, and the customs union, it seems unlikely that the UK would want to, or will follow anything that looks like the Norwegian model..

And then we finish with:

The Government has much to answer for. The sooner it acknowledges the realities, the better.

Which I'd agree with, acknowledging the reality of the situation is probably a good idea..

*Edit:: Sigh...*

	<TEXT> If you're using experienced and top notch creatives for non-brand related IP (not logos, logomarks) you're always going to win doing a licensing deal.

Indeed, even if you aren't using experienced and top notch creatives you can buy in licensed material (and have access to a wealth of other royalty free or permissively licensed material for that matter) for far less than you can commission it.

The experienced people understand the value of giving up their control and ownership of the IP. They are likely to ask for a very high premium to do so.

Sort of depends on what they are providing, some things yes, some things no, most of the time it's a mixed bag (they don't want you coming after them for what you perceive are derivative works of something they provided for you and won't want to sell you something that limits future profitability, but if you are after a bespoke product that's generally a different issue). And in any case, always read the contract..

If something turns out to be iconic, focus your efforts on re-upping that license. You're still able to protect your brand and you're not burning through capital under the false notion of everything needing to be forever yours.

It only hurts you to do buyouts on EVERYTHING. If something turns out to be iconic...

If something you are licensing turns out to be iconic and it isn't yours, you are in the shit either way. The owner is going to look to maximise their return and your costs will rise, essentially anything strongly related to your brand you need to either own, or have a perpetual license with minimal royalties (can't do that with everything of course if we are looking at IP beyond imagery).

I'd argue that a good balance is that you own your brand, but don't kill yourself in terms of capital investment in getting that sorted, everything else matters far less (especially campaign material, stock imagery etc..). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So, silly question time - Any way of keeping the hazard light button lit up? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-09 23:54:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've tried looking at the various VCDS resources, tried searching, but between the various different terminologies, and mixing 'lights' with lit up and indeed illuminated I'm getting nowhere..

To describe what my issue is  - My 2003 Touran has a hazard light button nice and obviously on the dash, it lights up briefly when you turn on the lights and then goes out (at the same time as the lights around the light selector).  That hasn't really been a problem except when I would have liked to use it a little while back on a dark stretch of motorway, with it not being lit up I couldn't find it to hit it (nor could the passenger). If it were lit up all the time (and I note that it only glows dimly initially..) it would have been far easier to find..

Anyone have any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For stock material and things like site theming I'd agree. For more specific branding you are almost certainly going to need some bespoke work anyway (at which point there is often little to no value to the designer in licensing..) and the price differences become negligible. Depends on what the OP means by 'I outsource most of the graphic design work' too, although I assume he's not outsourcing his product for example.

Oh and it can be a pain in the backside dealing with licensing generally for a small startup, and cheap enough to get 'good enough' design work done without it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In fact, I would argue YOU NEVER NEED to own design work forever as an early stage startup.

It's a bit here and there, you probably should own the artwork, but you'll want to be able to change it and mess about with it as you figure out what your brand is, so don't invest a huge amount of money or emotion into any particular design in the early stages. What you don't want to do is associate yourself with certain imagery and then open yourself up to liabilities because it turns out someone scraped a logo, imagery or other design elements from someone who is willing to take you to court. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of ownership, it would depend on the agreement you have with the freelancer doing the work.  That said, the [upwork T C's ](https://www.upwork.com/legal/), specifically section 8.6 Intellectual Property  Rights, make it clear that you as the client become the owner or any work created for the client by the freelancer:

*Upon Freelancers receipt of full payment from Client, the Work Product, including without limitation all Intellectual Property Rights in the Work Product, will be the sole and exclusive property of Client, and Client will be deemed to be the author thereof. If Freelancer has any Intellectual Property Rights to the Work Product that are not owned by Client upon Freelancers receipt of payment from Client, Freelancer hereby automatically irrevocably assigns to Client all right, title and interest worldwide in and to such Intellectual Property Rights. Except as set forth above, Freelancer retains no rights to use, and will not challenge the validity of Clients ownership in, such Intellectual Property Rights. Freelancer hereby waives any moral rights, rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure and withdrawal or inalienable rights under applicable law in and to the Work Product. If payment is made only for partial delivery of Work Product, the assignment described herein applies only to the portion of Work Product delivered.*

Of course that assumes a few things, most importantly that the freelancer has the right to assign ownership (if they used liberally licensed content they might not be able to..)...

So that seems to deal with both 1 and 2, as to three, if the above applies then you'd stop in the same way that you'd prevent anyone else from infringing on your copyrights, (that depends on jurisdiction, but broadly comes down to asking them not to, and taking them to court if they don't comply...).  

It all mostly hinges on whether they have the rights to pass on in the first place though, which they broadly should, but might not. Where they haven't they should be telling you what licenses the material they have used is subject to though.
