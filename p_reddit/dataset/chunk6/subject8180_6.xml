	<TEXT> I'm going through those things currently and have been for 6 years, and talking to someone who understands sounds heavenly. If you like, you can add me on Discord - foe #1638 or snapchat (which I tend to use more throughout the day) - reptil3
I look forward to speaking to you, and I'm sorry you had to go through all that :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly not a grill but I'm in a similar place to you; I'm that one guy who sits alone at lunch and plays games etc etc. I'm not from the US, although I am the same age, so we could play games or something together if you'd like :)  </TEXT>
