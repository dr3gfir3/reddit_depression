	<TEXT> Doxxing means to publicly reveal a person's identity and/or address on the internet. I think it's pretty obvious that that wouldn't be a good thing to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was rather freaked out as the plane lifted off, as I had never been on a plane before. Apparently, I must have looked like I felt since the guy sitting beside me leaned over to talk to me.

Hey fella, you alright?

Yes, I replied, Ive just never been up in the air before.

He leaned his head back as he laughed, No need to worry about it, he said after he finished laughing, 
Ive been flying since I was 12 and every single flight that Ive been on has never failed me.

I was about to thank him for his reassurance, when he started talking again.

Well, save for that one flight, that is.

O-one flight? I stuttered, What happened on that flight?

Ysee, he began, It all started when I was just a youngn, about the same age as you seem to be. Everything seemed fine, the passengers and the stewardesses seemed to figure that this was going to be a typical flight. Suddenly, the engine conked out, sending us plummeting into the Pacific. 

Thankfully, we all had those safety belts on, well, the passengers did. The poor stewardesses and pilot did not have enough time.

I couldn't help looking down to make sure that I had been buckled in, as he continued to tell his story.

We ended up floating around on those chairs that smelled like beer and vomit, for awhile, everything was fine, that is until we got hungry. Ysee, none of us thought to pack a lunch. A few weeks later, a helicopter flew over and the pilot yelled down, asking if I was one of the survivors of the plane crash. I yelled up, letting him know that we were from the plane crash, but that I was the only one to survive.

He smiled as he finished his story, I was about to ask him some questions, when we felt the plane land. As soon as it completely landed, the stranger stood up and exited the plane. Later as I waited at the baggage claim, he walked up to me.

Too bad that we had such a safe flight. He grinned as he licked his lips, then he wandered off, while I was still in shock. 

I've never seen him again, even though it has been three years since then.  Every day, I feel fortunate for that and I pray that no one will ever end up on the same plane as him. </TEXT>
