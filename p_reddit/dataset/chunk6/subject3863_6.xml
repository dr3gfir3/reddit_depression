Science does not have all answers and that is the beauty of science and just further proves that human race will never know everything and that we will constantly evolve and advance. 

You are supporting dogma that is based on incomplete book that supposedly describes events that happened long, long before book it self was even written in dead language that only had about 3500 words in its vocabulary and where words and phrases have dozens of completely different meanings. For the record everything you do/see/touch in your entire life is based completely on science alone. Your entire life you will not come in contract with a single thing or event that was unquestionably created by creator. 

Heck you can't even produce two of the same independent translations of the book it self let alone any evidence that anything book is describing actually happened.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is because Priest/Rabbi/Imam always present them selfs as best of the best that society has to offer. All of them demand unquestionable trust and respect from their followers and general public. 

That is why they should be held to higher standards, and it is extremely important to expose them for what they truly are and that is humans with fake morals that use their influence for their personal interest. 

Further more his entire religious community including the school that he stole money form is actually supporting him. 

Here is the article from local news papers in Lakewood just read the comment section and than tell me what do you think. In if fact you are unbiased

	<TEXT> Well, that is where we disagree. What we probably can agree on is that many scholars are "openly" atheist and in the same position as Rabbi where they could rob the school out of funds, right?

 You don't need to ask someone if they believe in god or not. They are all public figures that often make public statements and people ask for their opinion a lot. It does not take a rocket scientist to figure out if they are in fact atheist or not. 

I guarantee that no one asked this criminal if he was Jewish Rabbi it is just publicly available information. 

Beauty of atheism is that it is not centralized nor it is organization of any kind. Some atheist are just more publicly successful than others and they use that success to talk about atheism to wide audiences.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't dispute the fact that atheist commit crimes. Some of the most gruesome dictators in the last 100 years were in fact atheist. 

With that said, topic of this particular thread is a Rabbi stealing money form disabled children and trying to cover up his tracks while entire religious community along with school it self is doing their best to protect him. 

And that in my opinion is not Kosher. 

Again all I did was asked OP for example of atheist doing something similar since OP already made that claim. That is it nothing more nothing less. 

Now, since you are obviously triggered by my question do you have something to show for or you are just going to keep on making comments that have nothing to do with discussion at hand.  </TEXT>

Most interesting thing is that you are "not denying what is going on" but, you are just unaware of anything negative, because it does not happened in your community. I'm just surprised that you managed to find this fairly obscure sub, yet you are somehow completely oblivious to news and information that everyone in civilized society is bombarded with every second of every day. 

As far as divorce, if Jewish women would go to a lawyer, social worker, or even a police station they would be able to get protection and divorce form their abusive/asshole husbands. Instead they chose to pay Rabbis tens of thousands of dollars to kidnap and beat their husbands. So with that said I have ZERO sympathy for anyone and everyone involved. All of them belong in prison. 

Your passive aggressive insinuations that this sub is somehow anti-semi are bullshit plain and simple.  </TEXT>

Whales on the other hand are wild animals and population of 2 million is nothing impressive especially when you consider that there is around 90 different species of whales. Further more humans consume only specific species of whales so extracting large amounts of animals without way to replace them is serious problem for that particular species.

	<TEXT> That is because area Rabbis and Jewish community leaders also engage in stuff like [kidnappings](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3527591/Take-cattle-prod-certain-parts-body-Jewish-rabbi-known-Prodfather-admits-torturing-husbands-agreeing-divroce-wives-FBI-sting.html), [illegal organ trafficking](http://www.slate.com/articles/life/faithbased/2009/07/organ_failure.html), [bribing police](http://nypost.com/2016/04/18/shomrim-leader-busted-amid-nypd-corruption-probe/), [bribing politicians](http://age-of-treason.com/2009/07/23/jewish-supremacists-bribing-politicians-and-laundering-proceeds-of-criminal-activity/), [and more police bribing](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3652390/They-cops-call-Shady-businessman-paid-corrupt-NYPD-cops-100-000-bribes-lane-Lincoln-Tunnel-shut-VIP-escorted-Bill-Blasio-fundraiser.html), just to name a few.

So as you can see we are not talking about rouge bad apple or two, we are talking about **Organized Crime Syndicate** that is hiding behind the vail of religion. 

Now if you actually do care about reputation of Jewish community maybe you should look in to rooting out the problem and turning criminals over to face the music instead of whining on internet about stereotypes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here](https://www.astrill.com/astrill-vpn-routers.php) is the company that was highly recommended to me. Their service is less than $6 per month with unlimited bandwidth. 

[Here](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com) is what people over at r/PcMasterRace recommend. 

As far as trust, I honestly have no fucking idea, I never used VPN before nor do I know enough about it to make knowledgeable guess. Maybe someone who knows what they are talking about could chime in.  </TEXT>

Edit: Also, article it self states that actual rate of abuse of general population is unknown, but "so and so" said that is 1 in 10 ... Give me a fucking beak will you. Are you trying to tell me that 10% of male population in US are fucking pedophiles?

	<TEXT> Nonsense we overproduce ( export ) coal by 5 to 12% each year. There is no single solution for powering our civilization. Coal/natural gas/oil/wind/solar/hydro/hydrogen and yes even nuclear energy will all play big role for forceable future. 

Different regions/industries/equipment call for different sources of energy. There is no two ways about it.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear about people of Wyoming, but here is the hard cold truth. Denying reality and science just because of ones personal interest while times are changing is not the way to go about doing things. 

Just imagine where would our society be if our ancestors denied the science when gasoline engine was introduced or hydroelectric plants were being built. Both of these inventions took a massive bite out of coal industry and in process changed the world as a whole and socio-economic standard of all people for better. 

As far as imports form China that is a myth. Truth is that US exports anywhere form 5 to 12% of total coal production ( depending on the year ) and only imports fraction of total coal consumed in US because it is cheaper to bring it in form Columbia, Brazil and Canada to parts of the West Coast and some Golf States. 

Sources: 

1. https://www.americangeosciences.org/critical-issues/faq/how-much-coal-does-us-export-and-import

2. https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/index.cfm?page=coal_imports

So as you can see we actually produce way more coal than we actually need, and I think that we can both agree that waisting resources such as coal and oil is everything but good for our nation. 

Finally renewable energy is here to stay. It is getting cheaper and cheaper by the minute and it is constantly expanding and employing more and more people. As of 2015 13.44% of all energy consumed in US came form renewable sources and that number will only grow. 

Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_energy_in_the_United_States

Finally there is so much our government can do to take care of people who lost their jobs not just in Wyoming but in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Kentucky. Problem is that solutions are masterfully wrapped in to partisan narrative of socialism vs capitalism and for that reason no one wants to touch miners with the 10 foot pole. 

You guys won't benefit form this legislation, there is only so much coal we can consume and opening new coal powered plants is not on anyones agenda. 

So until we elect politicians that are willing to invest in to us The People instead of special interest and dying industries people of Wyoming will be loosing jobs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the thing, no one is beating you over the head to use Facebook or Google there are alternatives out there. Most importantly they don't charge for any of their software or services. 

ISP's on the other hand do charge! A lot! And you can't even get online unless you are using their service. So in real world now they have complete monopoly over communication networks. Last time I checked there are laws against it. On top of that they get 10s of billions of dollars of our tax money to upgrade their networks. Yet instead of spending that money on introducing fiber optics for example they show it in to politicians and executive pockets. 

Do you see difference now?  </TEXT>
