**Cousin Anna and the Ouija Board**

The phone call was hurried; a rushed explanation, an address and a plea. Theyd messed with something they shouldnt have even known about.

And of course I was expected to fix it.

Most of my cousins knew better than to break out the Ouija board at a house party, but itd been too late by the time Anna caught them, hands on the planchette, as the lights in the room flickered and something answered their call. She locked herself in the bathroom and called me from a circle of bath salt on the tile floor. The girl wasnt dumb, but she was trapped.

Spirit boards were used as early as the Song Dynasty, but the Ouija Board is a Hasbro-owned term coined in 1901, by a man named Fuld, who thought he could speak Egyptian Arabic. (Later he admitted that Ouija comes from the French and German words for yes.) Yes-Yes Boards have been available in America since the 1890s, and playing with one was considered a parlor game for many years before mediums and spiritualists took the rite up a notch and claimed to speak to the dead. Since then, boards have been given a bad rep, and are known as a surefire way to get your shit possessed, according to some Pagans, Christians, and other people that dont know what theyre talking about.

Heres what a Ouija Board really is: cardboard and ink, with just a bit of plastic.

Can it get you in trouble? Sure, if you let it. But it requires some power to do so. Outside of Hollywood, a couple college kids screwing around with a planchette are completely safe, unless one of them has a buried ability in their blood to summon up something actually dangerous.

Apparently the houseparty had one such attendee, and the moment her fingers guided that plastic pointer across the cardboard and ink, something answered. Idiots. If you want to talk to ghosts, meditate with some incense, a white candle, and a specific dead person in mind. Dont just let anyone in. And keep your hands off spirit boards, unless youre an absolute muggle. This isnt a movie, and I cant save everyone.

I pulled up to the house on the outskirts of a ritzy neighborhood. The address Anna gave me belonged to a mailbox with *Rainiers* printed neatly on it. It sounded familiar, but I gave it no real thought.

In the neatly manicured yard, a few party goers huddled together, talking quickly. I asked if anyone had called the cops yet, and they shook their heads.

Whats going on? one of them asked, pushing the others aside to follow me towards the house. She stopped at the bottom of the porch, as I continued on, without answering.

Im by no means an expert in the paranormal. I dont even much like it. But Ive talked with the dead, seen some things that made me a believer, and as much as I hate it, Id been marked by Death early in my life. So people tended to trust me to save their ass in stupid situations. Wish I got paid for it.

Inside the house, most of the bulbs had blown, a good sign something was drifting around. I checked my neck for the little star charm hanging there, and patted it twice, taking solace in its presence. From my pocket, I pulled out my phone, and turned on both the flashlight and camera. Likely nothing would show on the recording screen, but it couldnt hurt.

I made my way through the foyer, and into a living room. The couch lay on its back, and ashes from the fireplace coated the entire room, as if a backdraft had torn through the chimney. Sooty handprints covered the walls and ceiling, with some of the fingers stretching down the sheetrock as if the person had been dragged along. I held my phone light high and surveyed the room. It was very dark outside of the beam. As I swept the phone around, checking the screen for any disturbance, something flashed by my shoulder. I froze, and in my peripheral saw a woman step up to my side. Refusing to look, I tried to make out her features in the dark room, the bright light of my recording screen ruining my night vision. She stood roughly five feet tall, just below my chin, with a tangled rats nest of black hair. Without warning, she screamed into my ear, her mouth stretching around the howl. I flinched and she vanished.

Great, she didnt like me. This would be fun.

I stepped past the destroyed couch, and into the kitchen. I couldnt tell what was a mess from the party and what was destroyed because of the supernatural haunting taking place in this suburban dream. I swept a spot on the counter clean with my arm, pushing red Solo cups and melted jello shots into the sink. The sticky countertop pissed me off, but I didnt take the time to scrub it down before setting my purple Jansport in the driest spot I could find. From it, I pulled a repurposed Windex bottle filled with holy water, my banishing powder, and a white sage leaf. It misted as I sprayed it over my head, and the smell of black pepper and cloves settled around my shoulders.

Time for business. I played back the recording so far, and other than a dirty house and some minor static when the spirit screamed at me, nothing weird showed up. I sighed, and continued recording anyway. Hopefully my battery wouldnt die before I got Anna out of the house.

Sliding the now sticky backpack onto my shoulders, I stepped out of the kitchen, spray bottle pointed forward, and swept my light around the hallway. On the ceiling, ashy handprints led to the stairs. As I looked up, something popped across the hall, from one room to another. 

Bottle aimed like a gun, I crept forward, and pushed the bathroom door open with my boot. The room seemed empty, the mirror throwing back my camera light. The shower curtain was pulled shut, and I knew better than to look behind it. Whatever was floating around didnt need to be given any chances to mess with me. I sprayed the room down with the banishing mix, and shut the door. Across the way was an office, also empty. Shelves lined the walls, and books littered the floor. It seemed like a standard pissed off ghost. The Ouija Board had likely pulled her memory across, confusing her, and making her angry. It didnt happen often, but it wasnt impossible.

Most hauntings are only energy, past lives echoing across time and colliding with us. Some spirits were cognizant enough to know what happened or where they were, some even came back with personality, but others were empty thoughts, and hard to get rid of. Id try asking politely, before pulling out the big guns.

I took one last look around the scattered office, before it clicked that these Rainiers were likely the same as the local law firm on ALL of the billboards in the South. Best to get things done and get out before Mrs. Lawyer returned and sued me for property damage. Out of the office window, I could see that the small group of college aged kids on the lawn had grown in number, and were studying the house. I was glad theyd escaped the terror. I flashed my light through the glass and they all flinched back, unable to see me behind the bright light. With a laugh, I misted the room down, before moving on.

Upstairs, things looked much the same: lights blown, belongings and furniture scattered, and handprints along the ceiling, which honestly could pass for a crazy house party, if thered been enough liquor.

Off the landing, a door was slamming into something repeatedly, the thump thump thump freaking me out more than anything so far. I made my way through the darkness, cell phone light sweeping back the shadows. 

I checked the screen again to see if anything was visible, and a face popped up, eyes wide and mouth open. Hands came around the phone screen to grab me, and I jumped back, cursing. Too late, I sprayed the air with the bottle, but she was already gone.

Poltergeists cause mischief and mayhem just because they can, but its usually focused on one person, or family. Ive seen them attach to a house over time, but rarely has a poltergeist ever formed so quickly after being summoned. Most things summoned take time to build energy or anger before acting out, even rudely awakened ghosts. The exception was demons. With them, all bets are off.

But I doubted this was a demon, just a fast reacting spirit. Maybe shed died badly and the memory fueled her anger. It didnt matter; she had to go.

I continued my investigation of the house, and came to a shut door. Knocking got me no answer, so I opened the door slowly, raising the light to see what lay beyond. It was another bathroom. On the tile floor sat a jug of spilled bath salts, the debris forming an interrupted circle. Anna had been here, had formed the safety circle, but the rose scented salt ring had been broken at some point. No ghost could get through a circle of power, so Anna wouldve chosen to scatter the salt line and venture out. That dumb girl. I noticed then that the mirror had cracked, a good trick to get humans to panic and flee. But Anna was smarter than that. Shed only leave the certain safety if she really needed to.

I misted my spray here too, effectively ridding the spirit of three rooms to hide in, before continuing on.

I reached the first bedroom where the door was thudding into a pair of human legs bent around the frame. Shit. I took a breath, praying it wasnt Anna, and shouldered the door open, stepping into the room beyond.

Somehow I hadnt noticed the smell, too preoccupied with Anna and the house, but every inch of this room was coated in blood and viscera. Bodies littered the floor here, all of them fallen back from the center of the room where a coffee table sat with a Ouija Board on top. The Hasbro box lay nearby, ripped up and coated in red. Anna hadnt said anyone was dead when she called, panicked. Where the hell was she?

Stepping carefully around the bodies, I looked for her in the group of dead kids. I reached the other side of the room without finding Anna, and peered out the window. The kids on the lawn looked up at me. The house was dark, so they shouldnt have been able to see me standing in the shadows. I studied their faces, trying to find my cousin, when I realized those below me were the same as the dead kids behind me. The room grew icy cold, and dreading what Id find, I turned slowly from the window to find the ghosts of the dead kids standing behind me.

Had no one escaped the party house?

In the hallway, Anna flew by the door without a word. I paused, eyeing the kids, but they only stared me down. Spray bottle and camera at the ready, I stepped back across the room and into the hallway. The spirits parted to let me through.

In the dark, Anna had vanished again, but Death appeared briefly, passing by me, her black eyes, inky tears, and red smile bright in the dark. She turned into the bedroom, and I called after her, Take the evil one with you too, while youre at it. She only laughed in response, and I shuddered. The sound was just as rough as I remembered it, sandpaper against silk, the last breath of a teenager and the setting of the sun. I let her go, unchallenged. May the kids in that room find peace.

There were two rooms left, both bedrooms if I had to guess. I entered the closest one, and immediately the bed sheets moved. I jerked my spray bottle up and shined the light forward. Shiny eyes reflected in the camera, and I breathed easier. On the bed, peeking out from the pillows, sat a little terrier. I stepped forward slowly, hand out and he sniffed my fingers before wagging his tail. Save the dog, rule number one in any paranormal event. I scooped the friendly beast into my backpack and zipped up the sides. He poked his head out, happy to tag along.

Alright, Fido, wheres Anna? I asked him, as I moved back to the hallway. 

The last room in the house was the masters bedroom, and I entered it cautiously. On the bed, Anna sat head in her hands.

Hey, I whispered, but she didnt look up. Hey! I said louder, and she jerked, dragging her head up. It lolled backwards, as if her neck didnt have the strength to support it, and then rolled along her shoulders until her eyes met mine. Her hands fell to the bed, and her jaw went slack. She gurgled at me, the same damn sound the Grudge girl made, and thats when I realized she was screwing with me.

You bitch, I cursed at her, and she laughed. Anna returned to normal and waved me over.

What happened here, other than the obvious? I asked.
Kids, Ouija Boards, possession, the yuge, she said, abbreviating *usual* and making my eye twitch.

And? I asked, wanting to know where the angry ghost had gone.

Oh! Shes in the bathroom, I trapped her. I wouldve just taken care of it, but my bug-out bag is in the car, and I figured youd hate to have wasted the gas and not be needed. Anna paused, and as if on cue, a weird groaning echoed behind the master baths door.

You trapped a ghost in a bathroom? I asked, incredulous. Its not impossible, but she had nothing but bath salt.

Yeah, but only because its actually inside Sarah right now. I locked that thing in her just a minute ago.

Wait, who?

Sarah Rainier, lives here, goes to school with me, hosted this party? Anna waved her hand around, the snarky tone of her voice only serving to piss me off.

The lawyers daughter summoned a ghost with a spirit board?

Yup. Must notve not known she could. Her moms pretty vanilla. Their family likely hasnt dabbled in the occult for generations.

I nodded. Right, well, Im sorry about all your friends in the other room.

Anna nodded, face softening. Gonna be hard explaining this to her parents, and the cops.

That was a problem for later.

I handed the backpack and camera to Anna, and she smiled at the dog. I pulled white candles from another of the pockets, and a lighter from my jeans. She aimed the flashlight at the bathroom, and noted the diminished battery life of my phone. I shrugged. We were almost done now.

Setting candles in front of the door, I lit them, and then made a half circle of salt around the threshold, so Sarah couldnt get by me. I stepped over the ring and imagined white energy surrounding me. Properly grounded, I opened the door, and stepped into the bathroom.

Sarah crouched in the tub, staring at me. I held the spray bottle out, but she didnt move. Locked in a body must have confused her even more. Sarah breathed heavily through her mouth, great gulping breaths like she didnt quite understand how to work her lungs.

I knelt by the bathtub, and took Sarahs wrist in my hand. There was a pen mark there, drawn by Anna. I licked my thumb and rubbed it off, but kept a firm grip on Sarah. She didnt resist, nor did the spirit in her try to flee with the rune broken.

Its time to go, I crooned softly. Will you please go? And not hurt anyone else. They didnt mean to pull you here.

Sarah stared at me, dazed. Her eyes were too wide, and her mouth drooped on one side. She tried to speak, but it was less than a gurgle.

I sighed, and spoke again. I need you to go. Dont make me bang a spoon on a pan, please. It looks ridiculous and hurts my ears. The stupid Tumblr advice actually does work in a pinch, but Anna would never let me live it down.

Sarah chose that moment to start choking, great shuddering coughs that wracked her entire body. Something was happening. Not taking a chance, I turned on the shower, and cold water cascaded over us. Running water solved Sarahs ghost problem.

The shaking grew worse, but the angry energy dissipated under the waterfall. She collapsed in the bottom of the tub, and I turned the faucet off, before returning to Anna.

Call the cops, and stop the camera, I said, and she did.

It was not a fun night that I spent talking to the cops. I couldnt tell them much, other than Anna called me from inside a locked bathroom when she heard screaming, and I came to help her immediately. We didnt show them my video, and Anna explained that she called me instead of 911 because shed panicked.

They took my info because Id wandered into the room of dead kids, but otherwise dismissed Anna and me, since we were both women and barely 250 pounds together.

Sarah rode to the hospital, still unconscious.

I still dont know what the official report says (and Im curious because they had to somehow explain the handprints on the ceiling,) but I can say Sarah is very lucky her mother is a lawyer.

In less than a year, the case was closed unsolved, the Rainiers had moved across the country, and Anna had a good reason to skip house parties.

As for me, well...Im still not getting paid to save dumbasses.

**My Grandmother and the Demon**

The women on my fathers side are anything but normal. We talk to spirits, dream the future, calm and raise storms, protect our own, and cook amazing food.

Pair those abilities with my mothers Boricua blood, and I never stood a chance. Shes only one generation away from still living in the Puerto Rico. I know firsthand what old magic is.

My matrilineality is why I live and breathe magic.

And its why my maternal grandmother fled Puerto Rico. Its why Ill never step foot there. My life depends on it.

I know little of Marias life once she arrived stateside, but everything before the one-engine plane dropped her here is a cautionary tale for her descendants.

At sixteen, Maria was a pretty girl living in small town between the base of Cerro de Punta and the Rio Zamas. She worked under her mother, the towns medicine woman, and midwife. Some still celebrated the old Tano cems (gods, spirits, and ancestors), but many had converted to Catholicism, and the small town even built a church to the saints.

It wasnt illegal to worship the old ones, but it was spurned in society, so Marias mother kept her faith in secret, merging old magics with new beliefs in front of her patients and customers.

Maria was raised in two faiths, blending them together to create magic in 
Catholicism, pleading the angels to carry her wishes to Gods ear, and working cures and relief from local plant life and prayer. As long as the townspeople were happy, and healthy, Maria and her mother were not questioned about their workings, or their ties to the old gods.

Everyone has heard of La Llorona, the Weeping Woman, who has ties in every Latinx and Hispanic culture across the Americas and Carribean, but the true story is a folk tale of the Boricua people and a leash for their unruly children. What most have never heard is what the woman did before she killed her children and wandered off into eternity.

Born Ivelisse Madera, La Llorona married rich and lived poorly. As her husband began to lose interest in her and their children, Ivelisse pleaded with Maria and her mother to turn his eye back to her.

There is not enough magic in the world to cement a straying spouses loyalty, sadly. Maria and her mother tried their best, painting Ivelisses body in the colors of the stars and sitting her in a circle beneath the night sky, beseeching gods and saints alike to make her husband faithful. But no good magic can make a lover love again without their consent.

When the all the spells they knew fizzled out, Ivelisse took matters into her own hands and turned her back on the holy. Under the same night sky, Ivelisse killed Marias mother, and with the blood asked anyone who listened to bring her husband back. A demon answered, made of black smoke and red flesh. Maria fled, weeping and terrified, as the beast rose from the river that flowed out of her mothers slit throat.

An agreement was made, but Ivelisse in her desperation did not specify the length of time her husbands affection should return. He looked upon her fondly for a few years, before he drifted away again. Desperate, Ivelisse called upon her contract, and the demon requested new blood of the same line.

But Maria had ran much farther than Puerto Rico.

Unable to save her mother, and with no court system that would dare side against the rich Maderas, Maria took all of her mothers money, and immigrated to the U.S., where she was safely out of reach of demons summoned by scorned women.

Ivelisse knew shed lost her husband, and she needed someone to blame. What was one more deal with an evil being?

She drowned her children, giving over their souls to ensure her eternity. Now, she searches, not for the children, but for Maria, wandering the banks of the Rio Zamas, looking for the bloodline that will return her lover to her arms.

Does the taste of Marias blood live in my veins? I know a demon that could answer that question.

But Ill never give him the chance. [Too many other beings have a hold on my soul already.](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>
