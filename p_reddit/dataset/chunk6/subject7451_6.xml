	<TEXT> There are so many variables and so many different movies made, with such a wide variety of budgets, and the numbers are so obfuscated....[Investopedia](http://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0611/why-movies-cost-so-much-to-make.aspx) offers as good a guess as any.  (Remember, too, that article only seems to address big-budget movies.)

But I wouldn't rely on its numbers either.  Thing is, there's so much money at stake, so few effective rules regarding its accounting, and such a strong advantage to the deep pockets not to tighten the rules, that we may never know. 

One thing to realize, though, is that a 2-hour movie requires hundreds of hours of planning, coordination, and production, all of which costs money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A film budget is simply a line item shown to potential investors and rarely reflects the actual cost of making a film, as it omits many types of credits, incentives, and charges which may come into play.  It can be adjusted as need requires to solicit funding and/or limit tax exposure.  Its significance has nothing to do with what a typical person might consider to be a budget.

It is not to be confused with a net budget, which more closely (but not necessarily accurately) reflects how much a movie costs to make.  Net budgets generally are closely guarded secrets.

A good way to think of a budget (or gross budget) is as a starting point, or estimate, for the cost of a movie.

*Fiction* is a good name for almost every number you'll ever see regarding a film, except for gross earnings.  And even that may be fudged.

If you think I'm making it sound like Hollywood numbers have nothing to do with reality, you're right!  They don't.  This is simply one aspect of the simply astonishing world of moviemaking--and it's why studios resist so stridently any effort to disclose their accounting methods.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, but in Hollywood almost every film fictitiously results in ["net losses"](https://www.google.com/search?q=hollywood+most+films+lose+money+accounting ie=utf-8 oe=utf-8).

They utilize accounting tricks called [Hollywood accounting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting) to mask their profits.

It's why, for example, Return of the Jedi, which has earned over $570M, despite a budget of $32.5M, famously (on paper anyway) [has never earned a profit](http://www.slashfilm.com/lucasfilm-tells-darth-vader-that-return-of-the-jedi-hasnt-made-a-profit/).

It's why any agent knowledgeable seeks [percentages of gross, not net](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121018/01054720744/hollywood-accounting-how-19-million-movie-makes-150-million-still-isnt-profitable.shtml).  

And it's why net is meaningless when it comes to discussions about the profitability of a film.

	<TEXT> Respectfully, blockbusters may have skewed your view of what makes a film a financial success.  A movie doesn't have to earn top 10--or even top 700--results to be considered successful.  This movie was widely praised, viewed, and discussed when it came out (and somewhat regularly ever since), and is widely considered a sci-fi classic.  Hard to see any way in which it's been *overlooked*.

As an aside, I checked out the earnings of one of my favorite's, Jacob's ladder.  Earned [approximately 1/3 of Children of Men](http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=jacobsladder.htm).  Never heard it described as overlooked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've mentioned it elsewhere, such as [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/5k9fk8/in_praise_of_netflixs_the_oa/dbmy0jx/).  The problem is the shooter.  He comes from nowhere--and I don't mean as though from a portal--but narratively.  There's no foreshadowing or signals whatsoever.  He serves as a deus ex machina, which is, frankly, an amateurish way to resolve a dilemma--like a character waking up to realize she'd dreamed the whole thing.

Additionally, of course, the way the shooter is presented (and defeated) is incredibly insensitive to the real-world horror that such a situation unfortunately all too often presents.

But disregarding the insensitivity, a story has to earn its ending.  And this one didn't--not at all.  Because it didn't, no matter how subtly, build up a rationale for the shooter.

Unlike some others, I don't have problems with some of the other characters--the psychologist, for instance.  But the final 10 minutes or so destroyed any suspension of disbelief I had at all.  

The show could've gotten to the same point--her being carried off, injured, the dance meaning something else, questions about her sanity--in many ways that could have been earned.  But it didn't. </TEXT>

Heck--might as well have shown a person jumping from one of the Twin Towers.  Hey!  I know!  The dance *could have saved them!*

	<TEXT> Thing is, any story has to earn its ending.  And this one, the ending was so disconnected from the story that it made the entire setup feel like a cheat.  

Seriously--a phantasmagorical story about a school shooting?  And the shooter comes *right out of nowhere*?  I don't mean nowhere as from a portal, but nowhere as from there were no elements in the setup whatsoever suggesting that this would happen.  Sure, sure, the future.  But a story has to earn its ending.  

There has to be some kind of development--foreshadowing, signals, *something*.  No matter how subtle.  Otherwise it's deus ex machina--which is about as discredited a mechanism as there is in writing.

Not to mention, of course, the absolute lack of understanding about the sensitivities associated with school shootings.  Good lord--could you imagine someone whose child actually was killed in a shooting seeing that?  They'd want to become shooters themselves--of the creators!  Point isn't that you can't write about ugly things, but if you're going to do it, make it organic to the story.

Want to see fiction that handles horror/ugliness brilliantly?  Try to find/watch [Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Testament_(1983_film\)).  Tone was out of this world, and it took its setup to its logical conclusion.  No space aliens, angels, or dance routines in that.

Or [Another Earth](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/another-earth).  Or [Midnight Special](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/midnight-special).  Maybe that's the best comparison.  Crazy ending--*totally earned*.  Or [Take Shelter](http://www.metacritic.com/movie/take-shelter).  Or [The Quiet Earth](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/quiet_earth).  Or...or...or. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Surprisingly, pretty much every one of Netflix's superhero series are good.  Each with different tones but excellent acting/writing/production values.  Stranger Things, while not perfect, is entertaining (though Winona is extremely screechy).  Several others excellent too.  

But unless someone points to evidence suggesting that the majority of users here missed something about the end, this one is just *dumb*.  Which is really sad, because right up until that it had great tone and its writing, while a little inconsistent, was okay.

But the end is so bad it makes significant portions of the setup bad too.

Over the past several decades the GOP has run circles around the Democrats strategically, who only belatedly seem to be recognizing that its goals have nothing to do with the countless inanities with which it divides the populace and everything to do with the destruction of the American political system as it's existed for the past 100 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't have it both ways; marijuana's either addictive or it's not.  And if it's not, it's a choice.  

Many, many people have faced stress without resorting to marijuana use.  Also, I'm not saying marijuana use in itself is bad; to the contrary, I'd think it could be invaluable to NFL athletes, in particular, and that the NFL should be in the forefront of efforts to change the law regarding it.  

However, I will say that it's bad if it becomes self-destructive.  

Compare Gregory's situation to Dez in his early career.  Dez made some mistakes, and his early life was as bad as anybody's.  But he always showed up for his job.  Then, when he realized that he was facing the same situation--that the opportunity toward which he'd always worked was right before him, and profoundly at risk--he stopped the destructive behavior.  

So the question which Gregory has yet to answer is whether he can change.  Only time will show that.

But Broaddus's mention that Gregory has been showing up and working with Haley is encouraging; earlier reports had indicated that Haley had given up on him.  So it does seem that he may be trying.  Good for him.

Having said all of that, though, too, I still find it astonishingly short-sighted that the NFL punished Gregory for missing a drug test because he *was unavailable due to checking himself into rehab*.  That just seems asinine and counterproductive. </TEXT>

He definitely seems to understand that it's not whether a person makes a mistake that is the measure of a man, but what he does afterward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure it's an issue so much of *what he's used* as that he's chosen use of that substance over an opportunity that almost anyone else would love to have: the chance to achieve financial security, not just for himself and immediate family, but potentially for generations to come.

Squandered opportunity is one of the worst outcomes of a life.

That said, if he can pull his life together, well, who wouldn't root for that? </TEXT>

In the meantime, I'll stand by it--Martin, Smith, Frederick, all 1st-ballot Hall of Famers.  Not because they're Cowboys, but because they're sensational.

	<TEXT> We'll disagree on that.  Ware, Martin, Smith, Frederick, are sure-fire first ballot Hall of Famers.  Only thing stopping Bailey from being a first-ballot Hall of Famer is that he's a kicker, but as he's the all-time leader in FG %, he's a lock.  I've been saying since before the Cowboys drafted Elliott that he will be.  Now that he's almost done with his first season, it seems even more clear--just like it was after Dickerson's first season.

But I've seen every Cowboys lineman since the very early 70s.  All the greats.  These are 3 of the best they've ever had.

That said, I'd rather the Cowboys put money into their defense.  It's been overlooked to the point of starvation, and yet still it performs relatively well.  Imagine if they actually started investing in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically every game the Cowboys have been playing since the Steelers' game has been a playoff game, as their opponents have felt increased pressure; my guess is that some of the Cowboys' effort/struggles have been in the face of that.  They're simply not strong enough to steamroll teams desperate for wins.

Also, it's worth remembering that every single one of us would have been delighted with their record if we'd been asked at the start of the year.

Finally, though, I'd like to add that they need to give Irving more playing time, rotation or not, and see what happens. </TEXT>

But he had trouble improvising, and Romo has it all over him in that category.  

Aikman was like a show-dog and Romo is like a battered mongrel with an ear missing, the other torn and bent, scars all over his face, and an absolutely indomitable desire to win.  

His own heart sometimes gets in the way, though, and now his body is beginning to wear down.  It will be a great sports sorrow if he doesn't somehow win a championship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Electors would *never* flip the election in the sense that they would vote for Clinton.  At most, they would select a different GOP candidate, and if Trump didn't have enough votes to win, the House would make the selection.  There is not much of a chance that the House would select anyone other than Trump, because of their own self-interested concerns that any such selection would enrage the GOP base which voted for Trump.

If the information is correct, Putin has committed an act of war against the U.S.  That the Soviets attempted the same kind of thing in prior decades doesn't make it any less offensive; it's just that back then the U.S. still had a strong-enough sense of civics that it could withstand the attempts.  

And there is almost no chance that the U.S. (i.e., Congress) will do nothing about it.  After all, if the GOP really cared about the health of the nation, it wouldn't have committed so many of partisan acts over the past 20 years.

I'm not suggesting the Democrats are much better; in the same way Putin has outplayed the U.S. politically, the GOP has outplayed the Dems.  Doesn't change the facts; but that's yet another of the great tragedies that has befallen the U.S. since the GOP regrouped after Goldwater.  They developed a plan, and they've worked it brilliantly--focusing on local elections, conquering states via gerrymandering, presenting young candidates, and pouring money into propaganda.  We're now experiencing the result.

Delegitimizing journalism, compromise, and civic unity is how one attacks democracy.  We're seeing it in full force now.  The U.S. is not immune to historical forces.  Honestly we seem to be facing a grave threat to our system of government, and anyone who would challenge the reality of that threat seems to me to be of questionable intent--and, online, of source. </TEXT>

We've had many examples on reddit alone of people who are believed simply because of bias confirmation or because they sound knowledgeable--not because they're actually right.  And often when a person tries to correct erroneous material, he's voted down/attacked.

The internet's greatest advantage is also its greatest threat: lies can be spread quickly, and those who don't have time to verify (i.e., almost everyone) can be misled far too easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry--but you're making a presumption there.  As far back as I can remember I've believed in God.  Whether that's based on faith or simply is a result of [bioelectrical impulses which can stimulate an awareness of the spiritual](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet) doesn't really matter to me, as I don't need every question answered.

My views are somewhat complex and out of the mainstream with respect to any religion--at least that I've discovered so far.  I think religion is used far too easily to mask biases, and I'm very cautious about organized religion as a whole.

If I could summarize my faith, it might be with some sort of amalgam of [Micah 6:8](http://biblehub.com/micah/6-8.htm) (*he has told you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?*), the devotion, which I've seen attributed to a lot of different people, *may my life be a prayer*, and the Buddha's statement, *To do no wrong, to do only good--this is the path to enlightenment*.

Unfortunately I haven't seen those things reflected in any religion--though they certainly were reflected in Jesus's life. </TEXT>

Which is to say that they only work against reasonable people, and if a person is reasonable an order of protection is unnecessary.  The only thing an order of protection does is offer the police a reason to arrest someone after the fact.

But when a person who fears contact is up against a cult, that piece of paper won't be worth anything.  Anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my view, God's will for the universe is the same as an artist's will for the drawing; nothing exists without it.  However, when we factor in free will, the equation changes, so that God's will is that humans can make choices on their own, and humans can't decide anything which will change the limits God places on the work.  In other words, God has factored in chance; and it is God's will that we will have choice.  

But within those limitations, we, not God, are responsible for what happens.  To suggest anything else eliminates free will.

It's kind of like flying a helicopter: if you try to adjust for every wiggle, you'll crash.  But if you let the helicopter bounce around within certain parameters, you'll get to where you're going.  That a helicopter bounces doesn't mean that the manufacturer intended it to bounce X degrees at Y moment, but that the manufacturer knew that bounce is how a helicopter works.  Same with God's control of the universe.

To suggest that any individual candidate wins because it's God's will is to suggest that people like Hitler, Kim Jong-un,  Bashar al-Assad, and so on (dating back to the beginning of human history), all came into power because God wanted them to.  Clearly there are significant moral problems with that.

When Paul wrote Romans 13, and Jesus said to render to Caesar that which is Caesar's, they both were suggesting that we focus on what matters--the spiritual--not that we accept wrongdoing as God's will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People are blaming Dak for this loss, but I think Dez easily was as responsible for how lethargic the offense looked.  I think it was Sturm who said this offense needs Dez as a WR threat; otherwise teams crowd the line and the offense becomes one-dimensional (i.e., just like last year). 

Cowboys simply can't afford to have their best WR disappear in a big game--or, even worse, make big mistakes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any expectations as to how the Cowboys do in the playoffs. They definitely have some weaknesses.  But, respectfully, I'll disagree--I don't expect Dak to be the chief reason they might lose.  He's a rookie and still has a lot to learn.  But so far he's been a reason they win.  No indication yet he'll be a reason they lose.  

Even in his worst games, he's rallied the team to win.  There's just no indication whatsoever of the opposite.

A guy doesn't have to be brilliant to be a great QB.  He just has to *win*.

Dak made me finally understand why, in baseball, so many respected Derek Jeter.  The ability to perform under pressure is a gift.  And that kid's got it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thing is, Boot, anyone *could* win the Super Bowl, and we don't know who actually *can* until they do it.  Another perspective: Romo had a similar team in 2014 and he didn't win the Super Bowl.  Sure, the catch.  But there are always reasons why everything does/doesn't happen.  Teams win because of who they have and what happens during games.  

Like no less an authority than Dandy Don himself used to say, *If ifs and buts were candy and nuts, we'd all have a merry Christmas*.

The only inarguable fact is that the Cowboys have won 11 in a row, something no team in Cowboys history ever has done.  And they've done it with the guys who've played.  Which don't include Romo.

	<TEXT> Listen, as many times as you may have done this, you still may have no idea just how important that simple ability actually was.  

I was very poor as a child, and orphaned.  When I was very young, my father, who loved Winnie the Pooh, and used to read it to me, died.  So of course I fell in love with Winnie the Pooh, read it constantly, loved the image.  But because we were so poor, I never actually got to see the various shorts which Disney had made based on it.  

My mother, knowing how much I loved it, used to promise me whenever I'd get down about the fact it was going to be on cable, that one day we'd get cable and I could see it.  But of course it never happened.  She died when I was a teen, and I was swept into a deep hole which, thankfully, only in retrospect I see existed.  And so my dreams/love of the character fell to practicalities--chiefly, the struggle to survive.

Finally, years later, I got to see those featurettes--Winnie the Pooh and the Honey Tree, Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day--and my reaction to them I barely can describe.  They reminded me so much of my father, and tangentially of all I'd lost.

Finally, even more years after that, long after I was grown and the immediacy of all that pain from childhood and loss had faded, I got to go to Disney.  

I was fine, having a good time, until I saw whoever was playing Winnie the Pooh.  I was a grown man.  I fell to my knees and wept.  So much about my father came back--his scent, the strength of his arms, the sense of belonging I felt in his grasp, the sound of his voice, his nickname for me, even the feel of his whiskers on my head and face, all flooded back to me.  And it had been *decades*.

Whoever was playing Winnie, sure, she or he probably was used to strong reactions.  But that day whoever it was gave me back something I'd lost, something which mattered to me more than I ever could say.  She gave me back my father.

I believe I'd pick Darryl Johnston over Don Perkins though--Johnston played FB like Witten plays TE.

Also, in my opinion Bob Hayes was the greatest WR the Cowboys ever had.  Remember: the zone was created to try to stop him.  That his numbers don't compare simply reflect the different era.

So I'd go with Hayes and Irvin at WR.

But this exercise reminds me of just how many great players the Cowboys have had over the years.  I mean, heck, even a lot of the 2d-stringers are Hall of Famers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what to tell you.  Our hours are inconsistent.  This isn't a job; we don't clock in.  So occasionally posts languish and at other times they get removed quickly.  Depends on whether anyone's on.

As for this post and all similar posts, since before I became a mod it's been the policy of the sub to remove them.  The thinking goes that technically this kind of post is off-topic, and the vast majority of our users don't care about how the sub is operated, as long as it provides news and space for on-topic discussion, so we try to keep the feed clear of them.

In the earlier days of reddit, users knew to ask these kinds of things via mod mail.  Doesn't seem to be the case so much anymore.  Certainly not once a sub grows beyond a certain size.  

But so,  if anyone has a question/suggestion, we expect them to be submitted via mod mail.  I don't particularly mind this, though I get a lot of grief for it, even though it's not particularly my decision.  

I don't ever recall any kind of legitimate question being asked via mod mail which didn't generate a lot of consideration.  So mod mail isn't ignored, by any means.  

But it's asking too much to expect moderation policies to be set by users.  There's not a sub on reddit of any appreciable size or quality which is run that way.  It's just not practicable.
So when a user asks questions or has suggestions, he has to realize that they may not be answered in the way he'd prefer.  That doesn't mean he or the question/suggestion was ignored.  It just means that reasonable people can disagree.

A very small subset of users complain that we don't listen to our subbies.  But we do--*if* suggestions are simply made via mod mail.  Almost without exception the loudest complainers have never once contacted us that way.  Typically, once they have, they quit complaining.

In any event, it helps to maintain perspective.  Which some users seem to not like to do.  Or maybe it's that users don't realize how they come across.  Or maybe they don't know any way other than to be confrontational.  I dunno.

Anyway, we have a good moderation team; guys try hard to be fair and to satisfy every user.  Obviously that's not possible, so sometimes subsets of  users are disappointed.  That doesn't mean the mod team sucks.

Ah well.  Sorry for the digression.  To answer your question: we try to be consistent, but we're not always, and we have other demands on our time.  That's just reality.

	<TEXT> I don't mean this in a bad way, but if you have an attorney you shouldn't be seeking legal advice from strangers on the internet.  You have an attorney for a specific reason: so s/he can give you legal advice.  Why you'd want advice from others when you're paying for a professional service is unclear.

Sure, maybe you'd want some sort of context for evaluating your attorney's advice, once s/he's available.  But again: you're on a web site.  The quality of advice you'd get here is even more questionable than what your attorney would provide.

Further, no attorney here could give you advice specific to your situation, in light of the fact that you already have an attorney.  And  getting advice from non-attorneys wouldn't be advisable.

You don't say there's any urgency to this issue.  So wait until Monday and talk to your attorney. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't really a legal question.  The question is whether you want to do business with a company that presents itself this way.

Generally, you haven't suffered any damages.  So though you could sue the firm for anything you chose, the likelihood that the complaint would be dismissed probably would be high. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on your jurisdiction, what your job actually is, and a host of other variables.  You'll want to talk to a lawyer.

Generally, though, the fact that it was stolen doesn't necessarily preclude you from liability, as, for instance, it may have been stolen because you failed to secure it.

Also, depending on the circumstances of your employment, your employer could terminate you for this.

A lot of possibilities.  Thus: talk to a lawyer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a little late to the question, but I'm not sure there's a difference.  Oh, sure, maybe objectively there is, but for all we know our ideas of logic and rationality are limited.

One interesting thing to me about this, though,are the various studies I've read, such as the ones involving [the God helmet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helmet), and the study about [transcranial magnetic stimulation](http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/301117.php), which suggest that our beliefs in God can be modified by stimuli to the brain.

Ultimately, whether God exists is a question we may never be able to answer, until, if even then, upon death.  For all we know, maybe God's existence on a continuum, kind of like in string theory, such that God exists for people who thinks he does and doesn't exist for people who don't.  After all, love is like that.  And faith is real; but does that mean the object of faith is real?  And, again, at some point does it even matter?  As faith certainly has the power to make certain things real.

In any event, any answer relies on a great many assumptions, including, among others, how to define God, and we simply may not be equipped to make those intelligently.  

However, I'm not sure that means our minds are weak; is a mind weak because it has limitations?

Regardless of all that, I've reached the point where I'm okay with not having certain questions answered.  Life, I think, is kind of like flying a helicopter: if you try to control it too much you'll shake yourself to death.  Instead, you kind of have to be willing to accept a certain amount of chop.

For me, it's enough to act locally and to accept wisdom wherever I can find it.  That some of it happens to be from the Bible or from religious thinkers is just as fine with me as that some of it is drawn from great literature, great music, and a simple appreciation of the moment.  A need to define everything has faded as the years have passed.

	<TEXT> Also we had another of those silly penalties on a long run.  Cowboys committed a *ton* of penalties--far more than they normally do. 

Bottom line is the Cowboys beat the best defense they've played.  They don't have a track record of being formidable but they're trying to create it a game at a time.  They're doing okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously.  Guys were catching Zeke from behind.  There's not another team in this league, at least that I've seen this year, which has a defense as fast as the Vikings.  Problem was their offense wasn't very good.

Combine the 2 teams--Cowboys' offense and Vikings' defense--and you have a powerhouse.

There's not another team in the league that could do what the Vikings did.

Also, of course, it was clear that the Cowboys were tired; they'd played 3 games in 11 days, and they were wiped.

So add to your blueprint as #3: catch the Cowboys when they're exhausted.  And maybe that'll work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I said in my response, it is not for users to do this, because it's off-topic, and, frankly, the vast majority of users don't care; they only want to see news/stories about the Cowboys.  

The proper way to address these issues is via mod mail.  While you didn't do that precisely, I responded to you personally as though you did.

Sorry for the removal.  But if you have suggestions there is a way to make them, and this is not it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is true that this is generating a lot more complaints than any actual memes (zero).  But that's the way it goes sometimes.

As I said, the current meme policy was created after a lot of effort and thought.  So we won't change it in the foreseeable future.  Accordingly, our choice either is to give the users who want to post them a place to do it or to remove them.

As mods, we long ago realized we can't please everyone.  If we allowed memes as top-level posts, we'd get a lot of complaints.  We know this because we did--we received *many* complaints.  And we get complaints when we create threads like this for specific memes.

That's the way it goes. </TEXT>

As for banning people for complaints we receive from other mods, as we said previously, that policy is shared by almost every sub dedicated to NFL teams.  So our policy does not differ from those subs in any way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We only create dedicated threads when posts of a particular sort threaten to overwhelm the sub, crowding out most other posts on the front page.  While we recognize their proliferation indicates that some subbies like them, we also recognize that many other subbies come here for other purposes--in short, to get news about the team.  So we try to balance the interests of some subbies with the interests of others.  *That* is our goal as mods, not, as you suggest, to let you discuss whatever you want. 

There are plenty of subs on reddit in which you can do that.
