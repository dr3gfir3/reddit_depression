	<TEXT> Interesting, I've never seen that before. Growing up, we had a finished basement in my parents house, with three bedrooms. Only one had a window, and it was just one of those little 1'x2' hinged windows that you'd normally see in a basement.

Also, you're saying that as long as it doesn't have bedrooms, it wouldn't have to follow those guidelines?

	<TEXT> Basements in general usually only have one exit, the stairs, so wouldn't it not apply to any underground rooms to begin with? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha I do like the idea of the energy efficiency. It will be a constant temperature throughout the year. As far as natural light, I wouldn't be too concerned as my design for the tiny house itself is half glass. The basement would be designed as a true fallout shelter, feet of concrete and rebar, and many feet below ground. 

With regards to emergency exits, it would be similar to a standalone shelter, a main entrance i.e. ladder from the house, as well as an emergency exit, via a tunnel or stairwell to the surface at another part of the property.

I never thought about covering the basement in grass. How feasible would that be? It would need sunlight to grow, no? It would need to be mowed. I don't know how well it would work out to have an underground lawn. Although the idea surely is fascinating.

edit: grass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I've always loved the idea of having a huge basement/fallout shelter under my house. I also love the idea of having a Tiny House. I was wondering how possible it would be to build the basement, cover it up, and build a tiny house over top of it. The house would be much smaller compared to the size of the basement, and in the house would be a trap door in the floor that opens up to a ladder that you would descend down into the basement/shelter. Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was created as a spreadsheet, however I use a Mac, and exporting from Numbers to Excel loses the checkbox functionality as well as the tabs, which is why it works best on an iOS device. I suppose I can copy and paste everything into Google Docs, if it supports checkboxes and formulas. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I Made a Complete Game Checklist for Every Console (US Only), And am Looking for Feedback! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-12 04:37:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys! Throughout the years of my collecting, I have always wished I had a definitive list of games for each console. Ive spent many, many hours creating such a list, and Im ready to beta test it, if you will. Im looking to get some feedback, as well as hear what you would like to see implemented in it in a future release. Im also toying around with the idea of writing this into an iPhone/iPad app to give it a bit more functionality.

Heres some of the features Ive implemented so far:

* Available in 2 formats; .numbers (For Mac and iPhone/iPad), and Google Docs (For PC)
* The .numbers version is designed to integrate perfectly with your iPad, allowing you to scroll between consoles, and tap the checkboxes to add a game to your collection.
* Each game, for each system is split into three checkboxes, indicating Game, Box, and Instructions.
* Each console is split into three separate sections: Games (Licensed), Unlicensed Games, and Other. Other includes items such as Demo Carts/Discs, etc.
* In the interactive version, as you check systems off your list, it will automatically count your total and display it at the bottom of the list, along with the total amount of games in that particular category.
* The Table of Contents page includes a listing of each console in the order it appears, along with the total amount of licensed games needed for that set, the number that you currently have, and the percentage of completion you are at.
* Consoles that are still seeing new games are listed under (Other), at the end of the document, and games will be entered manually by the collector, as there is no definitive list yet. In exchange for providing this, please do not remove my copyright.

As I receive feedback, I will make changes to the original files and list them here.

[Mac/iPad Version - Be sure to "Open in Numbers"](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/1cb685e45p43uai/AADEtWXMolrAVGNiW1cRviUya)

[Google Docs Version (Place an "X" in the box for it to be counted)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dWx7AkVqol71gwsNlk4PMsO5qdn5_yD7Au6ozHl0q8c/edit?usp=sharing)


EDIT 1: Ported the Mac version to Google Docs. Doesn't look as nice as the iOS version, but it's functional.

EDIT 2: Added Neo Geo, Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket

EDIT 3: Added a Version number to the Table of Contents so you always know if you have the most up to date copy.

EDIT 4: Added 3DO

EDIT 5: Both Versions now update total amount on Table of Contents automatically (V1.1)

EDIT 6: Version 1.11 - Added 3 games to Nintendo GameCube (Baten Kaitos: Eternal Wings, Baten Kaitos: Origins, Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As is common practice for many a collector, consoles are normally displayed and stored out of the box, as to prevent damage from opening/closing the box more than necessary. I'm wondering what everyone's preferred method of displaying/storing their games is.

Me personally, I store the games out of their boxes. For example, I have a shelf for all my loose NES games in sleeves. On another shelf, I have the boxes to said games where applicable. For Sealed copies of games, I usually purchase a loose copy as well to display with the loose games.

Games for consoles such as the Sega Genesis, are made to be stored in their box, so for those such games, I keep them in the box, and for the loose ones, they are on a separate shelf until I can acquire boxed copies of them.

How do you display your games? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, I recently found this subreddit while doing some research for a project I'm working on, and was hoping to get some help. My name is Kyle Carroll and I am a 3D modeler and animator. I'm currently working on a pretty ambitious project that I can't fully disclose right now but it will be revealed on kickstarter pretty soon. 

I'm seeking advice and designs for a modern looking museum with a retro feel. I have a basic layout in mind, with room for expansion however I have no architectural imagination whatsoever. If anyone has any experience with this sort of thing I would greatly appreciate some help and would love to hear from you. I will privately disclose some more detail to anyone willing to help me design the layout and look of this museum. Thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I'll look into that tutorial. And I am fairly confident I can do the graphical elements pretty easily, but I don't even know where to begin with using the c# script to get its ins and outs within a unity object. 

Edit: looks like that tut uses XNA, I'm using Xcode on a Mac, hopefully I can at least get the basics. I know a bit of C++ already so that should help.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best way to go about making a graphical text based game? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-06 18:13:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a story developed for a text based game that I'd like to create, however, I'm trying to find the best way to go about doing it in Unity. The lower half of the screen would be a console of sorts, with the input/output text and would be the main part of the game. The upper half would display sprites and images that would change based off of the advancement of the storyline.

What would be the best method to create the input/output text system? Could it be scripted in C# and then set to display the output and recieve the input from a window on screen? Or is there a more visual way to do this? Any suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!! </TEXT>
