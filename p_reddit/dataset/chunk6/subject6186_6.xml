	<TEXT> Battlefield has NEVER had good Campaigns, but this seems to be making all the right decisions when it comes to tone and storytelling.

I'm getting a very serious anti-war vibe for all the media they've released around the Campaign.  From this clip, to the intro mission where you are consistently dying to what seems like a fruitless mission, to the trailer which had a soaring Oscar-Bait tone you'd see in films like Atonement or similar.  I REALLY want this to do something cool and different, and with stuff like this, it seems like Battlefield 1 is on the right track.

I mean...  Could you have EVER seen a game like Battlefield honoring the carrier pigeons who at times saved hundreds to thousands of lives?  This is different.  And I hope it continues to surprise me.

By the way, [this is a better video where the player isn't being a twat.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLW4k0a2G8A) </TEXT>

So, I know that you try to keep your guests completely in the dark, but there has to be some kind of document they sign where they say, 'We'll allow you to approach us naked and not sue.' Or something like that, otherwise I'm surprised you are not in court right at this moment.

	<TEXT> I feel like Fallout 4 was finally the straw that broke the camel's back.  NO ONE, and I mean, NO ONE liked the new dialog system.  I remember 'HATE NEWSPAPERS' and 'SARCASTIC' being mocked before the game even came out.  I think the lukewarm reaction fallout 4 got critically was a wakeup call for a lot of people creatively at Bethesda.  It always seems like they take two steps forward and then three back...  So hopefully this will create some creative reflecting about what they're doing wrong.  I know one thing for sure...  People are not going to tolerate a usual broken Bethesda game ever again...

Settlement Building, Weapon and Armor Modification, better shooting, and thought-out companions were great steps forward, but then they yanked out RPG elements, introduce a shitty dialog system, and streamlined a lot of stuff that didn't need to be.  It blows my mind that they didn't look at what Obsidian did with New Vegas and go, "Oh, we're fucking morons.  We need to ADD stuff, not take away." 

Perhaps its just trying to get the greater market into Fallout.  New Vegas was a great game, but I feel like it's for a more niche audience than the main-line Fallout games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but they want to.  They're just afraid to take that leap.

Look at the launch trailer for Fallout, and tell me what kind of tone you get from it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5aJfebzkrM

In fact, the whole reason they introduced a new voiced protagonist was to create more drama for the player.  They just didn't go far enough.  Fallout 4 was stuck tonally, like a lot of games, between the serious and the silly.  Grand Theft Auto IV suffered from this too.  They need to be able to tell a compelling story with enough going on that silly elements won't detract from it.  Witcher 3 is a great example of doing this right...  Going partying with a ghost inhabiting your body is SUPER silly, but the Witcher 3 is smart enough to still tell a compelling story even within that idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gopher is one of my favorite Youtube Personalities.  His mod videos are great, and he focuses on the mods that make Fallout or Skyrim more Immersive.

He has a great point about playing a vault dweller over someone who is currently in the wasteland, in that it has a great opportunity to tell a fish out of water story.  Someone who has never played Fallout can jump into any of the games and be as naive as the main character.

Unfortunately, I feel as if Bethesda squandered the opportunity of Fallout 4's protagonist.  They could have told a really heartbreaking, dramatic story about a man/woman out of time, the loss of their spouse, and how the world has changed so much.  Instead it was forced into this schlocky tone where your protagonist was too busy dressing like a bear and taunting robots into suicide to go look for his son.  

I think that's why the casual approach to main quests works so well in New Vegas.  Yeah, you are out for revenge, but you don't ever feel rushed.  Fallout needs to encourage exploration, and you feel guilty in 4 when you're exploring because your son could be in danger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hm, so lots to unpack here:

1. The perspective change between soldiers is interesting.  This harkens back to the old school, jumping between soldiers of the Battlefield 2 Console game.  Now, it felt like this was an aesthetic choice for the beginning of the game rather than actual gameplay.  It seemed to show the futility of it all, and how frequent the loss of life was...  I'm curious about how a video game that glorifies war is going to take an anti-war stance, but I'm open to seeing what they can do.

2. Whelp...  That sure is a lot of automatic weaponry for a game that is set in a bolt-action time.  I was glad to see a bolt-action rifle during one of the instances, but this seems like it's definitely going to take more liberties with the time frame.  Though, this makes it kind of weird when they have all these bumps at the beginning going, "This game is set 100 years ago..." 

K...

3. I couldn't really tell seeing as how every player and piece of the environment was a dirty grey, but it looked as if all the player characters were on the British side.  I was hoping it would bounce around more, but this is just the first mission.

4. I saw noticeable framerate drops during that play through...  I hope that isn't representative of the final release, but seeing as how it seems they are pushing the power of consoles as hard as they can go in this, I wouldn't be surprised.  Let's hope there's a day one patch or something along those lines.

5. It felt like, while that level seemed to try and look open-ended, the camera was transporting to each soldier in their specific zones.  I'm wondering if it'll ever open up like one of the multiplayer maps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say to play it vanilla and find specific things that bother you about the game.  If they bother you enough, then start seeking out mods.

For example, do you, like many people, hate the dialog system?  There's a mod to fix that and to find out what you are exactly saying when you press, 'Sarcastic.'

Or what if you spend a LOT of time in the settlement builder?  There's some mods to increase the budget you can place in a area, to extend power lines, to allow you to place things anywhere, or to add other simple fixes that make building more enjoyable.

What if you really LOVE survival mode, but hate how the saving system works?  There is a mod for that too.  But I'd say before you go crazy installing body mods, weapon mods, or mods that give you pet Deathclaws...  You should find the simple things that have easy fixes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [FO4][Request] Some Companion mod ideas... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-29 18:09:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like many people, I use my companions as pack mules for the junk and extra equipment I need to carry.  I was thinking of a way to save time, and I wondered if there was a mod that spurred companions to drop off their junk into the main workbench as soon as they entered the settlement.  They wouldn't have to even approach the bench, there could just be a notification that your companion has dropped off his/her junk into the main bench.

I was also wondering if anyone could make a more immersive mod to find your companions that didn't involve the console...  Like a radio where you can call them in to meet you somewhere, or to check in and give their general location in the form of a quest.  I've lost DogMeat again, and I hate using the console for anything because it takes me out of the experience.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [FO4] What lore-friendly weapon mods do you have? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-28 21:36:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been installing a bunch of mods on my fresh install, and I have been loading up weapon mods willy nilly without really thinking about it.

I have the DOOM Merged Set, Millenia's new gun, a bunch of the top files on the Nexus, and so on...  Thing is, I wonder if I'm cheapening the Fallout atmosphere by installing all these modern guns.

My rationale is that Fallout: New Vegas had a modern M4 in its vanilla roster, so all other modern guns can technically be canon too...

http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Assault_carbine

I also wonder about balancing these mods.  I have issues where a lot of Raiders will only be carrying one mod weapon that I've installed (The M14) and I'm wondering if there's a way to make that more diverse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are so 'professional' because Japan is one of the most overworked societies in modern times.

When the idea that selling your vacations is considered normal business behavior, you know something is wrong.  True, they overturned that with governmental policy, but Japanese businesses still expect you to take no vacations, and they don't have the 'go to college when you're 40' mentality that America does.  If you missed the boat in your early 20s, you are already behind the curb...  And look at what you're competing with...  How are you supposed to get into a job market like that?  You're expected to have a job 6 months out of college in Japan, or you are already a disappointment.

The work ethic is definitely something to be admired in Japan, but it seems like, to me, that the cost is a unhappy populace.  It's why you are seeing birthrates declining, less marriages...  Go on a subway train at 8 AM on a weekday in Japan, and tell me that these people look happy. </TEXT>

I was wondering what weird or interesting dinner places, besides Robot Restaurant, are cool to see in Tokyo?

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

So, I don't know if you all know, but there is a Sumo Wrestling Tournament going on from September 11th onwards.  Besides that, I know next to nothing about it!  But I'm going to be in Japan during that time, and I'd love to be able to catch a match.

So, my questions are:

1. Do we have to reserve seating for a match?  And if so, what site?

2. How much does it cost?  I got the impression that there are three tiers of seating, each varying in price.

3. Anyone wanna go see it together? :) My friend and I are interested, but it may be cool to get a small group together to see a match. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It still hurts.  I need a new series. ;_;

There's something about this show and how its characters view children that is just unsettling like anything I have ever watched.  The show's tone can be so nihilist with its complete hatred towards children and what they represent to the growing population.  Their lives are just thrown away at numerous moments throughout the two series run.  I think it's because the upbeat, yet disturbing, music and the vibrant splashy color offsets all the ultra violence presented on screen.  

Game of Thrones can show as many kids and innocent people being hacked up by swords as it wants, but nothing unsettles me the way Utopia does. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus, hell looks absolutely terrifying...  

That molar tunnel was unsettling as fuck.  I'm curious if this is going to just be a Amnesia/SOMA clone though.  The way the monster reacts to you made it seem like it was.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The scene I'm thinking of is a sort of 'wild hunt' with a Hutt.  Jabba's son Rotta is trying to impress his Father and other members in the criminal underworld, so he is giving jobs to my players.  One job idea is a morning Krayt Dragon hunt, where the players are riding about the dunes of Tatooine on 'horse-back' with Rotta while he rides on a barge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks good.  I like that they fleshed out the betrayal a bit more.  I'm hoping that there's some inner conflict with sideburns about betraying Clay for his Father...  Clay and sideburns seemed cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honesty don't get why this scene was the one that ruined the film for people...  To me, it was the awful pacing and how the film just couldn't slow down.  

Why wouldn't Allen dream of raptors while he's flying over the Island?  It doesn't ruin his character at all... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's also the [Roy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szzVlQ653as) version of the simulation theory.  Maybe you are special and everyone and everything around you is just NPCs in a gigantic video game.  To be fair, how do YOU know if the people you talk to are even real?  You can only perceive your consciousness...  Who's to say that the people around you aren't just elaborate AI machines that are indistinguishable from human? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, all comics done outside their creator's influence is fan fiction IMO.  Bob Kane couldn't certainly approve of The Killing Joke, or much of what has become of Batman these days...

AND YEAH, I know I'm gonna get, "B-B-But, DC made it so it's not fan fiction!"

Too bad.  I disagree.  It is fan fiction. </TEXT>

JAMES EARL JONES DID NOT DO VOICE WORK FOR TWILIGHT OF THE APPRENTICE.  He did some for the TV movie, the pilot of Rebels, but that's it.  They used Matt Launter and some snips of JEJ's previous voice work and spliced it together. </TEXT>

Nah, just kidding.  Good list, but seriously Under the Red Hood is the best of the bunch.  I may even like Red Hood as much as The Dark Knight. </TEXT>
