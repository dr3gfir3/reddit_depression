	<TEXT> Cheapest one at the hardware store is a good place to get started. It will be one temperature heated rod with no features and might die after a few years, but for $5.95, who cares. If you find you are interested, you can spend 30-60 on a solder station, which has a power switch, temp control, an iron holder and a cleaning sponge. 

There isn't much past that - even daily solderers just use something like that usually. 

I have a weller brand station that suits me just fine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice. Clark is a good place for psych. Undergrad psych is what most people go for there, myself included. The real value is in the free masters degree (fifth year) that you are eligible for if you have a good gpa. Psych is usually how people end up at Clark, but most people end up declaring a different major by junior year. The psych program is kind of dull during undergrad, but if you stick it out until fifth year, you get a great education. 

I also love Worcester - best food town in the northeast. And if you have any niche interests, there's a lot going on if you know where to look. 

If you end up with other questions, don't hesitate to ask! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the same as any inner city school for the most part. I know people who were mugged, but that will happen in Boston or Providence just the same. Honestly, on the couple of blocks campus encompasses, it's very safe. At night it can be good to walk with a buddy/group. Nobody ever messed with me, but I'm a ~200lb guy. There's cheap housing nearby, but the surrounding neighborhoods can be sketchy. $300 a month for rent, but people break into cars occasionally. On campus is fine though. 

Edit: congrats on your acceptance though! Any idea what you want to study? </TEXT>

You might be able to find premade earphone Y cables.  </TEXT>
