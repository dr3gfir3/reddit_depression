	<TEXT> #1 Old Gatorade that had been used like an ashtray. Was dying of thirst then chugged my friends Gatorade, got cigs and nasty in my mouth, choked on cig butts. 

#2  as a kid, I had a deathly fear of earwigs. When I saw one heading toward me on the carpet I got the bright idea to use a piece of paper  to flick it away from me. The earwig promptly split in two, with one end left on the carpet and the other end flinging up into my wide open mouth. Horrible incident.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking as an organic farmer who raises birds free range on pasture, it makes me sad to think of birds confined to such a small space. The purpose of chicken tractors is to move them frequently so that the birds always have access to fresh greens. In contrast, I don't think bees appreciate their hives being moved regularly(despite the fact that commercial beekeepers have begun to move their hives, which stresses the bees).This is not a good idea. How about free range birds with a stationary hive? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't move to California. There are already too many people there for it to be a sustainable place to settle, as is evidenced by many CA residents moving due to water scarcity. 

Also, please please don't try to keep this many animals in a city yard. First off, it would be illegal in most places, plus plain cruel to the animals. If you want this lifestyle, you need more land.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I found these books inspiring and helpful: 

*  *One Straw Revolution* and *Sowing Seeds in the Desert* both by Masanobu Fukuoka

* *Gaia's Garden* by Toby Hemenway

Also, it's okay if gardening isn't as much your thing as botany is! Just follow that spark and you'll find a place to contribute within the permaculture movement, whatever that means.

	<TEXT> Farmer here...Most seed packets will have germination rates showing what percentage of the seeds sprout, or grow, on average. Find out what hardiness zone you live in and then you can get a better idea of what you'd like to grow. Start small and have success and happiness. What do you want to eat? Give it a try! Also, no need for miracle grow, have a compost pile instead! Or try lasagna gardening to build up soil without tilling.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't even dignify the experience as your "first date". I bet that's still in your future. You're not alone.it's not uncommon to have at least one "ick" moment such as this when you're first starting to navigate the dating world and sexual experiences. Just remember that it's perfectly ok for you to be assertive and to let boys know what you're comfortable with. It's also totally ok to let your partners know what you want, and to value your own pleasure. If a guy isn't okay with that, then he's not worthy of you! Hang in there, this shall pass. There are good guys out there! </TEXT>
