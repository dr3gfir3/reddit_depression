	<TEXT> Similar to LeBron and Battier in Miami. Both have the size and strength to guard 3's and 4's. Ingram maybe better suited to guard wings, but PG is more than capable of defending 1-4. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you ever hear the tragedy of Derrick Rose The Bull? I thought not. Its not a story the NBA would tell you. Its a r/NBA legend. Derrick Rose was a PG of the Bulls, so powerful and so wise he could use his athleticism to influence the ball to create lay-ups He had such a knowledge of the game that he could even keep the ones he cared about from injuring themselves. The eastern conference of the NBA is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so talented the only thing he was afraid of was losing his talent, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught Jimmy Butler everything he knew, then his apprentice had him traded to the Knicks. Ironic. He could save others from injuries, but not himself. </TEXT>

LaMelo = A

LeBron = E

LiAngelo = I

Lonzo = O
