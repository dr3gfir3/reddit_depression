	<TEXT> There really aren't any writings about it that I know because it's not how Judaism works. There will be the writings on the exceptions. But the exceptions aren't sins, they're part of the rules.

For example, a person is commanded to eat the Passover sacrifice. But if you're ritually impure, you don't eat it. So there you have one commandment dependent on another.

But otherwise, some examples, kosher isn't dependent on Shabbos. Shabbos isn't dependent on who you're married to. Yom Kippur prayer isn't dependent on whether you're fasting or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shulevitz, a rabbis daughter who was raised on the Upper West Side, says her family was initially less than pleased at her choice of a career.

When I went to law school, it was considered a shanda (scandal) because women are supposed to not be seen so much in public. People tried to talk me out of it, said Shulevitz, who is single.

That's bizarre. Perhaps they mean the Upper West Side of Lakewood? I know a million frum female lawyers that are her age and even older. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Disliked the Kept Woman by Karin Slaughter </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 15:28:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the longest time I resisted picking up a book by her because I thought "Slaughter" was a gimmicky name for a mystery writer. But I got past that and took out the Kept Woman.

But I didn't like it and couldn't finish it. From the very beginning the writing seemed odd and the dialogue even worse but I thought maybe it needed some times to settle down. But it never did. 

Mysteries are supposed to be fairly breezily written. This was the complete opposite. It just dragged and dragged. Every scene went on far longer than it needed to. It's shocking that reviewers on Goodreads say it moves along at a breakneck speed - what are they comparing it to, War and Peace?

But worse than that are the characters. There seem to be five main characters, four of them women. That sounds cool until you realize that these four female characters have less personality combined than the one male main character. In fact, two of the women were so undefined that I couldn't remember which was which when they were in the same scene together.

And then there was the problem that male character was an emotional wreck but he was so woobified that it was nausea-inducing.

I found out after putting it down that this is the 8th book in the series. Maybe it comes across better if you've read the other seven books but at this point I have no desire to go back and read any of the others.

I am absolutely mystified by the glowing reviews and high star ratings. Do you read Slaughter? What do you like about her books? </TEXT>

There's no dialogue so I'm perfectly happy for them to make up whatever physical details they want so long as they preserve the point of the scene. 

Note that your director can and will override whatever you write anyway, so, basically focus on the best story you can write and don't sweat the details (even the sweaty details).

Thanks, maybe I'll add one detail to give more of indication what I'm thinking, but otherwise I'll leave it bare bones (heh). </TEXT>

A third category is when an important person does something that causes people to talk  even if it would generally not be considered an Aveirah (Shabbos 51b).  This is considered a Chillul Hashem because people will learn from him. The Gemorah explains that greater the person is the more careful he must be.

According to the SMAG #2 and SMaK #85, however, category three is even if is not an important person but a regular Talmid Chochom whose actions cause people to talk  this too is Chillul Hashem.  These authorities also say that when a Jew does any action that will cause Goyim to say, The Jews have no Torah   this is a Chillul Hashem.

	<TEXT>  Possibly minhag hamakom isn't the right phrase, but you get the idea - Americans have one standard of kashrut, Israelis have another, as an American you have to follow the American standard, as an Israeli you have to follow the Israeli standard.

That isn't true. Israel and America are exactly the same - they both have a range from meikil to machmir hashgachas and everybody has to decide on their own what they'll eat based on their community and their own personal opinion.

 I do believe the OU sets the standard for kashrut in America. I haven't been anywhere that the Orthodox community accepted something significantly worse. 

As I mentioned, in New York there are local rabbis who certify places that are open on Shabbos. For the OU this is a big no-no. Most MO people will eat in these places. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is incredibly bizarre.

First off, this isn't how minhag hamakom works. 

Second, minhag hamakom barely even exists anymore.

Third, there are many other Orthodox hechshers in the US aside from the OU and I'm sure their standards are quite low (one example - certifying a restaurant open on Shabbos). But low standards is not precisely the same as not reputable.

Fourth, this presupposes that one is treating the OU like their rabbi, as opposed to thinking of them as the dudes who happen to put little symbols on your food that make it a-ok to eat. 

Fifth, Americans aren't supposed to follow American rabbis and Israelis, Israeli rabbis. You're supposed to follow *your* rabbi, wherever he happens to be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Grand Budapest Hotel. And it's not based on a single book, it was inspired by the writing of Stefan Zweig. 

The end-credits for Wes Anderson's 2014 film The Grand Budapest Hotel say that the film was inspired in part by Zweig's novels. Anderson said that he had "stolen" from Zweig's novels Beware of Pity and The Post-Office Girl in writing the film, and it features actors Tom Wilkinson as The Author, a character based loosely on Zweig, and Jude Law as his younger, idealised self seen in flashbacks. Anderson also said that the film's protagonist, the concierge Gustave H., played by Ralph Fiennes, was based on Zweig. In the film's opening sequence, a teenaged girl visits a shrine for The Author, which includes a bust of him wearing Zweig-like spectacles and celebrated as his country's "National Treasure".
