	<TEXT> There are wide ranging issues in classifying gospels as eyewitness or apostolic accounts, first they're not as early as popularly believed, they all post date Pauline epistles, which itself were written around 50-58 CE and didn't make slightest mention of any written account of Life of Jesus and all Gospels were composed in Koine Greek using no Aramaic source.

Mark the first gospel was composed around in ~70 CE is a anonymous document and there's no hint or internal evidence about his Authorship. the tradition which ascribes it to Mark the Evangelist is a later one, and mark itself is based on various sources mainly collections of miracle stories found in OT. 

As per Markan Priority Both Matthew(80-90CE) and Luke(90-110CE) extensively used Mark as a source, copying him verbatim sometime even word to word(Mk 13.14-Mt 24.15) which you don't expect from a eyewitness account..

- http://www.progressiveinvolvement.com/.a/6a00d8341c3e3953ef01310f9a7fce970c-400wi

Also there are Some major interpolations in all Gospel accounts..

- [Longer ending of Mark 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_16)
- [Pericope Adulterae in John](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_the_woman_taken_in_adultery) 
- [Comma Johanneum at 1John 5:78](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_Johanneum)
- [Luke 22:4344](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_22:43%E2%80%9344)
- [John 5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_5#Interpolation_.28verses_3b-4.29)
- [Matthew 16:2b3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_16:2b%E2%80%933)
- [Doxology 6:13 of Matthew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_6:13)
- [Luke 22:19b-20](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Supper#Institution_of_the_Eucharist)
- [List of Bible verses not included in modern translations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Bible_verses_not_included_in_modern_translations)
- [List of major textual variants in the New Testament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_major_textual_variants_in_the_New_Testament)
- [Top Ten Deleted Bible Verses That Were Not in the Original Text](http://yuriystasyuk.com/top-ten-deleted-bible-verses-that-were-not-in-the-original-text/)

So as you see, all the evidence point against the tradition of Gospels being a eyewitness account and Pre 70 CE dating.      </TEXT>
