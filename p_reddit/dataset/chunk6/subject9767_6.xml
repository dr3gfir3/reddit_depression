I'm not looking for the hey, how're you, nothing much -end of conversation- type of person. Someone who loves to talk and really is looking for a legitimate friendship. Male or female, I don't mind. I like to go to the beach, go out for dinner, bowling, anything really. Even Netflix on a Friday night. I'm a very mature person but I know how to have fun too. All in all, I'm really looking for a friend to spend time with and get to know. Write me if you're sincerely interested. Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I apologize in advance for my noobness and don't know if this is right place for it. My PC came pre-installed with Windows 10 and the site said Windows 8. Every game I try to play, it will be fine and 2 seconds later, it stutters and I drop frames like crazy. Goes back to normal for about 5 seconds and then does it all over again and continues. I've read quite a few forums and couldn't find a solution and I've tried everything. I was thinking about getting a Windows 8.1 disc. Those of you who are/were on Windows 10, are you experiencing the same issue? Is Windows 10 lacking certain updates or patches? 

Edit (forgot the specs): Intel Core i5-4690k CPU @3.50GHz 
16 GB DDR3 
GTX 970 4GB graphics card 
1TB HD SATA III
600W PSU

	<TEXT> This is kind of a shot in the dark, so here goes nothing.. Hi, I'm Zach. 22 years of age. Typically, Im this silly guy with a mind that wanders often. A lot, actually. Im naturally very dorky And I tend to have erratic thoughts that flood out of my mouth in tumultuous waves.. if youre good conversation, anyways. If not, I warn you that I am sarcastic by nature. Im often told that Ive lived a life years ahead of myself, so if you enjoy being deep.. That's me. Dont be intimidated, though. Im humoured by the slightest of things for the weirdest of reasons, so I enjoy laughing a bit too much. And as clich as it sounds, I pride myself in finding beauty in all things. I really enjoy video gaming. I play some Blizzard games and love Nintendo. Oh, Im also real open-minded, so you wont have to worry about me being judgmental about anything. Just be yourself with me.. and if we hit it off? Beautiful. I honestly just like people and making friends, so talk to me anytime you like. Message me if you'd like :) Gender doesn't matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I'm Zach. I like to consider myself a chill person. I pretty much like everything. I love to laugh and joke about stuff. I'm a good listener. I'm not looking for the hey, how're you, nothing much -end of conversation- type of person. Someone who loves to talk and really is looking for a legitimate friendship. Male or female, I don't mind. I do kik. Send me a PM and we'll see how it goes!  </TEXT>
