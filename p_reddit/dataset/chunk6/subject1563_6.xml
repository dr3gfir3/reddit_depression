	<TEXT>  Most recently, I've seen people who have done a quarter of what I've done in the industry get my dream job and now they're set for life.

Many people will dismiss this if they read it but I absolutely agree. This happens to me all the time. People with 1/10th the talent and ability and hard work ethic walking - FUCKING WALKING - into positions I would excel at.

I use the anger though, the frustration, it makes me want to succeed even more - PETTY? So fucking what?

I don't know if this helps, it did for me. But maybe think about it. Channel the negative into this.

Good luck </TEXT>

 If you think drawing attention to this subs flaws is a bad thing, you're sadly mistaken. Especially with a subject such as depression.

Where did I do this? Please answer promptly as you have now smeared my name on here.

All I said was if it was done in a different way it would not have attracted the attention of the bad element that has been causing the problems in the first place.

 shouldn't have had to ask the mods in the first place

Subreddits change over time, many people may not have seen a problem. 

 I think if you are any representation to the way this sub is run, someone like OP should have made a thread a long time ago.

Would you please explain that comment in terms of the words I have used on this sub. If you cannot an apology would be acceptable.

 edit : and roaming downvote brigades. But as long as the select few feel special. I'll be subscribing for sure now.

I don't understand what this means. Who is feeling special? You are subscribing for what reasons exactly?

	<TEXT> Such a simplistic way of looking at it which completely ignores my point.

I never once mentioned freedom of speech, I said I cannot support the hate speech that is contained (depending on legal matters of your country) within.

Your simplistic fob off of my legitimate concern and the foolish reaction from the users on here is deeply worrying.

You who support the books or the film are making money for someone who is a well known public figure who espouses hatred (may incite or become a figurehead, especially for the young) and a high profile member of a church which if you are caught engaging in same sex acts results in a [trial](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disciplinary_council).
