	<TEXT>  Or liking the dialogue and giving it a two.

To be fair, *"the dialogue is both well stylized and easy to follow"* and *"cumbersome, direct lines that are difficult to believe"* aren't contradictory. I've read plenty of scripts with dialogue that leans more towards style, less towards realism/practicality. If a script tries to be Sorkin or Tarantino, it's likely to be stylized, yet cumbersome. 

So maybe this is what the reader is saying: the dialogue is stylistic and easy to follow -- it just doesn't click perfectly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not much to say about this game, except wow, I can't believe that Trebek literally tore Susan's head off and devoured her soul. I know this sub has criticized Trebek's behavior sometimes (often citing his age), but it's nice to see he's still got some vitality in him. Honestly, the retired librarian from Dayton, Ohio, didn't stand a chance. 

It bothered me a little bit that the correct response to every clue was "Who are, the Old Ones". I imagine it's just the end-of-the-week doldrums, but I expected the contestants to catch onto that quicker. 

Also, have we ever gotten a glimpse of the judges before? That was a nice peek behind the curtain. Their ominous chanting was a little hard to understand at times (which I guess is true for all hooded figures; the heavy fabric dulls the sound), but I'll admit it provided a nice distraction from an otherwise uneventful game. 

Congrats to the current champion; may the weekend bloodletting be swift and painless.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my experience (as a script reader), coverage is this: 

- Up top, note the script title, author, page count. And draft date, if the script has it. 

- LOGLINE: A concise one-sentence summary of the premise. For example, "*A New York cop must save his estranged wife from terrorists who have taken an L.A. office building hostage on Christmas Eve*."

- SYNOPSIS: A page-long summary of the story, covering the major beats from start to finish.

- COMMENTS: A page-long collection of your thoughts: what about the script worked, what didn't, and what could improve. In very simple terms, it's this: A) How inventive/original/dramatic is the premise? B) How strong is the execution of that premise? and C) How thorough are the characters? Is the story dramatic? Is it engaging? Is it original? Would you recommend it to your boss? 

- VERDICT: Verdict is one of three options: PASS (meaning it sucks), CONSIDER (meaning it's not great, but not bad), and RECOMMEND (meaning it's good). 

RECOMMENDs should be used sparingly -- only if the script's really fantastic.

CONSIDER is the one you really have to justify with your arguments, because it's kind of a weaselly answer. 

Some companies also use CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS, which is self-explanatory. You like some things about the script, but you also have reservations. 

A lot of studios/production companies will give you a coverage template to use, and you basically just fill in the blanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read movie scripts for a living, and every time I read a horror script, my mind keeps coming back to [Erin](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/powerlisting/images/c/cc/You-re-next01.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20140901011609) as an example of the perfect horror protagonist. 

Almost all the horror protagonists I read are panicky, insecure, running around -- *enduring* the madness, but not actually trying to negotiate it or influence it. Or, at best, they'll flail for two-thirds of the story, enduring all the horrifying sights, and then in the third act they'll pull themselves together and defeat the villain/slasher/demon/ghosts/whatever. 

And it never quite feels like a story  it feels like a showcase of cool horror elements the writer wanted to include. The protagonists are pretty much just reaction machines, or meatbags to be killed off by the cooler elements in the story.

But Erin? *Erin gets shit done*. 

While everyone else is panicking, Erin is running the goddamn show -- *Okay, here's what we need to do, here's how we're gonna do it, and let's go*. And she takes these fuckers **DOWN**. And my god, it is so refreshing to see a hero who immediately rises to the challenge, and who isn't just a damsel in distress getting spooked left and right. 

So cheers to you, you glorious Aussie badass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rise of Tarantino-isms. 

I will stand by my claim that Quentin Tarantino ruined a generation of screenwriters by making it okay to write lengthy scenes full of cool dialogue, all while the story gathers dust (which isn't even what Tarantino himself does). 

So what you've got now is writers mimicking Tarantino's style, but neglecting the substance underneath it -- What is the dialogue actually saying? About the characters, about the world, about the story? 

The weight isn't there, and the dialogue is just a bunch of cool words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I used the word rocker in replace of 'teddy boy'. The film is set in 1979 and revolves around the Punk v Teddy Boy culture-clash in Britain

Ah, I see. Wasn't familiar with that clash. 

I think it would help to mention it's not just the boyfriend: he's got his own gang. That makes it sound like a conflict is coming -- as opposed to one man against a dozen, or whatnot. 

But if the focus is more the girl running away from home (as opposed to a gang war), then I would include more about her and her life. The fact that her boyfriend is abusive, for example, and the fact that she's happy with her new life -- those are big ideas. It doesn't sound like a downward spiral; it sounds more beneficial than destructive (at least, until the boyfriend arrives). 

So maybe "falls in with a gang of punks" is better, rather than "hitchhikes with a gang of punks"? Something to imply she's more comfortable with them, than with her existing life.

	<TEXT> 1) "Catalyst to a culture war" is a very vague phrase; I'm not sure what that means. And it's not entirely clear how running away with a gang of punks starts that culture war. 

2) You could probably take out the "downward spiral", because that's kinda just a buzzword. *A reserved factory worker hitchhikes across the country with a gang of punks, sparking a gang war when her rocker boyfriend sets out to retrieve her*, maybe?

Although punks and rockers are a bit similar, in my mind, at least. 

Is it just the rocker boyfriend, against the gang of punks? Sounds like an uneven fight. How tough is this rocker boyfriend? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Day 570 of being stuck with the Gusenberg Sweeper </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-06 23:48:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wake up and it's in my hand. I didn't put it there, I didn't grab it  it was already there. No matter how many times I try to put it down. The Gusenberg Sweeper doesn't let me drop it. 

The man at Ammo-Nation should've warned me. Or did he? When I bought the gun, things were different. The days were brighter. I could choose what weapons I held. I had control over my life. And then I saw the sign in the window: *St. Valentine's Day Massacre - SALE*. The Sweeper looked beautiful mounted on the wall, as seductive as the call of the Sirens luring sailors to their doom. The man behind the counter assured me, "That thing could take down a moose!" I asked to hold it. And my fate was sealed. 

The first touch was electric. "Look at you two together, what a lovely fuckin' couple!" I wish I had recognized the pain in the man's voice. His smile faltered, a crack in the faade his heart was struggling to maintain. He knew the curse had just claimed another victim: once a man holds the Gusenberg Sweeper, he will never let it go. A weapon forged in the depths of Hell, seeking out souls to poison and destroy. 

I tested the gun as soon as I left. The results were satisfactory. But as the days passed, and the gun's novelty wore off, until finally I'd had enough, and dropped it in the parking lot beside Del Perro Pier  but the gun wouldn't drop. I tensed as a panic quickly engulfed me. I tried again. The gun remained. My breaths grew shallow. I tried again. The gun remained. I fell to my knees, furiously shaking my arm, letting out a croaking cry. The gun remained. I couldn't even scream.

Sometimes I think about ending it. A burst of ratatat fire and the sweet release of death freeing me from the taunting, cold embrace of steel and wood against my calloused palm. But I know the gun would find a new victim, and I cannot let the curse continue. I walk the streets of Los Santos, every step another burden, the Gusenberg Sweeper hanging from my hand. Most of the police have learned to leave me be, but every now and then a rookie stops me. Tells me to freeze. Tells me to drop the weapon. I laugh, to keep from crying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with every word. 

And this...

 they'll tell you that this guy is a bad ass.

...is specifically where a lot of problems occur: writers love to call their protagonist a badass. The first draft of *John Wick* fell into this trap a lot (and didn't entirely solve it, in my opinion). But it's harder for writers to actually *demonstrate* how their protagonist is a badass, aside from just saying it. 

So what you end up with is a protagonist described as a badass by every other character -- but when it comes time to demonstrate it he's just a standard action hero. </TEXT>
