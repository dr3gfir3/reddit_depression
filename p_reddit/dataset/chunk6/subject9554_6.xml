	<TEXT> My father always tells me about a story that involved a high school friend he had in the 50's. His friend was driving home from a summer job in his fathers new car when he fell asleep at the wheel. As a result, he took his foot off the accelerator and started slowing down, but at the same time he leaned on the door handle. The door opened and as they didn't wear seat belts, he fell out and onto the roadway. He then woke up and watched as his dads brand new car slowly ran off the road and hit a telephone pole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isnt enforceable. From Title 36 and note the term "should", not "will"

171. Conduct during playing

During rendition of the national anthem when the flag is displayed, all present except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. Men not in uniform should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should render the military salute at the first note of the anthem and retain this position until the last note. When the flag is not displayed, those present should face toward the music and act in the same manner they would if the flag were displayed there.

172. Pledge of allegiance to the flag; manner of delivery

The Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag, 'I pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands, one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.', should be rendered by standing at attention facing the flag with the right hand over the heart. When not in uniform men should remove their headdress with their right hand and hold it at the left shoulder, the hand being over the heart. Persons in uniform should remain silent, face the flag, and render the military salute </TEXT>

He talked in a light faux British accent and was wearing a fedora or something like it. When I told him that, he tipped his hat to me and said "Ta Ta".

	<TEXT> When I was in Junior High/middle school my wrestling coach was a teacher who was also a retired WW2 and Korean War Marine. (also 1979-1980) He had landed on Tarawa and fought at the Chosin Reservoir. An absolute bad ass. He also wasn't shy. After practice we would take showers in those old open bay showers and grab ass like middle schoolers do. 

Then one day, he steps into the showers while we are all in there. Nothing sexual, nothing perverted. Just something that was accepted back then. Holy shit...I'll never forget that day because I was amazed at this old mans Donkey Balls. They were hanging halfway down his thighs. Man O' Man. From then on his nickname was "Donkey Balls Olsen". Tough old bastard. I miss his no nonsense approach to everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will get buried but my senior year I got into an argument with this guy who was a pretentious prick. He was also the student Yearbook Editor.

My name was changed in many photographs by one letter (the teacher editor didn't catch those changes) from, for example, Tommy to Tammy (not my real name). The only pictures he didn't change were my senior picture as well as sport action photos. But he did change them in the team football and wrestling photo.

Fuckwad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a repost, but it fits the fainting helping discussion.  

Back in the early 60's, my grandfather was putting shingles on the roof of his barn. While doing it , he slipped and rolled off the roof. On his way off the roof, he hit the curved lip on the edge and it knocked him out. He then fell 20-25 feet and hit the ground. My mom found him laying there, unconscious with his pipe still in his mouth. Nothing was broken. I guess when he was knocked out he completely relaxed which saved him. Although he didn't have any broken bones, he was lucky because his landed only inches from a cement pad...and he was incredibly sore for a few weeks afterward. He was so sore that my mother told me that they had to tie a rope to the bedposts by his feet so he could pull himself up in the morning. They did call the ambulance and he was taken to the hospital just in case. After the ambulance had put him into the back of the vehicle, it wouldn't start back up so they had to use a tractor to pull it so it could pop the clutch and start it. Also, it was his favorite Corn Cob pipe. </TEXT>
