I finally decided to get help 2 years ago for my excessive anxiety too. I don't regret it. There are still days I feel anxious, but it's so much more controllable than it was. Seriously, good for you for making that call. I hope you get all the help you  need to get back on track!!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I cannot believe TwoXChromosomes victim blames. [Rant] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-23 19:37:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  Sorry in advanced for upset slightly whiney ranting.

This was my post on TwoXChromosomes for reference:

http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/2n4b2h/i_was_roofied_and_it_was_terrifying_ladies_please/

I went there to tell people, yes roofies do get slipped into your drink no matter HOW careful you are. It DOES happen and to be careful.

What everyone made it about was, you're a liar, it's your fault, you clearly drank too much, you have no idea what you are talking about.

Can we just talk about victim blaming for a second? IT'S WRONG. My story doesn't add up? I'M SORRY I WAS FU****G ROOFIED. I don't exactly remember everything. Actually no, I don't remember ANYTHING. I have a doctor's note stating what happened? Nope, OP is still lying. I state there have been rare cases of BAC raising with roofies? NOPE, who cares about the 2% that it happens to, she just drank too much. Stop lying OP. I state I don't EVER go above my limits. I DON'T get drunk. PERIOD. I am a responsible 23 old who wants to have a good time and not get drunk? Nope, I'm lying because I clearly don't know how I behave. I asked my friends how much I drank? Nope, they're lying to me too. Or the hospital is lying. I probably wasn't roofied. I'M JUST FLAT OUT LYING AND IT'S MY FAULT. 

Ok, back to talking about Victim Blaming. It's not right. It's just not.  Telling a girl it's her fault for getting roofied. She doesn't  know what she's talking about? That totally makes the experience... I can't even think of the word- not real? Derogatory? I don't even know right now. 

On that note, I didn't know where else I could possibly post to just let girls know that shit like that does happen. But I don't even feel like my message got across. And now I feel shittier than ever. I KNOW it wasn't my fault I got roofied. I KNOW I only had two drinks. I double, TRIPLE checked with the people I was with. I also KNOW myself better than anyone else. But you  know what, now I FEEL like it was my fault. I FEEL super guilty. I don't know where else to post or where else to get support. It's the worst feeling in the world not be believed about something like this. I feel like just screaming my lungs out. I KNOW ME. I KNOW I didn't over drink. SOMEONE PLEASE FUCKING BELIEVE ME. 

tldr; had two drinks, got roofied. Posted on TwoXChromosomes to let ladies know this shit does happen and asking them to be careful. Got Victim Blamed to hell- delegitimizing my experience and I feel like shit.

Edit: Yes, it's fine let the downvoting begin. They're just internet points for goodness sake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ladies and gents. 
I honest don't care if you think I'm lying. If you think I drank more than I did. If you think this story isn't adding up. If you want to bash me, whatever. I know how much I drank. Telling me I'm lying, telling me I don't know what I'm talking about, it's rude. And I'm not going to victim blame myself or second guess myself. I didn't write this post to get into and argument with people about whether I'm lying or not. Frankly, I thought TwoXChromosomes would be a lot more supportive, but that's also okay. I also won't be bothering to pay attention to anymore posts that attempt to tell me I'm lying. I have enough of guilt on my shoulders that I let this happen in the first place. 

What I wanted to get across here was WATCH YOUR DRINKS. This shit happens in real life. It can literally happen to anyone in any situation. I thought I was a pretty careful person but this still happened. I don't want to hear it happen to other girls. Cover your drinks with your hand, don't put down your drinks, If you leave a drink unattended,don't finish it and get a new one. That is all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [23/F]
Ladies. It can happen to anyone. I am a responsible adult. Yes I drink, but I never go over my limit. Never get blacked out, never drink more than is dangerous, never got in trouble. I was/AM a good girl. I social drink and that's about it.
I went to ONE house party 2 nights ago. Just one. The first time I've gone to a house party all year. It was a friend of a friend's. I poured my own drinks, kept it in hand. I was being safe. When the host turned off the lights for 5 minuts, I thought nothing of it. I was just chilling with my glass in hand, people bumping into me occasionally. What no one knew was that I decided to leave the party early because I was tired and wanted to stop drinking. I left and went to a bar to just hang out and meet other chill friends. Next thing I know, I'm on the bathroom floor unresponsive. They took me to the hospital and said I was really lucky I left. They said I'd been roofied and that I had a bad response to the roofies mixed with alcohol. My Blood alcohol level (from just having two drinks) shot up to .28 I'm lucky I didn't finish that drink or I would have been even worse. That's pretty high and that's when they knew there was something wrong IF I was not lying about the two drinks (which I swear I wasn't.) 

Main points: it was terrifying, it was scary, I still have a headache two days later, and I am absolutely terrified to drink again, let alone go outside again. I know I was lucky. I don't even want to imagine what would have happened If I had stayed at that house party or if I had had a normal reaction to roofies. I could have been assaulted or raped. Thank god I wasn't.

My mother believes and supports me without question. She has been fantastic. My other relatives....they think I'm an alcoholic and a slut. I can't change that and it sucks.  They don't believe I was roofied. They think I drank too much and am lying about the drugs. I'm not. This shit happens in real life. 

The guilt sucks. You know it's not your fault, but someone you just feel like in some way it is. Why did I have that drink? How did I let myself get roofied? Was I really dressed in a way that made guys think I was easy? I know, it's not my fault, but the guilt doesn't go away so easily. 

Ladies, PLEASE be careful. I'm begging you.

EDIT: to normal BAC scale

EDIT 2: No, I won't be pressing charges, but I DID tell the police and local campus security exactly where it happened, and to deal with it as they saw appropriate. Why I'm not pressing charges was a decision I made myself. I want to remain annonymous and I want to put it behind me. I told the police because I didn't want it happening to other girls. Other than that, I want to put this behind me. Please respect my decision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This contains major spoilers, so don't read this if you haven't read HoF.

Ok, please tell me some of you on reddit have read the third book in the series because I literally just finished it this morning and cannot concentrate in any of my classes. Oops. 

1. WHAT THE HEC CALAENA AND CHAOL? Mass basically uilds up their relationship from book one and we finally see them together in book two and everything is glorious. And at the end, you're like ok, he's mad, she's mad, they'll get over it. BECAUSE THEIR LOVE IS ETERNAL.  And then, without even meeting each other He knows it'll hurt but decides to get over her and she takes of her amethyst ring and feels a weight lifted of her shoulder.
No. NO NO NO NONONONO.  Stop it. Don't just build up their relationship and tear it down without them even meeting. One problem, and they call it quits. No working it out, nothing. STOP. MY SOUL IS CRYING. I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

2. Anyone else ticked that Sorscha was just used as a plot device to spur Dorian into action. After Sorscha came in, I just cannot see  Calaena and Dorian together ever again. WILL HE NEVER GET HIS HAPPY ENDING??

3. Chaol, why are you such a god damn Wimp. PULL IT TOGETHER  MAN. AHHH

4. Rowan. Rowan was such a great addition. The only way I will forgive Mass for breaking up Chaol and Calaena is if she get together with Rowan. God, they were such a dynamic duo.  The bantering, the love. STOP TELLING ME THEY ARE FRIENDS. YOU KNOW THEY AREN'T. 

5. Mannon. What a bad ass. I didn't like her stories at first,  but it grew on me.  And Abraxos. What a sweetheart. 3

HOW DO I CONTROL ALL THESE RAGEY FEELING!??! </TEXT>

It will be hard at any age, but I'm sure with your support after the divorce by showing them you still love them and can now concentrate on being an even better father versus worrying about your marriage...they'll appreciate it later on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was awesome.

After being in a two year relationship, I was really feeling down, sad, etc. You know the drill. My friend URGED me to get a vibrator. I was so hesitant at first. I just felt so embarrassed to use a sex toy. Was I really that needy/desperate??? Yes I was. And it was worth it.

So I bought one and...I LOVE IT. How did I live without one for so long!? Why did I depend on others to give me this feeling when I could do it on my own twice as fast!? I'm feeling so much sexual freedom right here you guys, ahhhh! 

I just had to share the story, and thought this was the best place to post :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you are in the EXACT same situation I was in...exactly one month ago. Wow. I didn't even notice today was the day.  My ex-SO was really hurt and sad about it too and pretty much said the same things to me. I also cried and hurt so SO much. I still hurt. But listen. The first two weeks are definitely the hardest. I STRUGGLED to get through them. Let me tell you my do's and don'ts maybe they will help me.

DO
1. Spend every waking moment with friends possible. It helps keep your mind of things.

2. If you like exercise do that. WITH PEOPLE. I like dancing. So I went clubbing. A LOT. 

3. make a list of things you gave up that you enjoyed (maybe unintentionally) and will now strive to do those things. Make them short terms goals. Not oh, i'll do them soon. Say, I'll do them at THIS day with THIS person. Make the plans real.

5. Do eat healthy. it helps. really it does. Also fluids. You've been crying a lot.

6. DO let yourself mourn. Take some time off whatever you are doing. Relax in the evening. Don't try to do hw (if you're still in school) if you don't have to. Take time to rest and do other things. Forcing yourself to act like everything is normal doesn't work. It's not. You have to make a new normal routine and that's why you can work on.


~~DON'T~~
1.Don't let him define your life. He let you go. He let go of someone that would have never given up on him. You are letting someone go that was more than willing to give up on you. 

2. Don't sit in bed and think. You will just cry. I liked to get my mind of it and read. Unlike tv, reading takes actual concentration and you will soon find yourself taken by the plot. I can suggest you SO many books. Just tell me what you like if you are interested.

3. Don't talk yourself out of going out with other friends. You need this so much right now. Talk it out with them. Let your feelings go with them. Spend time with them when you were supposed to spend time with him. Soonish...the times you were supposed to be with him will be associated as time with your friends. I'm only one month into my break up and i'm telling you this helped me the most.

3. DON'T SLEEP. if you can't. 4 hours of good sleep is better than lying in bed for 9. It won't always be like this. Trust me. Get up, read, journal, color, watch tv, whatever. DO NOT just try to sleep with your  mind full. I just stayed up slept when i was sleepy. Like to the point i was so sleepy I couldn't think anymore. It's ok to let yourself do this for a while. It won't always be like this. You'll go back to getting normal sleep soon. It really did help for the first two weeks though.

Now...I have a lot of anxiety. And most people say DON'T do this...but it really helped ease my anxiety. 
My ex-SO and I decided to continue texting after our breakup. BUT ONLY to alleviate feelings. Like hey i REALLY miss you. IS this right? etc. I miss sleeping with you. I miss watching this show with you, i miss your smile, etc. He would in return usually say something along the long page. Because it's not like he didn't care. He missed me too and it hurt him to break up with me. BECAUSE OF THAT REASON, we were able to share the pain of the break up with each other and get over it together. Soon, the texting got less, and emotions are not as strong and I barely text him anymore. But it helped SO MUCH at first. Because you are in my same situation, I recommend you talk with your SO and see if this is an option for you. Rather than going cold turkey. That would have given me SO MUCH anxiety..

lastly, FEEL FREE to PM me. I will talk with you. I will support you. PLEASE. DO. THIS. 

Lots of love and positive vibes. You are strong girl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If any of you haven't read it, I just finished Exquisite Captive by Heather Demetrios
[link]https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18106985-exquisite-captive

This book was just SO SO powerful. The characterization was complex, the world building was on spot. A few too many flashbacks and get this, the "villain" is part of the love triangle- which was written SO spectacularly. I hate love triangles, but gods, this one REALLY worked. It pulls at your heartstrings SO much. Every lover of YA lit Romance and fantasy needs to read it and fan girl with me here. My heart strings are still being tugged on from the aftershock of the ending. 
PLEASE READ IT. AND THEN MESSAGE ME SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT. I know you will want to. Trust me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished reading Exquisite Captive by Heather Demetrios.

The part at the end where [spoiler](/s Malek, the villain that he gave up his evil villainous ways because he knew he could either have ultimate power or Nalia's love. And he chose Nalia's love. AND THEN SHE BETRAYS HIM. And his heart breaks and he turns evil and cold again.) It just broke my heart SO MUCH. MY SOUL IS CRYING. BUT IN A GOOD WAY. FOR The characterization is so complex and real. My heart still hurts from the raw emotion of that scene. 
For anyone who wants a fantasty romance that leans towards a slightly more mature audience, this is for you. If you do happen to read it, please hit me up and mourn with  me. I'm dying a little on the inside. It was SUCH a powerful seen. </TEXT>
