	<TITLE> I know the universe is expanding at an accelerating rate - but has the rate at which it is accelerating (jerk) been observed by scientists? Does the jerk of the universe's expansion mean anything? </TITLE>

	<TITLE> [TOMT][MUSIC VIDEO] A scary video (I think it may have been a music video) featuring an old lady in an industrial setting and a skinny old guy who had a freaky yell </TITLE>

	<TEXT> All I can recall is that the video was featured on an old teletoon show (I think it was Station X) and there were people in an industrial setting outside of some old warehouses, and there was a freaky looking old guy (I think without clothes on) who was bald and had a very creepy looking scream. There may or may not have been an old lady in the video as well. </TEXT>
