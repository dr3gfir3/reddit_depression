	<TEXT> Yep, The pasta was a little under cooked, The problem is that i needed to make the dough thinner, that way it would have cooked more evenly ! but it was my first time ever making the dough and forming the ravioli, Quite pleased anyway :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sauce is what the beef ribs were braising in. It consisted of red wine and beef broth. I reduced the sauce down and added cream to reduce the richness just abit and add more texture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Trust me their was no need for any Gorgonzola on top (although it sounds interesting), the flavor profile was already amazing as is, trust me. 

I chose to just put parsley on top to cut through the richness of the sauce at times. The lemon zest i think would have been a good idea, but the garlic i would leave out, only because i used the garlic that i braised the beef ribs in with the sauce and the filling. 

Truely appreciated that you noticed that a lot of time and effort  was taken to produce this dish. Thank you so much for the ideas and compliments ! 

P.S I did add much more sauce, that amount was just for presentation :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't agree with the above point you have made. Muscle does have exceptional flavour. One of the most expensive cuts of beef for example is the filet Mignon, which is a very lean meat and has superb taste.

I totally agree that fat enhances the flavor and makes a big part of it. but it's wrong to think that muscle has no flavor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the information !! The main reason I post my pictures here is to get feedback from people and improve and try new things.

Would you be kind enough to give me a recipe or a link to find the authentic chicken satay you are mentioning ?  I would mainly like to see what ingredients the sauce and marinade contain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I Find it difficult to believe that you found a marbled chicken breast, I have never heard of such a thing. Plus the chicken breast is an extremely lean part of the chicken.
 
In any other type of meat (Pork, Veal, Lamb, Game animals) it would be great to find a marbled piece of meat as this keeps the piece of meat juicier once cooked.

Marbling is just intramuscular fat (fat deposited into the muscle's) which when cooked it melts making the meat tastier and juicier.

Hope this helps ! </TEXT>
