	<TITLE> Easter revision courses: What's your opinion? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-08 13:01:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't quite know where I stand on the easter revision course. Ultimately anything that benefits the student is good. Students that have missed out on a lot of material, for whatever reason, have an opportunity to catch up without the burden of the teacher having to print off reams of notes for one person. However many of my colleagues disagree.

One teacher that I work with believes that the easter revision courses give students the impression that all they need are a lot of quality notes and sample essays, discouraging them from actually doing any work themselves.

What's your take on the matter? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many of my colleagues have spent time in the UAE and they have all really enjoyed the experience. Particularly my female colleagues, maybe it's wrong of me but I assumed it would be a difficult experience. Either way they had serious craic over there. Anecdotally I've heard that that the students are all rather difficult to teach but that's only a small part of your experience. Do get advice from others who have been.

An okay site to look at to get started would be:
http://expatteaching.com/component/content/article/75-teachers-from-ireland

However you should look around and get more advice from other expats and teachers who have been. Your salary and benefits may vary depending on the company. But when I looked into it last year most offers paid for my food and accommodation not including pay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While there exists another subreddit for teachers here, there has been no activity for two years and nothing was ever posted. So I have set up a subreddit for anyone in the teaching profession in Ireland and expats that are now teaching abroad.

The aim of r/IrishTeachers is to provide teachers working in the Irish education system a supportive community that offers the professionals a space to share advice and take part in meaningful discussion about their careers.

Check it out r/IrishTeachers </TEXT>

In 99% of cases I've found a workaround, some harder and some super simple. Just one game that NEVER worked. I don't think steam should be held hostage to users that can't look up a message board but for the seriously dysfunctional cases a warning would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that's fair enough.

Most importantly, Steam 'is just the vendor'. The overall functionality of the game should be sorted with the provider. Yeah it'd be nice if steam included all patches but that's not their job.

A simple warning "There have been known compatibility issues with this game" would suffice.

But also, only if its on the scale of thousands. If all it requires is a .dll file then Steam shouldn't be held hostage to completely helpless users. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, to their credit they have always been really good with returns in my experience. But even a warning like that would be good, might reduce some of the negative feedback at least.

In terms of common sense, I would say there is a spectrum of skill required to install some games. For some its simply running in comparability mode, for others it requires you to install several programs and basic coding. Its a slippery slope in terms of what they are allowed to get away with,. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Authenticity vs Originality: Should game titles be bound to cannon? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-06 15:21:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen debates on the authenticity of a game's story played out many times. How bound to the original concept must a game be in ordered to consider it great? There are two issues that I see here:

First of all, the game series. Titles such as Fallout and The Elder Scrolls have volumes of Lore, the Fallout Bible considered by many as the ultimate guide for what is and what is not Fallout material. Whether Bethesda, Obsidian or a new Developer take over the next Fallout project, should they be bound to the cannon to the letter? Yes there are certain elements that make up the game as a whole, the history, the super mutants, the vaults, but what if a new concept is created by the developers that would make a truly awesome game but would also go against the lore?

"Then its just not a cannon game, there are plenty of non cannon fallout games..."

Yes but one of the reasons that these games are not considered equal to the main series is that they were not cannon. Flawed games but that term "non-cannon" is like a scarlet letter. Why bother playing it? Much like real life, facts are only truth until a new truth is discovered. What if the next title completely rewrites the source of FEV or one of the original protagonists?

Secondly, the titles, standalone or series, that come from other media. Batman, Lord of the rings etc. There was a recent discussion on the validity of "Shadow of Mordor" because of the non cannon elements. To be clear, I have not played this game myself.

In the same way that Christopher Nolan took his own approach to the Batman Universe, should developers not be entitled to the same? While many non cannon games are great, there is undoubtedly a black mark over them, they're not allowed sit at the same table as the Cannon games. Is this fair or is the distinction between cannon and non-cannon an important one?

	<TEXT> Oh well that's fair enough, a lot of that reads like the bible it's quite hard to get through, impressive work by Tolkien but really complex.

The hobbit is my favorite book but I think the movie was right to make the changes it did. Most of the boom is walking and talking and would have made a shite movie. Without having played that game (I definitely will now) I would be supportive of people taking artistic licence to produce a great piece of work as opposed to sticking to lore for the sake of it. </TEXT>

If the "Return of the king" game has Mr blobby as the main antagonist I'm gonna be like.. hey what's up?
But if somebody wants to have a shot at a general LOTR universe styled game then cool. If it's a good game it's a good game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Steam has, in my opinion, quite a reasonable returns policy, one I've used more frequently than I would like. But shouldn't they have a responsibility to words customers in ensuring that the game they are selling me actually works on my PC?

I'm not talking about basic System requirements like RAM and available space, that lands squarely in my responsibility as a consumer. But what about games that don't work on certain systems? Leaving us to crawl through pages of FAQs to find a patch or dll etc...

Perhaps they could offer games pre adapted for your system? Or do as android app store does and only make titles available for the appropriate systems based on your hardware?

Having spent hours trying to get KOTOR 2 to run on Windows 10 I gave up. Sure I got my.money back but that's no the point. I wish they would simp take responsibility for the titles they are selling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've managed to get through every game on my "to-do" list and looking for the next. The problem is I can't think of any PC available titles, yeah I can look up random titles but how would I know what's any good?

I loved the Dark Souls, Fallout, Elder Scrolls, Splinter Cell and Arkham Series. I've also replayed a lot of older titles, wasteland, portal, Deus Ex etc.. Basically looking for a good RPG to some degree.

I did my best with Bioshock 1 2 but just found them.to.be tedious shooters. Beautifully styled but repetitive.

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

Edit: Witcher 1? Is this worth my while? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Will Dark Souls 2 run better on my PC than Dark Souls 1 Prepare to die? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I understand that normally with sequels there is a bump in graphical requirements. However my PC runs 8gig if RAM and has no problem with any other modern game I've tried at high detail.

Both games are at 2/4 gig of RAM yet DS prepare to die runs incredibly poorly which is worrying considering the graphics are not wonderful.

I have heard that DS1 was never made specifically for the PC but DS2 was. Should I theoretically be able to run DS2 smoother than DS1 or does the series just not run well on certain PCs?  </TEXT>

Biggs and Wedge(any variation), Lara Crofts Butler, That Russian sailor from Deus Ex "I spill my drink!" Aku Aku...

	<TEXT> At the time the Devs would simply look at them as a reference, intended or not. It's harmless, funny.

Ten years later I imagine the Fallout 3 Devs looked at the Wanamigo and just thought "That's a lawsuit right there". </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why does the PC version of Dark Souls (Prepare to die) offer console commands instead of PC keys? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-02 11:46:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm finding a few issues with the game, having recently aqcuired it. The biggest issue is simply the fact that console commands come up "Press A to loot" etc.

Is there a version which has actually been adapted to pc properly?

The other issue is a strange one. My PC is high spec and bought recently, however I find the graphics don't run as smoothly on DS1.

Was this game never properly ported for pc or have I fucked up somewhere down the line on my end? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's literally the first thing I thought of when I saw them in 2, I don't think they ripped them off exactly but I find the two creatures veeeeeeery similar.

But I would think that putting them into the 3d universe would have made the similarities more realistic. Perhaps that's why the planned Wanamigos in 3 were supposed to be a mutant variety of the original form.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The concept art was available but there wasn't much by way of game files for people to use (I stand to be corrected on this) so I would believe that was a modfer issue. Buy yeah I think I would have lost it had I seen something like that in the capitol wasteland. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That makes sense. Avellone clearly wanted to stick to the cannon, although I think Bethesda and obsidian like you said wouldn't really care. But it's probably a dev somewhere that's making the decision to ultimately put in a little monster here or there. I think the bible is cannon but all bibles are subject to alterations no?

	<TEXT> Well I guess they were torn between stepping out on their own and making a point or trying to respect the previous games. Moving away from the isometric model must have opened doors for the Devs so I'm.not surprised. Also haven't heard of the lamprey floater but I'm going to assume it's water based. Not enough water fiends in the series for my liking!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was very little in the way of creatures that were not carried over to Fallout 3, NV and 4. For such a unique and powerful creature not to.be carried over to me seems odd. I wouldn't think that it was a case of there not being a relevant place for them to exist. They had escaped to the wastes like the Deathclaw. 

If they were going specifically for the research facility feel then there could have been a few at the enclave base or vault 87 in 3. Most of the DLCs in NV would have supported them too (I feel).  </TEXT>
