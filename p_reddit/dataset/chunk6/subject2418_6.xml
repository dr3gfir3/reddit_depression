	<TEXT> In my family, my grandpa passed away and his girlfriend survived him. Then her son passed away in a car crash. At his funeral she collapsed and passed away. It was a rough time.  
  
-Thanks for all the kind words, and your similiar stories; I really don't like spreading sadness so let me try to make this beautiful: human existence is such a powerful thing that we have the ability to love others so dearly that to lose them from this earth can make life end. Love, and others in your life, are your life. Cherish them dearly, hold them nearly. You are *here* for each other. Love so often exists unspoken, and yet is so incredibly present. Live in love, let it show, and it will grow. </TEXT>

The way they blindly instantly accept dubious allies, gleefully lash out at our oldest allies, cheer on the punishment of people based on no evidence.. is how people end up in concentration camps. Honestly if Trump says jump they do, so what if Trump says my administration is being threatened by a jewish cabal? Or by all muslims? What will those folks who question nothing do? I haven't seen them disagree with the man yet, and have seen them so easily whipped up into a mouth-foamed frenzy, I suspect they would not question, but automatically agree. </TEXT>

And Rex has 250 million in Exxon stock, so, any sweet deals he cuts, he will benefit from. Oh, and he has no fucking diplomatic foreign policy experience. Oh, and, he in no way represents draining the swamp. In fact, it somehow seems not a single one of Donald's selections does, yet... Donald's supporters are not complaining. Literally bait and switch, clear as day, they got hoodwinked so rich people could get rich, and they're still meme-ing their asses off. </TEXT>

It's part of the fake news era. They always jump in front of you with some distraction claim, rather than address the substance at hand. Another thought on this: it was funny, sometime around Saturday morning all of putin's babies found their talking point at the same time: "evidence" -- literally, I was following all this quite closely and was posting on it, got hundreds of "evidence" responses all at that time. It's like they get their talking points from a ministry of insecurity or something.  </TEXT>

Even just the way every single player is ready for the solo to explode from the end of the chorus, and boy does he kick off. Switching with perfectly matching attitudes against Dickey Betts. Continually returning to the main theme but making it new each time. It simmers up it simmers back down and gradually, a tension is built that unleashes in a heaven cascade of shimmering sound. I say that if you wish to fully enjoy it, as it is a journey, is to not listen will doing anything else than listening, and led him take you along his on this sky ride. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What matters to me in this... is that Abbey Road was written as the last. I think if this were commonly understood, what they were doing would be better understood. They were saying goodbye. Side Two is the last hurrah, the combination of everything they've done sewn together into one single dear farewell. Hence "In The End" was the end, it was saying goodbye, with that one last piece of truth. I don't know if they knew it would be the end, but I have a feeling they had a feeling, and so they made their goodbye the best album side in history, the last will and testament of the Gospel according to Richard, George, Paul, and John. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 5 songs I think you should hear </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-02 15:32:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thought I'd try this. If you guys like it, maybe I'll make it a series.    
  
Here's five songs that kind of vibe together, that I thought you all might enjoy. Note that four of them are unreleased, I gravitate to the rawness that comes with such recordings.    
The theme here is.. **dreaming through**  
  
[Flaming Groovies - Around the Corner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_QkxIgnwxw)  
-my god this song is fun, and you could tell me it came out yesterday, I'd believe you. Instead it's from 1969. Absolutely delicious.   
  
[Dylan and the Band - All I Have to Do Is Dream](https://vimeo.com/158720985)  
-Little outtake from the basement tapes, I was only able to find it on Vimeo. It's a sweet little rolling rocker, nice guitar back up, clumsy but fun solo, padded thumping background drums.  
  
[Jeff Buckley - Just Like a Woman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh-PMHmd00o)  
-This cover is so awesome. From some unreleased (until a few weeks ago) demos he did in '93. His voice, of course, is like the Archangel Gabriel, but he does some really neat subtle little guitar moves that I find damn awesome.  
  
[Big Star - Like St. Joan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA7RaICr5XI)  
-This demo is just so mesmerizing.. I'll let this one do the talking.  
  
[Pink Floyd - Green is the Colour (live BBC)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XeWngFZaa8)  
-This doesn't even sound live, it's such a good recording. I'm not much a Floydian, but this one is just a dream. 
   
Here are the above songs [in a Spotify Playlist](https://open.spotify.com/user/1236835890/playlist/0z2GaWcQGOUNOjUnKil9KI)--
  
Thanks!   
(and for more curated quality, [here's my renowned spotify playlist](https://play.spotify.com/user/1236835890/playlist/1tQ2pv2vOvydj3YmRJ7pqB)  full of the most lovely of tunes of all genres) </TEXT>

I don't give a shit what they call themselves, the alt-right? that name is just fine. The devil wears many masks. I encourage everyone to fight them. That includes The_Donald folks, don't just try to disassociate yourself from these enemies of freedom, you have to speak against them as well. Honestly, if you choose not to do this, it will come back to haunt you, as you will be more and more tightly associated with them.

	<TITLE> The New York Times caused severe damage to the Alt-Right and /r/The_Donald today, I salute them for their work </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-23 07:32:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> They brought the [alt-right](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/22/alt-right-supporters-donald-trump-backlash-disavow-reddit-4chan?CMP=share_btn_link) to Donald's face, and he denied them. They are cowering.  
  
They ran [an expos](http://nyti.ms/2f0L9G9)
on the human damage an effort by /r/The_Donald and /r/pizzagate to invent fake news has caused. This exposure resulted, directly, in /r/pizzagate getting shut down this afternoon. Right now at /r/The_Donald they are losing their minds, claiming /r/spez is a pedophile defending them, or bought. Their mods are giving them places offsite where they can carry on their sinister plottings, and telling their users to keep quiet for awhile, as they are under heavy scrutiny. Predictably, this has resulted in some of them saying their mods are in on it. Take a look over there, their rabidness is on full display. It's funny, they sent the NYT a ton of salt this week (to say they are "salty" for how Donald won) and look at them now. It is likely that the NYT will face more attacks from them, what form this will take, I cannot guess.  
  
So today The New York Times exposed two realms of evil, and gave them great injuries, only by asking people question. That is the power of focused, inquisitive journalism. 
  
I encourage, as I have before here, users to suppor The NYT and to message admin requesting /r/The_Donald be shut down.  
  
Today good took a small step on evil. Kudos, also, to any and all of you fighting these outlets of evil.

	<TEXT> Alright, I'll stop griping sorry. I don't think "accomplish" is the word to use, or the goal. For one, it was a cathartic release of pain at the prospect of spending four years under someone who has directly threatened groups of people (muslims, mexicans) who will be under his reign. It's anguish that the years of Barack will be followed by years with the lord of chaos. This will be broadcast nationally and so the nation, maybe the world, will know that the same town that stopped a Trump event also did not take his election kindly, or lying down, and got up and release rage about its prospect. It will let people across the country know that we feel their pain, and expressed it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erdogan is very powerful post-coup. Even assuming it wasn't setup, he used it to his advantage perfectly. The Kurds are a minority, exaggerated as a threat (like the US has been post-coup) to create an enemy for the Turkish people to bolster Erdogan and his party. He didn't invade Syria to stop ISIS in response to the airport attack, he did it to block the Kurds from getting close to the Kurds in Turkey. He wants to meddle in Mosul for this purpose too (Iraqi government is pissed about this) but so far he's been held on this by the US. He is making messes messier all for his own gain. It's a sad state of affairs for the Kurds and Turks who see through this alike, and for the state of mideast affairs in general. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my belief. It's time to give up. It's to *let Assad win*. Because he won. It's over. The rebels lost. Let Russia win this won, don't go full blown cold war unending proxy war. Tens of thousands more will die if not. I know this is sad to let a dictator and mass murderer win, but what can you do? If you don't let the mass murderer win, tens of thousands more die, and thousands more migrants steam into Europe, Canada, US, etc.
  
So what do you do now? Bring the rebels to the table for surrender, make sure they are secured their safety. Once that is completed target ISIS completely, get ISIS done.
  
My main concern is that because the battle map is so overlapping, sooner or later, US or Russia is going to blow up one of the other's jets and then god only knows what we're in for. </TEXT>
