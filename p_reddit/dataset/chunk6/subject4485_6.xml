	<TEXT> Well cooking a potato or boiling some pasta is simple

but there's a reason many chefs keep learning after 40 years..

It's "Easy to learn, difficult to master"

Still, learning how to cook is great. how each individual ingredient can taste differently depending how its prepared/cooked and which other ingridients its mixed with, is an entirely different thing.

Set some simple goals to begin with, than expand from there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Data fra google maps, nu her ved 9:45 tiden, hvor der er en del mindre trafik end der er i "myldretrafikken":

Fra hvor jeg bor og over til min far:

Bil: 12 minutter

Bus: 45 minutter (+33 minutter)

Til min kreste:

Bil: 41 minutter

Bus: 1 time og 45 minutter (+64 minutter)

Til mit arbejde:

Bil: 12 minutter

Bus: 26 minutter (+14 minutter)

Og alt det er bare i den ene retning, s skal man jo ofte ogs den anden vej igen.

Alts, der er busbaner hist og her i rhus hvor jeg bor, men... det er jo ligegyldigt i langt de fleste tilflde, ifht at komme frem hurtigt.

Det er da umuligt en overraskelse at, folk foretrkker bilen fremfor en bus. Der er s mange fordele ved bilen, foruden du sparer en DEL tid hver dag ifht din daglige tur p arbejde og hjem igen. Dertil kommer der alt det andet praktiske bilen s ogs kan bruges til, nr du IKKE krer til og fra arbejde. Her i blandt, indkb, ture til familie eller p smferier osv. 

Har du nogensinde taget til ikea med en bus og handlet nogen mbler? nej. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a friend who asked me to build him a PC

i asked him about his budget and what he wanted to play... He said he's like to start playing something other than LoL but his current laptop could barely handle it. I showed him a few games on my pc.

He then said, he might as well get a higher end gamer, so he could really get into it. so i build him one, with his consent, i explained why he could spend less, showed him alternatives and such.

anyways. he ended up spending 3500 dollars (incl a monitor though) as i said he should settle with a 970 GTX, because the 10xx series was coming soon (this was before summer last year)

to this day, he has still only ever played league of legends on his PC... that's fine of course... just seems extremely stupid. </TEXT>
