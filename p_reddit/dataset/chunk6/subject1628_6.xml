	<TEXT> Either way they're nice. Some people think all replicas are crap, but this isn't true. I've seen some really well-done. I was joking about the Chinese school-children. Beauty setup. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha ok. Nevermind, you're not understanding the idea of a "comparison" to show the price change. I will keep looking because it is not as easy as "checking out the 3 big company's websites". 
Edit: I have read articles for the past 3 years stating that prices have increased. This will help as opposed to "checking out the websites in public view" so I have made a complaint to the CRTC because I have found ACTUAL EVIDENCE. You can go back to work now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, the new prices are in full public view, but without a comparison, the CRTC can't and won't do anything. I don't doubt at all that prices were increased but it helps to have the proof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP, do you have any documentation that "accidentally got leaked"? I'd be happy to contact the CRTC, but need proof that this is what has indeed occurred.  PM me if you need to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, about to make my 1st swap. I bought tiny plastic baggies at a discount ship, but also made seed envelopes to put into a bigger envelope. Which is the best way to go? I read that the seeds could mold in the plastic, but these seeds are so tiny I'd hate for them to fall out of the envelope and get lost.. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>
