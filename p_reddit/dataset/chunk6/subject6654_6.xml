	<TITLE> TSX ECU / Electrical system haywire? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-10 19:47:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, I had to drive my mom's TSX last week and I noticed something odd that I think needs to be looked at ASAP.  Something is a bit wrong with the electrical system of the car (I think?).

Examples:  
Rolling the windows down, they roll up

Increasing volume (from steering wheel controls) changes radio input/channel

Cruise control acting up as well.

Even though these are just minor things, I don't want anything incredibly important to fail because of a electrical problem while my mom is driving.

Thoughts?

	<TEXT> When you first start up the car.  It's almost a grrrr / revving noise, coming from the dash board area just for a second.  It makes the same noise when you turn the car off and open the door.  

My only guess is that it's the ECU starting up/shutting down?  I'm not sure, my dad's Acura does the same.  

edit:  it's not an engine-related noise.

Edit 2:  https://vimeo.com/198880987

Anyone know what this noise is? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my experience with my BRZ in the snow (copy/paste from r/ft86), album here http://imgur.com/a/tjztP:


Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff. 

We did not get stuck once!!

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo. This car amazes me.

And of course, we got very tail happy! 

TL;DR: If you plan on driving this car in the winter, get winter tires. I went all out with the Blizzaks with no ragrets.

Incredibly informative and the way it was put together made me feel like I was watching a top-notch, 20-minute documentary.  May's segments were always good, but this one was in a league of its own.  

On the other hand, yes this show is very scripted.  But that segment was so well put together that I didn't even think/care about whether it was scripted or not. </TEXT>

Cake day, so why not post this awesomeness?  Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back.  Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all.  Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice.  At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff.  We **did not get stuck once**!!

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow.  Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula.  We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo.  This car amazes me.  

And of course, we got very tail happy!  Just look at the (almost) 180 spin in the main photo :)

TL;DR:  If you plan on driving this car in the winter, get winter tires.  I went all out with the Blizzaks with no ragrets. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the past couple of weeks, I seemed to have been missing my Swiss Army pocket knife.  Nothing fancy, just the mini $15 one that has the knife, scissors and nail file.  The last time I remember having it was when I drove in to Brooklyn a few weeks back.  

I put the knige in my backpack's water bottle holder, which I soon found out has slits in it to expand and accommodate bigger bottles.  I drove my mom's car into the city and threw my bag in the trunk.  When I got back home, I learned that my knife was not in my bag, and I knew *exactly* where it was.

For all this time now, I have known it's just in the trunk waiting for me.  But I went ahead and bought another one on Amazon because I'm that fucking lazy and didn't want to venture to the driveway.  I wonder if I'll be lively enough to get the package tonight at the door when it arrives.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> On 20 July 1969, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed on the surface of the moon. In the months leading up to their expedition, the Apollo 11 astronauts trained in a remote moon-like desert in the western United States. The area is home to several Native American communities, and there is a story  or legend  describing an encounter between the astronauts and one of the locals.

One day as they were training, the astronauts came across an old Native American. The man asked them what they were doing there. They replied that they were part of a research expedition that would shortly travel to explore the moon. When the old man heard that, he fell silent for a few moments, and then asked the astronauts if they could do him a favor.

What do you want? they asked. Well, said the old man, the people of my tribe believe that holy spirits live on the moon. I was wondering if you could pass an important message to them from my people. Whats the message? asked the astronauts.
The man uttered something in his tribal language, and then asked the astronauts to repeat it again and again until they had memorized it correctly.

What does it mean? asked the astronauts. Oh, I cannot tell you. Its a secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know.

When they returned to their base, the astronauts searched and searched until they found someone who could speak the tribal language, and asked him to translate the secret message. When they repeated what they had memorized, the translator started to laugh uproariously. When he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant. The man explained that the sentence they had memorized so carefully said, Dont believe a single word these people are telling you. They have come to steal your lands.
