	<TEXT> The significance is kind of two-fold. First is sort of obvious from a commercial development standpoint...developing desirable flavors of marijuana for resale (in places where it is legal of course ;). But you could envision another scenario where a range of desirable flavors could be offered to patients who may be using the drug for pain management or appetite stimulation.
I'm not a cannabis expert, so  I dont know for certain the answer to the second part of your question. However, the based on how the paper is worded it would lead me to believe that the female plants produce much more of the compounds.    </TEXT>
