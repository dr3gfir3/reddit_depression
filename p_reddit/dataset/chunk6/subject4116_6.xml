	<TEXT> It's not really worth eternal crafting. Any build with the level of gear you'd have if you're mirroring items doesn't want the hybrid roll over a spell dmg roll. If it didn't already have the t1 spell crit maybe it would be worth it, but unless they're prepared to get rid of the spell crit, in which case it's back to prefix lock scouring, the hybrid roll kinda kills the potential unfortunately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   except for just the fact that there FAR more intersex people (even physically) than are reported

While I can't speak to the truth of that statement, I wonder as to it's relevance. Gender and sex are not the same thing, they are separate concepts.


 alongside the fact that people may not FEEL they are either social gender

I would question the validity of those feelings until such a time as there has been established a condition along the lines of gender dysphoria. I'm not interested in dealing with nebulous declarations of how people might feel. I once met a man who said he felt that he was a dragon, people might feel alot of crazy shit or they might just be acting out for some underlying reason. I don't see how playing into that helps the person, and I can see many scenarios in which it can be very harmful.

so i think including singular they/them to the mix is totally fine as well, i mean, it's already singular when attempting to be ambiguous, as 'it' is clearly marked as an inhuman pronoun.

I have no problem with they/them.

	<TEXT> Sure, ok, that's your point. Now you need to explain why that matters. So CwC is better in some areas than CoC. CoC is also better than CwC in some areas.

Now answer my question. If CoC was buffed in the way you want, would you then demand that CwC is buffed to put it in line with CoC? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, a language is an amorphous concept, so technically speaking *it* can't be damaged. What I meant is that it could damage the ability we have to effectively communicate using the english language. So, for instance, let's say we start using "xir" as a pronoun. But what does "xir" mean? If I say "xir was going down to the beach" a person who knows the words will know what I mean, but a person who doesn't will not. Now you might say that it's a simple matter of teaching this ignorant person what xir means. Not even getting into how you explain the definition of a pronoun which was created by a person to essentially specifically refer to whatever they might be, my main problem arises when you do this on a population scale with thousands and thousands of people all making their own pronoun. It's a short step away from either not being capable of effectively communicating, or having the majority of your vocabulary taken up by pronouns. Which is why, as I said, this specific issue wouldn't exist if there were a consensus. 

Not only that, but I don't believe it's correct to pander to people like this as I can see no reason to do so. I have very little idea why they do what they do, but I have seen no evidence for the reality they present. If someone is transgender then I will refer to them as he or she, whichever they like, and I'll do so because I understand that they have a condition, gender dysphoria, and not doing so is harmful. But I'm not aware of any condition which causes a person to present with a hereto unknown third, fourth, or in the case of New York City twenty nine genders. 

Humans are a sexually dimorphic species, with gender presenting in a modified bimodal distribution. There are men who act more feminine, and there are women who act more masculine, and there are even men who present as totally feminine and women who present as totally masculine. But the fact remains that it is bimodal, not trimodal or any variation thereof. </TEXT>

Wut? Now you're just blindly throwing out accusations. I have doubts whether you even know what that word means, because nothing I said follows a prescriptivist mindset, unless you're mistaking my mention of closed classes. And if that's the case, I'd suggest you're the one who should talk to some linguists.

All you've done is throw out petty insults and try and poison the well by associating my opinion with anti-science ideas. You're no man of science, you're an ideologue through and through. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit did you even read what I said?

Where did I say that the English language never changes?


Where did I say that the change in question is necessarily a bad thing?


I'll tell you, just to save time. I didn't.

What I said was many different groups all trying to force changes, some through legislation others through social guilt, is not a good thing. Especially when that change is targeted at a [closed class](https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-closed-class-words-1689856).


If people would like to present words, and hope that they one day become common speech that's fine. But that's not what is happening. What is happening is many different groups trying to force changes. 

Shakespear didn't try and pressure people into using his words. He didn't legislate for his words to be used. He wrote words, people like them, and they become part of common parlance and eventually part of the formal English language.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your statement:

 he stages literally every shot. never even spending the night in the outdoors.

His statement in the video you linked:

The way we film these things is over 6 days. And when I'm filming the live night stuff out I'm out with a sort of camel carcass, or up a tree. And then when we're not filming the night stuff I'll stay with the crew, ya know wherever that is. Whether it's in a tented camp area in the sahara, or a jungle lodge in a rain forest or wherever. But, um, yeah you need to kinda take the rough with the smooth a bit. 


Those are ridiculously different things. You're saying he sleeps in a hotel every night, he's saying that when they film him at night he is sleeping outside, and when they aren't filming the night shots he sleeps with the crew. Which makes complete sense.

	<TEXT> You seem to have misunderstood the purpose of Man vs Wild. The show was not designed to show people stranded in terrible situations how to survive, if that were the case it would mostly consist of Bear sitting in the same spot and occasionally gathering food.

The point of the show is to have Bear dumped into hostile environmentd, then do his best to survive while actively vying to personally reach civilization.

It is not an educational show that demonstrates survival tactics, per say. Rather, it's a show created for entertainment value that happens to include some survival tactics.

	<TEXT> Not weird, absurd. If we start acquiescing to the request to refer to people with pronouns they've conjured from their own imagination then we step into the realm of absurdity. We begin to cross the boundary of language having a logical structure, to anything meaning whatever you want. Pronouns are a closed class, and this sudden change many people are trying to inflict could have very damaging effects on the english language. If there were some sort of consensus as to these additions then it wouldn't be entirely unreasonable, though I'd argue that the method of control through legislation some are trying is fascistic, but there is no consensus. There is nothing even close to a consensus. </TEXT>
