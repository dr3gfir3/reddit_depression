	<TEXT> What are the steps to transforming emotional pain/emotions into music/writing?

I want to commit to transforming emotional pain/emotions into music/writing. I've been venting on here a lot and I want to be more productive and shift away from the helplessness/victimhood I am feeling. One step is through music/writing. I was always interested in music and writing and as I got older I stopped/ my focus shifted away from that. Now I want to get back to it. To be honest I was never really committed because of fear and insecurity but now that I want to take control of my life I want to do things that I'm interested in/love. 

Anyway for the people that use their own creativity to healthily vent their emotions, how do you do it? What are the steps to transforming emotional pain/emotions into music/writing? </TEXT>
