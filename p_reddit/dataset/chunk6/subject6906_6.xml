	<TEXT> Greek Life at every school has an element of racism or ignorance. It is very vain and superficial. Looks matter a lot depending on the sorority/fraternity. Some want to promote their image on campus, therefore, they will purposely select people who are physically appealing...while others may be focused on level of involvement.  

Ratio is mostly a Rutgers creation. It's a self-constructed way to commoditize the social-oriented girls on campus. If its their residence, they can choose to let people in or not at their discretion. 

The elitist attitude is definitely true. It all depends on what fraternity/sorority. Generally, the girls/guys who post a lot on Instagram represent the superficial ones. The number of "Likes" and self promotion of their weekly events is important to them, too. 

I wouldn't get all caught up in that as it does not represent true reality. Hot white chicks exist everywhere. Just because you see something on Instagram does not mean it's reality. People can pick and choose the pictures taken...edit them, and post only the pics they want to show the public. What you don't see is what is actually happening in reality. 

As a HS senior just relax and look forward to doing well in school.  The best advice I could give you is this...If you do well in college, it can open a lot of doors. Partying is a lot of fun, but it doesn't help you progress. Focus on doing well, landing a good job...and then you can do all the damn partying you want. Not to mention, smart girls...regardless of race will be more attracted to you do to success. 

Just be yourself and don't let social media/social environments dictate your progression as a person.

	<TEXT> Bust your ass academically and continuously inquire about the Academic Excellence Awards given out. You can also stay on the radar by getting involved on campus and meeting as many admins as possible. It's a form of networking, but can help if there scholarship ops that arise from involvement in certain programs.

	<TEXT> Discover will reward you for a consistent track record while using Discover It. 

It happened to me. I was upgraded to the Discover More Card and given a $2500 limit.  

The key is to pay all your balances on time and in FULL. To get started, purposely use the card on one or two high amount items that can easily be paid off.  

Ex. A printer for school ~ $100, a pair of shoes ~ $85

To build great credit, keep your balances stabilized. Do not carry high balances.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A class about personal finance should be a gen ed required course. Regardless of your major of interest, financial education is so helpful in every aspect of life. I hate to sound like some condescending @ss with a dad-bod, but financial literacy skills are practical and more applicable to the real-world than some of these useless mini courses. </TEXT>
