	<TITLE> Fake news about Elon Musk and "FEMA tunnels" is being spread </TITLE>

	<TEXT>  Global Goal Nine: Infrastructure of the New World Order - Elon Musk to Construct FEMA Tunnels under US Cities?

This was an actual "featured story" on Google News, meaning that when you click the "show more" link on a related story, it appears below it with the word "Featured." I found another version of this story on Facebook. It's from "The Christian Truther," but don't give it traffic. Instead, I'll just quote the crazy parts.

I don't know if this is organically occurring craziness, or a bizarre new front in the "Stop Elon From Failing Again" propaganda effort.

 America is set for a remodel in the coming years. According to Donald Trump, were going to rebuild our cities, and rebuild our infrastructure. While a remodel is needed, the architecture and plans are concerning; the latest proposal by Elon Musk is alarming, because of its similarity to the mysterious FEMA tunnels.

 Throughout 2015, Americans were concerned with Jade Helm 2015, Walmart remodels, and tunnels. In 2016, we were concerned with the possibility of Hillary Clinton obtaining office or Obama staying in office as president. For 2017, a new/old concern is arising  tunnels.

(Here it gives a basic explainer about the project, as well as hyperloops.)

 ... While Elon Musk is one of many who has made such proposals, it is important to note, that Elon Musk is also an adviser to Donald Trump. That said, Musks projects align directly with other globalist ideology that America is set for a remodel into a globalist country.

 Infrastructure proposals have come from other globalists as well, such as Parag Khanna who believes that America should become a full-blown technocracy. Parag Khanna sat as an advisor to Obama, while Musk is an advisor to Trump.

 Similarly, the United Nations has an agenda for the globe, set in stone in 2015, the 2030 Agenda sprung into being as a continuation of Agenda 21. Under Agenda 2030 are a set of goals for humanity. Goal Nine is currently in focus in regard to infrastructure.

 Having previously likened, Parag Khannas work to that of a United Nations plot, and Parags proposals to that of the FEMA Regions Map. Musks work is also strikingly similar to the United Nations ploy, agenda 2030.

 The Boring Company

 Elon has proposed various times that he would like to see tunnels under cities come about to alleviate the congestion and traffic. However, is there another agenda at play?

 For decades, people far and wide have warned about the coming FEMA tunnels; now Elon Musk is reportedly going to construct them, under US cities. Even though Musk has proposed it, Trump has to approve it. This means that currently there is no telling what the plans would be for underground tunnels  but it significantly appears as though the globalists are gearing up to construct the Megacities of the New World Order.

 The only question is, with Parag Khanna designing the FEMA map, through infrastructure, is Elon Musk creating the FEMA tunnels?

The end. I was fortunate enough not to know what FEMA tunnels were. An article titled "US FEMA DEATH CAMPS  WALMART TUNNELS  COFFINS  AMERICA IS FASCIST" wasn't as helpful as it appears, but after wading through other incoherent articles riddled with all caps, my general sense is that there are undercover FEMA camps hidden inside giant Walmarts, where people, maybe with Ebola, are being secretly jailed, and are dying, while mysterious tunnels lead to unknown destinations, perhaps top secret underground military facilities, and it's all going to unravel when martial law, which Jade Helm is practice for, goes into effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The respondents use two basic defenses. One is the generalized prejudice that "Koreans are racist," therefore their own racism is justified. It's awfully convenient that they can convict all their Korean targets with guilt, so that their own racism isn't their own fault or responsibility, it's merely justified punishment for others' guilt. And I'm sure they spent time translating the Koreans' comments to make sure they were guilty before being racist toward them.

But being an asshole is not justified by the real or imagined presence of other assholes.

The other defense is that it's a joke. Neo-Nazis explicitly use racist jokes to move the Overton window toward white supremacy. They literally admit and promote using racist jokes as a propaganda tactic. When people call them out on their racism, they lash out  "We need our safe space to call Michelle Obama an ape without criticism!" And then they demonize those who point out their behavior as SJWs. Because you're not supposed to care about the non-whites. SJW is just a more broadly applicable version of nigg*r-lover. You can use it to attack people who defend not just black people, but literally anyone other than racists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People actually got upset that the media was portraying it as a close race. This sub got upset at people who warned against complacency. I do believe people thought they were free to cast protest votes because they thought Clinton would win, though. Many people said they would vote minor party or stay home unless it was close.

The big problem, though, was the FBI repeatedly, falsely, criminalizing Hillary for two years. And they can do the same thing in 2020. They literally don't need to have a case to falsely criminalize Trump's opponent. This is how a country's security forces install a strongman.

Russian disinformation and hacking also hurt, but the FBI's eternal email drama was the big story that killed her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stein was given a legal path to a recount. She turned it down despite being given more than enough money. (The court requested a $1 million *refundable* bond to guarantee payment when she has $7 million.) Now she's pursuing a completely meritless federal case so she can pretend she tried to pursue a recount, after which she'll just throw up her hands and pocket everyone's donations. Stein is running a scam. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jill Stein is untrustworthy. There is no federal right to a free recount for someone with no chance of winning. This is a path to keep the money. When sued by donors, she'll be able to use the defense of "I tried to conduct a recount, but the courts didn't let me," when in fact she had the money to pay for a recount the legal way and turned it down. She's already said she's going to keep the millions she doesn't use for recounts rather than refund them, and she keeps raising her cash goal to drain more Democrats.

	<TEXT> That U6 number has now fallen within the normal range and is continuing to fall, a big improvement from 17.1%, showing that the job market is improving, not falling behind. The record-high number of retirees due to baby boomers and longer lifespans is skewing labor participation figures, which is what that aggressive and not universally agreed upon 250,000 number is based on. Any measure of the health of the job market has to look at the actual job market, not everyone 16 and over, which includes students, stay-at-home parents, the disabled, retirees, the independently wealthy and others who simply are not looking for work and are not an indicator of how easy it is to get a job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Labor participation is skewed by the non-participation of elderly retirees, who now represent a greater share of the population than ever before, thanks to the baby boom and longer lifespans. If you want to understand the real economic situation of people, you have to understand that not everyone 16 and over wants to work like the participation rate suggests, including students, homemakers, the disabled, retirees, the independently wealthy, and others who simply aren't job seekers. And if you want to know how easy or tough it is to find a job, if you want to measure the health of the actual *job market*, then you only look at people in the market. Someone who hasn't looked for a job in years isn't an indicator of how easy it is to find a job or how healthy the job market is. They do have an impact on the economy, just as a bunch of retirees do, but the economy is not to blame for their lack of job-seeking in an economy at 4.6% unemployment.

As for wages, there's always some monthly noise, but wages are rising faster than inflation on an annualized basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People often ask "Who cares?" or "What difference does it make?" A few answers:

* A reason to fight. Most Americans, including Donald Trump, understand the basic fairness of "one person, one vote." When people see injustice, they want to fight it. And when you want to fight, you stand a much better chance of winning.
* A reason to hope, not despair. America has not turned into a racist, pussy-grabbing majority. The Democrats won the most votes for the sixth time out of seven. We aren't outnumbered, we're underrepresented.
* A reason to strategize. When you have enough votes to win, but your voters don't matter because of their location, you can strategize. You can encourage Democrats in blue states who are thinking of new schools, jobs, and retirement destinations to consider swing states and swing districts. You can press more states, like Oregon, to pass the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact.
* It's reality. The number of votes for each candidate is a basic fact of the election. There should be no opposition to reporting it. </TEXT>

In the 7 years that followed, US manufacturing jobs rose. What really hurt US manufacturing was the rise of China, where manufacturing jobs were shipped to starting in 2001 under Bush, exacerbated by China's admission to the WTO that year. [(Chart)](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP)

China is what hurt US manufacturing. China is not in NAFTA, as the first two letters make clear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like they have 7 chutes to drop from, but 15 slots, with the chutes in the middle. It looks like there's a high-value board and a low-value board. Here's the high-value board. I've bolded the slots that have chutes directly above them.

1, 50K, 100, 100K, **1**, **200K**, **1**, **300K**, **1**, **400K**, **10**, 500K, 100, MILLION, 1

And here's the low-value board:

1, 5K, 100, 20K, **10**, **10K**, **1**, **25K**, **1**, **10K**, **10**, 20K, 100, 5K, 1

For the high values, it looks like you'd always want to drop from the chute the farthest to the (audience's) right, if you have a green ball. I'm not sure if you know it's green (right answer, adds money) or red (wrong answer, subtracts money) before you drop it, though. It looks like you may have to load the balls into the chutes before you answer the questions, or at least before you know whether you got them right.

This looks like a lot of fun, but I could imagine the winnings ultimately being pretty low, given that you can lose up to a million dollars with each drop as well as win a million. I suspect they wouldn't let you fall below zero, though, they'd just wipe you out or maybe send you home if you had $100k but lost a million. Otherwise, you could have people in negative millions having to finish the game knowing it's pointless. </TEXT>

There was a lot of criticism during the Bush years that painting Bush as an entertaining fool rather than a threat helped humanize and reeleect him, when they should have put torture and lies about the Iraq War squarely on his shoulders.

	<TEXT> That's an argument for not contradicting people's opinions with facts. That's paralyzing.

There are more people out there whose minds can be changed than just Trump and Clinton voters. And in 2020, there will be new voters, too.

Speaking of studies, believing that an opinion has more popular approval increases support for that opinion. It's called the [bandwagon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect). So it is useful to drive home the fact that Trump is not popular and did not get the most votes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Protesting is a completely different topic than whether we should publicize who got the most votes. It is important that everyone knows who got the most votes for reasons such as the ones I mentioned. Including the basic reason that it is reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently mail-in ballots have to be [manually reviewed](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-primary-results-finally-counted-20160710-snap-story.html). I'm not sure why. I'm one state up in Oregon, where it's all by mail and all automated.

There are also a ton of provisional ballots when people go to the wrong voting location, and those take even more time to review. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's important to understand reality for many reasons.

...

For example, when polls show very negative attitudes toward Trump and his policies, some Trump supporters may try to tune out reality by saying "the polls were wrong." But the polls converged on a Clinton lead of about 3%, while her actual lead will be closer to 2%. So the opinion of the people, as measured by calling people and asking their opinion, is not "wrong." We know what the public does and does not support.

It's also important to highlight the level of inequality in the system so as to build support for changing the system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Legislative bodies throughout the world have unequal representation, like the US Senate. But where the country's leaders are directly elected, there is no similar electoral college body to interlope and redistribute the vote. Even within unequal bodies like the US Senate and European Parliament, all of the voters for a particular seat are given an equal vote for that seat. The same is not true for the US presidency. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A New Yorker has [approximately](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/map_of_the_week/2012/11/presidential_election_a_map_showing_the_vote_power_of_all_50_states.html) 1/4 the voting power as a Wyomingite.

America is the only democracy that so overtly perverts the basic democratic rule of one person, one vote. Land mass does not vote. People do. </TEXT>
