	<TITLE> Touching Story About John Cena   Kevin Owens On Talk Is Jericho </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-14 19:29:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm probably not gonna do it justice typing it in my own words so Im gonna give the exact quote ny KO

My son's such a big John Cena fan. He would ask me 'when are you gonna wrestle John Cena?' 'Eh, I don't know, maybe one day.'

We got to do it, his reaction was all over Twitter and Facebook. It went viral because my wife recorded it because she knew what I was doing but he didn't know, he just knew I was going to be on Raw. But also, the coolest part was I went to the Performance Center a few weeks before the match and John was there. I knew he was going to be there, John told me 'bring Owen.' So Owen walked in, he had no idea, it was his first time at the Performance Center, and then he saw John.

[I] was like 'who's that,' [and he said] 'that's John Cena!' John gave him a letter that he handwrote. I don't even know if I'm supposed to say that, I don't know if John is a big fan of me telling this, but he handwrote a letter to my son, like two full pages. Explaining to him like...

I was telling John once when we were preparing a promo, I was saying like 'you know, if you want to make it a little personal, I could talk about this one time WWE had a show at the Bell Centre [in Montreal] and I took my son. I was second row and everybody there knew 'that's Kevin Steen, he's a professional wrestler, but look at him in the second row of the WWE show with his son. I bet he wishes he was in the ring, you know?' But I put that aside because I just wanted my son to be able to shake John Cena's hand, and when your match ended I rushed the guardrail with my son just like any other fan would, and instead of coming around the ring and shaking hands, you just left, you went to the back and my son was crushed. 

And John was like 'oh my God, I'm so sorry.' No, it's fine, he was fine a minute later... I'm just saying, do you want to talk about this [in the promo]? He said 'maybe we keep this for later, but I feel terrible, please tell Owen I'm sorry.'And the letter was John basically apologizing for that. Honestly, as a father, my crowning moment now is that moment when I got to see my son interact with John for the first time, and just see how happy Owen was. And John Cena is the one to thank for that, but I feel like a great dad."

Cena really is a stand up guy </TEXT>
