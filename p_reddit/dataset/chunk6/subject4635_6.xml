	<TITLE> Today a troll made me a new friend </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I stared up a game of blind normals. Was going to try out Eve jungle because I hadn't played Eve since she got her ulti changed. As the chat loads I see somebody call top (we will call them rox) and then somebody else call top. Since calling for roles is tradition in blind normals I say that rox called top first. The other person then proceeds to say top 3 more times in chat. He then says since he said it 4 times in chat that obviously means he should be able to take that spot. I honestly thought he was joking because of how ridiculous that sounded. Then he claimed that rox and I were a duo. I said no and that I just felt like he was being a jerk to rox. He then said he was going to check to see if we were a duo once the game loaded.

When everybody finished loading rox (who was playing Jayce) said he would take mid or top (the other person was playing Yi and I was jungle) and let Yi into whatever lane he preferred (mid or top). We were blue side so both of them had to help me with wolves and blue. Once we get to blue Yi Alpha Strikes blue just before I last hit it (I was going for a smiteless) so he can take it and then he proceeds to follow Jayce into mid now claiming he wants mid now. Jayce is obviously fed up with this and politely asks the other team if they can report Master Yi. Usually I never ever ask the other team to report somebody on my team but this time I did due to the ridiculousness of the situation. I quickly explain what happened in team select and what happened just before they went into lane. Yi then starts lying in all chat about how we were trying to troll him and that we were being uncooperative. Our Ashe also then chimed in and said to report our Yi. They never even said anything before in team chat. The Lux on the enemy team believed Jayce and I and said they would report Yi after the game.

When 20 minutes finally rolled around with both our top lane and bottom lane turrets gone our entire team agreed to surrender (except Yi of course who was still saying we were lying about everything we said). The entire other team said they would report Yi for us and were sorry that Yi was even on our team. I then asked rox (the Jayce) if I could friend him and actually play a duo game with him sometime and he accepted. Here is the little convo we had after the game.

roxaswins if you read this I just want to thank you for trying to be level headed in a situation where people usually just rage and then not cooperate when somebody ruins their game. Hope to play with you soon! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 4th year working as a park ranger in a state park. 40 hours a week, $8.25 an hour. It's ok. I just got promoted so I do even less work now but its way more boring. Basically I bike to a location in the park. Stand there for 60-120 minutes then go back to base and take a break for 15-30 minutes. Then go back out and do it again, for 8 hours. Also I have to work weekends and holidays (but on holidays we get extra pay). It sucks that I lose my summer but making over $3000 by the end of the summer is pretty awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Atheism is, in a broad sense, the rejection of belief in the existence of deities. In a narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Most inclusively, atheism is simply the absence of belief that any deities exist. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which in its most general form is the belief that at least one deity exists.

from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism

/r/atheism loves to circlejerk saying they believe in science. Simply atheism is the rejection of the belief that there is a god (or gods). Basically they believe there is no god. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see where you are coming from but in my personal experience in Bronze (currently Bronze I) it's much easier to bend over backwards for your team. For me I prefer ADC, then Mid or Top. I say this in chat. If I'm first pick I'll wait out the ban timers till the last second to see what people want to play. If people only call one position I'll ask if they can play anything else. If everybody calls a position and one position is open that I don't usually play (jungle or support) I'll just take that position because I rather trust myself in those roles than somebody else who just calls one position.

I assume most people on the subreddit take ranked more seriously than normals and they come in with a good pool of champions and know how to play a couple people in each position. This is the same for me. If I have to go jungle I have maybe 5 or 6 champs I can chose from and if i have to go support I can choose from 3 or 4 champs. I have practiced them enough before going into ranked so that I feel comfortable playing them even though they are not my preferred positions.

Also by playing a role you can play even though you usually don't you learn more about that position and the next time you have to play it you have a better chance of winning. Would you rather play a position you know really well and force some other guy to play a position you have no idea he knows how to play or would you rather play a position you know ok but let some other guy play a position he wants to play. I would rather trust the other person in the position they want than in the position they don't want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another 5 v 5 map doesn't really work. I think I read this somewhere else but whatever. When you want to play 5 v 5 normal team battles you play on Summoners Rift, when you want to play 3 v 3, you play on Twisted Treeline, when you want to play ARAM, you play on the Howling Abyss, when you want to play 5 v 5 dominion you play on the Crystal Scar. Each mode was designed for one map. Also balancing for a new map would be almost impossible because some champs could be really OP or UP with a different map. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Own Experience

I started playing the game right as it came out on Steam accidentally. You could see it was really unpolished (but not as unpolished as Smite when I first played it). It was also really fucking fun. With the new influx of people mainly everybody was on the same level and it was fun. For the first month or two everything was looking pretty good. After a while though people started leaving the game. Good players stuck around though and any new players that would play the game got matched against those new players. This lead to new players not coming back to the game. The good players got even better and stomped even harder on the new players. Repeat till we get to today.

Also it seems like the long standing player base is very elitist and basically doesn't give a fuck about teaching new players. I know some do try to help new players and explain how the game works but some of them just love to stomp and show of their skills. This fact was the reason I quit the game. I was fairly good but not as good as the people who were in the game since beta. I could pretty much hold my own though. Some of the peoples actions in game disgusted me so much that I really didn't want to be part of the community anymore.

The last reason is that all the champs were overpowered in one way or another. People on the forums still complain about every class being overpowered in some way or another. Vet with the claw and his 3 grapples. Assassin with her super damaging back grapple. Assault with almost infinite fly. Tank with tons of damage. Gunner with slam and tons of damage. Spark with tons of damage. Basically you get the point. Since the game came from its MNC roots where everything was overpowered there, new players couldn't really adapt to dying in a second to some pro they don't know how to counter.

I still love the game and hope it makes a comeback some day but I've moved on for now. Maybe Uber can take it off steam. Launch Planetary Annihilation. Get some money from that or make a Kickstarter for SMNC and relaunch the game fresh, new, rebalanced, and more accessible. </TEXT>

I'm thinking about getting an Intel CPU and mobo and maybe bump up to 16 GB of ram. I would be making this purchase this summer. What would be the best time to do this and what would be the best CPU and mobo combo to go with. I use this computer for gaming but I also want to get into streaming and recording games as well so that't why I wanted to upgrade my CPU. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off Irelia has a slow AA animation so I can understand how it's hard to last hit with her.

When you play as Irelia you have to know what skills your laning opponent has and when they are on and off cooldown. If you want to harass them you need to go in at the right moment.

When I play Irelia I take one point in E then Q then W and then max W first (Q second). When you get into lane last hit as normal. Maybe you should go into a couple practice games and practice last hitting with her. In lane when the opponent hits you you should be able to E them back, stun them and get a couple hits of before moving back.

Once you learn W you can E them, activate W and then trade pretty easily. However I only do this combo when the opponent attacks me so I can get the stun. You really shouldn't need to use Q ever in lane unless you are chasing your opponent and you know you can do more damage. Just learn when you can trade with opponents and you should come out on top. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Decided to create a variation of the theme I created yesterday. Also I added border support for the text on this theme and introduced it to the old theme.

	<TEXT> My first skin and layout. It took me about 6 hours to get everything the way I wanted. 2 hours were spent on trying to get the weather skin to work correctly.

.rmskin: http://sdrv.ms/Y7DYxv (Download the Mirrors_Edge_1.rmskin file that is selected)  
Background: http://i.imgur.com/aISP3ai.jpg

If you click on the CPU or RAM text the task manager opens up. There is also a settings file in MirrorsEdge\Settings. In there you can edit the color value to get the colored text of your choice and you can also edit the weather location code. The weather skin gets data from weather.com.

Hope you enjoy!

EDIT: Tried some new colors out based on suggestions  
Orange: http://i.imgur.com/9FX72OF.jpg (229,124,0)  
Red: http://i.imgur.com/NO2SNFI.jpg (255,54,41)  
Black: http://i.imgur.com/JQofq1m.jpg (0,0,0)

EDIT 2: New download link. Added borders to the test to increase visibility. Border color can be changed in variables file.
