With so much exposure in the news and people still not believing, what has to happen to an individual before reality sets in. Do they, their community has to be affected in order for this to happen?

Iv gone past caring what other's think, if I'm directly not causing them harm. To try and live up to how others expect me to be and live, is in my own opinion dicing with unneeded stress. As long as I'm putting positive thoughts and actions out there and letting go of the consequences helps me a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An article which highlights how packaging on fast food has negative affects on our overall health.

The samples, consisting of paper wrappers, paperboard, and drink containers, were analyzed for a class of chemicals called PFASs (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances), also known as PFCs. These highly fluorinated chemicals are widely used in an array of nonstick, stain-resistant, and waterproof products, including carpeting, cookware, outdoor apparel, as well as food packaging. "These chemicals have been linked with numerous health problems, so it's concerning that people are potentially exposed to them in food," says Laurel Schaider, an environmental chemist at Silent Spring Institute and the study's lead author. Exposure to some PFASs has been associated with cancer, thyroid disease, immune suppression, low birth weight, and decreased fertility. "Children are especially at risk for health effects because their developing bodies are more vulnerable to toxic chemicals," says Schaider. Approximately one third of children in the U.S. consume fast food every day. </TEXT>

''Even though pets may not fully understand or respond verbally, the level of disclosure to pets was no less than to siblings," says Cassels. "The fact that pets cannot understand or talk back may even be a benefit as it means they are completely non-judgmental"

	<TEXT> Rising sea levels, extreme weather such as intense heat waves, flooding, droughts and storms pose increasingly severe risks to Europe's ecosystems, human health and economy, says a new report.

The report 'Climate change, impacts and vulnerability in Europe 2016', from the Copenhagen-based European Environment Agency, assesses the latest trends and projections on climate change and its impacts across Europe, and finds that better and more flexible adaptation strategies, policies and measures will be crucial to lessen these impacts.

Changes in climate are already having wide-ranging impacts on ecosystems, the economy and on human health and well-being in Europe, with new records continuing to be set on global and European temperatures, sea levels and reduced sea ice in the Arctic.

Precipitation patterns are changing, generally making wet regions in Europe wetter and dry regions drier. Glacier volume and snow cover are decreasing.

At the same time, climate-related extremes such as heat waves, heavy precipitation and droughts, are increasing in frequency and intensity in many regions. Improved climate projections provide further evidence that climate-related extremes will increase in many European regions.

	<TEXT> Interesting, i wonder how much common this is on Reddit.

Vast legions of malleable Twitter accounts are valuable to both corporations, for whom they can pump up follower counts, and to individuals and organizations interested in flooding Twitter with spam or creating the illusion of a consensus around controversial issues. A small percentage of the bots may have already been sold, they say, as they appear to follow accounts outside of the bot network. As older accounts are more valuable  its hard to trust a Twitter account created two days ago after all  their shadowy master could simply be waiting for his investment to mature. </TEXT>
