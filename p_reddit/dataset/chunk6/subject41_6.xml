	<TITLE> What do you think were the most overrated films of 2016? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-05 19:33:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Title. What movies do you think were the most overrated of 2016?

I am personally going with Lion   Hidden Figures.

Lion felt cliche and Oscar-baity. I felt like 3-4 films could have gotten a Best Picture nom instead (Silence, Nocturnal, Jackie). The only great thing about this movie was Kidman   Patel.

I have no idea how Hidden Figures is getting so much praise. It was a decent film, but it felt so cheesy and predictable for the whole movie. How many montages of a lady running to the bathroom is enough? Some lines were just so bad and took me out of the movie (IE. Kevin Costner 'we all pee the same color line). The acting was just okay at best and it felt like it could have been directed by anyone.

What are your choices? </TEXT>

My percentages are a bit off. But yeah, I don't do Blues Drags, Dust Devils, Turoths, Kurasks. (Unless i'm really low on points). For the 1 or 2 Blue Drags tasks I did, I didn't really bank hides. Also Iron   Steel Drags are on block list.

Wtf is a fake slayer loot tab lol. I didn't sell tab once, and I have 85 Slayer. Obviously I didn't pick up every fucking item. But this is everything that I did pick up. </TEXT>
