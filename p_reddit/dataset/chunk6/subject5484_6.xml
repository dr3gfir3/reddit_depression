	<TEXT> Well...that was a reasonably thorough dress down of them bogeymen, and it's not that I disagree, but there's a great deal the Dems can, should, and need to do on their own part to recalibrate what they represent.

Waving a finger at the other party while you pretend your own poo doesn't smell is not the way forward.  If you think "stumbling towards their next campaign contribution" is something unique to Republicans, you're ignoring what a corrupt mess Washington is.

We're not in campaign season or campaign mode right now, so writing this all off as purity tests and whataboutisms wrongly implies that now is not the time to discuss these problems.

There are reasons that Greens and independents refuse to vote for mainstream Democrats, and it looks a lot more Republican than you might think.  It goes something like "OK OK, let's do some voting for the people.  Yay, done?  OK, good, now let's get to work. Which of my donors benefits from this spending bill?  How does my SuperPac want me to vote on this other thing?"

Sanders is proof that a significant portion of the non-Republican voter pool cares about these things and does not feel compelled to simply vote Democrat because they're not Republicans.

You can carry on with your own "But but the GOP..." whataboutisms and imply that it's traitorous or naive to criticize the Dems at this point.  However, if the Dems are going to use this critical moment in history to exclusively talk down the GOP without adapting their own, they do so at their own peril.

I want them to have a policy and agenda that Greens, Independents, and Dems all think is in the interest of American citizens as a whole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree in the sense of watching this for decades.

Bush and McCain arguing who the true conservative is.

But they weren't arguing who the true Republican was, were they?

Liberal is a word you avoided.  It needs to be OK to be a liberal the same way it's OK currently to be a conservative.

Conservatives (the Right) wants all of the things you mention.  The Tea Party (now aka the Freedom Caucus) is a bunch of conservatives.  Do not let them off the hook.

And Sanders (in the New York debate that should now be legendary) took apart mainstream Democrats for precisely what they are: a left-leaning party still beholden to banks and other corporate interests.

Disclaimer:  That doesn't mean I'm a Sanders supporter meddling.  I'm simply a liberal.

Should the Dems hold the GOP accountable?  Absolutely yes.

Are they?  In kind of a fuddily-duddily status quo kind of way.  Yay they filibustered Gorsuch.  Does that make them a principled outfit standing for what is right and just?

It's really kind of meh.

John McCain solo is outshouting them.  Lindsey Graham (god forbid) is gaining more coverage opposing Trump.

And the whole thing falls apart if they're still the other Goldman-Sachs party.

The most monumental change from the past year actually involves Trump.  Third party schmird party under this system.  On both sides, independents chose not to go the independent route.  On both sides, this disrupted the status quo.  If we're only allowed two parties (due to the electoral college and the apportionments act that keeps the house from growing), then both parties' umbrellas need to be larger.

Under our left umbrella, the backyard needs some serious scraping before we can legitimately stand for all we are supposed to, and that means people before business.

I disagree with a strategy to make the GOP bogeymen unless people can trust that we are not another flavor of bogeymen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like Bernie and appreciate how he isn't beholden to corporate interests and big banks.

However, this is massive overstep without a full-scale reconfiguring of the entire US education system, which is not going to happen.

a) European countries with free university are moving away and charging nominal tuition.  Not US-crazy tuition with crazy US student debt, but not free.

b) Any and all of these countries with free/almost free education track students from a very early age either toward or away from universities.  By middle school, you're either headed to uni or a vocational school.  By 16, you're in one or another, choosing a trade to apprentice in or studying advanced classes.

Then, you apply specifically for a major you intend to study and get accepted into that school or not.

This is a far more efficient system because a) you don't have a bunch of high schoolers studying for uni alongside a bunch of people who hate being there and b) you don't spend two years of uni drinking and thinking about what you might major in.

Making it free to just bobble about university is only going to increase the bobbling, and, if the UK can't afford free education anymore, how are we going to afford it?

Fer cripes sake, make it more affordable.  Cap tuition increases to cost-of-living increases.  Cap debt so that universities aren't so giddy to continuously sign up more people for crippling loans.

But but but.  What happened to killing campaign financing?

How about killing the reapportionment act to allow the house size to grow?

How about killing the electoral college?

I'm sorry, Bernie, but I find this irresponsible.  </TEXT>

Far from starting with Trump, GOP warmongering has been an unstated plank in their platform.  

What's trying to be claimed here is that US aggression in other parts of the world is detracting from Trump's base?

Like Trump himself, they have some nuanced position on Syria that doesn't involve pooping on Democrats?

That's like suggesting the Westboro Baptist Church has a clear position on colonizing Mars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand how you feel, but neither net privacy nor net neutrality have anything to do with government spying.

The government is free, within reason, to spy as they wish.  Neither of these give them greater or lesser freedom to do so.  This deregulation is corporate.

Technically, the government needs a warrant to spy on your internet activity.  Without a warrant, they're doing so illegally and the case would most likely be tossed out in court.  Will they go ahead and follow the rules?  I can't say for sure, but they will if they have a reason to bring a case against you.

As for propaganda and free speech, they've never attempted anything so extreme, and now I'm fairly confident it's too late.

A story from the early net (1992 or so)-  I was playing text games online and people would jump all over you if you used a swear word because they were very rightly concerned that the FCC would roll in and attempt to censor the net.  But that was 25 years ago and people freely use 'shit' and 'fuck' on Reddit and many more places with impunity.  At this point, the genie is far too far out of the bottle for them to even try that type of censorship.

In terms of turning the web into a propaganda piece, it's also far too late.  The media outlets will not be censored or turned to serve the government.  Businesses like Amazon will not be censored or turned to serve the government.  Free sites like wikipedia will not be censored or turned to serve the government.  It's worth noting the CIA tried to alter wikipedia's entry on them and they got caught out.

So, dude, no worries about these things you rightly fear.  It's not going to happen that way.

What you should be concerned about is "Hmm...wikipedia now takes ten minutes to load.  I'm on Comcast.  Is it because wikipedia says bad things about Comcast?"

You're worried about government propaganda.  Are you worried at all about corporate propaganda?

	<TEXT> I will answer with a series of extinct questions:

Can I talk on the phone?

Call ____ in ______(anywhere more than 10 minutes away)?  Whose going to pay for that long-distance call?  Then, HOLY SHIT I got the phone bill.  It cost $75 to wish grandma a happy birthday.

What are we gonna watch tonight?

Who knows how to program the VCR?

Is that really true?  No, you're making it up.  No, seriously, my friend said so.  OK, let's look it up in either the dictionary, the encyclopedia, or the Guinness Book of World Records.  If it's not there, we'll probably end up bickering about it until there's a TV show 10 years later with the answer.

Is that a computer?  What can you do with it?  Answer: play games and print dot matrix banners with print shop.

OMG you have a beeper?

OMG you have a fax number?

Leaded or unleaded?

OMG, $15 to fill my tank?  WTF

How dare you say WTF? Mind your language.

Well, we're supposed to be driving to ____.  Where the hell are we?  Maybe we should ask that guy.  That guy: go down there until you see the big tree.  Turn left, then go straight to the chickens.  If you see the swimming hole, you've gone too far.

Where the hell is Barney?  We agreed to meet right here two days ago when we talked on the phone (which cost $15 in long-distance charges).  We're supposed to go watch ET and the movie starts in 7 minutes.

Can I write you a check?

OMG, where is my money?  If I lost it, I have to go home to get my bank book and then to the bank.  It's Friday night 8pm?  OK, I'll be going home.  See you Monday.  Can you give me a ride to work because I won't be able to go to the bank until lunch break?

Have you seen my car stereo?  It has a cassette player that will flip the tape back to the beginning so I can listen to Slippery When Wet again and again and again.  Start to finish, mofos.

Do you have a bomb?  Answer: Nope. Check-in agent: OK, here's your boarding pass.

Can you believe the in-flight movie is Ishtar?  I totally missed that at the theater, and now I get to watch it free!

How are my friends and family doing?  Are they OK?  I could call them, but that would cost $7500 in long-distance charges from Germany.  I guess we'll have to catch up in 6 months or a year when I get back?

Maybe I could write them a letter?  Hmm... That would cost me $5, or I could stay in this Amsterdam youth hostel one more night.  Yeah, 6 months isn't so long.

Where is the card catalog?

Will the library be able/willing to order this book?

Have you heard microwaves interfere with pacemakers?  Ima stay away from that shit.

Have you heard you can play frisbee with compact discs?  Then you just wipe 'em off and they're good to go.

Why do you keep lying about floppy disks?  They're the big floppy ones. 5 and a quarter.  A hard disk is that smaller blue plastic thing you put in advanced stuff like Macs.  What?  Hard drive shmard drive.  I just explained this to you.

Mini-discs?  Oh hell yeah.  MP3's?  Nope, sorry, don't get it.

Have you heard about the world wide web?  Go to the computer room and check it out.  It has a blowjob hall of fame.  (real tip from a friend).

World Wide Web?  No, I think you should use Lexus/Nexus.  Maybe Gopher.

Have you heard about MUDs?  It's like DnD but online.

Why can't I finish this PC game?  What do I have to do to not flee the final dungeon in terror?  I guess I'll never know, but maybe I'll play it again from the fucking beginning 3-5 more times just in case I missed something.  After 3-5 more tries:  I guess I'll never know.

Have you heard about the secret code that makes your Mortal Kombat character rip out the other guy's spleen?  You can get the codes for cheap if you pay $6 for a magazine with them.

How long do I have to wait in line to play NBA Jam?  My quarters can only wait so long.

How much does ____ cost?  I dunno, but maybe you could call Barney.  I think he paid for one of those 5 years ago, but I still haven't seen him since he ditched me before ET.  You can call him, but that would cost $15 dollars in long-distance charges.  Maybe you should just buy it.

	<TEXT> Put simply, free market capitalists want zero regulation coming from Big Government.  However, didn't just wake up one day and say "You know what?  Let's regulate Big Business."  Rather, regulation is historically a response to businesses misbehaving, starting in modern times with T Roosevelt busting trusts and collusion.

Net privacy and net neutrality are two different things.  Losing net privacy means companies are free to track, snoop, and sell data.  Net neutrality means that you have equal connection speeds and pings to all sites.  Both regulations were put in place rightly so to protect consumers from predatory practices.  

Losing net privacy is not something we want but can be addressed by getting a vpn. Otherwise, as you mention, you will get targeted ads.  This is more nuisance than terribad, but it's not serving consumers in any way.

Net neutrality came as a result of Comcast choking speeds to sites they don't like.  When it's lost, for example, Comcast and Verizon are free to cut speeds on Netflix v Amazon Prime to push you where they want you to go, or force both Netflix and Amazon to buy them off to prevent this.  That's just square one, they'd also be free to choke speeds on games you play to encourage you to play ones of their choosing or offered by outfits again willing to buy them off so that we have full access speed.  I don't know that they'll do that, but the death of net neutrality means they can do it.  Is any of this in our interest?  Absolutely not.

And here's the sniff test:  We're part of the G20, the most prosperous countries in the world.  When the Republicans kill net neutrality, we're going to be the G20 country with the crappiest citizen internet rights.  Worse than Russia (permission to choke torrent sites).  Worse than Mexico (one of the strongest actually).

And this all because of vapid arguments about Big Government that abandon us to Big Business.

Final note: you mention Big Government regulating internet content.  Net privacy was a regulation protecting your data, not controlling content.  Net neutrality regulates the way infrastructure is used and also doesn't regulate content.

	<TEXT> The government pricany protections that are getting flushed is a classic example of what BS "free market capitalism" is.

"Pure competition" is going to drive telecomms to use underhanded tactics to outdo one another and limit consumer freedom.

Supposedly, if free market pundits were correct, this freedom from Big Government would mean that these companies are going to provide us a better, greater, fairer internet than we would have with government regulation.  We won't.  Instead, Big Business will have free reign to herd us like cattle to sites and services of their choosing while they make more money selling browsing info and choke connections to sites that are not part of their conglomerate.

Don't just think of this in terms of the internet.  Continue to think about these implications whenever you hear people blowing hard about Big Government ruining the fun for Big Business. </TEXT>

"Bullshit" is stuff you don't like.  Doing the laundry and waking up on time are "bullshit".  Moreover, doing a job you don't like is "bullshit".  A lot of "adults" never escape "bullshitting" themselves.

Bullshit is when you don't tolerate things that are wrong.  Bullshit is when you don't tolerate "bullshit" when there's a serious job to be done.  Bullshit is when you take yourself seriously and can confidently call "bullshit" on "bullshit".

Most importantly, adults don't "bullshit" themselves.  That would be  bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OMG, thank you for the nice boss question.

YES!

This is what I've been waiting for.

First off, forget about the nicest thing. In 22 years of work, I've had 1.5 nice bosses.

a) I had one boss who did his job fairly.  He gets a .5

b)  The nicest boss understood something I was taught about in Boy Scouts as early as eleven, but I didn't see until I had a nice boss:

a) To lead is to serve-  You are not put above people to look down on them or think yourself the better.  You ARE your subordinates, and happy subordinates will do what you need them to do to the very end.

b) Generate consensus, and then make the hard decisions-  No one is ever going to 100% agree about what to do, but there is a critical difference between asking everyone for their ideas and then making a choice compared to not asking for ideas and making a choice.

c) Welcome feedback-  If you avoid feedback because you know it's going to be terribad, you are the problem.  If you think you are above the people who would be offering the feedback you avoid, you are almost certainly part of some Dickensian nightmare (please, sir, may I offer you feedback?) where you fancy yourself some sort up nobility overseeing a bunch of weaker plebes.  If that is how you view your subordinates, you will sow weakness and crap. </TEXT>

I harbor no bias against the people or the country.

I don't think anything I said was unfair or prejudiced against Mexico or Mexicans.

I've simply described two neighboring countries divided by wealth and opportunity.

a) I think it's a fair statement.

b) I think most Mexicans would agree.

I would expect to be drowned in downvotes if I said that Mexicans are a bunch of bad hombres who import rape and murder into the US.  

There's telling it like it is (which I think I did), and then there's "telling it like it is", which translates to "I'm going to say something wildly racist and insulting and parade it as the truth."

	<TEXT> a)  I'll let you choose.  Imagining it now would be convenient.  Imagining it historically means that you had to make the ethically dubious decision to fight Mexico for BC and that Klondike gold in the name of manifest destiny.  Not gonna fight?  You have no Pacific coast territory.  You want from sea from shining sea?  You have to take it in an ugly bit that will be remembered.  To be nice, we won't say Toronto is an independent republic and you'll also have to grab that like the US did Texas.

b)  You're trumping your tough immigration policy where you have basically zero concerns about illegal Americans making their way into Canada.  Do you think the US has weak immigration policies?  Good god, you're validating Trump.  What you have is tough immigration policies combined with a border you don't have to worry about in terms of illegal immigration.

Let's pause for 5 minutes and imagine that the US was a country of 300 million people directly south of you who made 5 bucks a day on subsistence farming and the rich were a bunch of cartel-types whose profit was directly based on smuggling coke and heroin across your border. DISCLAIMER: Just an example, not saying this is the current state of Mexico, but similar.  Imagine if a majority of us Yanks tied their future economic prosperity and/or illegal trade to being able to cross the US-Canada border.

Policy shmolicy.  If you told me I had ten days to cross into Canada from the US without going through border checkpoints, I could do it so easily that I wouldn't need ten days if I was already up on the border.  The US-Canada border has the exact same problem that the US-Mexico border has:  it's vast and unpatrollable.  In fact, given that the great North Woods is far more hospitable than the desert areas between the US and Mexico, it would be easier to find some random bit of woodland to pass through where desert heat wasn't going to kill me if I didn't move rapidly.

Then, we can move on to the actual border checkpoints.  Does the RCMP need to check every pickup-truck to see if there are 5 Americans sealed in under the bed?

c)  Ima leave that alone. </TEXT>

Correction: I think my 22 million comes from how many Canadians live in proximity to the US border.  Kind of irrelevant.   My bad.

To preface, I'm going to tiptoe into this, and I definitely didn't make my post to incense Canadians.

So, first of all:  Whoosh!  The US has disappeared.  Not just the country, but the territory it occupies.

Vancouver is now immediately north of Tijuana, and Toronto is separated from Nogales and such by the Rio Grande.

a)  You've just lost a major, modern trading partner that fires your economy.

b) You have a (not to bag on Mexico) a struggling country whose citizens seek a better way of life by migrating into Canada, short-term for work and long-term to take advantage of its opportunities and prosperity.  These migrants who come in, legally or illegally, are not doctors and software engineers from other parts of the world.  They offer what they have: labor, mostly unskilled, on farms and in other menial work.

In this situation, what happens to wealth in/equality?

What about ethnic relations?  What do people already have to say about Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans in BC? 

You've asked me how it would be different.  I'd ask you if you really think nothing would change.
In the interest of fairness, perhaps Canadians would have a far better solution than the US currently does.  If so, I'd love to hear it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to be a "shit disturber", but I'm an American who has worked twice in other parts of the world where my office had a Canadian majority presence.

The only Canadians that truly bothered me were full-on nationalists that hated the US and wanted to continually go off about things like Vietnam, various scandals, and anything about the US being crap.  To be fair, these same people were very vocal about the Quebecois and equally ready to take a dump on them:  "Let them go live with the Mohawks."

What I found less annoying but still annoying were Canadians assuming I knew nothing about Canada and how we in the US might learn by going up to visit.

"You should come up and see.  It's totally mellow."

The guy who said this didn't realize that I went to uni in Vermont and went up to Montreal regularly.

That said, I agree.  It IS totally mellow.

But what's missing here is the reason why.

Canada is a nation of 22 million people or so with significant ethnic minority populations in Toronto and Vancouver, where the minorities are not also impoverished economic minorities.

The US is a nation of 300 million people with profound wealth inequality that is not exclusively but commonly drawn along ethnic lines because of our history of slavery and our history, border, and discriminatory treatment of Mexicans and Mexico who now constitute very large segments of our population.

The easy-out logic for Canadians is "Yeah, well sucks to be you cuz we didn't do all of that bad stuff."

The reality is that Canada has a far simpler socio-geographic situation than the US, with a much smaller population of far fairer wealth equality that has a single border with a G20 country.

a) The roots of America's troubles are centuries old and no single American has control or ability to fix this far messier situation.  

b) If it were Mexico and not the US to the south of Canada, Canada would be a very different place.

This is why I'm not a US nationalist but I can't really accept nationalism coming from other countries.

I like Canada and would consider living there, but there are reasons things like rights come up in the US far more often.  It isn't simply because Canadians are mellow that rights do not feature as much, and the US can't simply fix itself by becoming more like Canada. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Attention Free Market Capitalists!

This is your hour.  Once net neutrality is dead, please keep us briefed on all the great things that will come as a result of deregulated telecomms.

Cuz their newfound freedom isn't going to screw over consumers.  No no no no no.  They're going to have a "pure competition" to provide us all with something far better than this Big Government net neutrality stuff.

Right?  </TEXT>
