	<TEXT> I think that whole thing is largely an effect of the almost total destruction of insulated cultures and communities. Today they are all becoming connected, so people are much much more than ever before coming into contact with alien and radically different ideas and perspectives. A lot of people find that overwhelming or just aren't interested in expanding their sympathy and empathy that far beyond what they're accustomed to - yet they're still confronted with those ideas, so they resent them. It's especially easy to resent a foreign idea that's introduced via media rather than by an actual acquaintance or friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a millennial and I agree. I mean it's the standard baby-boomer critique but it's true. Some of that culture however is what we were trained to expect. I think each generation has some trouble with both overcompensating for what was missing from their upbringing and also not knowing how to reproduce the virtues their parents/experiences gave them for their own kids. The same recipe never works quite the same 20 years later and not all the same ingredients are available.
At any rate, personally I feel like it's on me to identify the virtues my grandfathers and fathers had and figure out a recipe that works for me today and, somehow, one that will work for my sons.
But it doesn't do any good to just say 'you're not like we were, why are you such pansies.' It's always difficult to communicate across generational divides, but the rewards are huge for both generations if it's achieved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ancients had this, imho really difficult to translate conception of the inner self, that vague as it is, still seems a damn good model. The kardia was imagined to contain the will, the thoughts, the 'eternal spark' of the soul all sort of flowing in and out of each other, but also distinct to some degree... Any attitude that amputates a essential component of being human is an impoverished and distorted perspective. And living a life that deliberately atrophies part of your humanity deforms you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I think we're all at least a little uncomfortable with the idea that all human behavior and relationships are self-interested. But unpleasant or not it's fascinating. Because even self-sacrifice is often surprisingly rewarding. A lot of people would say much more rewarding than self-serving behavior. So that raises that question of whether or not it's really that sacrificial after all. And on the other hand, self-serving behavior has its costs, whether that's social or in self-esteem. Maybe they are ultimately just strategies of fulfillment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm with you in skepticism towards any attitude that dismisses emotion and intuition and is worshipful toward logic with a capital L. But even the blind spots and conceited rationalizations themselves are examples of flawed reasoning. Any really careful thinker learns to distrust themselves and at least tries their best to stay vigilant against their own biases and motivated rationalizations. Anyone claiming to possess logic as a character trait is making a bit of a fool of themselves (me included since I'm definitely guilty of that). It's not a character trait, it's a method that's only as good as its application at the moment, and even at its best has limitations. In addition to that, reasoning is only as good as the "data" you're using, so even when we reason carefully we can trip over a mistaken assumption or a hidden premise. Reason in practice produces a humility about the whole enterprise reminiscent of the attitude you find in basic research scientists about their work. They know the task of completely unraveling even a small fragment of the universe is always beyond their grasp and the limitations of their instruments, but they just do the best they can with what they have knowing that though slow and imperfect their progress is real and based on a sound method. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since I was in college myself in early 2000's I've been discussing philosophy and religion with students continuously. It's striking how rare it is to find someone who's learned critical thinking. It's like an archaic lost language.
I can't judge how we compare to other generations, but I personally believe it's in part a symptom of a shift in the purpose of education away from liberal arts and 'learning to think and communicate clearly' to multiple choice exams and preparation to pursue a specific job or career. People maybe are learning to think critically in their field but it's compartmentalized and not a tool they use in a general way.
I think an aversion to labor, maybe especially intellectual labor, is part of human nature. If there isn't any effort made to highlight the general importance and value of rationality then the average person will tend to 'skip it', or leave it to others to do the thinking for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On LSD:
Started slow, first hallucination I remember was textures on surfaces moving (like wood grain moving like water for example). I remember the pupils in my two friends eyes looked like holes, and telling them I could see inside their heads. By that time we were driving around in a convertible at night, I remember a kind of similar effect to the eye thing where I had a kind of x-ray vision, I could see through houses and trees etc.
Later on it definitely messed with my judgment and made me less inhibited, kind of like alcohol. Did some stupid stuff involving an ex.
After that I had a kind of dream-state spirit quest kind of thing, but it was abstract, difficult to describe, although I could try if someone's really interested..
I didn't sleep at all. Towards morning I just sat and talked with my buddy for hours, no hallucinations by that time.
I didn't feel normal for a few days and ultimately decided not to ever do a hallucinogenic again. A. I liked it more than anything else I'd ever tried and didn't trust myself not to abuse it. B. It bothered me how long it took to wear off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely empathize.
My solution is greatshield + Estoc or Spears (Heide spear is good b/c they are weak to lightning). Focusing  on one at a time (turtling and using over-the-shield strikes when you can't get clean shots in safely) is important because whenever 1 garg is down to 50% health, a new garb will join the fight. It takes patience and usually a good stock of healing items but I kill them this way reliably every new play through, including a NG+ round for the +2 gold serpent ring for farming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since a couple folks asked about toughness: For toughness options you have Endless Walk set, Garwulf+Zoey's, Unity/Elusive Ring, Perma Vengeance-Dark Heart (requires stacking CDR which sacrifices damage), Aquila, and a gem like Esoteric or Gizzard. You can actually use ALL of these at the same time for essentially infinite toughness. The top ranking players are dropping some of that ridiculous toughness for added damage. For example, using Vengeance on cooldown instead of permanent so you can add area damage etc. in place of CDR. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently became friends with a blind dude. He's been blind basically since birth. We haven't discussed sex yet but he showed me how he 'watches movies' - its a program that narrates all the visual info in real time with the film. Anyway, while I was listening to the movie with him I realized I was of course automatically visualizing it (I'm a visual artist). I asked him what he imagines when he hears it. He said he imagines sensations mostly. Like for example the scene we were hearing was in a snowy winter landscape. I realized I would never have thought about how that cold would have felt to the characters. It was actually really interesting but challenging to try to experience the story like he does without visualizing it. </TEXT>

Pick a media: Obviously it's great to experiment with everything, but it's important IMO to pick a primary media and work on mastering it. Most of the time for now you want to be focusing on drawing without being surprised or distracted by what you're drawing with. Tried and true graphite on white paper is perfectly fine. One idea I'll also suggest is using toned paper with both black and white charcoal/conte pencils etc. This allows you apply highlights directly with the white on grey paper instead of subtractively (leaving an area blank or erasing it). It's faster and simpler media-wise, which again allows more focus on what you're doing.

Copying Photos: You can see yourself I'm sure how your realism improved from copying photos. That is a great way to get familiar with your materials and what they can do and practice basic technique. There are some problems you will get into if you work exclusively from photos and don't learn to draw from life but as long as you are aware of that it's no problem.

Drawing from Life: Every really excellent draftsman or painter trains from life. Period. There are countless ways to do it. Sketching people at a mall or busy street will improve your speed and teach you to capture a lot of info with a few marks... Portraits and figures are by far the best way to grow because they are the most challenging (I can go more into why if you want). Self-portraits are the best way to practice a portrait (because you can completely control the 'model', lighting etc with no time limits). 

The primary difference between excellent drawing and average is not technique or anything material, it's mental. Most 'how to draw' books/materials are useless because they usually don't teach you how to think properly about drawing. Check out Tony Ryder's book (I'll edit the title in when I get home). It covers those things really well and is full of inspiring examples of excellent figure drawing and portraits.

As you begin to master drawing from life, you will then begin to be able to draw much more convincingly from imagination, which for me anyway is the ultimate goal: to be able to draw anything I can imagine.

PM if you want any more info on some artists to check out or anything else. I love sharing what I've learned and I've been fortunate in having some great mentors. </TEXT>

There is no greater degree of indulgence and extravagance on earth than that which I possess - endless days...endless nights.

I allowed myself to be falsely accused, arrested and convicted on a lark. A diversion. An experiment. What was unexpected was that the burden of finite life lost weighing on the men around me would sharpen and enhance my own sensation of freedom.

	<TEXT> Ascetic has to be burned for every attempt right? Where does one acquire infinite ascetics?

Oh and i saw a video about the visible Auorus set where they use a trick to kill the red next to boss door, then save out after entering fog door - it saves the item but respawns phantom - could that work for Aldias too? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah ok got it! I discovered that layering different levels of hardness helps cut gloss too, kind of like layering oil paint - it's time consuming though, and at some point the paper tooth can get 'over-saturated' if you're not careful. Putting soft down first and layering harder over it seems to work best for dark values. Graphite has a lot of potential that doesn't often get fully utilized! Keep up the good work! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dark values look really matte, heavy graphite tends to have a high gloss, how did you do that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it looks realistic, especially at that size - was just curious if you added it or if it was original to the shot, and wondering if it had maybe an image hidden in the smoke too :) </TEXT>
