It's not like il be never logging in the druid again, I can still use that for the first few weeks until the priest gets geared  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I currently main resto druid and am the highest geared healer in my guild. I want to reroll disc priest, my guild doesn't want me to. I aren't raiding properly, only 1 of 3 nights a week and I am barely putting any hours in due to work so won't be competitive anymore anyway. I'm not sure what to do, I was thinking of finding a new guild if it's that big of a problem but a lot of these guys are really good friends. It seems stupid to fall out over what way I want to play a game </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm starting a new job next week which requires me to work rotating shifts, this means some weeks I won't have any time to play at all.my guild has no problem with this however I am struggling with how to approach the game with a more casual attitude. I'm very much an all or nothing type of person. Any advice how to be more casual but still relatively competitive would be greatly appreciated </TEXT>
