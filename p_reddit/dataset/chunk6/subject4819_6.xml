	<TITLE> A message to all movies: Don't bother doing actions scenes if you're just gonna do sloppy editing and quick jump cuts and weird angles. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Especially with American movies compared to say classic hong kong (either wuxia or realistic, from the well known jackie chans and jet lis and chow yun fats to lesser known actors) or korean (the hallway scene in oldboy) or most asian production movies, with their unedited fight scenes, still camera that actually shows the martial art prowess and action. 

I mean, it's simply inexcusable in this day and age, when even the best movies, with their great plot lines and fantastic characters, tend to suffer this western trait of having sloppy editing, shaky cam (bourne series ugh) all over the place, and jump cuts that really distort more than enhance the experience to make the viewer believe they're actually witnessing a fight scene. 

I don't know if there's a proper solution since martial art prowess takes years to master and Western movies are on a tight schedule, but I just... I just don't think shaky cam and quick editing and the worst of them all, shooting in the dark to mask the terrible editing/fighting, is the answer. </TEXT>

I've noticed some would be sure to make even the most insignificant bit of a newspaper page that appears for half a second have a detailed background behind it, while others might actually copy and paste the same article each time and just post it in format of a newspaper article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only without the Hollywood happy ending. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marty_(film)

It's this very sweet movie about a good natured 34 year old who is still single and constantly pressured by his friends and family to be married, only he just hasn't really met anyone. He's not super handsome or anything, nor suave, just a nice sweet kind of guy. 

And the thing is, I know that in real life that story as of 2017 doesn't really happen to have the happy ending that some of the more innocent black and white movies of old display. 

I dunno. I just realized that I'm a meager 6 years away from becoming that age and having never had something even resembling a romantic relationship with *anyone*, much less a woman.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OH man, don't even get me started on those CW shows... but here's the thing. Just like how barney and teletubbies are strictly for the children demographic, those CW shows are strictly for the teenager-twenty-something collegiate demographic. Those CW shows are basically teenage drama but with actors who are in their 20s, and the writing/plotlines reflect that. 

I mean hey, 15 years ago I was a teenager and I used to watch Smallville, back before there even was a CW. And I still like it out of nostalgia, though I'd never call it a good show, it's terrible. But it was *my* terrible. And that's what the CW shows are. They're for a very specific demographic and not really for people who want something, you know, good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It made no sense 10 years ago for tov to not be on ps3 in North America, and it definitely makes less sense now when EVEN tales of symphonia, a gamecube game, and its sequel, a wii game, made it to ps3. 

Not having tov ps3 in English is one of the most bizarre unexplainable business decisions ever. 

I still remember back in late 2008 when we got eternal sonata for ps3, and it very clearly was meant to be an appetizer for tales of vesperia, since both games were released on 360 first before being ported to ps3. I don't know what happened roughly 8 years ago though that made the English version of ps3 vesperia seem nonexistent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh... that's surprisingly similar to my situation too, at least some of it. I had always known *of* anime, but it wasn't until 2009 that I started watching when I was super depressed because of an accident (an incident shall we say) that completely changed the course of my life. A friend of mine had always talked about this stuff and once I had started to watch the big popular ones like nge, cowboy bebop, death note etc, I went back to him hoping to discuss it but he had already started phasing out of it. 

By the end of 2010 I has reached my peak depression and consumed a ton of anime media, up until the disappointment of a certain show kind of soured me on the entire medium and I kind of just didn't watch it much anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I'm worried about that, being completely bored with pop culture. I also don't want to mindlessly consume a bunch of it because the pleasure centers of the brain shrink when overexposed so I want to try and moderate it, especially since I can't truly appreciate something when I'm watching it as a distraction from life. 

I also haven't read any classic literature recently because of that, I don't feel like I'll truly appreciate it in this frame of mind. If I do end up doing the plan I have for the summer, I'll be taking a bunch of books with me to read, and no other form of technology for entertainment venue.

But I'm planning on taking a really long trip to the mountainside where I'll be just out in nature everyday enjoying fresh air and sunlight. And losing something like 30 kilos. Then come back home a hopefully work out enough to regain my old muscular physique, maybe even improve upon it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe it's because I don't live in America but, why don't you show up in person to apply for a job instead of doing something semi-anonymously online and complain about the amount of hoops you have to go through? The fact of the matter is when it comes to jobs, it's about who you know, and when people say that they stress the importance of starting internships and the like early so you establish connections and relationships so that you have more references to call upon and more likelihood to get a job. Companies aren't just going to hire anyone, they want someone they feel can give them what they want, and you just have to present yourself as such. 

I dunno, just something I've noticed. It's tough, I'll give you that. Very very tough. But I guess it kinda has to be that way.  </TEXT>

It really shows how the creators of these shows think on their feet, adapt to changes, and create a fantastic show. We're in for a new wave of comedic genius, not to mention originality (considering how tgp ended, taking most viewers completely by surprise)

While I agree regarding empowerment and the overt sexuality of western society, it's not exactly something exclusive to women. And I think that's equality, showing sex appeal of men for women's benefit, so as to break the stereotype of only men enjoying eye candy or having expression of sexuality presented while women remain on a pedestal as not enjoying it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Off the top of my head, some of the more memorable female roles for me were Sarah Conner in Terminator 2 and (this might seem a strange choice for some) the mouse mother mrs brisby in Secret of Nimh, Don Bluth's first and easily best animated movie. And what these strong female lead roles of old share is that they're all mothers, or wives, and have got something to protect, such as a younger son/daughter/baby, or maybe an incapacitated husband.

 But I can't recall a role where it was just a female as a heroine simply as a woman, not a wife or mother. At least, in a movie that's actually really good, and doesn't prop up said protagonist's gender as the only thing of note. So essentially what you mention regarding pushing changes in inauthentic ways. And it's also insulting to all involved, since it's like blaxploitation films of old where simply being a different race or creed or whatever is the only thing of note, and instead of designing all new characters to be written for roles, it's simply "what if we take established character... and make them female??" which is actually more insulting than it is empowering (as opposed to creating a role specifically for a person) or at least I tend to think so, since I would be insulted if they made a character whose entire purpose is just that he shares the same ethnicity as me or stuff like that. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was thinking about how in star wars 7, they made a female the hero instead of the damsel in distress. And she's the one who "rescues" the guy.

I wonder if the movie would have been nearly as successful if they went with the traditional format of a guy being the hero who fights the bad guys to rescue the screaming damsel. Indiana Jones 2 was on TV and I was just thinking about how things were so different 30 years ago, with the love interest just constantly screaming the entire movie and/or being put in eye candy type clothing. 

Just want to hear different opinions from people on here on the changing dynamics of blockbuster movies and the like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) The first movie that everyone loves, that's amazing and came out of nowhere and is infinitely rewatchable to this day.

2) The sequel that came out a few years later that... everyone was sort of on board for... and at least had cool scenes and set pieces (like the kraken from PotC, or the freeway scene/twin albinos who who you were just waiting to see how their fight with Neo would have been like since they do a disappearing act thing but Neo can see the code so... ??? We'll never know how such a fight would have turned out)

- Tried to bog the movie down in its own lore.

- Had a cliffhanger ending that panned to the face of a character we were shocked to see! (Barbossa moreso than... human Smith, of course)

3) And finally the third, disappointing one (though one could argue potc at least had a better resolution than... whatever matrix 3 was)

- and interestingly, both got rid of the cool thing that people remember from the second one for some conspicuous reason, that being the kraken from potc and twin ghost albinos from matrix. Much to the chagrin of a lot of fans.

- oh also, both sequels were filmed back to back for both franchises, and the they were released very close to each other.

It's not uncommon for trilogies to do this so you'll notice a lot of similarities with other franchises (particularly the sequel hook, that's a given) but I thought matrix and potc in particular shared a lot more than the usual. </TEXT>

I particularly like when there's a story of an experienced guy having sex for the first time and the girl pounces him, maybe coaxes the animal out of him, until they're both drowning in a sea of intense passion and lovemaking, the kind where you don't know where she begins and he ends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anjelica ebbi/krystal boyd looks nothing like that American singer. And I should know, I've been watching her videos for the past 5 years now, love her and her x-art/joymii/etc material. Sometimes I just like to marvel at her and think... she's perfect. 

There's one video from x-art with her and taylor sands that's near perfect, if it wasn't for the disappointing ending. But still a great video. 

As for her boyfriend they broke up, but prior to that they had an amazing set of videos from the cashforsextape series, where they go out on dates, talk to each other, actually communicate, have sex in spontaneous places, and when they're finally alone have a lot of the good kind of dirty talk because they're actually a couple and it's been... built up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Japanese understand the catharsis of seeing the guy cum inside the woman, several times in one video in fact, which is perfect,  especially when seeing it dripping out and then he continues for a second round (and there's so much of it too, which is great)

But as everyone knows, Japanese is horrible because of the cultural belief that women should be crying, squealing and generally unhappy during sex, something that they have to "endure" for the man instead of enjoy. The big problem with Japanese porn. 

That's where western porn comes in. Just need to see women actually enjoying the sex and better yet, take active charge of their pleasure by grinding on top of the guy and smiling and actually climaxing on camera, and have the copious amounts of creampie that japanese porn has. 

That I believe, will make the perfect porn video.  </TEXT>

If a medium place does exist, why not more people there?

	<TEXT> Or how it always starts with blowjob, penetration, different position, then jerking off. I personally don't care for the blowjob at all, and normal guys don't need it at all to be erect, simply there being a woman who wants to have sex with them is enough to make a guy rock hard.

In terms of the formulaic nature of porn, I suggest more teasing. Let's say the guy is lying down and the girl is about to sit on him, the tip's almost near the entrance... but she gets up. And he's maybe tied down, struggling to enter her by thrusting his hips, but she's teasing him and teasing him until he can take no more, and then when it does happen it's ***soooo*** much more satisfying. Or another favorite of mine, the almost kiss. They're about to kiss, just an inch from each other, tongues almost out... but it doesn't happen yet. Not yet... not yet... and then: ecstasy. 

If there was forum for porn creators to actually get input from the audience, I'd throw in all these suggestions. </TEXT>

Like any visual medium, porn should make use of the imagination, it's not just what's on the surface, it's also what's implied, it's about seeing more than just the colors onscreen, the visual medium of movies offers both sight and sound and something deeper, atmosphere, that can only be created with a right combination of the many elements that make up a video. 

You keep saying visual, but I feel you're missing a profound element of the visual, not to mention you're basically saying you're more interested in seeing another guy's orgasm than the woman's? As far as nothing to "see", that's also a weird thing to say considering creampies are a thing. Real ones of course.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, no condom is a given, and as for relationship porn my personal go-to for completion is when she deeply tongue kisses him while he's inside her, especially at the moment of completion. I *do* like the actual act of penetration, but I like deep kissing way more, especially when they're in the lotus position. By far my favorite. If they're not kissing, then I want them to communicate to each other about kissing, or just what makes them feel good, like rubbing the girl down there, or nibbling on an earlobe... stuff like that.

One scene I always liked is where the guy goes down  on the girl for a change and is enthusiastically eating her pussy, and then goes back up to deeply kisses her and asks her how good she tastes, then back down and up again, before neither the participants nor the audience can take it anymore, and he finally sticks it in her.

	<TEXT> I mean, do guys seriously even like that? A lot of the mainstream American porn devotes like 5-10 minutes of the guy trying to jerk himself off while the girl just kneels there with her mouth open and a glazed look in her eyes. How did entire generations and millions of people find that remotely erotic?

For my part, I enjoy the catharsis of seeing the guy come inside the woman, or that they "came at the same time" which might be impractical but fantasy wise is my favorite.

I'm just curious because it's the most common type of video ending, they even used a term for it in the industry, the moneyshot </TEXT>

I knew it I knew it I knew it. Ok I didn't know it but... the very first episode when he was talking about the feeling of an otter holding hands, and how everything was rosy colored and whatever, I was thinking, isn't that a little too cloying? Is heaven really a place where you just live forever and there's no suffering, no way to work, overcome obstacles, grow and do the basic thing of what humans do? It's like the first matrix, which was a disaster, so that's just weird. And the frozen yogurt places... that's not my idea of heaven, because I detest froyo, it makes me throw up like all dairy and dairy like products do. And the way Tahani was condescending, right away I was thinking there had to be something up with that. OH and lest we forget, the clowns? Seriously the clowns? That would have been the biggest give-away if I wasn't so distracted by everything that was going on, but clowns have always been evil, and the ledge with no stairs, I mean there's no person whose ideal home is a house that has clown pictures... that was dead give away. I made a mental note of those things from the beginning. Chidi's reasoning for getting into "the bad place" was super weak but I let it slide. That laugh Ted Danson did... literally terrifying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm... even then, I'd say since trailers constitute as spoilers as well, and actually have had real plot twist spoilers in the past. But it's alright you know, I'm just saying that I'm someone who doesn't like knowing anything about a show beforehand, I like going in blind and experiencing everything without any preconceived notions or previous impressions. And I like the fresh experience I get.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was apprehensive at first as I usually am with all new shows that I hear through the grapevine but I was instantly drawn to it.

My favorite thing I'd say so far is how I went from disliking the initially condescending british accented lady to immediately liking her only a few minutes later and finding her hilarious, I like how this show is portraying people, I've never changed my opinion on a person so quickly before.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like the girl is about to whisper into the microphone, she's going to do a skk type sound... and then she doesn't and moves her head away from the microphone. Just keeping the audience guessing which amplifies asmr triggers immensely since it jolts your brain when it surprises you and does something unexpected </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You had me at uncensored. Now let's see if it's actually good (it would be nice if it were colored, but definitely not necessary) 

My favorite uncensored vanilla comics are Pretty Cool and Pisu Hame.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look, I really *want* to like megan plastic face fox character on new girl because so far she's becoming less unlikable and is slightly emoting more, so that's nice instead of the consistent resting bitch face, but jesus christ I can't look at that ugly face, it's so damn plasticy and caked in like, 10 years' worth of plastic surgery. I just don't understand why showrunner elizabeth merriwether got this woman out of all women to be on the show. Is it because the last name is fox and new girl is on the fox channel? I dunno, I just... I dunno.
Lizzy Caplan's Julia from season 1 was basically the same role first, a lot prettier, a lot funnier, and should have been on the show a lot longer (they just wrote her out so poorly, but they do that with all the good boyfriends and girlfriends of nick/jess for some reason, they just don't know how to write them out organically)
I'm invested in the show so it really bothers that fox hasn't left yet, just do the break up already. Otherwise you know I kind of don't mind the season, definitely hate it less than season 5, and that's as big a compliment as one can give with a show that's starting to lose steam and seemingly knows it. </TEXT>
