	<TEXT> They came out with three easy to get into shows in the last year, and they are all great by my opinion.

For a funny "tv-style" show, watch Crunch Time.

For a great Sci-Fi show, watch Day 5. 

For a potty-mouth cartoon, check out Camp Camp. 

Now besides those three shows, there's tons of other content. Like the other poster said, definitely check out Theater Mode if you're into shitty movies. It's pretty funny. 

And because you like Cow Chop, make sure you check out Funhaus. Especially since we will almost certainly be seeing a crossover between the groups when CC moves to L.A. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here are some different Minecraft Let's Plays I have thought of that might be cool to see them play. I know doing it week-in and week-out might get difficult, so these are just some ideas I enjoyed thinking of. If you have any of your own post them in the comments!

I know these are supposed to be posted in the weekly thread, but I don't see that coming up anymore. :(

---

**Flip This House X**

Simple one - Pick a day that Jack is out of town, and literally flip his house. Have the top of his head touching the ground, and have a ladder up to the upside-down house at the top.

---
**Hide and Seek**

Non-Acheivement City. Need a map with a large island that they can play on. The island should absolutely covered in trees, a super thick forest. The main goal of this game is to be the first to collect ten gold nuggets from chests spread throughout the forest. The entire game takes place at night, with day/night cycle turned off.

The hide and seek portion of this is that one person starts as a seeker. Every person is armed with a bow and arrows, but only the current seeker can use theirs. When they shoot a person, that person is now "it", and the previous seeker gets one minute to get away. The seeker is not allowed to open chest, so the only way they have a chance of winning is tagging someone else.

Some of the chests around the map will contain powerups instead of nuggets, like potions of speed, jump and night vision.

---

**The Tri-Wizard Tournament**

Recreating the Harry Potter Tri-Wizard Tournament, except instead of a big Goblet the final goal is to mine the Tower of Pimps.

The first task emulates the dragon task in Harry Potter. A large Obsidian Pit is made, with viewing areas on the side. One side of the pit is the entrance, the other side has a small raised area with a chest. Between the two sides is a Wither. The chest contains some regular apples, plus one golden apple (Withers love apples). Lowest time to steal the Golden Apple wins.

To mix it up a bit, and make it more like the Harry Potter Experience, each contestant will draw before the match to choose the Wither's assistants. This will be something like three skeltons, three creepers, three zombies, or something else. Just something to make that much harder.

The second task is the lake task. There will be a large lake, and the bottom will be covered in chests. For each contestant, one single chest will hold a block of wool that is their assigned color. They need to find that block and bring it to the surface. Once again lowest time wins.

The final third task will of course be the maze. The person with the best time of the first two tasks goes first, and so on. They will be armed with an iron sword and a diamond pickax. The maze should be dark and full of terrors - like zombies and spiders. First to find the Tower of Pimps and the center, mine it, and bring it to the judge on the outside is the winner. 

If you die you have to restart from the outside. 

---

**Achievement City Beautification Project**

Another simple one: Just a beautification project for Achievement city. Each person could pick a project. Somebody could add flowers to their favorite areas. Another could make fireworks trigger on the Achievement City Railroad. They could even build a piano using pressure plates and music boxes, and reenact *Big*. Just small stuff like that.

---

**Settlers of Catan**

If you played the game, you can see how this would work petty quickly. Just build a game board, and Matt or whoever runs it can distribute resources as needed. 

---

**Murder**

Just a note, this is one I suggested previously in the game suggestions thread.

Will recommend again: Murder (Like the G-Mod one), in Minecraft. Set-up a map, and have Matt be the game-master. Each person starts in their own room, and in that room there is a chest. The chest can be accessed from the outside by Matt as well.

Before the game starts, Matt places an item in each chest. Assuming six people are playing, four get nothing, one gets an enchanted bow with a few arrows, plus a jack-o-lantern, and one gets an enchanted sword.

It will play just like murder, with hidden clues around the map they try to collect to get a new bow. If the person with the bow kills the wrong person, Matt throws a potion of slowness at them and they have to put on the jack-o-lantern head.

There are other rules they can put in place too, like the murderer must drop the bow if they pick it up. I'm not sure how well this would all work, but I would love to see it tested.

---

Let me know if you have any suggested improvements!

	<TEXT> I haven't watched the whole episode yet, I just want to say that this is by far my favorite show RT does. I actually look forward to driving to work in the mornings now, just to listen to this. You literally motivate me to go to work, which is no small feat working in a pretty boring office telecom job.

Now, as a small request for merchandising: Please release a goat horn mug or something like it. I would buy it in a heartbeat, especially if it had the H H logo on it.  </TEXT>

Now if you start drawing up a spreadsheet with RT member's poop schedules, then you might be too creepy. Or just have a weird fetish.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true, and kind of what I had a feeling may happen. It's unfortunate, but this subs really seems to be one of the most toxic subs I've been in, and I think it really is a reason the sub isn't growing. 

I remember the sub was posted in an Ask-Reddit thread, and a user from there came into the FAQ thread and asked what Rooster Teeth was all about. He got down-voted. I guarantee that turned him off of Rooster Teeth as a whole. 

One other suggestion I have for you guys to potentially organize is mini-AMAs. Maybe try to talk to Miles or Luna and have some of the animators come in and do a sub-only AMA, or the prop crew, or the production crew, etc. 

My second suggestion is a bit more out there, but may work. In the past I seen somebody wishing they had First to watch some stuff they missed. I was in a decent spot financially, so I asked them their site name and bought them 6 months. I would love to see more of this, Random Acts of RT or something like that. I've also done similar with RT Store gift certificates.

A third is just to really enforce a "Don't be a dick" rule. A lot of time somebody will post an (admittedly dumb) question. The only comment might be something like "Google it" or "Just search the sub." While these are valid answers, people seem to forget that a lot of the time the person who asked the question isn't just looking for an answer, they are looking for a discussion. The quick downvote and snarky answer just drives them away from the sub.

I have no idea what middle ground you would need to improve the sub, but these are just my suggestions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate to say it, but if you actually want to see growth and more subscribers in 2017 you may have to allow/encourage shitposts. I mean, /r/Funhaus has 70,000 less subscribers, but compare the top posts in the last month and you can tall they are hitting /r/all quite a bit more.

https://www.reddit.com/r/roosterteeth/top/?sort=top t=month

https://www.reddit.com/r/funhaus/top/?sort=top t=month

Hell look at another production company like H3H3 and you'll see what I mean:

https://www.reddit.com/r/h3h3productions/top/?sort=top t=month

They have less subscribers but far more upvotes!

Now I know the mods don't actually remove shitposts or anything like that, but I think I nailed down part of the problem. I think you guys might want to consider using CSS and removing the downvote button. Obviously this is only a partial fix, but the honest truth is a small group on people on the new queue can completely control the flow of this entire subreddit. 

I'm sure some people may not like this, but there would still be ways to downvote if you really wanted to. Furthermore, I think this will encourage people to posts here. As a mod of a couple of other subreddits (none super big, mind you), this is an incredibly intimidating sub to posts in because it seems like it's difficult to succeed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretend you want to build a lego house to model a real house, and need to know where you should put the little 2x2 blocks to make support columns. But you don't like straight up and down columns, you like cool diagonal ones. 

So first you build the floors out of lego, with no walls or anything connecting them together, and get ready to build your model. You take the bottom floor, turn it upside down, and place it on the ceiling. you then attach strings to that bottom floor, and now hang the second floor (Also upside down), off of the first floor attached to the ceiling. You make your string go at weird angles and lengths, until the second floor is completely level with the first floor attached to the ceiling.

He then repeated it with the third floor and so-on, until he had all his floors level. At that point he would take the strings off, disconnecting all of the floors. He would then reconstruct it using something hard, like 2x2 Legos, placing these support legos exactly where the strings had been, but this time constructing it the right way up. </TEXT>
