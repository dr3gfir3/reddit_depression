	<TEXT> This is from [Bill Owens' series Suburbia.](http://www.billowens.com/suburbia/) 

[Here is what he had to say about the posted photo](https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/may/27/bill-owens-best-photograph-tupperware-party-1970s-california): Tupperware is a classic, as American as apple pie. Its tied up with the dream of plenty, but its also about being thrifty, so you can preserve both your food and your way of life. The woman hosting this party is standing beside me. Shes not in the shot. And look at her shag carpet! Shed recently bought a rake to make it stand up two or three inches. You could walk across it and see your footprints.

The lady standing up wasnt friends with the others, though. She was a professional salesperson who went from town to town within a 30-mile radius, working on commission. Here shes selling a standard eight-quart bowl and spinner. On the side of her coat you can see all the awards shes won for outstanding sales. This woman devotes her life to selling Tupperware and shes dressed up nice. I love her white boots. You wouldnt know it from their deadpan faces, but I can assure you that this was a lively party. The ladies were all having fun. Theres a glass of wine in front of each of them, and thats a sure sign of a good time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Waddy's Wagon" was the fifth B-29 to take off from Saipan on the first raid on Tokyo, November 24, 1944, and the first back. On January 9, 1945 it took off from Saipan to bomb the Nakajima Aircraft Factory in Musashino, Japan. The crew attempted to guide a crippled B-29, Miss Behaving, back to Saipan but "Waddy's Wagon" had also sustained hits from enemy fighters and the plane was ditched in the Pacific Ocean.

Holding "Damit", the plane's mascot, is Capt. Walter "Waddy" Young an All-American footballer with Oklahoma University in 1939 from Oklahoma. On top, left to right, are Co-pilot Lt. Jack "Cactus" Vetters from Texas; Gunner Sgt. Wilbur "Sleepy" Chapman from Texas; Navigator Lt. Paul "Gat" Garrison Jr. from Pennsylvania; Gunner Sgt. Lawrence "Lucky" Lee from North Dakota; Gunner S/Sgt. Joseph Gatto from New York; Radioman S/Sgt. Kenneth "Windy" Mansir from Maine. On the ground, left to right, are Bombardier Lt. John Ellis from Missouri; Engineer Lt. Bernard "Bunny" Black from New York; Ground Crewman Cpl. Lindsey Decker from Iowa; Radioman Sgt. George "Sparks" Avon from New York; Gunner Sgt. Corbett Carnegie from New York.

On January 9, 1945, Lt. Robert Phillips from Tennessee was the substitute Co-pilot, replacing Lt. Jack Vetters for the mission, so Vetters was the only flight crew member pictured to survive the war.

You may have seen a similar photo with the crew duplicating the pose of their nose art caricatures. [Here is the original version](http://i.imgur.com/iOsnfUW.jpg) of that photo and [here is a colorized version.](http://i.imgur.com/I6DRHHv.jpg) </TEXT>
