	<TEXT> I have a two year old son named Alexander. No that's not the horror story, although any new parents out there might beg to differ. He is the most perfect thing I could ever or will ever create, and I love him with all my heart.  

When I look at Alex, I see myself. An entire lifetime of academic achievements, romantic pursuits, dreams and ambitions, and of course the glorious pride of shooting the game winning goal... the infinite potential of his un-lived life is a miraculous blessing that I am privileged to be a part of. 

My wife Stacey thinks I'm going to run myself into the ground trying to be the world's best dad. She thinks I'm overcompensating because my own dad left when I was two. And so what if I am? Dad leaving *destroyed* my mother. It was because of him that I grew up practically impoverished, withdrawn, and angry at the world. What's so wrong with wanting something better for my own son?

I'll admit that I did tend to obsess over the idea though. Everything was a competition - I wanted a better job than my father, to drive a better car; I even started interrogating my mother about all dad's bad habits so I could avoid them, although she replied with something which shocked me. 

"Why don't you ask him yourself? I know where he lives." 

I couldn't even remember the man. Learning he lived just on the other side of town made me furious. I had to know what his excuse was for never being there, and even more than that, I wanted to tell him straight to his face that I wouldn't be the same terrible father he was. 

I was expecting some kind of burnt out crack-den or whore-house, not the luxury high rise apartments that matched the address. Sure my mother lived comfortably now, but somehow I didn't think he *deserved* the same kind of lifestyle now. My fist landed on his door with a quick burst of powerful thumps. 

"Who are -" the man in the loose bathrobe asked, but he didn't even have to finish the sentence. The resemblance was *uncanny*. The long nose, the angular cheeks, the wisps at the end of his eyebrows - he looked *exactly* like an older version of myself. 

"Yeah," I said. All my carefully prepared arguments from the drive over here evaded my mind. All I could think about was how unsettling it felt to look at that face which could have almost been a mirror.  

"Well alright, come on in." He turned around and sat down on his sofa. "Your mother send you?" 

"Do you and her still talk?" I asked. 

He shrugged. "Sometimes. She told me about your kid. Congratulations on -" 

"Why'd you leave?" It wasn't supposed to go like this. I was supposed to be gloating over a successful life he played no part in. He was supposed to be pleading my forgiveness. So why did my voice crack like I was the one begging? 

"The same reason you'll ditch your kid," he said. "They're better off without us." 

---

I left shortly after that, feeling less satisfied than ever. How dare he presume I would make the same terrible decisions he did? Maybe he was right that I was better off without him, but my son needed me and I needed him. 

I gripped my steering wheel so hard my knuckles turned white. How could I possibly be bad for my son? I was so focused that I didn't even notice the car cutting me off. 

"Hey asshole! Get off the road!" I shouted. I never do that sort of thing, but I was so pissed at my dad that everybody better stay out of my way. 

Maybe that's what dad was talking about? If I brought home this kind of anger, then my son would start to internalize it as he grew up. Maybe it was best for me to just stop at the bar before heading home and take some time to cool off... 

---

I couldn't sleep that night. Stacey was mad at me for coming home late. She smelled the alcohol on me, but I didn't want to tell her about my dad because I just wanted to forget about him. *They're better off without us.* Hah! Better off without you. 

But what if there was something more to it? Maybe my father really knew something I didn't - some inherited health problem, or predisposition to an addiction, or Hell I don't know. He didn't seem accusing or angry or anything when he said it. Maybe he was actually trying to warn me. If that was the case, then wasn't I being selfish in putting my own comfort over the security of my family? 

It was 2 in the morning when I knocked on his door again. He opened it wearing the same disgusting bathrobe. 

"Why are they better off without us?" I blurted out. I wanted to cut straight to the point and not give small-talk a chance to sap my anger. 

"Come on in, have a seat."

"I don't want to come in. I want an answer," I said. 

"You smell like booze," he said. "So did I when I went home. Your mother couldn't stand it." 

---

That was it? He was an alcoholic? Well I wasn't. Sure I drank from time to time, but I wouldn't let it ruin my relationship with Stacey like it did with him and my mother. I couldn't stand the sight of him, so I just took off right after he gave me that explanation. 

But Stacey had been upset when she smelled it, so maybe I could still learn from him. I decided to spend the rest of the night at a friend's house so she wouldn't have to see me like this. 

I sent her a text to let her know what I was doing and went over to my buddy Tom. He and I stayed up chatting for awhile, I had a couple more drinks to help me sleep, and then I crashed on his couch. Between the alcohol and knowing I resolved the issue, I slept like a baby through the rest of the night. 

---

I wish I hadn't though, because she was was absolutely *livid*. She wouldn't even let me explain myself. I tried to tell her about my father, but she just thought it was *awfully convenient* considering I hadn't mentioned him yesterday. 

The alcohol - the night out - she was utterly convinced I was cheating. I even tried getting her to talk to Tom, but she wouldn't stop yelling long enough for me to get him on the phone. 

I shouldn't have hit her. I know it was wrong. But I couldn't get her attention, and I was getting so mad at her being mad... shit, I don't know. It wasn't even hard - I just pushed her away from me and she fell over. I was so embarrassed that I just rushed straight out the door. 

Where was I supposed to go though? I didn't want to bring my mother in on this. She had to believe I was the perfect son - the perfect husband that my dad never was. The only person who seemed to understand what I was going through, the only one I wanted to talk to, was my dad. 

**Tap tap tap**. My knock lacked all of the certainty and power it had the first time around. And yeah, maybe he was just going to say something that pissed me off worse, but maybe he'd also remind me about how much worse of a father he was. Compared to him and everything he's done, I'd be able to look at myself and know I wasn't so bad. 

"Tell me everything," I said. 

"Well come on in."

"I don't want to come in. I want to know what made you such a shitty father." 

We stood facing each other through the doorway. He looked worn out, but I must have too after last night. For a second I thought he was going to just close the door in my face, but then he sighed and said: 

"I hit your mother. Are you happy now?" 

"Yeah what else? I want to know everything." My breath was coming in shallow gasps. There had to be more. There had to be something that made this man worse than me. 

"Just leave it alone, will you? It's ancient history," he said. "Either come in or leave, because I don't want to just stand here like a couple of -" 

"I want you to tell me what else you did to us!" I shouted. 

"Yeah, well know what I want?" He said. "I hope when your son comes knocking on your door in twenty some years, you do something I couldn't and break the cycle. I hope you don't answer him." 

He started to close the door. I tried to push my way in, and the door *slammed* on my foot. 

"I'm not you! I'll never be you!" 

He tried to push me back so he could close the door, but I barreled into him and knocked him to the floor. He tried to crawl away, but I straddled him and pinned him to the ground. 

"Get the Hell off me -"

"Not until you tell me what else made you leave."

"It's none of your business -" He tried to sit up, but I forced his head down. *Too hard*. It slammed into the tile floor with a sickening crack, and a pool of blood began to spread out from the wound. He wasn't fighting back anymore. His body felt limp. 

"What did you do? What did you do?" I kept shaking him as though that would wake him up, but all I did was smear the blood around. But there! One of his eyes flickered open for a moment. 

"I swear to God," I said, "if you don't tell me I'll -"

"I killed a man," he grunted. "After that, I couldn't look you or my wife in the eye, so I left." 

"Who?" I asked, but somehow I already knew the answer. 

"He had it coming. For leaving my mother. For leaving me." My grip went slack, but it didn't matter. He couldn't stand anymore. I let him slip to the ground and stared at my bloody hands. 

What son would want a father like this? Maybe he was right. Maybe they are better [off without us](https://redd.it/66r2hk).

	<TEXT> Growing up, I was one of those kids who could be washed with a fire hose and still have dirt between my toes. Mud was the best toy in the world. I used it like Play-Doh to build entire forts, and my twin sister said she could always tell when I was coming before she saw me because of the *squelching* sound.  

Bugs? Bring it on. I'd eat one for a dollar. Painting? My whole body was both brush and canvas. Maybe you'd find me baking a cake with my sister. We looked almost identical, but you could easily tell us apart because she would be wearing disposable gloves up to her elbow while my whole face was buried in the bowl to lick the batter. 

That's what makes it so unfair that she got sick and I didn't. It started with her feet and ankles swelling up. I thought she was just starting to gain weight, and I forced her to jog with me in the morning before school. She kept trying to push through, but she couldn't keep up with me like she used to. I shouldn't have made her feel bad for it, but I was only 17 then. I thought she just wasn't trying. I didn't understand that she was trying twice as hard as me, or that trying sometimes wasn't enough. 

A month later, she could barely walk without throwing up. She was exhausted and dizzy all the time, and I felt so helpless watching her drift away from me. She was diagnosed with a polycystic kidney disease which was causing both of her kidneys to fail. She tried dialysis for awhile, but it quickly became clear that she was going to need a transplant. 

I didn't even have to think about it. She was my other half. If her body was sick, my body was sick, and if there was something I could do to make her better, then I that was the end of the discussion. It was just bad luck for her to express the inherited condition while I didn't, and it could have just as easily been me. It was going to be a routine enough operation though, and once she had one of my kidneys there was no reason for the cysts to form anymore. We were both going to be okay. Yeah we'd have to be on medications for the rest of our life, but as long as she'd be taking it with me, it would be fair. Besides, what twin doesn't want to have matching scars?   

We were prepared for the surgery together in the same room. We made a game out of drinking the nauseating laxatives which were necessary before the operation: first one to get through it gets to choose which kidney to have. It wasn't even close to fair because she started out nauseous and I had always been the one who could stomach anything, so I made a big show of spitting it up and let her win. Her gloating about beating me was the happiest I had seen her in a long time. 

It was so embarrassing because she wouldn't stop giggling while the male nurse shaved the little hairs on our abdomen. I started laughing too, and the nurse looked so uncomfortable that he had to excuse himself from the room to 'check something'. 

"Come back!" she yelled after him. "We can do you next. It'll be fun!" 

Her smile was glowing despite everything she had to go through. I want to always remember her like that. 

The surgery was terminated half-way through. There had been a complication, and her body had gone into shock the moment her first kidney was removed. They said she woke up for a moment and held my hand right before she went, but they might have just been saying that to try and make me feel better. It didn't work. 

The doctor said I could see the body if I wanted, but what was the point? All I had to do was look in the mirror. All the pain and loss on my face - hers must have looked the same way. Then the doctor leaned in real close - like he didn't want anyone else to hear - and he whispered something to me. 

"Since you're all prepared for the surgery anyway, do you want to still go through with it?" 

"She's gone. What's the point?" 

"There's someone else who is also a match. You could be saving their life instead." 

What did he think this was, a charity? I wasn't just giving organs away. I was only doing this because she was my sister and I would have given anything for her. I wasn't about to risk my life for -

"The recipient is willing to compensate you with 250,000 dollars." 

I choked on my reply. It's amazing how quickly you're able to justify something for that kind of money. I had already been prepared to give it up. Was there really anything wrong with selling it? I would be able to help my family with all the medical costs my sister had wracked up from her illness. Besides that, I would be able to help so many more people...

I nodded. The anesthesia mask went back over my face and I slipped back into oblivion.

---

I didn't tell anyone about the money which was discreetly wired into my bank account. There was an unwholesomeness about it somehow, but maybe that was just because the whole incident was so close to my sister's death. 

I paid off all of my parents bills and told them they were covered by an anonymous donor, which I guess was true. Over the next three years, I funneled the rest into a non-profit organization which helped people get their medical procedures. 

*Three years*. It went fast. I'd expected that kind of money to be able to help people for a lifetime, but people came from everywhere to make use of the fund. 

Co-pay for cancer medications, necessary operations which were denied by insurance, health screenings for those without insurance - three years and the entire 250k was spent. But I received so many letters and gift baskets and people hugging me *sobbing* about how I saved their life. It was a rough estimation, but I figure in that time I saved the lives of at least 30 people. 

*30 people for a kidney!* I was  a 20 year old college girl. There was nothing special about me at all. But knowing that such a small sacrifice had made such a huge impact - I couldn't just stop now. 

I went back to the doctor who performed the operation, and he confided that there was a constant market for other organs. I asked about harvesting from cadavers or something, but he said only live donations or incredibly fresh harvests would bring that kind of money. 

Getting volunteers though? Next to impossible. And it was illegal to advertise buying that sort of thing. Even if I managed to raise awareness about it around campus without getting arrested, then people would probably keep the money for themselves instead of helping others. If I wanted my foundation to continue, I was going to need to get the organs myself. 

It made me angry to even think about how greedy people were. The potential for good each body contained was astronomical. It was selfish - almost criminal to think that they valued their own life over the lives of dozens of others. I had several meetings with the doctor trying to brainstorm ideas to collect, and that's when he told me a secret which he had sworn to keep for life. 

The man who had my kidney killed my sister. He'd paid the nurse 100,000 to do it so he could get my kidney instead. The doctor had found out too late to stop him - his own life was even at risk if he didn't extend the offer to me. 

I finally found the first person to join my Organ Harvesting Club. 

---

I tracked him down with the doctor's help and waited for him to come home. Getting in was easy - I just rang the doorbell and he opened it. 

My plan was just to get information on him and his house on my first visit, but I couldn't hold myself back. His blood was flowing through *my* kidney. My sister's blood was on his hands. I punched him square in the face and tackled him straight to the ground.

He was twice my size, but he was fat and old and I was an animal. If I had prepared better, I wouldn't have gouged my fingers into his eyes (worth 750$ each). I wouldn't have broken his teeth with my elbow (about 1,000$) or spilled so much blood when I slit his throat with my switchblade (337$ a pint). 

I didn't even get his body to the doctor in time to get top dollar on the rest of the organs, but I'll be more careful next time. I expect to get close to 600k for the nurse who killed her.

Can you think of any other club which can potentially save hundreds of lives with each new member that's added? I hope my sister is watching somewhere, and that she knows how much good has come from her death. She can stay pure and clean and perfect, but I was never afraid to [get my hands dirty](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).
