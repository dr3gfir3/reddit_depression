	<TEXT> Firstly, I don't think you've made any argument as to why future art will not be as good as last art. We've had thousands of years of art. You've picked a couple of important artists and claimed that nothing will top it. Why won't they? In the hundreds or thousands of years to come, why is it unlikely for someone to make art as great as the last greats.

Secondly, art isn't just some old relic to be judged by its historical impact. Art is about communicating ideas, creating passion and excitement amongst people, creating something that people relate to, something relevant to the audience of today. 

Nothing against the Mona Lisa but I'm more excited to hear the new Radiohead album. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your post makes you seem very concerned about how people will judge you and your family. Your relationship with your children and your responsibility to support them is more important than what your bigoted neighbours will say about you. If you are in an area where being gay is difficult, well that means that your children require MORE support from you, not LESS.

Also if you are concerned about how people will view you, as time goes on, more and more people are viewing the non-support of gay people to be unacceptable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Success in terms of career and money doesn't equal happiness. I know many people don't believe that, but it really is only part of the equation. 

Lack of empathy may well lead you to faster financial or career success in many situations, but that is not really what you are after. What you really want is happiness. 

I think people that care about other people and have people care about them are the happiest people. There are plenty of "successful" people that are not happy. 

While success and empathy both contribute to a person's happiness, I think that empathy has a bigger impact. The joys of material possessions wear off, regardless how much you have. What's the point of having success if you lack the empathy to enjoy it and share it with others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I picked up the Darkthrone record in an awesome bar in Bergen called Apollon, which had over 30 beers on tap and a huge metal (and other) record collection to buy. The Sabbath one is from a small second hand record store in Bergen also. </TEXT>
