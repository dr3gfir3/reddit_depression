You call it recency bias to believe the above then say "there's a reason TOS was rebooted into films" as if that was some choice between TOS and several series that didn't exist yet when the wildly popular film series started, not a result of the popularity of movies that themselves were developed after a TV reboot (Phase II) failed to get off the ground.

The TOS movies had a better box office track record and better brand recognition.  These are the people who gave us *Into Darkness.* I seriously doubt they chose TOS because they wisely saw it was higher in quality.


The fuck is up with everyone's hostility in this thread?  Has everyone forgotten the MST3K mantra? It applies in situations like this, too.  You love Trek. I love Trek. Why on God's Blue Betazed should which one a person *prefers* be such a point of bitter argument? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its common name is *Pomp and Circumstance*.  It's an excerpt, usually referred to as "Land of Hope and Glory," of the first march from a series of them which is named *The Pomp and Circumstance Marches*.  

The series is by British composer Edward Elgar.  The story goes that a professor at Yale was a friend of Elgar's, and he arranged for the piece to be played in his honor at a graduation at which Elgar accepted an honorary doctorate.  It became a tradition from there.

So TL;DR, they're actually the same piece.

---
EDIT: As for the second part, *America The Beautiful*, dude's talking up his sleeve.  Katherine Bates of Massachusetts wrote the poem that comprises the lyrics.  The most common music used for the song is the hymn, [*O Mother Dear, Jerusalem*](https://www.loc.gov/item/ihas.100010615/) by Samuel Ward of New Jersey.  Just because the tune has a similar meter to *Auld Lang Syne*, which is what I assume he's referring to, does not mean they are related in any way.

Both sets of lyrics are set in something called Common Meter.  It's worth noting that *Amazing Grace*, the Gilligan's Island theme song, *Advance Australia Fair* (Australia's national anthem), *The House of the Rising Sun*, *The Rains of Castamere*, and even the Pokemon theme song also use similar meter.  Just try singing the Pokemon song to the tune of America the Beautiful.  It actually works. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuji, gala and red delicious aren't popular with consumers so much as they are with *growers and grocery stores*.  They are cheaper to grow, ship better, bruise less easily, look good on a shelf and keep well. They're big business apples.  The decline in popularity of the red delicious wasn't reacted to fast enough largely for those reasons.

Also, I'm mostly just doing some friendly ribbing (take a wild guess what the most grown cultivar is in Michigan), but I'd like to point out that the comment you replied to asserted that Michigan grows the *best* apples, not the ones Wal Mart and McDonald's are most likely to buy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Delicious):
In the 1980s, 'Red Delicious' represented three-quarters of the harvest in Washington state. A decade later, reliance on 'Red Delicious' had helped to push Washington state's apple industry "to the edge" of collapse.[5] In 2000, Congress approved and President Bill Clinton signed a bill to bail out the apple industry, after apple growers had lost $760 million since 1997.[6] By 2000, this cultivar made up less than one half of the Washington state output, and in 2003, the crop had shrunk to 37 percent of the state's harvest, which totaled 103 million boxes. Although Red Delicious still remained the single largest variety produced in the state in 2005, others were growing in popularity, notably the 'Fuji' and 'Gala' varieties.

Your apple industry almost collapsed because it got addicted to the Kim Kardashian of apples.  You've now swapped a good portion of that production effort for...Fuji and Gala.  Nice work there.  Let us know when you've learned how to grow an apple that tastes like something. :p

	<TEXT> * Michigan was the first state to abolish the death penalty, making it the first English-speaking government body to do so.

* Michigan was the first state to put the establishment and maintenance of public libraries in its constitution.

* The Wal-Mart/Super Target -type department/grocery store was invented in Grand Rapids.  The first one was designed to be easily converted into a car dealership should the idea fail.

* In addition to having the second longest coastline in the US, Michigan has the longest freshwater coastline of any state or province in the world.

* Michigan has more lighthouses than any other state.

* Kellogg's and Post are in Battle Creek.  Breakfast cereal is basically a Michigan invention.

* We almost went to war with Ohio that one time over Toledo.  Congress gave us the UP instead.  Joke's on them; there was a ton of lumber and iron up there, and the largest commercial deposit of copper ever found is up there, too.


* Woodward Ave in Detroit was the first (concrete) paved road in the world (defined as more than one contiguous mile).

* Woodward, at the corner of Michigan, also sported the world's first four-way green/yellow/red stoplight.  It was invented by a DPD officer.

* MSU was the first higher learning establishment to teach agricultural science.

* The Detroit-Windsor tunnel is the first international car tunnel in the world.

* The first international *railroad* tunnel was built in Port Huron.

* Detroit was the first city to use telephone numbers.

* Our state police were the first to use a radio system.

* Vernors is the first soda pop made in the US.

* The total area of farmland in Michigan is half again as big as the entirety of Maryland, or roughly three times the size of Connecticut.  If it were a country, it would be slightly smaller than Swaziland and slightly larger than East Timor.

* Michigan is the second-most agriculturally diverse state.  We grow about 70% of all cherries produced in the US (which is the second largest producer of cherries, period, behind Turkey), and are first in production of beans, asparagus, blueberries, cucumbers, lowfat ice cream mix (don't know what this is but I keep hearing it), easter lilies, hanging flower baskets, impatiens, petunias, and geraniums.  We are second for apples, squash and carrots. 85% of this is grown in the western half of the lower peninsula.

* Grand Rapids was the first city to add fluoride to drinking water.

* If you are in Michigan, you are never more than six miles from a body of water.

I know it seems off topic, but I thought I'd point it out as the station's news department is based on its parent independent station in all but branding and the "affiliate" part only means that it buys primetime programming from the network. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So get this: 

Grand Rapids and Flint were both officially settled roughly around 1820 (this is not including native villages), but GR hit the industrial revolution just right with its furniture industry and grew much faster at first.  Grand Rapids passed a hundred thousand people sometime just after the turn of the 20th century.  At this time Flint only had 13,000 people.  

By 1960, Grand Rapids had experienced some pretty good population growth considering it had lost the industry that put it on the map, and was up to 177,000 people.  Flint had roughly 200,000 and had taken over as the second largest city in Michigan at this point.  

Poor Flint started losing people in the late sixties. This turned to a flood in the seventies and never stopped.  Flint dropped behind the capitol, Ann Arbor and two Detroit suburbs (Warren and Sterling Heights), and is now seventh largest in the state.  

It was estimated that Flint dropped below 100K last year.  At this rate it is entirely possible that Wyoming, Grand Rapids' most populous suburb (which is growing like the weed that it is), will have a larger population than Flint by 2025.

In other words, in sixty years Flint grew by more than the entire 1960 population of Grand Rapids, and will have lost more than half of that growth in the sixty after that.  It's now on track to be passed by a suburb of the city it once eclipsed.

I, for one, do not welcome a world where Wyoming is larger than Flint. </TEXT>

* "Plan 9 From Outer Space" for an example of film that "echoes through time" precisely because it sucked.

* Saturday morning cartoons for an example of media that merely coast through the public consciousness retaining goodwill through pure nostalgia.

I'd argue that the assertion, "something which resonated with a portion of the public across a protracted period = can't be something bad" is based on an *ad populum*.

I, for one, am on the "why did people even like this" wagon for "Clerks", fwiw.  I found it puerile, did not relate with it one bit, and couldn't stand the characters.  If sucking is a subjective quality then not sucking can be too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is definitely an old possibly-industrial wheel or mill of some kind. Judging by the quality of the wood and the lack of wear I wonder if it was made to be mostly ornamental, or at least for something soft...as mentioned before, like flour.  Shot in the dark, but MC 21676 could be the craftsman's initials and the date of of creation.

The side of the small part in picture seven probably fit into the larger part, and there is evidence of wear from a now-missing grind plate that fit into the part shown in the first and second-to-last pictures.  the side of the small part shown in picture eight looks a lot like an old industrial wheel, so it probably hooked up to some sort of machinery on that side or had something else attached to it.

Edit: On second thought, I wonder if these pieces were part of the same machine or if they were just bought and refurbed together.  Do they fit together? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might have something to do with the fact that they opened their donut shop down the street from a bunch of homeless shelters in the first place.  

They moved into an area where a problem has existed for decades, then blamed the problem for their closure.  It's not the homeless people's fault that the area didn't gentrify as fast as the owner wanted, and it's not like they have anyplace better to go.

I would also argue that they are exaggerating the problem.  I'm not saying it isn't bad, but it's certainly not Times Square in the 70s bad like they make it sound.  It's not even as bad as it was 20 years ago.

Propaganda lost a founding partner awhile ago, the brains of the operation, who was replaced by the daughter of the building owner (the other partner).  Some said he was pushed out by the owner, but that's neither here nor there.  The quality of the donuts has declined quite a bit, but they are still grossly overpriced (literally 4x) compared to the local competition.  The store has also been open less and less of late.  Clearly something else was wrong.

Said building owner is currently trying to keep one of the shelters from expanding nearby.  It really, really looks like he's trying to use the business' failure as political leverage by blaming the homeless people.

Imagine dropping a 400hp V8 into a rusted-out Ford Festiva.  Doesn't work, right? You've got great potential power but no way to safely apply it to pavement.  That's my brain.  Sometimes I think it's worse that I'm smart because I can't escape a deep understanding of exactly how broken I am.

I struggled academically, even with good help.  I had a compulsive need for more knowledge (still do), but school often felt specifically designed to thwart me. I spent a lot of free time teaching myself things I missed in class.  I spent much more disappointing my teachers and trying to make up for it.

I had emotion control issues and was never any good socially, and never had any friends.  I went to a school with mostly richer kids who took every opportunity to make me feel lesser-than.  It got to the point where I would stay in during recess to avoid the other kids.  I was a full-blown misanthrope before I even knew what the word meant.

I don't recall exactly how it was that we ended up tuning into our CBS affiliate one Saturday night, but the episode was a rerun of "The Measure of A Man."  Here we had an entertaining show that was also smart on several levels, presented in a whole-cloth representation of everything I wished the universe could be.  Optimism and hope just oozed out of the thing.  We also had an emotionally stunted outsider as the hero of the story--being defended fiercely by his friends, to boot.

I took it on myself to learn everything about Trek.  I set the VCR to record it whenever it was on, whether I'd seen that episode or not.  I practically memorized the Star Trek Encyclopedia when it came out.  There was a point where I had read every TNG novel (and most of the TOS ones) and companion book in publication.  I'm rusty, but I can still usually get the season and episode title just from the first few minutes of an episode.  I lived and breathed Star Trek.  I didn't know it at the time, but it also gave me an intellectual outlet that helped me handle school, as I could use it to escape the stress,  process the world my way, and rethink things.

I don't consider it too dramatic to say that Star Trek saved my childhood.

Several years on, I still had some trouble with social skills. I was 24 and I'd never kissed a girl.  I did have friends, though, and all of them were Trekkies.  They pushed me to put up a profile on OKCupid.  Someone responded, and we started dating.  Knowing the stereotypes around Trek, I waited awhile before mentioning my love for Star Trek.  Turns out she owned Spock ears and had built a model of the Enterprise D.  She'd had a rough childhood (early divorce, alcoholic father) but had also found solace in the Star Trek universe.  I'm going to avoid being sappy, but we've been married almost seven years and have a four-year-old Trekkie.  I never thought I'd be here.

TL;DR Special needs kid.  Star Trek was my only friend, and one of the things that brought me together with my wife. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My late larger one [\(found this, see v7-v11, mine's apparently a nine\)](http://bootleg.sksapps.com/tutorials/ps2version/ps2id.htm) appears to have a very similar hardware configuration to the slimmer one, so it has a ton more interior airspace.  I remember being concerned about how hot my friend's new smaller one was compared to mine.  I also found [this post](http://psx-scene.com/forums/f20/best-ps2-version-62714/) of people taking the question very seriously indeed.

That said, early PS2s had DVD problems, but other than that they're all pretty solid.  Nothing to worry about on an X360 level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Has anyone spoken with the mods of /r/offmychest to see what their rationale is?  OP, I've been banned by a bot before but a calm note to the mods overturned it without fuss.

Also, I have to point out that guilt by association is a valid means of policing a subreddits when another subreddit has a well-established history of leaking trolls if not outright brigading.  As a website administrator,  sometimes I have to block entire foreign ISPs to stop people from attacking it or otherwise injecting inappropriate content. This is the same thing.  It might be extreme but it might also be easily seen as necessary.

EDIT: I also find it important to point out that *your right to free speech does not extend beyond action of the government*.  You can't be jailed for it.  Individual people can still ostracize you for it. </TEXT>

That, and Sony needed to make a profit on the machine this time around. They took a serious bath with the ps3 at first, and all of that innovative technology made the machine much harder to program for.  Sony had a lot of priorities in designing the PS4, not just power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the US we usually have states divided up into counties or parishes (same thing, different terminology), then each of those is divided into townships (again, terminology may vary), and addresses are counted off in numbers (roughly analogous to Cartesian coordinates) from an arbitrary point within the most populous township or the middle of the county seat (capitol).  These numbers rise all the way out to the county line.  Counties can be big, and this point is almost never dead center, so the numbers can get pretty high. 

Exceptions are sometimes made in more aged areas for addresses that predated this system, but it's more common that some time ago the local government actually changed the numbers on buildings to better fit this system.  This still happens from time to time.

In Kent County, MI, where I live, Grand Rapids is the county seat.  This city is divided into quadrants (NE,SE,SW,NW) by a North-South baseline road (Fulton St) and an East-West one (Division Ave) with 0,0 for the county being the intersection of both (even though this is in the corner of the county).  In addition to this, nearly every street in GR is platted as "something Avenue" of it runs north-south and "something Street" if it's east-west (some exceptions being made for old Ottawa tribe roads).

After that each 100 addresses is 3/5ths of a mile from the previous, with the address of the house being its distance in 1/800s (math?) of a mile from the baseline road most perpendicular to that street.  Because of this our blocks (and numbered streets) are actually numbered in 800s, not 1000s.  For example, 28th street (technically 28th St SE or SW depending on which side of Division Ave you're on) is a major road here, and itsname name designates it as baseline 28 or 2800 south.
