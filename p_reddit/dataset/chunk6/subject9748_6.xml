	<TEXT> Great question!! I went from writing thrillers for grownups to writing thrillers for kids and am drawn to the dark side but you can't cross some lines with kid lit! 

As my son became an avid and selective reader, I discovered that kids love to be scared not just in movies but in books too. I started reading some of the books my son had on his bookshelf and in doing this I began to see patterns in these kid adventure tales  and I began applying what I learned to create my own stories. In writing thrillers for kids I discovered these things:

Put the kids in charge. Kids dont want to read about grownups having adventures.
Which leads intohave the kids figure out how to take the bad guys downnot grownups. Kids want to see themselves as the hero!
Whatever scary situations they find themselves inthey must navigate their way out.
Dont dwell on the dark stuff. Make it happen fast without gory detailkids can use their imagination.
Give them friends in their travels.A kid needs friends to help him along his scary adventure.
Through story events,have the kids discover their own strength and courage to overcome bad things happening to them.
End the chapters on cliffhangers to encourage kids to want to keep turning the pages and find out what happens next.
Have it work out in the end, or at least partially, even if all seems doomed for a while.
Add humor! Interjecting a dollop of funny can alleviate the tension in the scariest of scenes.
Make it a series! Have a final resolution to the story but leave it open for more stories down the road. Kids love to follow their beloved characters into new adventures.

So while there are some tense, frightening things that happen in my kids' books I figured out this map to help guide me in writing them. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did for nearly 2 years! My parents owned one in NH on Squam Lake (where they filmed On Golden Pond) when I was a kid. Super fun as a only child with lots of kids to play with. I went back there this past year to do research for a book I am writing for teens set there!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, the first one I ever fell in love with was The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis! It was fantasy and that was it for me. The first story I wrote after reading it was fantasy about a wizard, a flying ship and dodo birds. After that I fell in love with the Little House series by Laura Ingalls Wilder. I so wanted to be her! When we lived in a campground in NH and had hogs and chickens that I got to take care of, I so was Laura! I also got all of Roald Dahl's books from the Tooth Fairy :) . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HI, Im Donna Galanti and author of the first two books in the paranormal suspense series, A Human Element and A Hidden Element, and the first two books in my middle grade adventure fantasy series, Joshua and the Lightning Road and Joshua and the Arrow Realm.

Im drawn to exploring the twin sides of dark and light in my writing, whether for kids or grownups, and the tormented hero is my favorite. Much of my own life blends into my fiction, especially from my travels, having been adopted, and being an only-child. I started writing books out of grief after my mother died.

My newest book for kids, Joshua and the Arrow Realm, is a high-stakes romp through a wild, imaginary world where descendants of the Greek gods walk beside you, beasts abound, and not everythingor everyoneis as it seems. I think its a fun mix of mystery, mayhem, and fellowship. 

I love to write about kids being their own heroes and I also love traveling to schools where I (hopefully!) inspire kids to read and write. Middle grade is super fun  one step in the world of magic and one step in the real world. Ask me anything!
