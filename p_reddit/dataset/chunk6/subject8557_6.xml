	<TEXT> Well, part of the justification judges and law enforcement give is that bikes don't have the same capacity to injure as automobiles do. There are injuries from bike related incidents, however I have yet to hear of a bicycle caused fatality. That is not however true for automobiles. Don't get me wrong, I think a lot of cyclists ride recklessly and irresponsibly, but an automobile driving in such a fashion would be much more dangerous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have got to be kidding me. 

When I was 14, the local cop came by my house every day. Got all up in my business. Didn't ever think about it until I was older, but I was the only black kid in the area and he didn't go to any of the white kids' homes.

I managed a business in the nice part of town and the local cop stared me down for the first two months until he realized I worked there. 

I'm not saying cops are all bad, but unless I absolutely need to, I am not calling them or asking them for their help one little bit. If you ask ppl in the black community, they will say the same thing. The police never make anything better, I stand by that.

	<TEXT> That was condescending and I resent it. I may not know all the ins and outs, but I worked in Congress and know better than most. What's going to happen if the alt right takes this as encouragement and acts on it? What happens when its revealed or realized that this terrorism could have been stopped if the president didn't do this? By the foia we are entitled to a lot of info, but thats another story. He is literally putting American lives at risk and some nazi will act on it. What happened to providing for the common defense, general welfare and blessings of liberty? How's that going to work for him? 

Furthermore, just because I sometimes get triggered and don't perceive reality as it exists, doesn't mean that I don't understand, sometimes I just stick my foot in my mouth before I fully understand. But maybe one day you'll have ptsd and understand.

	<TEXT> Toucan Sam was so upset when they spelled his name wrong that he surprised everyone with his pent up ferocity and destroyed all his enemies with impunity at the sleight.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry but this sort of happy-go-lucky bullshit is just meaningless nonsense. Try living with PTSD and saying it doesn't define you. I tried for years only to listen to self-righteous, clueless people like you tell me I should just get over it, or don't let it define me. It sounds good, sure, but that's all, just another sweet nothing.  </TEXT>
