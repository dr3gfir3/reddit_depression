	<TEXT> I was on metformin and duramine but they made my heart feel incredibly....'fluttery' (only word I could think of) and I stopped sleeping. I looked like a speed freak haha. I did find though that it helped my blood tests and I was feeling better during the day. 

It is really hard...I remember when I was first diagnosed I thought my whole life was over. I was only 16 I am now 19. I just completely withdrew and I think that made my depression a lot worse but I researched a lot and relied a lot on my family and boyfriend.  </TEXT>
