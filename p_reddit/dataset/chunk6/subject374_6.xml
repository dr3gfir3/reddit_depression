	<TEXT> The way the doors work at my school is that locking them keeps people out, but anyone inside can still leave without the door unlocking. A one way lock, not sure what it's called. 

No one can be trapped in the room, in case of fire and such, but unwanted visitors are kept out.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mr. Cooke's Last Chemistry Class </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-20 06:12:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mr. Cooke was the best Chemistry teacher. He was known to be an asshole at times, but he was good at his job. He got along well with the other teachers, and with students he'd taught in the past. Most of the kids who didn't like him were the ones currently being taught by him. He didn't take shit, he didn't accept excuses and he didn't give you extra chances once you proved you were too lazy or too incompetent to understand the lessons. 


He never gave lessons twice. You listened the first time, took notes, and went to your notes or other students when you were confused. You could ask him a question, and he'd explain to you, but he also taught college students so he expected you to be able to figure things out. He was respected, and feared. Sometimes he had a temper. The level of fear everyone had for him was at an all time high on his last day teaching at our school. 


We were nearly halfway through the year, a time when everyone was both excited and worn out. Christmas break had come and passed, and most of the students had taken on that after-break mentality. Forgetting the things we learned in the first half of the year, slacking, not coming prepared to class, half-assing assignments because all we needed was to do the finals for the semester, and just general rowdy behavior. The Juniors were intolerable, and we went in to Chemistry that day overconfident and unprepared. 


The day was supposed to be simple, we were all finishing up projects and studying for the upcoming finals. Some students were mixing chemicals and recording the reactions, some were studying, some reading, some doing work for other classes, all of us were relatively on task, save for a few of the guys. They were dicking around in the lab portion of the classroom, mixing random things, running around the workstations, and pretending to throw chemicals at one another. Mr. Cooke had left the room a few minutes prior, and they had taken full advantage of the absence. 


As one of the students who was actually working, I got annoyed by the situation pretty quick. We were all going to get in shit when the teacher got back. There were some more bold students who were trying to work as well, ones who actually told the guys to stop fucking around before we got in trouble. They just laughed about it though. 


Sean, Blaine, and Logan. Best friends, cocky idiots. I can't believe that after teachers dealing with their antics for two and a half years that they'd still be assigned to the same class. Why would you assign three guys that are *always* doing reckless things to the *same* Chemistry class? It was beyond me. The three of them had already pulled several stunts in here that have lead to detentions and suspensions, and I had no doubt that Mr. Cooke would be absolutely pissed when he witnessed the latest one. I guess I was right. 


Someone left to get him, not wanting us all to get the lecture about standing by during a potentially dangerous situation. Mr. Cooke came thundering into the room, followed hastily by the girl who had retrieved him. He shut the door behind him, locking it into place, then walked across the room and locked the other door. The boys paid no heed to the teacher, and were still running around holding bottles of acid. Stupid. Maybe that was what set Mr. Cooke over the edge. 


He stood behind his desk silent, waiting for the class to realize. Most of us at the desks did, and we fell into a hush. Soon enough everyone else caught on, but the boys who had been messing around had only calmed slightly. They stood side by side in front of the lab area, knocking into each other and snickering. It was a definite improvement from their other moronic activities, but they were still bound to get in some trouble. *Some* being the understatement of the century. 


Williams, Kolovsky, Overbeek, He pronounced each syllable with enough force that he could have broken their names apart just by saying them, Get up here.


The boys walked over, their smug grins proving that they had no idea of the hell they had to pay. Mr. Cooke produced a large glass bowl, and placed it on top of the desk. He walked over to the lab area and collected a large glass bottle, then brought it over the desk and proceeded to fill the bowl halfway. 


Alright students, He began, What is the normal safety procedure for dealing with *any* chemicals? 


A girl near the front raised her hand and began listing the safety protocol we had learned in the beginning of the year. The teacher nodded as she spoke, but the boys behind him were snickering to each other and mocking the girl. 


So what you're saying is, running around carelessly with any sort of chemical is not safe or permitted? 


The girl hesitated, looking for a moment to the boys who were now mocking the teacher. Mr. Cooke abruptly pick up the bowl on his desk and tossed the contents at the students behind him. There was no sign, no warning. He had been so calm, and now suddenly the room was full of panicked students. We had gone from an attentive flock, to a field of scattered prey. Our shepherd had been a wolf in disguise. 


I sat stricken in my seat. People were screaming, rushing against the doors. I stared at Logan, who clutched his face in agony, the skin seemed to slowly be melting away. It became a grotesque mask over his face, blood and melting flesh mixing together to create a hideous visage. Blaine and Sean didn't fair much better. They had all been hit to some severe extent, faces, necks, chests and hands. They all look like monsters, and their agonized cries have haunted me since that day. 


I joined the others who were escaping the room, entering the hall in a state of fearful panic. Other teachers and students were rushing forward to find out what was going on, and the screaming-- oh god there was so much screaming. I can hardly stand to think about it all. Itll take a lot of counselling for a lot of people. I don't think I'll ever get the image of melted flesh out of my mind. 


The authorities were called, and Mr. Cooke was taken away in cuffs. They still haven't figured out what exactly broke inside him that day. One too many rowdy students, or careless actions, maybe it was the entire job itself, or maybe he was just crazy. The boys were taken to the hospital to get treated, but they all survived the horrific incident. 


School was closed for nearly a week, the Chemistry lab has been closed off. A new teacher was hired, and there are so many counselors available to talk to the students about the incident. It's only been a few weeks since then, but it feels more fresh than that. I don't even know what I'm supposed to take away from this sort of situation. There is just one thing that constantly runs through my mind. 


I never want to make a Chemistry teacher mad.

	<TITLE> Listen to What Your Kids Say </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-19 02:33:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My son is a good kid. He's smart for his age, and he tries his hardest to be kind to other kids. Sometimes he makes a mistake, but like every other kid he has a reasoning for why he does it. He is always able to justify everything he does with the ever infallible kid logic. 


*Well that's what Mommy does when she's upset.* 


*It's okay that I called him an asshole Daddy, you say it about your work friends.* 


*I had to break the screen to let the people inside out, they were trapped.* 


*Well Rebbeca in my class brought a kitten to school in her backpack, so I'm allowed to bring our cat.* 


I mean, it makes sense to an extent, but their oversimplified view of the world can be problematic. Things aren't okay to do just because you saw someone else do them. But we're adults, we know this. 


That brings me to what happened a few days ago. I was parked outside the school, waiting for the teachers to escort the first graders outside. I was going to pick up my son and his friend Jeremy to have a nice afternoon of snacks and Lego at our house until Jeremy's parents came to pick him up. 


The kids came out of the building and my little Andrew ran to the car excitedly. Remy was following hesitantly behind, looking incredibly upset. 


Andy, why is your friend so upset? I asked as he came up to my window. 


He just membered that his Mommy made cookies yesterday and now he won't get any! He replied dramatically. 


Well, if he's going to be so upset maybe I should call his parents to come get him? 


No Daddy! I know what to do, He smiled and hustled towards his friend. 


Hey Remy! We have ice cream and cookies and a new Xbox! You can come play with us, it'd be more fun than going home right now. We'll even drive you home after! He started pulling his friend towards the car, but I got out of the vehicle. 


Hold on boys, I need to talk to Andy for a second, I pulled my son aside, Hey, you can't lie to your friend just to get him to come over. He's going to he upset that we don't have those things, okay?


But it's what Uncle Tim does when we find friends to play with me at his house, He replied while giving me a skeptical look. 


What friends? 


Me and Uncle Tim go to the park and bring home friends to play. He brings them home after he brings me home. So it's okay.


That was the day that I found out my brother-in-law had kidnapped and murdered over thirty children, using my son as bait. Andrew thought his park friends always went home, but who knows what happened before they were killed. 


Sometimes you really need to pay attention to the reasons your kid says or does certain things.

	<TITLE> My Sister Didn't Exist Until I Found Her Journal </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **This post has been updated, if you already saw the beginning of my experiences, please start reading at the "Update"**


I always considered my life to be painfully average, maybe slightly below average even. I was an only child, well adjusted, not the greatest parent-child relationship, but everyone has their demons. I did well in school, not super popular but not entirely resolute, the whole nine yards of regularity. At least, I thought that until I was 19. Ever since that day just a few months ago I've been searching for answers. I've received a lot of them, but only the type that make you question things even more. 


That day would be the one when my family home burned down, and secrets arose like the plume of smoke I pictured had consumed my childhood. I was off at school, living in an apartment with some roommates at the time, a few hours from the town that I was raised in. I was headed to class when I received the call. There was a fire, two bodies were found inside the house. I knew as soon as I heard the word bodies that my parents were dead. For some reason I couldn't place at the time, it felt like a heavy weight had been lifted from my shoulders. 


It took a few weeks for the investigation to end, so I waited to head home until they told me I could do so. There was nowhere for me to stay in town, no point in heading home until I was able to enter the house. I was told that it was an accidental fire, caused by a cigarette. Internally I cursed myself for picking up my father's bad habit. It was something that my mother had always scolded my father for when I was young, and she had always given me distasteful looks when she saw me lighting one up as a teenager. The one thing I had in common with him, and it happened to be what tore my life apart. I'm thinking too deeply about it though. 


I learned that the fire was pretty much contained to their bedroom, it seemed that he had fallen asleep smoking, another topic of my mother's disapproval. It wasn't the first time, but it was definitely the last. They died in their sleep of smoke inhalation, gone before the flames even began. I was told to expect water damage throughout the upstairs and ground floor, but the structure was sound. 


On the drive towards the ruins of my childhood something nagged at me from the back of my mind. I chalked it up to my petrifying fear of fire, a phobia which inconvenienced my life at times, but I never knew the source of. I can light up a smoke, which I did many times throughout the drive, but open flames put me in a panic. *No campfires for me*, the thought made me wonder if my fear was the reason we had never gone camping as a family. I'd heard that my father was quite the outdoorsman before he became a parent. Maybe he was just bad at being a parent overall. I apologize, you'll notice that I'm prone to getting off track. 


Now I say burned down, but when I arrived it wasn't that dramatic. A large portion of the upper floor was blackened, and smoke damage was a major issue up there. The most serious damage was to the master bedroom obviously, I didn't dare enter that room. Not only was I warned that the floor might be more damaged now that the water had time to degrade it further, but I honestly couldn't bring myself to look at the room my parents died in, or a room that *anyone* died in for that matter.


I was nearly in tears seeing the disaster the fire had caused, it sent a deep chill through my body. Water damage had ruined many of the possessions that I had grown up seeing. I wasn't sure where to start, but I needed to work on packing the house up, or at least the parts of the house I could safely get to. Upstairs wasn't really a concern right now, most of the important belongings on that floor were located in the destroyed bedroom. My bedroom had been packed up when I moved away, it was a plain guest room now. Mom never saw any point in letting the room go to waste. 


There wasn't a lot that I could take, furniture was damaged or too big to leave with, most of the undamaged items on the first floor were useless. I collected photos and small trinkets, I had no idea what was worth taking, I just knew that I didn't want to be here long. I didn't even know if I wanted the mementos I had gathered, but maybe they'd help me recall my youngest days back when everything was normal and *happy*.


I was entirely overwhelmed by the situation and the memories that it brought forth, so I decided to go down to the basement. It was the only place left entirely intact after the fire. I thought that this would be the place where the items if my childhood might be stored, since the only traces in the rest of the house were the photos on display. My mother was ever the organizer, she enjoyed having a house worthy to be shown. 


The basement was a vast room of nothing, just old furniture that hadn't seen the light of day in years. Not nice antique furniture either, more like the cheap stuff that already cluttered the small apartment I live in. Reaching the bottom stair to survey the rest of the room sent a deep chill of foreboding through my body, but I assumed it was just the actual chill of the air combined with the darkness consuming the far corners of the room. I shrugged it off. Behind the worthless bookshelves and couches was a safe set into the far wall, one of the large stand-up ones. I don't know why I knew it was there, no one ever had cause to go near this half of the room. The water heater and such was against the wall nearest to the stairs. Nothing had moved in or out of this room for the entire duration of my life. 


There was something about the safe that tugged at the back of my mind. I was compelled to open it, though I doubted that my parents had put anything in it. It had to have been there when they bought the house, and was entirely overlooked. They likely never knew it was there. My mother refused to enter the basement at all, and my father was never interested in looking through old furniture. 


As I stood in front of the safe the combination for it seemed to appear in my mind suddenly, as though it had been waiting for this moment to arise from the depths. I wasn't sure why I knew the combination, but the random series of numbers that had popped up from an extremely fuzzy memory worked when I entered them. The safe unlocked. 


I opened it to find only one object inside, it was a small notebook. The cover read one word, *memini.* My first thought was that it was an odd title for a journal, and my next was: *I wonder how you pronounce that?* So, like a girl from every lame horror movie, I read the word out loud. The house didn't shake or collapse, the lights didn't flicker, the ground didn't open up to swallow me, no dark creatures crawled from the shadows to hurt me. But I remembered. 


My vision went dim and my eyes shut. It didn't come all at once, but it started with the most relevant memory to my current situation, which played out like a movie behind my eyelids. 


I was probably around seven years old, playing in the basement with another girl who was about 11. The space looked the same as it did now, save for the eerie feeling. We were having fun, running in and out of the safe which was held open by a chair back then. No one used it, no one cared to close it, no one really ever went in the basement at all. Except for us. We liked to explore, and we knew that no one else knew about the safe or they would have warned us away from it. Who would let children play near a safe big enough to hide in when no one knew the combination for it? 


We kept it a secret, it was our little fort, and as long as the door stayed propped open as it always did we were fine. But it didn't. One day the girl-- *Eve*, the sudden recollection of her name popped into my head-- closed the door on herself. She moved the chair that had always been there, and shut herself in. My tiny little mind panicked instantly when I heard the lock click. *Ohmygod momma is going to kill us. I have to get help. She's going to die in there!* 


Hey! Eve's muffled voice came from behind the thick safe door, Open the door, it's dark in here!


I can't, I spoke in a loud whisper, worried of alerting the adults before we had planned a good reason for doing something so careless, I don't know the code. 


Sure you do, or you will. I know it. She said confidently. How you could possibly feel confident while locked in a dark enclosed space was beyond what my young mind could believe, and I quickly became frustrated with her. 


No you don't! No one does, stop messin with me, I'm getting momma. I turned to leave, but her next words stopped me in my tracks. 


Cmon, I'm your big sister, would I lie to you? I'll tell you the code, and you let me out, and if it doesn't work then you can go get her, okay? Her pleading tone still managed to sound self-assured. Maybe that's what made me listen. She told me a number sequence, and I spun the lock accordingly. To my surprise it worked. 


I stared at her as she smugly walked out of the safe, and shut it behind her. How did you know? I asked her in awe. Our parents-- that thought jolted me as the memory played through-- didn't even know the safe was there, so how could Eve know the combination? 


Member when I told you I could see the future? I wasn't lying. I already saw this happen, and sometimes I see old things too! I saw an old lady open it up in a dream, it's really cool! She seemed excited to prove to me that the claims she had made several times before were true. 


I don't believe you! That's not even real, I was annoyed that she was faking some kind of magic power just to mess with me. I'm telling momma that you're lying! I was about to storm off, but she suddenly stood perfectly rigid. Her eyes clouded over until a milky white made it hard to identify where her pupils were hidden. 


She spoke in a soft voice, All will be lost, and fire shall return it to you. Then she burst into tears. 


Seeing my older sister cry sent me into another kind of panic, and I ran to console her. When her sobbing stopped, she looked to me with more seriousness than any 11 year old child should possess, It won't really be an accident. When I'm gone, you won't know it. But when you do know it, I'll be waiting for you, okay Lily? 


I nodded, but her words terrified me. I didn't understand what had just happened, and she convinced me not to tell our parents. At the time I had no idea what she meant by those strange words, but the random memory that had taken hold of my body released me as my younger self nodded in agreement to the secret. 


Suffice to say I was absolutely floored by what had just played out in my head. The basement felt colder than it had just moments before I read the word on the cover, and the darkness seemed to thicken. I decided to leave and gather my thoughts elsewhere. Suddenly being here felt wrong. I had been hoping to find happy memories, but I was quickly coming to the realization that I might have found ones worse than the past I already knew. 


I kept hold of the journal, adding it to the other mementos I had collected. There was nothing else I wanted, and I wasn't sure that I'd want to even come back here once all the damage was repaired. It hadn't felt safe here for a long time, and my newly resurfacing memories made the house feel haunted. 


As I drove back to my apartment the revelation hit me hard. I had a *sister*. It brought up so many questions. Why couldn't I remember her before? Why did that word trigger that memory? Was it real, or were there chemicals still floating in the air from the items burned in the fire that caused me to hallucinate? Did she really see the things she said? Why didn't my parents tell me I had a sister? Most important of all, if this is real then, where is she now? It all *seemed* so real, and the chill I got from thinking about her fire prediction made me curious and afraid. 


Between getting lost in my thoughts I noticed something odd. A dark car had pulled out of the neighborhood with me, and after over an hour it was still there. Whoever was driving was keeping a distance, but I could just *tell* that I was being followed. I tried to ignore it, but I kept my eye out for the car the entire way home. I kept thinking over my discovery though, and vaguely wondered if the person following me was related or if I was just paranoid due to what I had learned. 


If I had a sister, and she predicted that in the future there would be a fire that would cause me to remember, then doesn't that mean she was right? Doesn't that mean that the memory was *true?* Maybe her disappearing is the reason my parents hated me so much, maybe it's the reason I almost didn't live long enough to move away from home. 


All I knew at that point was that I would need to see what else was in that journal, I needed answers for what I saw. If I really had a sister, then why don't I have any memories of her ever really existing? 

**Update:**

As I pulled into a parking lot of a random building several blocks from my place I saw the car that had been tailing me stop. Whoever it was had parked about two blocks away, but no one got out of the car. It freaked me out, it would be a stretch to think that someone coincidentally left my old neighborhood and drove all the way here at the *same* time as me. I don't know why, but a violent shiver shot down my spine. I felt watched. I didn't trust it at all, I made a quick phone call to one of my roommates to let them know I'd be home in a bit. 


Instead of parking completely I drove out the other exit of the lot. I had only stopped for a brief moment to park and hoped whoever was driving would think it was just for the phone call. I drove to a friends old apartment several streets over, parked in their lot and entered the building through the front door, carrying the box of mementos. As I watched the front door shut behind me I saw the car pull up to a stop across the street. *Good.* 


I might have been half insane over what I had learned earlier, but I wasn't being too paranoid about this. I had thought before that it was possible I was seeing several cars of the same color and worrying myself for nothing, but being followed here solidified the fact that someone really was tailing me. I walked deeper into the building, down some stairs, and out the back door into an alley. 


I followed the alley down several blocks until I hit a busy street, with the car nowhere in sight I felt safer. It took me nearly an hour to get to my own apartment after making these stops, but it was worth it to throw off my stalker. 


When I got back to my apartment my roommates seemed off. Not only did they comment on how pale I looked, but apparently a man had come looking for me. As if this day hadn't been odd enough, I didn't actually know any guys who I had given my address to. My level of paranoia increased greatly, even though there could have been a rational explanation. 


I asked the girls about him, and the three of them each gave a slightly different description. They didn't disagree with each other though, even though there were some obvious contradictions. 


Hey Lee, you okay? Not to add more to your plate, but some old guy I was here asking for you a few hours ago, Maya told me as she wrapped me in a hug, We told him you weren't here, but he left a card. 


She handed me the card, but before I had the chance to look at it Allison came running from her room, Did you tell her about that cute guy that came looking for her? Like damn Lily, why'd you keep tall, dark, and handsome a secret? I tell you about the guys *Im* dating. She smiled at me as though waiting for some lurid details about this guy, but I was confused. 


Wait, so two people were here for me? I asked. 


What? No, just the one, grey hair and blue eyes. Maybe someone from the insurance company, Maya shrugged and headed for the kitchen.


Yup, that was him, Allie agreed, Dark hair, green eyes, just *gorgeous.* She sighed and threw herself dramatically onto the couch. I looked at them both, neither of them seemed to realize that they were describing two vastly different people. 


Are you fucking with me? You're not even saying the same things. They replied to me by staring at me like I had grown a second head. 


Maybe you should go lay down, you've had a long day, Maya came back over to me, put her hand on my shoulder, and gave me a concerned look.


I felt like everything today was made to drive me crazy, so I just sighed and took my box of junk to the bedroom I shared with our other roommate. She wasn't home yet, so I decided to call her. I told her where my car was, and I asked if she'd drive it home for me. It was on her way so she agreed, she didn't want to take the bus home with a load of groceries. Hopefully it had been long enough for the tail to leave, or at least be thrown off by someone else driving my car. 


I sat on my bed and finally took a look at the card, *Mister Midnight. We'll call you.* What the fuck was this guy, a magician? There was no number on the card just the name and the small message below it, both in embossed glittery silver script. I was confused as to why this guy even bothered to leave a card, and why he came looking for me at all. Today of all days. 


The day just seemed to be confusion on top of confusion. I decided to forget about the guy for now and look inside the journal from the safe. I was about to open it when I heard the front door open and quickly slam shut. 


Shit guys, it's freezing out there. Oh hey, is Lee here still? Saw that blonde guy walking around her car when I picked it up, I heard Raven asking as she made her way towards our room loudly and swung the door open, Oh hey babe, did the girls tell you about your weird ass visitor? 


I guess, kinda? You're all confusing me honestly. How was he weird anyways? I was a bit fed up with everyone acting so odd. 


I dunno, he just had this creepy vibe about him, and he was lurking around your car which is sketchy as hell. I almost wanted to yell at him to get out of here, but he freaked me out for some reason. He took off when I walked up to it though. Everyone else seems to like him, no clue why, She shrugged and started rifling through the bags she had come in with. 


I figured it would be easier to just ignore the fact someone had come looking for me and focus on something else for a while. Though I was definitely freaked out that whoever had visited the apartment had somehow found my car quite a distance away. It didnt make any sense. Maybe it could have been insurance people who came to visit and followed me for hours, but I highly doubted it. Things werent adding up and it worried me, but it wasnt something I could deal with immediately. Instead of dwelling on the strangers who were following and looking for me, I opened up the journal to the first page. 


*If you're reading this, then Mom and Dad are dead. Or at least the things that were pretending to be them. You've been stained by darkness, and now it follows close behind, I'm so sorry Lily. Everything you know is veiled. Think closely about your life without me before you go on.* 


Think closely? This all seemed extremely cryptic, and I felt like someone was intentionally fucking with me. My life without a sister was definitely different than I would soon remember. 


I was happy as a kid, normal and cheerful with loving parents. Things changed around the time I was 11, but I've never known why. My parents seemed to withdraw from the society around them, no more bake sale participation, no more church, no more family outings. My mother had been the ideal Christian PTA parent, but all of those traits seemed to leave her as I got older. My father had been a car enthusiast, but he lost the joy for it. 


Instead they stayed inside most days, away in their room, going out to bars and parties on the evenings and weekends. The older I got, the more bitter they seemed. They no longer had time for me and my insignificant school problems, but I assumed it was a side effect of your only child turning into a teenager. Things got a little rough, my mother seemed to despise me, my father just seemed to ignore that I was even there. 


They fed me, clothed me, gave me a home, but interacted with me minimally. When I was 17 there was one incident which stood out. It was nearing the time of my high school graduation, and my girlfriend at the time had snuck into my room late at night, not a completely random occurrence but not very common either. 


We had been dating for several months, but I had never brought the topic up with my parents. I wasn't sure how they would react to the fact that I was dating a girl, especially because she was transitioning. My mother had been arrogantly Christian when I was younger, and though we had stopped attending church I wasn't sure if her righteous tendencies had halted as well. 

The encounter started out as odd as it had ended. I woke up in the middle of the night to a cold breeze, my window was open. I moved to get out of bed and suddenly a boy was in front of me. It took me a moment for my panic to subside and realize that I was actually looking at my girlfriend. She would have been pissed if she knew I had mistaken her for a boy, but I could swear that she looked different than usual. 


Tara? Did you sneak in my window? Instead of answering, she leaned in to kiss me and my fear seemed to disappear. When I opened my eyes I noticed that the dark room made it seem like the whites of her eyes were gone, the entirety of her eyes appeared to be a black void. I blinked a few times and they returned to normal. I felt like I was forgetting something important. 


Come with me, She led me by the hand to my window, Jump, it's not that far. I felt dazed, but my human instinct told me this was wrong. I was on the second floor, the ground below my window was all patio stones. Our house was tall, the ground floor had high ceilings, it would equate to nearly a three story drop from the edge of my window to the ground. *This is wrong.* 


I pulled my hand from her grip and backed away from the window. There was no jumping, you'd have to climb the flimsy lattice that decorated the house. She grabbed my wrist tightly and dragged me back towards the window. 


Come on, I need to take you. Her appearance seemed to shift as I returned to a state of panic. She looked like her, but *not*. Her features seemed to shift to more masculine, taller, broader, shorter hair, sharper jaw, eyes once again bottomless black pits. 


Who are you, what are you *doing!?* I struggled to get away from whoever or whatever was holding me. Suddenly my bedroom door swung wide, and there stood my parents. I gave one last effort to wrench my arm away, and I was free. As that *thing* turned to look at them it returned to the appearance of my girlfriend, but now with an absolutely terrified look on her face. 


Escort that shameful thing out of my house. Tara visibly flinched when my mother spoke those words. I had no idea what was going on anymore, so I took her hand softly and led her downstairs. I stood by the door as she left, wondering if she would change again or if I had dreamed that part. My thoughts were interrupted by the door being slammed closed on the hand I'd left resting on the frame. 


I backed away as soon as the door swung back open, and stared at my mother in horror. *What the fuck?* My wrist was already bruising from Tara holding me, and now it felt like I might have a broken finger or two. My mother smiled at me as she came towards me, she grabbed my hair and proceeded to drag me back upstairs. 


Why would you let something like that into the house? Honestly, do you *want* to go to hell? She spoke calmly as she pulled me along, not a hint of exertion. I didn't understand what was happening. We entered my bedroom, and she brought me back to the still open window, pressing my face against the sill, I can send you if that's your wish, you little brat.


Her hand gripped the window as though she was going to bring it down on my neck, and I was absolutely terrified. I tried to get away, but my struggles did nothing. She brought the window down, but it was stopped by another hand. 


It isn't our place to do this. You need to let her go, they need everything to play out, My father spoke calmly, as though he hadn't just watched his wife attempt to crush the throat of his only child. She released me, and walked out of the room without a word, Go to sleep, forget this. He followed behind her and shut my door. 


I tried to convince myself it had all been a dream, but my hand and wrist were bruised the next day. Later that day I found out Tara had been hit by a car on her way home, she didn't even survive until she got to the hospital. It was the worst two days of my life, not only might she be alive if she hadn't come to see me, but the last time we had been together I went crazy thinking she wasn't herself. I felt like shit. 


Two months later I graduated, a few weeks after that I had found an apartment with Maya near the college we'd be attending. I turned 18 in July and moved out on my birthday, even though my parents had gone back to ignoring my existence. Best gift I could get. It didn't feel right to be there, as though something bad was about to happen at every moment. 


Recalling my past left me feeling vulnerable, less than two years is not enough time to completely put that incident aside. I felt some comfort that Raven was in the room, her and Maya knew most of what had happened back home. I gathered myself and went back to reading. The next words got me mad, I was sure I was being fucked with. 


*Everything really happened. It was all real. They veiled themselves, but did not know to veil the other demon.* 


Okay, what the fuck guys? I don't know why or how you got this book into my house, but it's not funny at all. I'm sick of all this. Someone tell me why, *NOW,* I started yelling as I stormed around the apartment, waving the journal around. 


Raven tried to hold on to me, and the others just stared as though I was completely insane. I cried and begged for answers, but none of them knew what I was talking about. I was a confused emotional wreck. The girls provided no answers, they were honestly innocent. Maya suggested that maybe I should look more into the journal. I couldnt quite grasp the demon bit of what I had already read, but Id look more into the journal later for elaboration.


I don't have the time to tell you more right now, but I'll keep updating every few days. Weird things keep happening around here, and I still have to attempt to get to my classes. All I can tell you right now is that this is what started the process of my entire life going to shit. Or rather, worse shit than I already experienced in the past.

	<TEXT> I was unaware that eating human flesh rather than healthy diet food was considered "normal human behavior", let me know how that works out in your life :) 

I would describe anyone as repulsive and lazy if they'd rather eat meat from their own body than make a healthy food choice. They could be 105lbs and it would be disgusting, lazy, and morally wrong. 

But I said mean things about a person who happened to be large, so I must hate fat people? Get a grip.

	<TEXT> He was entirely content living life before he got too large to do so. He over indulged, but he went out, he had friends and fun, and as soon as he was big enough for those regular interactions to be inconvenient, he stopped caring about them. 

He wasn't ever depressed, he was just lazy and only cared about being comfortable. It's not that he hated being alive, he just hated any version of living that involved putting effort in to it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I Tried To Force My Husband Into Losing Weight </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-16 17:41:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive always been concerned about my husband's health. He was overweight since the day we met, but he never really tried to fix it. It wasnt really a concern in the beginning. Sure, being bigger isnt a bad thing, but thats only true until it negatively impacts your health and your ability to function. It wasnt that he needed to fix his weight problem the entire time, but he really should have taken some steps to avoid getting bigger. He ignored the issue for so long that I by the time I stepped in he must have been over 400 pounds.


He had trouble walking, he never wanted to get out of bed, in fact he hardly wanted to do anything at all. I loved the poor guy, but he was a fucking mess. It was ridiculous. He had no motivation to even attempt diet or exercise. He complained about walking from bed to the bathroom, and absolutely despised going outside for any reason. He was slowly killing himself.


I couldnt take it, it was painful for me to watch him suffer and literally not give a shit about it. I know its has to be hard to live like that, but he didnt *care.* Hed been told by myself and other doctors that he had to prove that he could lose weight through diet and exercise before he could get surgery, and he refused. He would rather be a disgusting recluse at home than do even something simple to fix himself. He hadnt let himself die yet, but he was hardly living at all. 


One day I had finally had enough. The night before, he had almost rolled over on me in his sleep. It was the last straw for me. He'd nearly killed me. I couldn't take it anymore, and I needed to take things into my own hands. If he wasn't going to help himself, then I was going to have to do something drastic. There's no way he would be able to continue living this way, at least not for very long. That was the day I told him that I was going to help him solve his problems. He was less than excited, he didnt *want* to be fixed because that would mean living life.


He didnt care that he could hardly walk, he didnt care that he ate at least six meals a day, and he absolutely did not care that he was no longer the person I had fallen in love with. He had become this lazy pig with no desire to live life. The only thing he wanted in the world was to stay in bed, eat food, and watch TV. I wasnt about to let him give up that easy. After the procedure he would *want* to stay in shape. Once it was done there was no way hed ever want to go back to his repulsive lifestyle. Maybe wed rekindle our spark.


It took me a few weeks, but I finally was able to collect everything I needed from the hospital that I worked in. I set everything up so that he could stay in our bed while I worked. I put him under, and once I was sure that he was entirely unconscious I began my work. It was a long process, and I wouldn't be able to do everything in one day. Though plastic surgery is my field of expertise, he was a special case. Our home didn't have quite the same amenities as a hospital, some of those which he would need to heal as per usual. The healing process would need to be done slightly different than it would if he had actually gone in to get the work done.


After the first part of the surgery was done I waited for him to wake up. I was so excited for him to see what I had done, but it wasn't time yet. I knew I knew he would be hungry when he woke up, so I decided to make him breakfast while he was still under. Knowing him, any dietary restrictions I gave him would be aggressively ignored. I had thought that he would be ravenous as soon as he woke up, and I was correct. The first thing he asked for when he awoke was food. I smiled at him and handed him the plate. He had just lifted a piece of the bacon from the plate when I stopped him.


Are you sure you want to eat that honey, it isnt pork, I said with the sweetest smile I could muster on my face.


This would be the true test to see if he was ready to finally lose all this weight. This would also be the test that proved whether or not he was actually as disgusting as I had come to know.


Well what is it, hun? The piece of bacon was dangling from his lips as he asked. 


It's human bacon. Do you still want to eat it? This was a moment of truth.


I watched, absolutely repulsed as he took my statement into account and chewed the bacon in his mouth. He savored it for a moment, as though he was trying to discover every aspect of the flavor. Then he stopped.


No, no. I'm not doing this. Go get me some real food, He said it suddenly, as though he'd only just realized that it would be wrong to eat human flesh.


I'm not giving you anything else. You can either diet and eat the food that goes with it, or deal with this, I followed up by leaving the room to get him a plate of something healthy.


By the time I came back the plate was empty. I was appalled. I knew he was a pig, but I didn't know he would go to such lengths.


I brought you something so you can start your diet. You won't keep the weight off unless you eat healthy. I told him, trying to hide the nausea that coursed through my body. How could he eat that bacon after what I had told him? Could anyone really be so *sick?*


He chuckled for a moment, This is just some kind of trick to convince me to lose weight. I'm fine. I'm not doing your diet nonsense. I like the way that I live now. There's nothing wrong with me.


I was shocked at his response, and I nearly dropped the plate I was holding.


You've got to be kidding me, you'd rather eat your own flesh than attempt to lose even a little bit of the weight? Don't you want to live the life that we used to have? Dont you miss being able to walk more than ten steps without being out of breath? I was losing it, he was so adamantly against doing anything to help himself.


I told you already. I'm fine. There's no point in lying to me to try and convince me that something is wrong. I *do* have taste buds you know? Obviously this bacon is veal. Which is nice because usually you don't go for something so expensive. You ought to feed me better, I need a lot of sustenance you know.


I turned to walk out of the room. I was entirely disgusted by his attitude towards everything, and in his disbelief. His voice stopped me as I reached the door.


Oh by the way hun, I'm still numb from the chest down.


That would be the anesthetic, I snipped at him and walked out of the room.


Over the next week all of his meals consisted of meat from his own flesh. He insisted that it was veal, and wouldn't believe a thing I said otherwise. At this point I was too repulsed by his response to continue with it, and I decided to do the one thing that would prove to him that I hadnt lied about feeding him human meat. I went into the room that morning and removed the cloth that kept his paralyzed body hidden from view. Then I removed the bandages that were covering the wounds.


What did you do? He asked in surprise as he stared at the deep, scabbed over cuts that covered his once large stomach.


We're running out of fat to get the bacon from, I told you that it wasn't veal.


You know what, He said, I don't care anymore. Never did. It's the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. If it makes you happy we can keep doing this. He smiled at me as though it was an enticing offer.


That day I packed a suitcase, I walked out of the house, and I never went home. It's been months now, and I've moved far away. I think I've created a monster.

^^March ^^15 ^^at ^^6:06pm


I've been seeing this post everywhere today, It's so weird?! I wonder if the person it was meant for has seen it? 


Saw this in the comments before I decided to share: 


This post from the Missed Connections section of Craigslist is going viral, the same post was posted in numerous locations on the site. Many visitors to the site have shared the post, citing it as creepy and obsessive, what do you think? 


Yea, I'm thinking it's a bit crazy.

### Almost Your Time 


I have seen you so many times. So many close encounters when we have almost had the chance to meet. Every time one of these close chances happen, it makes me want you more. It seems that you are just always slightly out of my grasp. I know that most would say you are lucky to avoid me, but I think that you might enjoy getting to know me. 


You are so much like many others, yet at the same time you are so unique. I know that you are not the type of person who would regularly be looking at a posting like this, but you are the type to notice when something goes viral. I know this is the type of message that will get passed around, and eventually you will see it. 


Many of our previous close encounters you have had no idea that I was there. That is usually how it is for most people I get close with. I have had more than my fair share of those who are aware of me, those who accept me, and come willingly. Some of those aware decide to try and avoid me, but nearly every person I have set my eyes upon has eventually succumbed to my dark charm. 


There are some who find me appealing, desirable. Those who seek me out when I don't want them to, when I am not prepared for them to fall into my arms. You would think that it makes things easier, but it can be very overwhelming. I know you used to be one of those people, you craved me at one point in time. Now you have pushed me out of your mind entirely, I think you may have forgotten that I even exist. Are you mad at me? For stealing someone you loved, or perhaps for not answering your calls when you used to cry for me to come and take you away from the pain you lived with? 


You know I could not do that. You were not ready for me, as much as you thought you were. It is rare for someone to decide to take being with me into their own hands, even more so for a person to succeed in getting to me by themselves. I am not strictly against such things, but I am better at knowing when the time is right. I am sorry if you have put me out of your mind, if you had thought it would be decades before we came close to one another, this is not the case. 


You have evaded me so many times, those times were not right for us. Soon. Three days in fact, at 11:04pm. I will be there, we will face each other again, and this time there is no avoiding me. We can finally be together, I hope you enjoy the time you have. 


- do NOT contact me with unsolicited services or offers

	<TEXT> I'll definitely take this into consideration, I'm not sure if I'll do it before passing it off though. I don't want to be quarantined or something, I'd rather wait to check for residual symptoms and then inform the next person that they should see a doctor. 

It sounds selfish, but I don't want to be the one stuck in a hospital for who knows how long. Plus the pills are only going to be given to me with two weeks worth of doses at a time. If I go to a hospital and they can't recreate the pill within two weeks, I'm dead. There's no way an anonymous supplier that probably created the disease inside me is going to deliver to a hospital.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd feel bad about passing it off to the elderly. The amount of unwilling people who would touch them in a hospice would give a noticeable death toll. Maybe people who are already dying, that would be less awful, but harder to actually do unless they're dying out in the open. 

Can't exactly walk into a hospital room and touch patients willy-nilly. Passing it off to someone alert enough to keep themselves alive would be the best option, or it'll come back to me, or pass on unchecked after a day of the pill is forgotten.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> For The First Time In My Life I Wish I Had Said No </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-15 03:59:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Most of us started hearing this around middle school; the campaigns, slogans, presentations, and whatnot. *Just Say No To Drugs!* They wanted to get the message across while we were still young and compliant, before we got the urge to experiment. I never found it very effective. If you want to try something, then you don't really concern yourself with lectures you received when you were 12.


For my entire life I didn't really care about those lectures. When I first got them I thought they were ridiculous, *who is doing drugs at 12?* When I was 13 I started trying things out, mostly because that was the age when my depression first reared its ugly head. After that, it didn't matter. *This makes me feel better. I can ignore how sad I am.* The rest is history. 


That brings me to what happened last weekend. My best friend, Sadie, and I decided to go out to a club. It was a Friday night and we planned to have some fun. It started off as a regular night, drinking and dancing together. I was standing near the bar waiting on my drink when a guy walked up to me.


Looking? He mouthed. 


I shrugged and he gestured towards an empty table near the back of the club. I grabbed my drink and walked over to meet him back there. I sat next to him and he showed me a small pink pill with an eye engraved on it. 


E? I asked. 


He hesitated, then nodded, 10 per, but I'll cut it to 70$ total if you want the whole bag,


70$ for ten pills? That was a pretty sweet deal as far as I was concerned. Too good to be true honestly. 


Any good? I questioned skeptically. 


Probably the best you'll ever take, 


I wasn't convinced on his pitch, but a high is a high. This wouldn't be something new, and it'd be relatively cheap. As we made the handshake exchange he gripped my hand. 


Take one right now so I know you're not a cop, He said tensely. 


I popped a pill into my mouth, washing it down with my drink. He visibly relaxed and gave me his number after, told me to let him know when I needed more. I was set, I finished off my drink. I was headed back to the bar to see if I could get some water when Sadie stepped in front of me. 


What did you just do? She set her eyes on me like it was an interrogation. 


Nothing? It's fine, I shrugged off her accusatory glare. 


I saw the guy, why can't you just say no? She frowned at me, not a fan of my recreational activities. 


I *can* say no. I just don't want to. Seriously, I'm fine. Don't worry about it,


She rolled her eyes and walked back into the crowd of people. I brushed off our disagreement and got my water. About 5 minutes later I felt the pill kick in. I felt an overwhelming sense of warmth, and then things got odd. The edges of my vision faded to black, my chest felt heavy, and my limbs tingled. My vision blacked out entirely for a moment, and when it returned everything was beautiful. 


My mind was floating, I was *so* happy. Everything was more colorful, the room almost glowed. It felt like my vision was sharper, dark corners were easier to see, and I felt *good.* This was insane, this isn't what was supposed to happen. Maybe the dealer was right, this was the best of *anything* I'd ever had. I'd never experienced anything like it, and it would be worth the eventual crash. 


Based on everything I was feeling this was definitely *not* E. It wasn't even close. It was *better.* I was slightly concerned that I had no idea what he had actually sold me, but I'd text him later to address it. I'm not a picky person, maybe it was something new on the market. I really didn't care that much, I'm known for doing anything to avoid having to think about my life and my past. This was just another distraction from real life. 


About twenty minutes later I went to the bathroom, that's when things got crazy. There was a girl wearing glittery blue eyeliner in there, and I found myself transfixed on the glitter. She gave me an odd look, and I could tell she was annoyed at my staring. I turned away but she had apparently already decided to confront me. 


What are you staring at? She asked harshly. 


Nothing now, I replied with equal venom as I adjusted my own make up in the mirror, I was just looking at your makeup,


I don't know if she misheard me or if maybe she was high, but she grabbed my shoulder and spun me to face her. I was ready to tear into her, but my vision went black for a split second. When it cleared I was horrified. The glittery eyed girl had fallen to her knees, blood was pouring from her eyes. She didn't make a sound as she clawed at her throat, long nails leaving deep gashes. 


This had to be a hallucination. Is this why the pills were so cheap? A split second and suddenly you're having the worst trip of your life? I freaked out, I ran out of the bathroom to get away from the awful sight my mind had created. I searched the club for Sadie, I needed to get home and lie down. When I found her she instantly knew something was wrong. 


Are you okay? What happened? Her voice was full of concern. 


I'll tell you after, please take me home. I pleaded. 


She nodded and led me outside to her car. On the drive back I explained the terrifying hallucination. She glanced at me with a look of disappointment. Her judgement annoyed me, and I ignored her for the rest of the drive. As soon as she pulled up in front of her apartment I hopped out and went inside. She followed me while still trying to get me to respond to her guilt trip. 


I got into her place and threw myself onto the bed, I was getting pretty upset at this point. Sadie walked into my room, still lecturing. 


Ohmygod Sade, can you chill out? I'm not dying, this shit happens sometimes. Stop fucking *parenting* me! I lost it, I was done with her talking down to me. 


She look dejected, I'm just worried about you, you're gonna end up killing yourself, 


Please stop. I'm fine. Haven't died yet, have I? I gave her a pointed look, knowing my response wasn't what she wanted. 


She reached out and gripped my shoulder in a motherly manner, and I violently pulled away. I *hated* when she did parental gestures, it did nothing to ease my annoyance. My vision flicked to black for a moment, and I wish it had stayed that way. 


When it cleared Sadie was in front of me clutching at her throat, digging her nails into her own flesh. Her mouth opened in a silent scream as her eyes filled and spilled over with blood, she stared at me with a look of betrayal. I didn't understand what was happening, the hallucination seemed so *real.* I couldn't contain myself, I kneeled by her and tried to hold her hands away from her body. 


She froze for a moment, letting her hands fall. The look on her face was now full of despair and she whispered something. 


It came out of you, She said softly. 


What? I gripped her hands in mine, she visibly paled. 


He did something to you, 


Those are the last words I heard, the blood leaking from her eyes began to slow, and I could feel her getting cold. I was thoroughly freaked out. I looked at my hands which were covered in her blood, and abruptly got up and left. *I'm having a really bad trip, I need to go to my own house and sleep it off.* It was a quick few blocks to my house, and I crashed as soon as I hit the bed. 


I didn't wake up until late the next afternoon, it was almost dusk. I was so confused, and it felt like the high hadn't faded. I looked at my hands to find that they were smeared with dried blood. *Hallucinations don't usually work like this.* Maybe there's some other explanation for the blood? What I saw couldn't have been real. I was scared, so I did the first rational thing that came to mind. 

What the fuck did you sell me? I asked as soon as the dealer answered the call. 


It uh.. A long story. Fun right? He laughed nervously. 


No, not fun. They're giving me some kind of crazy hallucinations. What are they? 


That means they're working. I'm so sorry man, His tone perked up, I'll make sure the supplier knows that I passed it on. Someone will meet you when you run out, okay? 


Not okay?! Dude, what the fuck? What is happening? My heart was racing, I didn't understand what he was telling me. 


Okay, here's the deal. Don't let anyone touch you, alright? Take one a day. Don't forget that. Also, there are no hallucinations. It's not a drug, it's an *antidote.* Deal with it, or pass it off. He hung up the phone. 


*Shit.* I only sort of understood it all, and this guy sounded crazy as hell. Maybe that's what these pills *really* do to you. I felt entirely drained and decided to go back to sleep, my body hated what I had put inside of it. 


I woke up before dawn in extreme pain. It felt like something was growing inside of my throat, stretching inside until I felt like my neck would explode. The pain was so intense that I burst into tears, and ran into the bathroom. My vision blurred into a pink haze. The sight that faced me from the mirror renewed my fears, I could see there was blood running from my eyes. I opened my mouth to see if the source of pain was visible, and it was. The inside of my mouth and throat seemed to be grey and black, like the flesh was dying. I gagged as I watched a piece of my cheek flake onto my tongue. 


I panicked, for a moment I had no idea what to do. I recalled the phone call, he was right about one thing so far. It's been almost two days, and there's no way this was a hallucination. Maybe he wasn't crazy at all. *Take one a day.* It was the only solution I could think if. I found the pills still tucked into the pocket of my jeans. 


Ten minutes after taking one the pain subsided. The blood stopped coming, and I felt *really* good. I checked my throat in the mirror, whatever I had seen before was no longer visible. My cheek was bleeding slightly, but the rot had apparently been cured. 


I've had some time to think about this whole thing. It's been four days since I took the first pill. If I go more than twenty-four hours without taking one, then I experience those awful side effects. I talked to the dealer again this morning, he told me the basics and what my options are in better detail. 


There's something inside me. It's transferred by touch. If you don't take a pill after you've been touched, you start experiencing the effects within a minute. If you don't take a pill once a day, you start experiencing the effects. Those effects are some sort of necrosis that eats you from the inside. There are three options once you've caught it. You can let it kill you and it will move on to someone else, you can touch someone else and give them the pills, or you can spend the rest of your life hoping the supplier doesn't run out so that you can live with it. 


The way it transfers is odd, it *leaves* you to infect someone else. If they take a pill as soon as they're infected, it stays with them. If they die without taking a pill, it comes back to you. All this information did nothing but terrify me even more. What if the supplier does run out? I don't want to die this way. 


I'm passing it on, I'm going to every club, every rave, every night until I do. There's a lot of people besides me that don't feel the need to *just say no.* I'll have this thing out of me before I need to restock pills. 


My only advice to you, those who enjoy being distracted from real life, those eager to try something new, if someone is selling pink pills engraved with an eye you should avoid them. Don't let them touch you. In fact, if someone walks up to you in a club, bar, party or something and asks if you want to buy something *just say no.*

	<TEXT> I was born blind. Zero sight. I can't see anything, I've never been able to at all. That all changed two days ago, and now I'm chasing glimpses of what any Sighted person would take for granted. 


I was on my regular walk home from work, it was about 6pm. I live in a fairly large city in Ontario, and from my understanding it was getting dark outside. It was a cold night, and I was happy to be done for the week. Nothing feels quite as nice as leaving work on a Friday night. 


A group of drunken girls ended up running into me on my walk. I heard their tipsy footsteps and loud laughter approaching, but didn't think they would be intoxicated enough to walk into a man who was quite obviously blind. Apparently they were, a cacophony of loud giggles and mumbled apologies bumped into me. I was shocked by the pungent odour of cheap liquor and even cheaper perfume. 


It was early for such activities to already be happening, but I suppose some young girls want to take full advantage of the weekend. I could understand it, but what confused me was that they all stopped, surrounding me. Two girls somewhere in front of me got into an argument. 


Ohmygod, you idiot! You just walked into a blind guy! A shrill yell. I didn't correct her, *several* of the group had walked into me. 


Shut up! It was an accident, he doesn't care anyways. Stop, let's go, An annoyed girl shot back. 


Um, I *can* hear you, you know? It's only my eyes that aren't up to par. I laughed, hoping to lighten the tension that surrounded me. I had no idea why the first girl has gotten heated so quickly about a simple drunken accident. 


It was rude. I'm sorry, sir. The first girl responded. 


No, no, I'm-- I was abruptly cut off. 


Stop being such a kiss-ass. He's *fine.* The second girl interrupted. 


Suddenly it happened, a bright flash of color exploded in front of my sightless eyes, at the same time as I heard the hard *slap* of skin connecting with skin. I was shocked, this was something I had never experienced before. It was hot, yet timid. Not hot like a fire, but like the stinging warmth in your cheeks after an unexpected compliment. Sharp, vibrant, obnoxious, the color of teenaged girls, wild slumber parties, and exciting first kisses. It was a group of young girls dancing to a song on the Top 40. It was the color of intense passion, heated arguments over what bar to go to next, and the feeling of someone attractive looking your way. 


I was struck still, the girls surrounding me were speaking as though they had forgotten my presence. 


You bitch! Why did you slap me? The annoyed girl spoke in anger. 


I-- I have no idea. I don't know what came over me, I just got so frustrated. I'm sorry, I'm drunk, maybe I should go home.. The shrill girl now sounded confused and defeated. 


The group ignored me and began walking away while talking, I had no idea what had just happened. I was thoroughly confused, and found myself turned around. I usually had a good sense of direction, but the entire incident had thrown me off. I collected myself, and began walking in what I assumed to be the direction home. 


I heard the familiar noise of a sports broadcast coming from a pub filled with mostly loud men, I was definitely going the right way. I paused when I heard a scuffle near the door to the pub. Something inside me told me to *watch.* I nearly laughed aloud at the voice in my head, *you can't see, remember?* As if my mind was having a conversation with itself the little voice replied, *but what if you can?* 


I paused on the sidewalk, partially because I didn't want to get too close to the potential fight that was beginning, and partially because I was listening to my brain. *What if it happens again? What if I could see something?* 


Let me back in! A man whined from near the door. 


You need to relax, the owner doesn't want you around when you're like this, The security guard replied in a calm, deep tone. You could tell he was the bigger man merely from listening to the conversation. 


Suddenly, another flash. You could hear the smaller man lunge toward the security guard, throwing his weight and fists against him in a pathetic attempt to force his way back inside. There was more than one color this time. First something deep and dark. The color of deep, and undying love. A color of rage. It was the feeling in your heart on your wedding day, passion that is coupled with adoration. It was violent and angry, while still being deep and meaningful. It was fists on bare flesh, fire, heat, and pain. It was aggressive. 


As the man was obviously dragged away, the flash of color changed. It was bright, and shocking. It was the embodiment of shame and embarrassment, but at the same time also represented happiness. It was warm. It was days at the beach with loved ones, it was a morning waking up with no worries and the warm sunlight on your face. It was anxiety, rejection and humiliation. Stuttering in front of a classroom and being laughed at, being turned down for a date, or being brushed aside by someone larger you had tried to fight. 


The feeling that ran through me was pleasure and excitement to the Nth degree. I felt amazing. I *saw* something. I had no idea what to do about it, but I floated home in a state of pure euphoria. I *needed* to see more. Color was a drug, and I was quickly becoming addicted. 


I slept deeper that night than I never had before, it was like crashing after a high. 


When my wife woke me in the morning I wanted to share the news with her. She didn't understand how it was possible, and I'm not sure that she believed me. I know I must have sounded crazy, but I asked her if she could at least try to identify the colors I was describing. Pink, red, and yellow were her best guesses. They sounded right, but I really didn't have a lot of past experience to go on. I was filled with joy, and I could tell that my wife was at least happy that I *believed* I had seen something. 


I wanted to spend my day walking the streets in search for color, but I had to wait until my wife left. I knew she was already skeptical about my newfound sight and I didn't want her to worry about me roaming the city *blindly.* Pun intended. She was washing up some breakfast dishes when she suddenly yelled in pain. At moment I received a new flash. 


Bright, surprising, close to what my wife had told me was yellow. It was a color of surprise, and frustration. It was happy, yet slightly angry. It was a color of rebellion, and sunsets. It was the warm feeling of sitting near a fireplace, and the excitement of going on a trip to somewhere new. It was mild anger and annoyance, and the feeling of fullness after a good meal. 


It changed rapidly. Suddenly burning hot. I could *feel* the color. Dark, angry, violent. It was what my wife had already identified to be red, but it *felt* different than when I had seen it on the street during the burst of angry. Now it felt hungry and vicious. It was the feelings of life seeping out of a body, pain, despair, and hatred. 


The flash shocked me as the others did, but this time I was slightly afraid. My mind ached to see more, and I was horrified. I knew she had hurt herself, but my mind was screaming at me to find more of this color. 


Babe, I swallowed the thick taste of desire in my throat, Are you okay?


Mhmm, don't worry hun, just a small cut. She replied, I could tell from her voice that it was true. 


My reaction to the color scared me, but I couldn't help it. I could almost taste the copper in my mouth, and the sensation made me salivate. I was disgusted with myself and assumed it was just my brain craving the stimulation of sight for the first time in its twenty-four years of existence. The mind is a tricky thing, and I couldn't help that mine was rapidly becoming addicted to color. 


My wife bandaged her hand and set off for work. I nearly went running out of the house once she was gone, needing to satiate the yearning that wracked my body. I walked the streets, heading in the direction that would lead me to the unsavory part of town. It seemed that violence was the only thing that carried sparks of color to my sightless eyes. 


As I walked I heard fights break out behind bars, couples fighting through open windows, and bitter parents disciplining their children. None of the violence surrounding me provided even a glimpse of relief for my cravings. I saw nothing, but I felt despair. Had I been cut off so soon from this feeling of bliss? I wandered the streets, finding myself in a quiet place where my footsteps echoed against bricks. An alley, in what may have been the worst part of the city. 


I strolled casually, but it felt like my mind was tearing itself apart. *Find it, find something. Anything.* The aching need pounded through all of my senses. Suddenly, it came. 


A flash, the feeling of falling. It was harsh and sharp. Distinct. The sound of a sharp blade cutting through the air, the feeling of wind rushing by your body. Cold, unforgiving, bright, and painful. The taste of something metallic, and violent. The color was shocking, reflective. Like a sword coming down. It was regal though, like fine jewelry. It was beautiful yet deadly. It quickly faded into what I was told was red, not the red of anger, but the one I had seen this morning. The red of blood, harm, and pain. The color gave way to another mixture of new ones. I could hear moans of pain coming from somewhere ahead of me. 


Dull, lifeless. Plain. The feeling of the city on an overcast day. It was dreary, and boring. It was the feeling of an impending storm, and the dusty remains of something abandoned. It mixed with and faded into another. Death, and malice. The feeling of pure evil, or *wrongness.* It was the feeling of a night without stars, loneliness, despair, but more than that. It felt like loss and mourning. It was deep, infinite as space. Bottomless, terrifying, all consuming. It was the feeling of entering a basement alone at night. It was elegance, class, and otherworldly beauty. But it was dangerous, it was an end. The alley became still and silent. 


My cravings were beyond satisfied, I didn't pause to think what I may have just witnessed to receive this overload of visual information. I was sky-high, but my rush was interrupted. 


You better get out of here, or this blade is gonna meet *your* guts next. Tell anyone, and I'll find-- An abrupt pause as the man got closer, Wait, are you blind?


I seem to be, I replied casually, the high from the visual stimulation was keeping my fear from seeping forth. 


Right then, walk away, He chuckled, Nothing to *see* here. 


If my eyes could roll-- I've never known if they did or not-- then they did at that moment. I heard him head back in the direction of his victim, and I quickly turned and left the way I had come. I got extremely lucky. Sure, I couldn't really call the police, what would I say? 


*Yes officer, I'm blind but I think I just witnessed a murder. How? Well I think I saw some colors. Yes sir, I did say that I am blind. No sir, I would not be able to identify the victim, suspect, or location of the crime.* 


I would sound ridiculous, no one would believe me. That's likely part of the reason he let me go. I called a cab to take me back home, I was satisfied for the day. I didn't tell my wife about my adventure through the city, I didn't want her to worry. After she got home from work we spent the evening together, I was entirely happy. 


I woke up yesterday morning in severe pain. My cravings were back and fiercer than ever, my body spasmed. I ended up knocking a lamp off the bedside table during my fit, and a shard from it flew directly into my thigh. I yelped in momentary pain, but the cravings had slightly dulled as a very brief flash of blood-red appeared. It was the smallest flash yet, and it did little to ease my pain. It was enough to get me out of bed. 


The phone beeped, and I checked the message. It was from my wife, I had slept in and she had gone ahead to work. My head was pounding, and as I went to leave the room several sharp fragments of the lamp dug into the soles of my feet. No flashes, no color. I was disappointed, I didn't step on them intentionally, but receiving no flash for the pain felt unfair. It made me curious. 


I picked up a relatively large shard from the ground and sliced across my outer forearm. A miniscule flash. I tried again, nothing. It seemed that everything only worked once. I would need to up the ante if I wanted to get my fix and make the searing pain stop. I got dressed and headed out of the house. Same plan as yesterday, I would roam the dangerous streets until an act of violence brought me color and satisfaction. Hours of wandering proved fruitless, and the pain only grew worse. 


I ended up curling into the fetal position in an alley, the pain was unbearable. I nearly passed out when I heard a gruff, raspy voice from above me. 


Yer in my spot, I suggest you move before I make you. I could smell earth and trash, the man smelled awful. It was clear that he was homeless, and I was having my breakdown in his territory. 


I'm sorry sir, I'm not homeless, I stammered out, the withdrawal was causing violent shivers, I'm sick, I can't see. I live in North York. 


I felt him draw close, and he gripped the front of my jacket. 


Get out of here, before I hurt you. His words came with a rush of new color. It was deep and dark. It brought on visions of a lush forest at night, mysterious plants and trees. The smell of grass and moss, the feeling of being surrounded by nature. But it was so dark, it felt like the depths of an algae infested pond. I felt renewed by the sudden sensation. There was an undertone of the dark, infinite color. I could tell I was in danger. 


Before he could speak another word, I pulled a pocket knife from my jacket and stabbed--well obviously --blindly. The moment the blade hit home there was a flash of color. It was similar to the yellow I had seen before, but this one was brighter, electrifying. It was like sudden lightning before a thunderstorm. I sent the blade into the homeless man over and over. I saw the quick flash of blood red, as well as the metallic color I had seen the day before. Then there was the dreary color that faded into the shade of an infinite abyss. 


He was dead. I felt the incredible rush once again, and hoped I hadn't gotten any blood on me as I happily trotted away from the scene. I could say I was at a butcher shop, no one would expect a blind man of murder. I was ecstatic, but as I worked my way back home I came to a realization. What was more violent than committing a random murder? How would I satisfy my craving for sight tomorrow? I pushed the thought aside, I would deal with it later. 


I changed clothes when I got home, unsure if they were bloodied or not. I stuffed them down the garbage chute and continued my day as though I'd never left the house. I kept my activities a secret again, now positive that telling my wife would convince her I've gone insane. 


My night was normal, but I woke up early this morning to the pain. It's coming faster, and I don't know how to stop it. Maybe just one more fix will end it for good. It hurts so much, I only have one option. I have to listen to the little voice in my head that *screams* for me to do it again. Be more aggressive. 


I feel remorse in advance, I have an addiction. I *can't* stop. I need to *see.* I need more, I think my body will shut down from the withdrawals. You don't understand how painful it is to see a glimpse of something you've been missing your whole life, and then to add to your misery you have to hide not only the pain, but the joy you feel when you find something that heals it. I had to let someone know. I'm not strong enough to resist the cravings. I have to keep doing this. 

I don't know how long I can go without getting caught, but I can't stop yet. I don't know if I ever will.

There was a reason our parents warned us away from the woods. A reason they adamantly insisted that the legends weren't true. We assumed it was the usual reason, there might be bad people or wild animals. Those were reasons that you tend to ignore as a child, because *nothing bad ever happens to children.* Back then the news stories seemed so far away, danger was a distant thought, bad things never happened in your home town. 


That was the ideology that sent me and my best friend Henry into the woods that night. We were going to catch the Black Rabbit. According to the urban legend if you caught it, you got a wish. We were quest seekers, little 8 year old adventurers. 


We planned our quest out methodically. We'd leave in the night once our parents were asleep. We'd pack snacks, and nets to catch the rabbit. Henry would pack one of his father's snares. We'd search the woods until we got to the Dead Forest. Then we'd set our traps and wait. 


The Dead Forest was a part deep in the woods, named by the locals. Henry and I had been there many times during the daylight hours, and there was no doubt that it was spooky. You'd be walking through lush, vibrant growth, and suddenly the landscape would change. A graveyard of small animal bones and rotted trees stretched several miles wide. No one knows why it's like that, but legend says that it's the Black Rabbit's domain. 


Around 11pm we met by the edge of the woods. It would be a long walk to the Dead Forest, but it would be worth it. Our friend Samantha had leukemia, and after all her fighting she only had a few months to live. We wanted to make her better, we couldn't imagine a world without her. So we set out to save her. 


Eventually we made it to the Dead Forest and set our traps, and we waited. After a few hours we checked, there was a small black rabbit caught in the trap. 


Henry reached his hand out to it, and suddenly sharp teeth latched onto his hand. As Henry screamed in pain it began to grow. It took on the shape of a man as it grew, the teeth sharpened. 


I watched in awe as is ate Henry's hand, then arm, and then widened its jaws to consume his entire body. When it was done there was nothing left. 


*What is your wish?* It asked in a deep voice. 


You ate my friend, give him back! I screamed. 


*I cannot return the payment you gave. Wishes come with a price.* 


This was *not* supposed to happen to children. I crawled to my feet and ran from the woods without a word. I never went back. 


Somehow Samantha went into remission, it's been twenty years since then and she's still alive. Maybe the unspoken wish came true, but was it really worth the cost?

	<TITLE> My Daughter Loves Playing Games With Me </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-12 06:33:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since she was a little girl, Maybelle loved playing Hide N Seek. She was great at it when she was young, she was so tiny. I'd spend hours searching for her, listening for my daughter's soft giggles as she listened to me walk by her hiding place. I didn't have to pretend I didn't know where she was, because I rarely ever did. 


Even when I could hear her laughter I had trouble locating her. She was an expert at the game. She'd hide in the smallest places. Closets, drawers, under beds, the cabinet under the sink, laundry baskets, and even the dryer. Sometimes it would take so long to find her that when I finally did she'd be asleep. So many times I'd carry her thin frame out of a hiding spot and into her bed. 


She'd stir as I tucked her in, Did I win, Daddy? 


You always do, baby. Sweet dreams little May, I'd plant a soft kiss on her forehead and turn on the night light. She was so precious, she made every day of my life happier. 


As she got older, she grew too big to fit comfortably in her hiding places, and she had run out of new places to go in the house. Instead of hiding merely herself she began hiding objects. Sometimes it was like a regular game of Hide N Seek, but other times she'd hide things from my wife so that she couldn't find them. She didn't want to be predictable, she loved winning the game. Some days I'd get home from work and Izzy would be near tears. 


She'd spend hours searching for the things our daughter had hidden, and she grew frustrated with the antics. Izzy and Maybelle weren't getting along very well, and I couldn't place why. My main assumption was that Maybelle wanted her mother's attention. I worked long hours, double shifts just to keep our family afloat. 


I know Izzy has been kind of different and upset since she was let go, but it wasn't fair to Maybelle. She was only seven, she didn't understand that Mommy had lost her job. All she knew was that Mommy was at home all the time now, and she expected that would mean she'd pay more attention. It didn't apparently, Izzy just found herself annoyed at the constant hiding. Usually I was the seeker, Izzy just didn't understand how much our daughter enjoyed outsmarting adults in some way. 


Back when Izzy was still working she'd get home in the afternoon to tired to do much else than cook, so playing Maybelles game was left up to me. I didn't mind it at all. I was tired too but I know the importance of being their for your child, especially when you're not home all the time. Izzy was always preoccupied with other things, she was constantly trying to contact people for job offers, so it was understandable that she couldn't always give Maybelle 100% of her attention. She wasn't really a bad mother, I think she just didn't understand how different life was with a child. 


She had never been at home all day, and last year Maybelle had aged out of her daycare. This was the first time Izzy had ever experienced what it was like to have to spend almost your entire day with a seven year old. She'd only been out of work for a month when I noticed that she was visibly stressed. 


I don't think she was sleeping much, she was constantly irritable and exhausted. That was a small part of the reason we had a huge fight last month. I was out picking up groceries, Izzy was going to watch Maybelle and get dinner started. I texted her to come outside and help bring things in, but heard the notification alert from inside the car. I gave a quick check around and found her phone tucked under the passenger seat, a series of notifications from her old boss and the text from me were listed on the screen. 


I dropped the phone into my jacket pocket and entered the house with arms full of bags. As soon as I shut the door behind me my daughter came crying and barrelled into my legs. 


Mommy tried to *cook* me in the oven! She cried, gripping my legs to the point that I couldn't walk. 


Um, I'm sorry sweetie, what? I didn't want to laugh when she was obviously afraid of something. 


Izzy walked over full of sighs and annoyance, She thinks I tried to cook her in the oven. She keeps calling me a witch,and she's hidden my phone and car keys, Her voice was harsh, and held a hint of a whine. She sounded like a teenager complaining about being picked on. 


Why does she think you tried to cook her? I asked, not because I thought she'd lie but because it was the oddest accusation I'd ever heard. 


She sighed again before explaining, She was playing that stupid game again and I couldn't find her. I figured she'd fallen asleep again, and I went to make dinner. When I set the oven to preheat and opened the stove to make sure nothing was in there, I found her. She's totally fine, the oven wasn't even warm yet. 


I was a little shocked at the nonchalant way she spoke about it. You're annoyed that you could have accidentally killed your daughter? I would have been horrified, I would have apologized for lifetimes for not finding her sooner. Sure, she wasn't hurt in any way, but the *possibility* of it shook me to the core. I found myself angry that she wasn't more careful, and sent Maybelle off to her room to play. 


Go on and play sweetheart, you're okay. Mommy has had a long day, she didn't mean it, I told her reassuringly. 


*Mommy is evil. She does bad things.* She whispered in response before obeying and running off to her room. 


Why wouldn't you just look for her? She could have gotten *hurt* Izzy. I spoke angrily, more upset than the situation really warranted. 


I'm sorry! I did look for her, and all the shit she's been hiding, I wanted to start dinner before you got back and she has *never* hidden in there before. I didn't know. I'm sorry, but she is okay. She looked ready to cry, perhaps my tone had been too harsh. 


I pulled her to me and apologized for being so harsh, I was just worried about our baby. She seemed to understand, and asked if I would help her look for her phone and keys while dinner finished cooking. I pulled her phone out of my pocket and held it out to her. She look surprised. 


You took my phone? She questioned. 


Oh no, I just found it in your car, babe, I turned to look through the couch for her keys. 


She looked quizzically at me and quickly scrolled through her missed messages. 


May must have put it in there before you ran out, She said before joining me in the search. 


I was confused about the way she was acting, but I pushed that aside. We eventually located her keys, they had been in a pocket if a jacket she rarely wore. 


It had been an exhausting day, and we ate a quiet dinner. Afterwards Izzy helped May wash up, and then called me to put her to bed. I started to tuck her in, and she beckoned for me to lean close. 


*Is Mommy gone?* She whispered to me. 


She went to lie down in bed, do you want her? I asked. She shook her head aggressively. 


She wants to hurt me, Daddy. She tried to drown me in the bath. She does bad things. She spoke as though it was a deep dark secret. 


I don't know about that, but I'll talk to her if it'll make you feel better, okay? She smiled and nodded. I gave her a kiss and told her I'd see her tomorrow. 


I meant to ask Izzy what the whole drowning accusation was about, but she was asleep when I went into our bedroom. The day had worn me out, and I needed to get some sleep before leaving for work in the dark hours of the morning. 


Throughout the next few days I would arrive home to complaints about things being hidden, and accusations of attempted murder. I have no idea why Maybelle thought her mother was trying to kill her. Perhaps the oven incident traumatized her, maybe it was an alarming way to cry for attention, but regardless it was wearing on my mind. 


Yesterday was the day I had to leave for good. On my way to work I heard a phone go off in my car, it was Izzys. She was going to be pissed when she woke up and couldn't find it for the other day. I prepared myself to be stressed out. Putting the phone in my pocket ended up being a mistake, it went off almost constantly with notifications. By the time I left in the afternoon I was thoroughly agitated. I got in my car and whipped out her phone, prepared to lay into someone for not being socially intelligent enough to know when their messages are being ignored. 


I was surprised to see that almost every notification was from her old boss. I would have shrugged it off and put the phone away uninterested in looking through his ideas for job openings, but the first message sitting on the home screen turned my annoyance into rage. 


*Babe, why aren't you answering my messages?* 


I ran through their chat history, praying it was a typo. All I found were graphic photos and lurid conversation. My wife for the past 9 years, the girl I've loved since I was 21, was cheating on me. I shoved her phone back in my pocket and drove home in a state of absolute rage. My first thought was that I was I was going to kill them both. 


I got home to find the house silent. Maybelle was still at school. I thought maybe Izzy was napping, and I was prepared to wake her up and make her face what she'd done. She wasn't in the bed though, so I went to search the rest of the house. I found myself reminded of Maybelles games of Hide N Seek. 


Maybe thinking of her was what made me check her bedroom. As I entered I nearly slipped and fell face first. There was a pool of blood covering the floor, and there she was with several deep wounds in her stomach. My rage dissipated in favor of despair. 


Izzy? I tried to shake her awake, but she had obviously been dead for hours. I ran out of the room sick to my stomach. I didn't know what to do. Obviously if the police asked for her phone, or questioned her friends or old employer, it would come out that she was cheating. I would be the main suspect. No signs of a break in, my footprints in the blood. I would go to jail and never see my daughter again. 


It was true that I had brief thoughts of a bloody murder on my mind, but this wasn't my doing. So I ran. I drove and picked up Maybelle from school, and we left the state. I was planning to make our way out of the country, maybe they'd find Izzys killer and I could come back. I couldn't stay and let them arrest me because I seemed guilty, I couldn't lose my daughter. 


Last night after May and I got to the hotel and she settled down to watch some cartoons on TV, I decided to look through Izzy's phone. More to remember the good times than search for more bad. I opened up our conversation and saw that several messages has failed to send to me for some reason. They were all similar. 


*There is something really wrong with Maybelle.*


*Baby, I'm afraid of our daughter.*


*She's scaring me. Every time we're alone she says that you're going to hurt me or she'll do it for you.*


*Why won't these messages send??? Everything else does. OUR DAUGHTER IS CRAZY.*


*This is why she's doing it. Hiding and getting into dangerous situations, saying that I'm trying to kill her. She's trying to get rid of me.* 


*Why does our daughter hate me?*


I was shocked to find them. I didn't know what to think, but I thought maybe I could figure out the reason she claimed her mother tried to kill her so many times. 


May, honey? I turned off the TV, I have to talk to you about Mommy,


Don't worry Daddy, I took care of her. She said with a smile, like I should be proud. 


You did? 


Mhmm, She giggled I played Hide N Seek with a knife and her belly! 


Oh, sweetheart that's not okay I started. 

What? She got teary eyed, Daddy I just wanted to help, she was doing bad things.


Oh baby, don't cry. I know, I hugged her because I didn't know what else to do. 


You'll still play games with me right? If you do then I promise I won't play the bad kind with you, okay deal? She looked up at me, almost smirking. Suddenly I was afraid. 


I agreed with her, and tucked her into bed. It's the next morning now, and I'm afraid. I'm afraid of a seven year old girl. I don't know what to do about her, but something about the way she looked at me while we were eating breakfast felt *inhuman*. She's my daughter and I love her, but I'm not even sure if she's really my daughter on the inside. 


I have to get going now, we're going to play Hide N Seek across the country, while I pray that I don't end up like my wife.

	<TEXT> This is amazing advice, I'll search around in the morning to see if there are any Pics remaining, and whether or not there are I'll find out as much as I can about their cure progress, or the progress with identifying the unknown substance. If I can't get in, or I can't find their samples, I'll head to the south woods before I leave and take mushrooms from around there, hopefully they have the mutation. 

I'll print out a copy of this, and add any updates to the end of this post. I'll try as hard as I can for as long as I'm able to help end this before it spreads.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Suicide Town (Part 2) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-10 23:36:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first part of the journey leading up to the last month of my life can be found [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5yi7eo/suicide_town/)


We started calling the monthly deaths *Waves.* I suppose it was a way to make it sound better. Rather than just bluntly stating that on the 9th of every month there would be mass suicides, there would be a *Wave.* The reality didn't set in until the second one. Sure, everyone had panicked during the first *Wave*, but it didn't compare to the level of fear that came with realizing it wasn't a one time thing. 


I was staying with Charlotte when the 9th of May hit. Her parents had gone out to get groceries, and besides the quarantine and the issues it caused, life was relatively normal. When her parents got home we heard the news, it was happening again. People all over town were committing suicide. 


There were crashed cars everywhere, bodies hanging in the street, people in stores picking up anything sharp enough to pierce flesh. It was the same scene as a month ago, but on a larger scale. Charlotte's mother was shaken, and she gripped her husband fiercely. They had been in a checkout line when the cashier wrapped a phone cord around his neck. 


Try as anyone might have to stop these people from harming themselves, they were unsuccessful. Another wave of mass hysteria and panic ensued. The news channel was down for the entire day. We had no way of knowing how severe this *Wave* was. 


I tried calling Erin's house to see if they had seen or heard anything about the deaths, but there was no answer. In the back of my mind I knew their family had been part of the people who were affected. We stayed in the house all day, not wanting to become collateral damage during someone's suicide attempt. 


By the next morning the news channel was up and running again, but not by anyone from town. The doctors and scientists who had been called in to find out what was going on now ran everything. They were finally ready to tell us what was going on. 


During the search for the mushrooms that Janice Bergman wrote about in her note, they had found some interesting things. First, was that there was only one type of mushroom growing in the woods around our town. *Boletus badius.* It wasn't a harmful mushroom, it was normally safe and edible. They collected soil samples, and several of the mushrooms from various locations in the woods to examine. 


According to their findings, something in the soil had absorbed into the mushrooms and caused some sort of mutation. The substance in the soil was not identifiable, they had no clues as to what it may be, or where it may have come from. They believe it is the source of the sickness that has infected our town. It's been nicknamed the B-virus. 


Additionally, they told us the specifics of the B-virus. Exactly one month after exposure an irresistible compulsion to end your life occurs. Immediately following death microscopic spores are released into the surrounding air, infecting anyone within 500 feet of the deceased. It is believed that the spores dissipate or are absorbed into hosts within ten minutes following the death. 


The new information on the B-virus heightened the panic and despair that already weighed heavily on the town. According to what we were told, the total deaths since patient zero were around 800. Nearly half the town, not including all the people who had been newly infected the day prior. Janice Bergman had started something that no one knew how to stop. They couldn't even begin to work on a cure because they couldn't identify the substance that poisoned the mushrooms. 


A sense of impending doom filled us all, and we began to truly live everyday like it was our last. All we could do was pretend like we could still live normally until the days when a *Wave* would hit us. We tried to make light of a dark situation, we nicknamed the scientists and doctors the Pics. People in charge. That was around the time we started calling the deaths *Waves*. 


The Pics brought in food from the outside, they kept our power and water going. We lived for free during that time, considering many of the adults in town had jobs a great distance away. They didn't let us die in any way that they could prevent. As far as we knew the Pics were working around the clock to see if they could find a cure for us. 


The day before the third *Wave* hit Charlotte's parents left. They told us to take care of each other and the house. They knew they were about to die. It was a miserable time, and when the third *Wave* rolled through, the town suffered its greatest loss yet. Another near 800 deaths occurred, doubling the already daunting total. Over three quarters of the town was wiped out in just three months. 


After that each wave provided less and less death, we were aware of the B-virus and we were aware of how to avoid catching it. Some people let themselves be exposed when a *Wave* hit. They didn't want to let their loved ones go alone, or they didn't want to stay in the forsaken town. People went crazy. By the 9th month we were down to just over a hundred people. Somehow staying hidden in Charlotte's house had kept us safe. We coined a new term by then, the Hopeless. 


The Hopeless were people who didn't give a shit if they got exposed, and went for maximum impact when it was time for a *Wave.* They were sad, they were vengeful, and they were the main reason that the B-virus didn't die out. They included the people who stayed with lived ones when their *Wave* hit. We all could have stayed hidden, but the cynical Hopeless wanted payback. They had lost everyone, and sought to bring the Pics and everyone else in the town the same pain. 


Only a few new people became infected with each new *Wave* now, and most of those infections were because of the Hopeless. They broke into houses and chased people down to ensure that their misery would live on. It was the darkest time in our lives. The following two months brought our population down to around 75. We were almost dead. About two weeks before we hit the eleventh month, we learned something new about the virus. 


If you died before your month had passed, you still contained more than enough spores to infect other people. We never realized this before due to the extravagant amount of deaths and infections. Food deliveries were sabotaged by the Hopeless, and many of the Pics became infected. To put it short, we were all fucked. At any moment someone could die and infect you,it was no longer confined to one day a month when we needed to hide, it was everyday. 


As of a week ago the town seems to have gone silent. I thought that maybe Charlotte and I were the last alive. I thought we might have beat it, and that we could be free and leave this place forever, but apparently that's not what fate wanted. 


Two days ago Charlotte came to me stone faced. She handed me a piece of paper, and didn't say a word. 


*I know it's too late, and I'm so sorry I didn't tell you. I didn't want to be left alone when it happened. One of the Hopeless got me last month when I went to the food delivery. I wanted to spend all of my leftover time with you. I'm sorry for being so selfish, I love you Annalyn Morrison. I'm so sorry.*


*- Charlotte*


I looked up at her in confusion, realizing too late that the note had been a distraction as well as a goodbye. Before I could get a word out, or even attempt to stop her, she plunged a kitchen knife deep into her throat. My end was set in stone. I kicked myself for not noticing the knife sooner. 


I don't have a lot of time left, and I don't want to spend the last month of my life stuck in this caged town. I'm not sure if there are any Pics left, or if the B-virus took them all. I hope this ends here, and I hope the virus doesn't drive me crazy enough to become one of the Hopeless. If the Pics are really gone, I can say that won't mean well for the rest of you. 


I'm just going to try to handle my last month in stride. My only advice to you is to not eat any wild mushrooms, even if they should be safe. And if you happen to be nearby when someone commits a public suicide, be wary, it may have gotten out. 


I'm so sorry to admit that I plan on leaving this town if I can. I want to live to the fullest, and if I'm sane at the end, I'll go somewhere where no one is close enough to get hurt.

	<TEXT> Janice Bergman was a nice girl, she was smart, decently pretty, and had the voice of an angel. I had heard her when she was rehearsing for the talent show. That was during my senior year of highschool, exactly one year ago now. She was the reason this all started. I think I could be the one it ends with. Someone has to know what happened here. 


I remember the day it all began well, partially because I was late. Late for seemingly everything. It was March, and on the drive to school my car had gotten stuck in the remaining muddy snow. That just seemed to set off a chain throughout the day, forgotten notebooks, things left in my car, locker stuck shut. Anything that could go wrong did, even after the school day ended. When it was time for the talent show at 6pm I *was* on time, but then realized I had to drive all the way back home to get my guitar. I wasn't surprised that I showed back up after the show had begun. However, I *was* surprised at the scene when I got there. 


There were police cars, and an ambulance. Half the school was standing on the front lawn, and more people were driving up at the same time as me. I got out of my car, unsure of what was happening. That's when my girlfriend came running from the crowd. 


Ohmygod, Anna! She sounded panicked. 


Charlotte? What's going on? I was still trying to take in the scene, a body was being taken to the ambulance. A red stain on a white sheet, Who the fuck is dead? 


She started crying, I don't know what happened, I was waiting here for you. Erin is panicking, she said that everyone watched Janice die! I pulled her into me as her sobs increased. I almost joined her, but I was still so confused. 


Erin and David came over at that moment, arms draped around each other's waists. Erin looked shaken. David looked ready to explode with words. They were my friends, but they weren't top shelf citizens. Erin spoke first, nearly screaming. 


Janice fucking killed herself! On stage, in front of everyone! She pressed herself closer to David, as if he could shield her from what they witnessed. 


What.. What the fuck? Are you serious, why? I had no idea how to react. I was silently relieved that I had arrived late. 


David confirmed what she said, and offered to show me a video he had taken. I was disgusted by the thought of watching it, and the fact that he kept the recording. 


Why wouldn't you delete that? I questioned, feeling sick over the entire situation. 


I was just going to record it for Erin, she was in the bathroom when Janice went up to sing. I wasn't expecting her to blow her fucking head off, He replied defensively. 


I was suddenly exhausted, by the conversation, the panic surrounding me, and the tragic death that had taken place that night. I pulled Charlotte away from the scene and we drove back to her house. When we arrived I got a text from my dad, he was actually happy that I had been late. He came to watch me play, but ended up only witnessing the gruesome scene. I told him I was with Charlotte, and he thought it was a good idea to stay the night with her. 


We spent that entire night distracting each other, and periodically checking the news to see if any answers were given about what happened. Nothing substantial turned up. No one knew why Janice would do it, she was always happy. Everyone liked her. No one could understand. 


In the following weeks rumours began circulating about a note, but it wasn't released to the public. Our town was relatively small, less than two thousand people. We didn't have access to a huge police force, or a big hospital, I'm not even sure if there was a psychiatrist anywhere around. Who could have known Janice would do this? We weren't equipped for that type of thing. The investigation was open and shut, she committed a public suicide to create maximum impact. We all tried to move on, and we were doing mostly okay. That is, until exactly one month after Janices death. 


Erin called me freaking out. The police were on their way, and David was dead. I could hardly understand her through her screaming sobs, and decided to just pick up Charlotte and go see her in person. She was a mess by the time we got there, and the police were leaving with the body. She took us to her room, where we helped remove the bloody sheets from her bed as we talked. 


Are you okay? Charlotte asked her. 


Do I fucking look okay? He shoved a fucking pencil into his eye while he was on top of me! She screamed, I suddenly realized that she was splattered with blood. 


Wait what? I don't know why my mind wanted more information, maybe it was shock. It took her a moment to collect herself before she explained. 


We were studying, and we took a break. So we were making out on my bed and.. She started crying again, He picked up a pencil from the end table and just fucking stabbed it into his eye! 


I didn't know how to react, so I just hugged her. I had no idea what to say, there was nothing in my seventeen year old repertoire about how to console a girl who just got a very personal insight on suicide. 


A few minutes later Erins mom called for us to come downstairs. We entered the living room to find the local news blaring. 


*... So far there have been over a hundred reported suicides today. Local authorities are unsure what may have caused this, and have said that they will be contacting other law enforcement services. This a tragic day in our own town, just one month after the jarring suicide of local high school senior Janice Bergman. In--*


The anchorman stopped mid sentence, causing the lady next to him to stare. He stayed completely still for a moment, then abruptly pulled out a pocket knife and gave a quick slice across his throat. 


*Turn the cameras off! Call the po--*


The woman was cut off as the automated message from the station appeared. *We're experiencing technical difficulties. Please remain patient while we tend to the issue.* Technical difficulties? I guess a lived aired suicide could fall into that category. A feeling of panic overcame the room. 


The whole town is going to shit, Erin's father proclaimed from his seat on the couch. He followed that up with flipping the channel to a sitcom. 


We retreated back upstairs, and Charlotte and I decided to spend the night with Erin, she was really fucked up over the situation. Understandable, I think we all were. The panicked feeling in the house had not dissipated, and I suspect the entire town was feeling the same. I shot a text out to my dad, letting him know that I was staying over. The three of us ended up cuddling together in Erin's bed, talking about anything that could distract us from what had happened today. We all ended up passing out as the hours dragged by, ignoring the fact that we were lying in the spot where David had died earlier that day. 


I awoke in the morning to find myself alone with Charlotte in the bed. I was tempted to wake her up playfully, but when the daze of sleep faded I recalled the events from the prior day. I could hear the news was back on downstairs, so I shook Charlotte awake to come see what had developed. Erin was already down there staring at the TV. 


What's going on, where did your parents go? I asked Erin when we found her. 


To check the exits. They're closing us in. They think we might be sick. She replied, she looked entirely lost, We're all gonna die in here. 


I gripped her shoulders tightly, trying to understand, What are you talking about?


Anna hey, Charlotte suddenly spoke up, The news has new information. It's back on. 


So rather than grill Erin for more information while she was looking like a deer in the headlights, I sat down with Charlotte. 


*... Sorry to inform the residents that the town is being quarantined. Due to the nature of the deaths, and the severity of the issue, medical professionals believe that we may be suffering from some sort of infection. At this time specifics are unknown, we will be releasing as much as we can and remain on the air as long as possible. It has been asked that we do not speak to anyone outside the town about the sickness and quarantine--*


Turn that shit off, Erin's dad came lumbering in through the front door. 


He immediately went upstairs, and the three of us girls sat on the couch in silence for a moment. Erin's mother came in next, she apologized for her husband's outburst and told us everything we needed to know. In the last 24 hours around two hundred people killed themselves. The local police have brought in specialists to find out what's going on. The doctors who were called in examined a few of the bodies, but didn't share what exactly they've found so far. They suggested to close off the town, whatever is happening might be infectious and they don't want it getting out. 


Due to the fact that we were nearly an hours drive from the next town over, we are the only place affected. So far everyone who has died was confirmed as a witness to Janices suicide last month. We're allowed to talk to people outside of the town, but if we mention the quarantine and incidents going on, our connection will be taken away on an individual basis. They don't want us causing a national panic, but they don't want us to feel like we're cut off. That's all she could find out right now, the authorities haven't released any more information. 


I felt as shocked as Erin had looked this morning. I held Charlotte's hand tightly, the feeling of panic renewed and aggressively bubbled in my chest. 


I need to call my dad, I felt sick as I said the words. Erin's mom gave me a look that felt like pity. 


There was no answer at first, but finally someone picked up the phone. My sigh of relief caught in my throat as I realized the man on the other end of the line was not my father. 


Yes hello, I'm sorry, do you know Mr he paused as he searched for something, Morrison? 


I'm his daughter, I nearly whispered, knowing what was about to come. 


I'm sorry Maam, his body was found in his home a few hours ago. He is being processed at the walk-in clinic. Could you come down here? 


I said I would and hung up. I had no idea who the guy on the phone was, and I found myself angry that anyone would pick up a call on a dead man's phone. Erin's mom offered to drive me there since I wasn't in a good state, and explained on the way that since we had no other medical facility, all the bodies were taken to the clinic. 


My last memory of seeing my father would be him lying on a table, with a broken and bruised neck. The only time I ever went home after that day was to collect clothes and pictures. I didn't want to be in the place where he died. 


In the following days we'd find that Janice did leave a note, as well as a few of the other people who died. I suppose they were the strong ones. The doctors went crazy over her note, and it ended up leaked to the public. 


*I can feel that my time is almost up, I should tell someone what happened before something bad happens to me.* 


*I went into the woods and picked some mushrooms, I knew they weren't the poisonous kind. I don't know enough about drugs, but I figured they had to be edible or that they'd make me hallucinate. I wanted to see what it would be like. I could feel that something was wrong as soon as I ate it. Now that feeling is back, and I know everything is going to go wrong.*


*I'm so sorry, I thought they were okay.*


*-J.B*


All the other notes were nearly the same as one another:


*Help me, it's inside of me. I need to get it out. Something is very wrong. There isn't much time.* 


I think this renewed the feeling of panic that we had become accustomed to, and people were outraged. What was this mushroom? Is it making us sick? All anyone knew for sure was that they were scared. People tried to leave, but the electric fence that had been erected around town kept them in. Someone tried to drive a car through the fence, but it was stronger than that. 


We were trapped. We were scared. We panicked. People died in riots on the street, riots at the gates into town. Some of the researchers who came to search the woods to find and examine the mushrooms were attacked or murdered. Everyone was acting crazy, half the town lost their rights to communicate with the outside world. The rest of us lied about having access to the outside, and we hid. 


We were in a full state of widespread panic by the time the second *Wave* began.

	<TITLE> She Is My Eternal Inspiration </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Cassandra was a beautiful woman. I swear to the Muses that it was love at first sight. When I first caught a glance at her I was stopped dead in my tracks. Long, flowing, chestnut colored hair, vibrant green eyes, beautiful olive toned skin that was flecked with beauty marks. Classic Italian beauty. Absolutely gorgeous. I must have looked a fool as I stood stricken still on the sidewalk. I had to pick my jaw up from the cement before I could continue on my way to work, and by that time her graceful stride had taken her into a photography studio. I'm no writer, but this woman inspired me to pour out my affections. 


I saw her from time to time over the next few weeks, always on the busy street. In and out of clothing stores, makeup and photography studios, and taxis. She was a busy woman, socializing and working her way to the top. She was in the right place, this part of the city was model central, and she was more than average model material. Her delicate curves were perfectly shaped for everything she wore, I wouldn't be surprised if she hit super model status within the year. That type of beauty is incomparable. 


I longed for the day when Cassandra might come into my studio. If she remained as well kept as I'd always seen her, then applying her makeup would be effortless. In fact, she'd hardly need any. I painted on beautiful faces for others, all the while wishing I would get the opportunity to have my tools touch her skin. It was a selfish thought, but her face plagued my mind. I was under a spell, and I'd never even spoken to her. 


I watched her for months. She often modeled at a studio not far from where I worked, and I would see her walking by my own workplace often. I ached to go talk to her, to tell her how she had become my inspiration. I began painting on canvas, just so that I could have a clean slate. As much as I tried to bring out the same beauty in my clients, none of them measured up to Cassandra. A blank slate was the only place where I could recreate her image to near perfection. 


I'd sigh at myself, embarrassed at my feelings for a woman who likely didn't know I existed. My apartment walls became adorned with those paintings, I saw her more each day. I decided that I should work up the courage to speak to her, rather than just remain a watcher from afar. I was terrified though, I was just a lowly artist and she was quickly becoming a high status model. I didn't want her to think I was just some fan that fawned over her pictures in magazines. I had to at least try though. 


I planned to casually run into her on the street after work one of these days, I knew that even if she wasn't walking somewhere as soon as I left that she would be eventually. I was more than willing to wait. I didn't have to though, she was brought into my workplace that day. I was shocked, I hadn't seen her around in the last few days and didn't expect this to be the place she'd pop up. After speaking with my boss she was brought to me for preparation. I was informed that she had been in a car accident, and some of the signs were obvious. 


She'd need her injuries covered up so that she'd look good for her appearance. I was elated to have the chance to work on her, even the bruises didn't ruin her beauty. I tried to strike up casual conversation but she was silent. I'm used to quiet clients though, so I wasn't offended. I regretted not trying to talk to her on the street before now, I had planned on getting her to come in here myself. Can't dwell on missed opportunities though, she was here regardless. 


By the time I was finished she looked exactly as she always had. I felt a little sad that this would be the last time I'd ever see her in person. She was still so beautiful, eternally so. I was proud of my work on her, I studied her so well before she came in that I had mastered creating this appearance. You could almost believe she wasn't a corpse. She'll look beautiful at her funeral.

	<TITLE> I Tried Out a Dating Site </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-08 00:49:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I first met Jackson I was stricken by his eyes. I say met, but we didn't *actually* meet that day. I found him on a dating site named something I'd be ashamed to admit having a profile on. He was a gorgeous human being, so of course I was cautious. I've seen Catfish, I know that online dating can be sketchy. 


I figured I was smart enough to not get screwed over. After we had talked a few times and he had given me some basic information, I dug as deep as I could online.


Every social media platform related to Jackson, I found. The phone I had been texting was in his name, and every picture he posted was only associated with his own accounts. By all means this guy was real, and he was interested in *me.* 


He was so similar to me. An only child with parents that we couldn't stand. We bonded over stories of lackluster childhoods. 


After nearly two months of talking online we decided to close the distance. My job provided me with the opportunity to travel different places when I wanted to do business, and it just so happened that Jackson lived in the city I'd be headed to next. Before I left on my trip, he confided in me that he hadn't told any of his friends that he started a relationship online. He was embarrassed. I was a little hurt. 


I had told my family about him. He was quite the catch, something I'd been looking for for a long time. I got over it though, it didn't matter if his friends knew about me. In fact, it'd be better off in case things went awry. I didn't need him running off and saying that I was crazy if it didn't work out. 


When I spotted him in the bar we'd picked for our first meeting I checked over the screenshots in my phone from when I was running my check, definitely the right guy. I tucked it into my purse, leaving the mugshot and details of his arrest open. We'd need to address that. 


We hit it off amazingly, and left the bar tipsy and in need of a bed. The walk to his apartment led us through a dark alley, where he stopped to kiss me. I pushed him off and held up my phone.


So, you're into kiddie porn? Wouldn't expect that from someone so attractive. I smiled a sharp grin as he gaped in shock and confusion. Before he could deny it, I lunged. My shark teeth sunk into his jugular. As he choked out his last breaths, I spit the blood in my mouth onto the ground. 


I had no desire to eat him, evil tastes vile. I was thankful for the nearby river, I was able to dump the body and collect his soul at the same time. 


Be careful who you meet online, that guy was bad news.

	<TEXT> After leaving Sherri's house my first instinct was to make sure Kevin was still at home and in bed. I was weary by the time I got home, but thankful to find Kevin snoring in his bed. I wanted to immediately look into more information about what I was dealing with, but I had no idea where to start. My brain was fried and I needed to sleep before I could dig deeper. 


I panicked when I woke up in the morning, the bliss of my slumber giving way to the revelations of last night. I still wasn't sure where to begin, but I thought my safest bet was to start with my husband. As soon as Kevin left to catch the school bus I told Jeremy all about my conversation with Sherri, and what we thought was happening with Kevin. He laughed at first, thinking it was a joke. 


Are you sure Sherri hasn't gone nuts? He had asked with a grin. Noticing that my demeanor remained serious he collected himself, Alright, so what are we supposed to do about this? His face shifted to a look of concern, and I could only imagine that believing in what I was telling him tested every ounce of the psychiatrist he was. 


I'm not sure, but maybe you know someone who could help? If this is something that's being passed around there has to be some kind of record, right? I can't imagine that no one has ever seen a psychiatrist about an issue like this. I told him, unsure if I was asking the right questions. It seemed only logical that if you had a child with these kinds of issues that you'd seek out professional help. 


I don't know if I can find that kind of information, babe, He gave me another worried glance, as though this revelation may break my heart, If it's not been discussed before, any information about specific patients with this kind of issue will be confidential. 


Well I figured that, but there must be *someone* who thought it was an extremely unusual case and sought out help. Or maybe someone who's seen it several times and decided to look further into it, or document it? I had not been confident broaching the subject in the first place, and my lack of in-depth psychiatric knowledge seemed more apparent as he tried to convince me not to get my hopes up. 


He squeezed my shoulder reassuringly, If there's been a case study, or it's in any medical journal, I'll do whatever I can to find the documentation. 


I nearly cried with relief, even if there was nothing to find I was still elated that I had someone to help. My hopes were definitely held high. I had one final question, Hun How hard do you think it would be to find a patient who was admitted to an institution? 


Still in one? I think you'd have to find the person who admitted them, I don't exactly have a list of every patient who has ever been admitted, and I couldn't give you that information if I did.


His answer satisfied me, and I kissed him goodbye so that he could leave for work. I had my own work to do. With the house to myself for the day I began to scour the internet for information about the Morton family. Local information came first, the news articles about the tragic fire. Looking through the online archive of the newspaper, I saw that they also ran a few other stories on the Mortons. *Local Girl Murders Sister* one of the headlines read.


I skimmed over the articles, they only confirmed what I had already been told. I glanced through older news for a minute until a headline from a few months prior to the fire caught my attention. *Child Still Missing*. The first line stood out, *Police are still searching for the boy who went missing in the middle of the night from a local foster home*. I was about to read more into it when my phone rang. My heart sank as I heard the voice on the line.


The principal of Kevin's school sounded mortified as he spoke, There's been an incident concerning Kevin, we're going to need both you and your husband to report to the school immediately. I looked at the clock, he'd only been gone less than three hours. What could he have done? 


I'm on my way, I felt sick to my stomach as the call ended. I immediately dialed Jeremy as I collected my purse and keys. 


Hey Jere, there's a problem with Kevin. They need us at the school right now, I said. 


Um, yea. I'll head right out, He sounded confused and distracted. 


You okay, hun? I was concerned, I didn't know how well I could handle it if something else was wrong right now. 


He cleared his throat, Ah, yea. I was able to find out about a doctor from some colleagues, but I have to tell you in person. It's not much yet. He still sounded odd, but I didn't have the time to question him right then. 


Okay well, I'll see you at the school. Love you, I was confused about the way he had been speaking, but now wasn't the time to dwell on it. I needed to see what on earth could have happened at the school. As I drove the thoughts all plagued me at once. *Article, school incident, fire, Morton family, doctor.* My search for answers about Kevin was pulling up so many new questions.

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if she was really crazy, or if the voices were real. I assumed my mother was merely driven crazy by the constant abuse and noise. It could have another source though, her method of ending things was *incredibly* over the top. 

I'll probably be getting speach therapy eventually, but I'm afraid to speak again. 

I know writing this was a risk because my mother may see it, but I needed to get it off of my chest. Perhaps I'll just reveal my story on here to the therapist when I go again. Our meetings so far have been more silent than you'd even expect.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She was definitely in the wrong, but it's been deeply ingrained to not speak of the things we do at home. It was easy enough to figure out that she did these awful things, and I hope she gets caught. 

Thank you, hopefully one day the fear eases enough for me to *want* to speak.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> You Don't Do That To Family </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Grandma started to lose her mind as she aged, and Mother thought it would be wise to take her into our home. She thought it might slow the progression, or at least keep her comfortable until her mind was emptied of every last one of it's marbles. Grandma was always a strict, bitter, and admittedly terrifying woman. She was well respected, but also feared. No one dared stand up to her, even as she started insisting that her delusions and hallucinations were true. We went along with it, but we also anxiously awaited the day that the 90 year old would pass. 


Myself being nearly twenty five meant that I did the majority of the housework to pay my dues, and Grandma was strict about it. Dad's been gone my entire life, I had no other siblings, and an ectopic pregnancy ruined my chances at having my own family and tore apart my fragile relationship. These two women are all I've got, and I needed them when I was alone and my mind slunk into dark places. Living with my mother wasn't the most desirable thing, but since my loss I haven't been able to function at 100%. Mom could use the help anyways, living alone can be depressing. 


I had been back home for a month when Grandma had come to stay with us. She wasn't quite as crazy when she first got there, just constantly mumbling about voices. I wasn't ecstatic about housing and caring for a mad woman, but I figured it could be worse. I thought it would be something else to take my mind off of constant dark thoughts, but she ended up being a black hole. After a few weeks of staying with us her condition was becoming noticeably worse. Her mumbling turned to shouting, and she began insisting the things she saw and heard were real. 


We had to play along or risk facing a violent outburst. She'd throw anything close enough to grab, and it fucking hurt if you were in the way of whatever she was throwing. We were nearly two months into this hell when she got my mother across the chest with a plate. It cut her deeply, and she had to go to the hospital for stitches. Grandma had always been a bitter woman, but this illness was bringing it to new levels. Mom refused to tell anyone outside the family how she really got the injury, and you could tell the secret was eating her up inside. She followed the one most important rule: You don't do that to family. Which meant, you *never* admit to someone outside the family that someone inside did something wrong. It was a rule that had been heavily enforced for generations. 


After that incident the situation in the house got very tense, and it made me wish I could get my shit together enough to leave. I'd feel awful leaving my mother alone with Grandma though.


Another month and things were intolerable. The house was a constant cascade of noises, TVs, radios, and loud uncomfortable voices filled any silence. Silence was no longer allowed. Partaking in the delusions meant more than just patting the old woman on the shoulder and saying, Yes, I hear it too. We had to help her block out the voices, or face her wrath. I honestly couldn't understand why my mother wouldn't just put her in a home.


I'd asked her, and every time she gave the same reply, You don't do that to family. 


I can understand the sentiment, I couldn't imagine how I'd feel if I had a child who sent me away to die in a false paradise. Old age homes are depressing, I've never met someone with any happy stories about sending a family member to one. Now, Grandma would be a different case. She didn't really deserve the amount of kindness we afforded her, but it wasn't entirely her fault. Sure she was a bitch before she went crazy, but it wasn't nearly as bad. 


The constant noise was enough to drive you up the wall, and I ended up finally using my prescription for sleeping pills. Along with the antidepressants I'd already been taking they helped enough to bring living there to a level only slightly below intolerable. It was okay, at least I could sleep through the noise. Mom didn't get the luxury of taking pills to shut it out, though she tried. The sleeping pills didn't work well enough for her, and the blaring radio coming from Grandma's room kept her up nearly every night. 


I think her true breaking point was about a month and a half ago. We were sitting down for dinner together, both the tv and radio were screaming the news from the living room. I could tell she was agitated, but I didn't realize how much until she got up and unplugged everything. The house fell into a moment of silence before Grandma started screaming. 


Laura, Laura! Why are you letting them take me! *Why?!* She shrieked, grasping her head in both hands. After another quiet moment she looked to me instead, Mary, sweet child, don't let her do this to me. God, make it stop! *MAKE IT STOP!* I recoiled as her voice raised, unsure of what to do. 


Grandma it's okay, please--


Shut the *fuck* up. Is it so hard to just have a minute of quiet? My mother cut me off with a glare. 


I was shocked, to say the least. I didn't understand why she was suddenly and so aggressively deciding to stop playing into Grandma's delusions. I didn't have time to ask her either, because that was the moment when a butter knife flew across the table. The heavy metal handle her hit her just above her temple, and the blood was immediate. She was pissed, but in a terrifyingly calm way. She touched her fingers to the wound, looked at the blood, and smiled. 


You fucking *bitch,* She said in a low voice, I care for you, take you into my home, put up with your bullshit, and when we don't play along for thirty seconds you hurt us? 


Grandma looked a little shocked but resumed her yelling, They're going to take me, they took my baby! Look how she disobeys me, she's handing me to the voices!


Mother shook her head and walked away from the table, and I did the only thing I thought would help. I started a random conversation with Grandma, something to distract her from her screaming and give my mom a chance to calm down and relax. It wasn't very helpful, I wasn't loud enough to block out the false voices in Grandma's head. I ended up sitting her in front of the TV and putting the news back on at a disgustingly loud volume. I went to find my mom and ask her if she was okay. She was in the bathroom tending to her wound. 


Are you going to the hospital?


Did you really turn that damn TV back on? She replied without looking at me. 


Um.. Yea. I figured it was better than the screaming..


I'm not going anywhere, someone will wonder why I've needed stitches twice in as many months. We don't talk about this kind of thing with other people. You don't do that to family. Oh, and stop making noise. I have a migraine and I'm going to lose it on someone if I hear another sound for the rest of the day. She pushed past me and walked away, leaving me conflicted. 

I spent the rest of the day trying to deal with the screaming, and when I could no longer take it I decided I needed to calm Grandma down. Mom had gotten so pissed off that she had moved the TV and radio from the living room into her own bedroom and closed herself in with them. There was only screaming to be heard in the house. I spent hours trying to talk Grandma out of it, but it only calmed her slightly. When mom finally came out of the room she looked exhausted. 


Didn't I tell you to shut up? She sighed. I felt bad for disobeying, but I didn't know how else to deal with it. You want tea Mary? Im gonna make us all some tea so we can forget about this stressful day. 


I nodded, wanting to avoid her freaking out again. We all sat and drank the tea, while Mom sang loudly to avoid the screaming. It was almost a peaceful moment. I checked the time after we finished and it was getting late, so I helped Grandma up the stairs and into bed. I turned on her bedside radio, and she was asleep within a few minutes. Relative peace at last. The day had exhausted me. I called a goodnight down the stairs to mom, and went into my own room. I couldn't immediately find my sleeping pills, but I was so exhausted that I didn't bother searching. I'd sleep fine without taking one. 


I slept better than I had in months, it was deep and peaceful and when I finally woke up I wished I could have stayed asleep forever. It was still dark, I was groggy and in a great amount of pain. I brought my hand to my face and I could feel that something was very, very wrong. I ran to the bathroom and caught sight of myself in the mirror, and my mouth bled as it attempted to open and vomit. I choked it down and cried silent tears. My mouth was sewn shut. Somehow through my shock I noticed an empty pill bottle in the sink, my sleeping pills. I had refilled the prescription only two days ago, meaning that nearly thirty pills had been used. I felt sick as I realized what my mother had done. 


I ran to Grandma's room next, and found her in the same mutilated state as I was. Only, she was also cold to the touch. I fought the urge to vomit again, and left the room. She either overdosed or asphyxiated and I wasn't trained to tell which was the case with her mouth sewn. I couldn't find my mother anywhere in the house, and when I pulled out my phone I realized that she could be anywhere right now. I had slept for nearly two days. No wonder I didn't wake up while being mutilated, I was nearly comatose. 


I wanted to call the police, but as I was about to dial I kicked myself internally. *You can't talk, stupid.* I walked my sorry ass to the nearest hospital, not wanting to traumatize anyone on the way. My car was missing, so I guess that's what mom used. The hospital staff nearly shit themselves when I walked into the emergency room, it was *almost* funny. 


This entire part if my journey is fairly boring, except for when they realized that behind my sewn lips I had no tongue. They replaced it, but I haven't learned how to speak again yet. I'm scared to talk ever again. The police came to question me about what happened, but I only wrote down that I couldn't remember. Obviously my mother was a suspect, they had found Grandma's body in her house. I know it seems messed up that I wouldn't directly admit what my mother did, but I have three very good reasons for that. 


1. She was already the only suspect. 


2. I was afraid she'd find me and punish me again for speaking when I shouldn't. 


3. You don't do that to family.
