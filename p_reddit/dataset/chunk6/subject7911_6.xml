	<TEXT> Yep. I think they should equally focus on creating new maps as they do for new heroes. As you said that maps are harder to make, this would result in longer intervals between patch releases but it would also give us patches with more content to explore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has been some time since we have been testing maps and till now we have got only two new maps, Stone keep and Brightmarsh and also that the new maps coming out are only for the Siege matches and so far we have not seen anything new for Payload and Survival. It would be great if we discussed our ideas for some new maps, modes, fixes, heroes, etc.

PvE was great like the invisible drogoz one (that was fun), but wouldn't it be nice if they added something like capture the flag or some more new modes.

Feel free to correct me if you think I was wrong anywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OMFG!! Those skins are dope. Way better than the ones Hi-Rez does. That Inara skin is amazing. But you should also make a Viktor skin. Viktor is my main. Good work. Keep it up. </TEXT>
