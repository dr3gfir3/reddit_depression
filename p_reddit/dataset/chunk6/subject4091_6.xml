	<TEXT> A bit late to the party.
I was ordering some food and suddenly these two guys sitting behind me started talking shit about me in my dialect. Phone rang- it was my cousin. The way me and my cousin talk involves a lot of swearing. Plus, our region probably has the hardest/meanest version of every curse word in my dialect. I turned around and saw these guys, face red, trying their best to avoid eye contact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are called irrational numbers iirc but only if it has nonrepeating decimals. Irrational because they cannot br expressed with a "ratio"

A number with infinite repeating decimal such as 1.6666666... Is rational becauce it can be expressed in ratio or fractions. 1.66666... Is simply 1 1/3

Hope that helps :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If terrorism is a rat, why does it matter?
If magnetism is true, is hypnotism better?
Can nepotism and nihilism be a serious fetter?
Does skepticism allow good things to splatter?
Too many questions. Too many litter
Just let me sing words of euphemism that flatter.
Because in my world not all answers matter.

It always feels like i missed a line or something but this particular piece has stuck with me for more than 10 years now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im assuming both can output to a 3.5mm. How about if you used those Y-splitters? 1male to 2female connectors. Plug it to pc headphone jack, plug the headphone to the splitter then connect the switch to it using a male to male 3.5mm cable.

This works on smaller devices but it might need a second opinion.

Personally i would use a mixer or if you can buy or build a box with some sort of selector to it, that would be safer and cheaper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I own 2 leicas. Altho both of them are pretty vintage; m2 and an m6 ttl 0.85x. The last time i used a digital camera besides my phone was 2011 iirc. Went full film after discovering the ease of using rangefinders, super quick focusing and that little surprise of not seeing them right after you take the shot. Film's not dead...






But your wallet will be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yess! I love the vintage styling of rangefinders. Fortunately leica still makes them this way altho they're very expensive compared to other cameras.

This camera in particular has a collapsible lens which can be hidden within the body when not being used making it pocketable. It's simply brilliant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep on running into factorial lately. Whats funny is ive been doing factorial manually for a while now solving different random things in life. Algorithm for music shuffle, odds in lottery. n! / n!(n-r)! It's amazing!

Whats funny is i never knew it was called factorial till last week.

(I was a math geek in hs and while i went to pursue an art degree, i still love math.) </TEXT>
