Second the make you talk about yourself, so they can learn what a unique and special person you are.

Then they politely gave you challenges, if you pass the challenges, you get included to the gang, if you fail they say "good try, you try again next time" then they give you a hug and let you go bout your day,

like I said, pretty intense... </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the new teasers for Justice League is out and is it just me or does this movie looks so fake?


I know there's gonna be alot of CGI, but it looks like they are not even trying to make it seem like it's actually there..


It's too shiny and glow. It has this glow look that you see in most low budget tv shows special effects. it looks terrible in my opinion.

It looks too dark and similar to the 3rd act of Batman v Superman and I hated that last part.. It was Atrocious.


Justice League (2017) is a film directed by Zack Snyder, that stars Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Jason Momoa, Henry Cavill, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher. It's based on the DC characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A man is stuck in a flood.
A group of rescuers sees him and attempts to rescue him.

"We're here to save you", they said.

The man replied, "Do not worry, Jesus will save me".

As the rescuers struggles to argue with the man, he continues to denies the offer so they left him anyway.

As the man waited for a miracle from Jesus, he eventually drowned.

As he entered in heaven he asked Jesus, "Jesus, why didn't you save me?"

Jesus replied, "You idiot, I sent a group of rescuers for you, you dumbass." </TEXT>

I don't have any references, polls or numbers but in my personal opinion of what's happening in the world.

Idolism or favoritism, they could be easily manipulated with simple trigger words, also fear and such, it's not just about presidential voting, voting in general in any shape or form.

Because I feel like majority of people are dumbasses and ignorant, and just don't give a f and the ones who do give a f are in the minority.

What do the people know what's best for them? </TEXT>
