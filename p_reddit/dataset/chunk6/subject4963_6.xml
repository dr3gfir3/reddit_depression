	<TEXT> 1) The Buddha argued against a lot of Vedic practices and philosphies which Hinduism adopted to an extent.

	<TEXT> I would imagine so. The temple is Theravadan and the Theravada sect doesn't believe in celestial buddhas, so unless it's a statue of a predecessor buddha (which I don't think is that common) then it's probably Shakyamuni. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The other day my MacBook Pro Retina 13" fell off a small table onto carpet and now the display isn't working. This has happened before but last time it was just the backlight that was out and somehow it fixed itself after a few days. Now the backlight is on but it isn't displaying anything. When I plug the laptop into a TV I can see everything, so I assume it's just a problem with the screen. I've tried resetting the display drivers and everything like that and none of that is working. I want to open up the back to see if there's maybe something disconnected. If I do that would the warranty be voided? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because something is beginingless doesn't mean it's endless. My philosophy professor used an analogy with the Statue of Liberty, stating that before the Statue was built there was a beginingless absence of the Statue, but once it was built the absence was ended.  
  
In response to the rest, yeah Buddhism is pretty much the harsh truth but it's what ultimately satisfies. Continuously craving is never going to have us be satisfied, so we need to get rid of it and return no longer be bound to Samsara. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In some sects of Buddhism, deities such as Bodhisattvas and Celestial Buddhas may contact people through esoteric means. You could read the book if you are interested, however remember that the book represents a sect of Buddhism that should not be half-assed or anything like that if you want to put it into practice. If you feel like practicing the teachings in the book you should try to find a Vajrayana teacher before doing so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not too sure, I've never been able to find it in the settings. At first I thought it was just a feature with the Samsung messaging app but it also does it with Textra which I remember Textra not having this feature on my old Droid Razr M. I'm using a Verizon Note 4 by the way so maybe it's specific to this?  
  
EDIT: Apparently this used to be a setting in Textra but was taken out when Android prevented apps from controlling mobile data with Lollipop. This is not at all my experience however as I remember this feature not working on Kit Kat Textra but working with my Note 4 from Kit Kat to now Marshmallow. The setting for it is no longer in Textra however. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It helps me understand the nature of reality. The understanding of Sunyata (Emptiness) has helped me tremendously in my practice, mostly it has led me to be more compassionate. This is where the Dharmakaya comes in as it is the ultimate reality of the universe, one where all things are empty (even the Dharmakaya itself is empty). The other two bodies are bodies that one should strive for in order to help rid the world of suffering. That's how I use the bodies in my regular practice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Manjushri, the Vimalakirti Sutra features him as one of the main characters. Maitreya is also present in the sutra to an extent but not as much as Manjushri.  
  
For Avalokiteshvara, he's featured in both the Heart Sutra and some of the Lotus Sutra (I think all of chapter 25 is devoted to Avalokiteshvara in that sutra).  
  
That's all that I know off hand. Good luck!    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry about that. In Vajrayana Buddhism (a very esoteric sect of Buddhism popular in Tibet) there is the belief in different states of being known as Bardos. The Bardo of Dharmata occurs after death, and a lot of crazy stuff starts happening. If you are unaware of what is happening, you may end up causing yourself to be reborn into a lower realm (hell, preta, or animal) or miss attaining Nirvana completely and not being reborn again. Being aware in this state means realizing the nature of the forms you are experiencing, which you must realize are all subject to these three bodies mentioned in the OP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those not familiar with the iconography or can't tell from the picture, from left to right is Bhaisajyaguru (Medicine Buddha), Amitabha Buddha, and Shakyamuni Buddha.  
The Amitabha statue was the first one I got at a stand in New York City by Times Square. It was during a time when I was still exploring different religions to settle into and was torn between buying the Buddha statue and a Ganesha statue. Owning the Buddha statue gave me a lot of motivation to continue to look into the Dharma even when I highly disagreed with it. Good thing I persisted.  
  
The second one I got was the Bhaisajyaguru statue. I got it from a cheesy "Asian-stuff" store in Jersey that was just filled with a lot of dragons and New Age stuff. I asked the sales person if they had any Bodhisattva statues and he looked at me like I had two heads. I asked him instead if they had Buddha statues and he brought me over to their extensive Budai collection haha. Saw the Medicine Buddha statue off to the side with a tag saying Akshobhya Buddha. I also remember seeing a very nice Tara statue but I knew very little of Tara at the time. Despite how clueless that store was I would love to go back.  
  
The Shakyamuni statue I just received from the website Buddha Groove. I heard about it a while ago but never bothered to check what they had in store. Going on recently I saw this and for the price it was well worth it. The back has Om Mani Padme Hum printed in Tibetan.  
  
Just wanted to let you guys know haha.  </TEXT>
