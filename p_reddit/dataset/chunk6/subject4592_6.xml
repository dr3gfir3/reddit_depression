As I said before its supply/demand problem, more available workers means you don't have to try so hard to keep those you have, thus you can lower the wages.

Plus I doubt that people on h1b visa are in union or that they don't get a boot when they complain too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think anyone is trying to say that there is high unemployment, well at least I'm not trying to say that.

I just think that jobs people have right now often don't pay enough for them to have decent life. 
And when you boil it down to basics this is supply/demand problem.
The price of labor goes down if there are more laborers available, especially if these laborers have less bargaining power.

Now I don't think that those illegal immigrants/H1B visa workers are unionized, or that they are super confident in standing up to their employers. 
In fact I would think that when they complain they are told something like:"Well Raj I hate to tell you this, but there are dozens of people waiting for your place, so shut up and take that overtime or you go back to India." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computing.
These CPUs use only the most commonly used instructions with as few bells and whistles as possible. 

This allows better optimization, so as long as you want relatively simple stuff from the CPU you get potentially huge gains on performance compared to CISC (for example Pentium).

Now for most users these gains are negligible, but in industrial applications they can be critical. 

In addition the RISC CPUs have less trouble with waste heat compared to those using CISC, because of that they are heavily employed in microcontrolers, smartphones, IoT and pretty much everywhere else where you can't afford an extra fan.

Also fewer instructions mean that learning the assembly for these CPUs is relatively easy, now for most uses that barely matters but when it comes to critical (and I mean CRITICAL) applications it can be worthwhile to check what exactly did the compiler produce out of your code.

There bunch of other reasons but for me these top the list.

Dealers on concerts and other mass events are especially problematic because of inherent anonymity. 
Dealers on street usually have their territories marked out, they are part of certain hierarchy (their at the bottom BTW), and generally prefer to stay alive, which is hard to do if you kill your customers.

But even them use spiked stuff, the only difference is that they are little more careful about what are they thinning it with, a little bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's be honest with each other. 

Trump is no longer in the "right wing" territory, maybe he never was.
Right now he is firmly in the "weird" area of political spectrum.

	<TEXT> New drugs, no question, while meth, heroin, coke etc. have a lot of "testing" these things are pretty much unknown.

 Nobody knows the "safe dose", nobody knows the long term effects, how addictive it is or how high it gets you. You have equal chance of feeling the high of you live and of getting into coffin.

The reason is that "producers" of these substances are developing them as fast as possible so that governments can't ban them.
Therefore they usually just feed it to rats and if they survive they give it to few junkies desperate for anything to give them kick.

If they get high and survive for at least few days then the shit goes into production, nobody wants their customers dropping like flies but if they die later nobody cares.

	<TEXT> Well everyone benefits from GMOs so that's pretty much impossible.

But on a more serious note, it depends on what you consider independent. Is it enough when the study was not industry financed? 

And what if the researchers received grants in the past or the future form biotech companies, and what if the university got some funding from these corps around the same time.

If you want the first one that is possible, if you want the second that's pretty much impossible.
 Almost all companies that need university educated personnel are somehow engaged with universities, in order to search for talent mostly but also to pick up trends, boost their research and to get publicity. 

BTW the same goes for climate research, almost all institutions working on it are somehow connected to those who can get something from it. 
In fact same can be said about pretty much any kind of research anywhere. </TEXT>

Moravia - Margraviete/march of Moravia was administrative unit until 20th century and in the early EU4 timeline was contested between Bohemia and Hungary

Franconia/Swabia - stem duchies of HRE

	<TEXT> The thing is that nuclear bombs don't have an infinite shelf life.

In fact they degrade much faster than most people think. 
So basically you can have a lot of them on paper but when it comes to actually using them you can end up with very expensive paper weights. 

Plus the number of nuclear bombs has dropped a lot in past few decades.

Don't take me wrong it's still not the investment I would make or recommend but it's not exactly crazy either.
 
Not to mention the fact that they're high tech weapons and if you want to make them and the missiles to carry them you will need a lot of engineers and funding for nuclear RnD which is not a bad thing either.

But I'm not qualified to make that judgement.

One way or another the Treaty and Depression certainly helped Nazis a lot. </TEXT>

This was by the way the war where Charles died and that started events ending by Burgundian Inheritance.

It would be nice to have possibility of alternative outcome.
Burgundy becoming a kingdom, elector and adding its provinces to HRE. On one hand emperor would limit spread of France this way, on the other hand he would now have massive rival within the empire and ideal candidate to depose him. </TEXT>
