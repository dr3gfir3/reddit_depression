For example, Deuteronomy 18:11-12 condemns anyone who "..casts spells, or who is a medium or spiritist or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the Lord, and because of these detestable practices the Lord your God will drive out those nations before you", and Exodus 22:18 states "Do not allow a sorceress to live".  

I could give plenty more examples but you get the drift I am sure.

	<TITLE> Notes from Letters to a Young Contrarian. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-17 15:18:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I read Letters to a Young Contrarian 4 - 6 times per year, every year since I first picked it up back in 2005.  

I have several copies of the book, one of which is autographed and is quite dear to me given Hitchens' unfortunate demise.  

I'm half way through my current reading, and figured I would post my notes thus far because a lot of it is appropriate given the current US political climate. Pay close attention to what Hitchens says about polls. I'll update this thread as I continue my journey through this little pamphlet. 

I attack and criticise people myself; I have no right to expect lenience in return.  

Bill Clintons approving Presidential initials were found on a note written by his half-brother Roger, who had been engaged in trying to obtain a pardon for a drug-dealer and also engaged in explaining how hed come by a brick-thick block of travelers checks. There was the usual obfuscation about no proven quid pro quo but I noticed, in the aftermath of the Rich pardon, that it had been several months since Id been able to get into a fight over whether Clinton was a cheap crook or not. Believe me, I remember when this was otherwise.  

Adlai Stevenson once said to Richard Nixon: If you stop telling lies about me Ill stop telling the truth about you.  

So this was an amazing and wondrous month; perhaps the best of my life. (I finished my centennial study of George Orwell in the same period. Much more civilised to be writing about him than any of the above.) I tell you about it not just in order to boast, though there is that. It went to make up for many, many other months, when the celebrity culture and the spin-scum and the crooked lawyers and pseudo-statesmen and clerics seemed to have everything their own way. They will be back, of course. They are always back. They never leave. But their victory is not pre-determined. And there are vindications to be had as well, far sweeter than anything contained in the meretricious illusion of good notices or a good press.  

The noble title of dissident must be earned rather than claimed; it connotes sacrifice and risk rather than mere disagreement, and it has been consecrated by many exemplary and courageous men and women.  

When a precious and irreplaceable word like irony has become a lazy synonym for anomie, there is scant room for originality.  

Its too much to expect to live in an age that is actually propitious for dissent. And most people, most of the time, prefer to seek approval or security. Nor should this surprise us (and nor, incidentally, are those desires contemptible in themselves). Nonetheless, there are in all periods people who feel themselves in some fashion to be apart. And it is not too much to say that humanity is very much in debt to such people, whether it chooses to acknowledge the debt or not. (Dont expect to be thanked, by the way. The life of an oppositionist is supposed to be difficult.)  

The essence of the independent mind lies not in what it thinks, but in how it thinks.  

The term intellectual was originally coined by those in France who believed in the guilt of Captain Alfred Dreyfus. They thought that they were defending an organic, harmonious and ordered society against nihilism, and they deployed this contemptuous word against those they regarded as the diseased, the introspective, the disloyal and the unsound. The word hasnt completely lost this association even now, though it is less frequently used as an insult. (And, like Tory, impressionist and suffragette, all of them originated as terms of abuse or scorn, it has been annexed by some of its targets and worn with pride.) One feels something of the same sense of embarrassment in claiming to be an intellectual as one does in purporting to be a dissident, but the figure of Emile Zola offers encouragement, and his singular campaign for justice is one of the imperishable examples of what may be accomplished by an individual.  

There is a saying from Roman antiquity: Fiat justitiaruat caelum. Do justice, and let the skies fall. In every epoch, there have been those to argue that greater goods, such as tribal solidarity or social cohesion, take precedence over the demands of justice. It is supposed to be an axiom of Western civilisation that the individual, or the truth, may not be sacrificed to hypothetical benefits such as order. But in point of fact, such immolations have been very common. To the extent that the ideal is at least paid lip service, this result is the outcome of individual struggles against the collective instinct for a quiet life.  

Emile Zola could be the pattern for any serious and humanistic radical, because he not only asserted the inalienable rights of the individual, but generalised his assault to encompass the vile role played by clericalism, by racial hatred, by militarism and by the fetishisation of the nation and the state.  

Anti-Semites among our young men? They do exist then, do they? This idiotic poison has really already overthrown their intellects and corrupted their souls? What a saddening, what a disquieting element for the twentieth century which is about to dawn. A hundred years after the Declaration of the Rights of Man, a hundred years after the supreme act of tolerance and emancipation, we go back to religious warfare, to the most odious and the most stupid of fanaticisms!  

A shameful terror reigns, the bravest turn cowards, and no one dares say what he thinks for fear of being denounced as a traitor and a bribe-taker. The few newspapers which at first stood out for justice are now crawling in the dust before their readers...  

Its always as well to remember, when considering miscarriages of justice, as the authorities so neutrally and quaintly like to call them, that the framing of the innocent axiomatically involves the exculpation of the guilty. This is abortion, not miscarriage.  

Read Zola with care and you will be less astonished by the follies and crimesfrom Verdun to Vichythat later overtook France, and indeed overtook an entire Europe of show trials and camps and martial parades and infallible leaders. You will also understand better why it is that the papacy, which now seems to try again almost every day, can never manage an honest or clear statement on its history with Jews, Protestants and unbelievers. And all of this can be derived from one determined and principled individual exercising his right to say no, and insisting (as Zola successfully did) on his day, not in court as we again too neutrally say, but in the dock.  

courage is not in itself one of the primary virtues, it is the quality that makes the exercise of the virtues possible.  

Galileo may have made a discovery that overthrew the complacent cosmology of the Church fathers, but when threatened with the instruments of torture he also made a swift recantation. The sun and the planets were, of course, unaffected by this disavowal, and the latter continued to revolve around the former whatever the Vatican said. (Galileo himself, as he finished his recantation, may or may not have murmured, epur si muoveIt still does move.)  

Incidentally, it now seems more and more certain that Zola was murdered in his bed, rather than accidentally stifled by a faulty fire and a blocked chimney; further proof that great men are most frequently not honored in their own time or country.  

One of the hardest things for anyone to face is the conclusion that his or her own side is in the wrong when engaged in a war. The pressure to keep silent and be a team player is reinforceable by the accusations of cowardice or treachery that will swiftly be made against dissenters. Sinister phrases of coercion, such as stabbing in the back or giving ammunition to the enemy, have their origin in this dilemma and are always available to help compel unanimity.  

As so often, the determination of one individual was enough to dishearten those whose courage was mob-derived.  

Quite often, the baptism of a future dissenter occurs in something unplanned, such as a spontaneous resistance to an episode of bullying or bigotry, or a challenge to some piece of pedagogical stupidity. There is good reason to think that such reactions arise from something innate rather than something inculcated  

Noam Chomsky recalls hearing the news of the obliteration of Hiroshima as a young man, and experiencing the need to go off and find solitude because there was nobody he felt he could talk to. It would be encouraging to believe that such reactions are innate, because then we can be certain that they will continue to occur, and will not depend for their occurrence upon the transmission of good examples or morality tales.  

To be in opposition is not to be a nihilist. And there is no decent or charted way of making a living at it. It is something you are, and not something you do.  

I am always and at once on the defensive, for example, when people speak of races and nations as if they were personalities and had souls and destinies and suchlike.  

There is only one thing you should do. Go into yourself. Find out the reason that commands you to write; see whether it has spread its roots into the very depths of your heart; confess to yourself whether you would have to die if you were forbidden to write. This most of all; ask yourself in the most silent hour of your night: must I write? Dig into yourself for a deep answer. And if this answer rings out in assent, if you meet this question with a strong, simple I must, then build your life in accordance with this necessity  

the decision to live at a slight acute angle to society.  

But contradiction is of the essence: many of my own favorite poets in English, from Kipling to Larkin, have achieved great and splendid effects in spite of, as well as because of, their affinity with ethical conservatism, sometimes in its radical forms.  

I accept all of Rilkes implied challenges because of what he wrote about solitude, and the ways in which it must be welcomed rather than feared. In the mental and moral equipment of a radical or critical personality, this realisation is of the essence. Rilke also allows me to touch on matters such as the inevitable disappointment of religion and worship, the defining importance of language, the combat between the tribal and the cosmopolitan, the fate of MittelEuropa, the still-poisonous influence of the First World War, the effect of Freud, and the recurring importance of the ironic.  

You seem to have grasped the point that there is something idiotic about those who believe that consensus (to give the hydra-headed beast just one of its names) is the highest good.  

As a species, we may by all means think ruefully about the waste and horror produced by war and other forms of rivalry and jealousy. However, this cant alter the fact that in life we make progress by conflict and in mental life by argument and disputation. The concept of the dialectic may well have been partly discredited by its advocates, but that does not permit us to disown it. There must be confrontation and opposition, in order that sparks may be kindled.  

Tautology lurks, and waits to enclose you.  

If you care about the points of agreement and civility, then, you had better be well-equipped with points of argument and combativity, because if you are not then the center will be occupied and defined without your having helped to decide it, or determine what and where it is.  

Shoes and minds, said this sign, must be left at the gate. Laughable of course, but evil if it could be enforced, as it often was under Loyolas Jesuitical injunction Dei sacrificium intellectus; an immodest and hysterical desire to annihilate the intellect at the feet of an idol.  

The second, which is only a corollary of the first, is that we do not naturally aspire to any hazy, narcotic Nirvana, where our critical and ironic faculties would be of no use to us. Imagine a state of endless praise and gratitude and adoration, as the Testaments ceaselessly enjoin us to do, and you have conjured a world of hellish nullity and conformism. Imagine a state of bliss and perpetual happiness and harmony, and you have summoned a vision of tedium and pointlessness and predictability, such as Huxley with all his gifts was only able to sketch.  

Always look to the language.  

It is true that the odds in favor of stupidity or superstition or unchecked authority seem intimidating and that vast stretches of human time have seemingly elapsed with no successful challenge to these things. But it is no less true that there is an ineradicable instinct to see beyond, or through, these tyrannical conditions. One way of phrasing it might be to say that injustice and irrationality are inevitable parts of the human condition, but that challenges to them are inevitable also.  

On Sigmund Freuds memorial in Vienna appear the words: The voice of reason is small, but very persistent.  

there are some flashes of human intelligence that rise above the merely contrary and that can show us how some of our predecessors dealt with fiercer opposition than we face at present.  

Alain, in Martin du Gards Lieutenant Colonel Maumort says that the first rulehe calls it the rule of rulesis the art of challenging what is appealing. You will notice that he describes this as an art: it is not enough simply to set oneself up as a person who distrusts majority taste as a matter of principle or perhaps conceit; that way lies snobbery and frigidity. However, it will very often be found that people are highly attached to illusions or prejudices, and are not just the sullen victims of dogma or orthodoxy.  

If you have ever argued with a religious devotee, for example, you will have noticed that his self-esteem and pride are involved in the dispute and that you are asking him to give up something more than a point in argument.  

From this caution I pass to an observation of the late Sir Karl Popper, who could himself be a tyrant in argument but who nonetheless recognised that argument was valuable, indeed essential, for its own sake. It is very seldom, as he noticed, that in debate any one of two evenly matched antagonists will succeed in actually convincing or converting the other. But it is equally seldom that in a properly conducted argument either antagonist will end up holding exactly the same position as that with which he began. Concessions, refinements and adjustments will occur, and each initial position will have undergone modification even if it remains ostensibly the same. Not even the most apparently glacial system is immune to this rule.  

George Orwell said that the prime responsibility lay in being able to tell people what they did not wish to hear.  

John Stuart Mill (who by a nice chance was Bertrand Russells godfather) said that even if all were agreed on an essential proposition it would be essential to give an ear to the one person who did not, lest people forget how to justify their original agreement.  

Rosa Luxemburg roundly declared that freedom was first and last the freedom for those who thought differently.  

John Milton in his Areopagitica proclaimed that, whatever one believed to be the right, it should be exposed to the claims of the wrong, because only in a fair and open fight could the right claim or expect vindication.  

Frederick Douglass announced that those who expected truth or justice without a struggle were like those who could imagine the sea without an image of the tempest.  

In place of honest disputation we are offered platitudes about healing. The idea of unity is granted huge privileges over any notion of division or, worse, divisiveness. I cringe every time I hear denunciations of the politics of divisionas if politics was not division by definition.  

You should scan Brian Victorias excellent book Zen at War, which, written as it is by a Buddhist priest, exposes the dire role played by Zen obedience and discipline in the formation of pre-war Japanese imperialism.  

we are mammals, and the prefrontal lobe (at least while we wait for genetic engineering) is too small while the adrenaline gland is too big.  

If you find yourself, as Basil Davidson did, in mortal conflict with a hateful foreign occupation, then you can be forgiven for being a zealot and even criticised for not being one.  

If you want to stay in for the long haul, and lead a life that is free from illusions either propagated by you or embraced by you, then I suggest you learn to recognise and avoid the symptoms of the zealot and the person who knows that he is right. For the dissenter, the skeptical mentality is at least as important as any armor of principle.  

And it was in order to survive those years of stalemate and realpolitik that a number of important dissidents evolved a strategy for survival. In a phrase, they decided to live as if.  

Im never certain which author can claim the credit for this mild-sounding but actually deeply subversive and ironic decision. Vaclav Havel, then working as a marginal playwright and poet in a society and state that truly merited the title of Absurd, realised that resistance in its original insurgent and militant sense was impossible in the Central Europe of the day. He therefore proposed living as if  he were a citizen of a free society, as if  lying and cowardice were not mandatory patriotic duties, as if his government had actually signed (which it actually had) the various treaties and agreements that enshrine universal human rights. He called this tactic The Power of the Powerless because, even when disagreement can be almost forbidden, a state that insists on actually compelling assent can be relatively easily made to look stupid. You cant achieve 100 percent control over humans, and if you could, you could not go on doing so. It isfortunatelytoo much responsibility for any human to assume, not that this keeps the control freaks from continuing to try.  

At around the same time and alarmed in a different way by many of the same things (the morbid relationship of the Cold War to the nuclear arms race), Professor E.P. Thompson, whom I recommended to you earlier, proposed that we live as if  a free and independent Europe already existed.  

The process often involved an inversion in the usual relationship between the ironic and the literal. The People Power moment of 1989, when whole populations brought down their absurd rulers by an exercise of arm-folding and sarcasm, had its origins partly in the Philippines in 1985, when the dictator Marcos called an opportunist snap election and the voters decided to take him seriously. They acted as if the vote were free and fair, and they made it so. (The forgotten fact that the Soviet ambassador to Manila took the side of Marcos was also a portent of a kind.)  

One could add further examples. In the late Victorian period, Oscar Wildemaster of the pose but not a mere poseurdecided to live and act as if  moral hypocrisy were not regnant. In the Deep South in the early 1960s, Rosa Parks (after some arduous dress rehearsals of her own) decided to act as if a hardworking black woman could sit down on a bus at the end of the days labor. In Moscow in the 1970s, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn resolved to write as if  an individual scholar could investigate the history of his own country, and publish his findings. They all, by behaving literally, acted ironically. In each case, as we know now, the authorities were forced first to act crassly and then to look crass, and eventually to fall victim to stern verdicts from posterity. However, this was by no means the guaranteed outcome and there must have been days when the as if  style was exceedingly hard to keep up.  

I can recommend, therefore (apart from the study of these and other good examples) is that you try to cultivate some of this attitude. In an average day, you may well be confronted with some species of bullying or bigotry, or some ill-phrased appeal to the general will, or some petty abuse of authority. If you have a political loyalty, you may be offered a shady reason for agreeing to a lie or a half-truth that serves some short-term purpose. Everybody devises tactics for getting through such moments; try behaving as if they need not be tolerated and are not inevitable.  

Im no great advocate of folkloric wisdom, but this tale has stood the test because it emphasises what Orwell once said in another context: very often the hardest thing to see is what is right in front of your nose. And there is, not infrequently, a considerable social pressure not to take note of the obvious. Every parent knows the moment when children acquire the word why and begin to make use of it. I still dont know quite why the sky is blue (I did know, once, but Ive forgotten) but Ive had to find explanations for Daddy, why is that man sleeping on a grating? and for other phenomena that I had become too much used to. In societies infected by the poison of racism, it has often been children (who dont suffer innately from the infection) who have set the example. Of course, one should not idealise children, who are very suggestible and who make easy targets for indoctrination.  

You have to be sophisticated by experience before you are old enough to argue that, say, it might be wrong to launch a thermonuclear war but not wrong, indeed only prudent, to prepare the weaponry of extermination. Or that an act that would be a loathsome crime if committed by an individual is pardonable when committed by a state. But these are the rewards of maturity, to be enjoyed only as we decline.  

We are an adaptable species and this adaptability has enabled us to survive. However, adaptability can also constitute a threat; we may become habituated to certain dangers and fail to recognise them until its too late. Nuclear armaments are the most conspicuous example; as you read this you are in effect wearing a military uniform and sitting in a very exposed trench. You exist at the whim of people whose power does not derive from your own consent and who regard you as expendable, disposable. You merely failed to notice the moment at which you were conscripted. A normal life consists in living as if this most salient of facts was not a fact at all.  

Try your hardest to combat atrophy and routine. To question The Obvious and the given is an essential element of the maxim de omnius dubitandum.  

I have met many brave men and women, morally superior to myself, whose courage in adversity derives from their faith. But whenever they have chosen to speak or write about it, I have found myself appalled by the instant decline of their intellectual and moral standards. They want god on their side and believe they are doing his workwhat is this, even at its very best, but an extreme form of solipsism? They proceed from conclusion to evidence; our greatest resource is the mind, and the mind is not well-trained by being taught to assume what has to be proved.  

A true believer must believe that he or she is here for a purpose and is an object of real interest to a Supreme Being; he or she must also claim to have at least an inkling of what that Supreme Being desires. I have been called arrogant myself in my time, and hope to earn the title again, but to claim that I am privy to the secrets of the universe and its creatorthats beyond my conceit.  

Fulke Grevilles unforgettable line, Created sickCommanded to be well.  

And there are totalitarian insinuations to back this up if its appeal should fail. Christians, for example, declare me redeemed by a human sacrifice that occurred thousands of years before I was born. I didnt ask for it, and would willingly have foregone it, but there it is: Im claimed and saved whether I wish it or not. And if I refuse the unsolicited gift? Well, there are still some vague mutterings about an eternity of torment for my ingratitude. This is somewhat worse than a Big Brother state, because there could be no hope of its eventually passing away.  

In any case, I find something repulsive in the idea of vicarious redemption. I would not throw my numberless sins onto a scapegoat and expect them to pass from me; we rightly sneer at the barbaric societies that practice this unpleasantness in its literal form. Theres no moral value in the vicarious gesture anyway. As Thomas Paine pointed out, you may if you wish take on another mans debt, or even offer to take his place in prison. That would be self-sacrificing. But you may not assume his actual crimes as if they were your own; for one thing you did not commit them and might have died rather than do so; for another this impossible action would rob him of individual responsibility. So the whole apparatus of absolution and forgiveness strikes me as positively immoral, while the concept of revealed truth degrades the whole concept of the free intelligence by purportedly relieving us of the hard task of working out ethical principles for ourselves.  

You can see the same immorality or amorality in the Christian view of guilt and punishment. There are only two texts, both of them extreme and mutually contradictory. The Old Testament injunction is the one to exact an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth (it occurs in a passage of perfectly demented detail about the exact rules governing mutual ox-goring; you should look it up in its context). The second is from the Gospels and says that only those without sin should cast the first stone. The first is the moral basis for capital punishment and other barbarities; the second is so relativist and non judgmental that it would not allow the prosecution of Charles Manson. Our few notions of justice have had to evolve despite these absurd codes of ultravindictiveness and ultracompassion.  

However, along with Islam and Christianity it does insist that some turgid and contradictory and sometimes evil and mad texts, obviously written by fairly unexceptional humans, are in fact the word of god. I think that the indispensable condition of any intellectual liberty is the realisation that there is no such thing.  

Just to spice things up, some religions promise a good deal of carnal bliss and I think I have already mentioned one of the Church fathers, Tertullian, who also dangled the tempting option of viewing the torments of the damned. All this proves is that religion is man-made, and that men have created gods in their own image rather than the other way about. Only a humorless tyrant could want a perpetual chanting of the praises that, one has no choice but to assume, would be of the innate virtues and splendors furnished him by his creator, infinite regression, drowned in praise!  

Sigmund Freud was surely right when he concluded that religious superstition is ineradicable, at least for as long as we fear death and fear the darkness. It belongs to the childhood of our race, and childhood is not alwaysas Freud also helped us to understandour most attractive or innocent period.  

However, those who persecute religion are to be avoided at all costs.  

What I propose to you is a permanent engagement with those who think they possess what cannot be possessed. Time spent in arguing with the faithful is, oddly enough, almost never wasted. The argument is the origin of all arguments; one must always be striving to deepen and refine it; Marx was right when he stated in 1844 that the criticism of religion is the premise of all criticism.  

I should not even attempt to sermonise, yet I do warn you that if you feel capable of going into internal exile and living against the stream, you can expect some dark nights ofall rightthe soul. But to undertake this and then to seek external or invisible aid would surely be to miss the point. A degree of solitude and resignation is necessary to begin with. Some people cant bear solitude, let alone the idea that the heavens are empty and that we do not even succeed in troubling their deafness with our bootless cries. To be an exile or outcast on a remote shoremany minds turn away in terror and seek any source of cosiness. I can only say that, not only when it is compared to the ghastliness of Eternal Paternalism, the concept of loneliness and exile and self-sufficiency continually bucks me up. (And one might also, when confronted with this unadorned reality, learn to treat ones fellow exiles with more consideration and respect. But lets not ask for the moon.)  

An old definition of a gentleman: someone who is never rude except on purpose.  

**Public Opinion   Polling**  

Nowadays, public opinion is more smoothly and easily ventriloquised. I am sure you have had the experience of making up your own mind on a question and then discovering, on the evening news of the same day, that only 23.6 percent of people agree with you. 

Ought you to be depressed or disconcerted by this alarmingly exact dissection of the collective brain? Only if you believe that a squadron of undertalented but overpaid pseudo-scientists have truly and verifiably arrived at this conclusion. And perhapsindeed I would argue, in any casenot even then. 

I am sure that you are partially armored, as most intelligent people are, against this kind of thing. Everybody knows that the question can be loaded; everybody knows that the sample can be weighted; everbody knows that the intelligibility of the questions depends upon the commonplace and the regnant assumptions. Its a mark of sophistication to understand these things, and occasionally to announce that one distrusts or suspects them. 

However, these reservations dont amount to a serious critique. The first thing to notice, surely, is that these voyages into the ocean of the public mind are chartered and commissioned by wealthy and powerful organisations, who do not waste their money satisfying mere curiosity. The tactics are the same as those of market research; the point is not to interpret the world but to change it. A tendency to favor one product over another is something not to be passively discovered and observed but to be nurtured, encouraged and exploited. 

Thus to the consumer the polla suggestive word, by the way, and derived from the old and retrogressive head count taxmay seem like a mirror of existing opinion. But to the one who produces it, the poll is a swift photograph of the raw material to be worked upon. You may have noticed that popular opinion is not always and invariably cited by the elites. Nor is it consistently tested: I dont remember reading the findings of any poll about the tight money policy of the Federal Reserve. Who would pay (a properly sampled poll is quite an expensive business) for such a thing? No, public opinion is not usually recycled until it has been treated. Only then are people informed whether or not their own opinion enjoys the certification of being the majority or approved one. Even general elections, which are supposed to involve voting in the active voice rather than the passive one, have been increasingly compromised by passive dress rehearsals: the polls condition the poll.  

**I never met an actual living, breathing individual who had been consulted by a polling organisation**  

One must avoid snobbery and misanthropy. But one must also be unafraid to criticise those who reach for the lowest common denominator, and who sometimes succeed in finding it.  

My dear friend Ian McEwan, in his novel The Child in Time, describes a man so demoralised by tragedy and loss that he is reduced to gaping at daytime TV game shows. Seeing his fellow creatures so eager to humiliate and embarrass themselves, he evolves a name for watching the proceedings and calls it the democrats pornography. Let us then agree to judge crowds as we would individuals, and to employ no standard of criticism that we would not allow to be directed at ourselves.  

Milton Friedman might be wrong about sweat-shops and free-market opportunities, but he was not wrong to state that one man plus a correct opinion outvotes a majority.  

One is sometimes asked by what right one presumes to offer judgement. Quo warranto? is a very old and very justified question. But the right and warrant of an individual critic does not need to be demonstrated in the same way as that of a holder of power. It is in most ways its own justification. That is why so many irritating dissidents have been described by their enemies as selfappointed. (Once again, you see, the surreptitious suggestion of elitism and arrogance.) Self-appointed suits me fine. Nobody asked me to do this and it would not be the same thing I do if they had asked me. I cant be fired any more than I can be promoted. I am happy in the ranks of the self-employed. If I am stupid or on poor form, nobody suffers but me. To the question, Who do you think you are? I can return the calm response: Who wants to know?  

One last straddle of my high horse, then (a beast which, as Gore Vidal once said, one must keep tethered conveniently within reach). I offered to tell you in another time and place about my relations with old Karl Marx, and I notice you have not yet taken me up on it. But Ive always found it both fascinating and distressing that one of his best-known sayings is not one of his sayings at all. He did not say, and more to the point he did not believe, that religion was the opium of the people. What he did say, in his Contribution to the Critique of Hegels Philosophy of Right, was this: Religious distress is at the same time the expression of real distress and the protest against real distress. Religion is the sign of the oppressed creature, the heart of a heartless world, just as it is the spirit of a spiritless situation. It is the opium of the people. The abolition of religion as the illusory happiness of the people is required for their real happiness. The demand to give up the illusions about its condition is the demand to give up a condition that needs illusions. The criticism of religion is therefore in embryo the criticism of the vale of woe, the halo of which is religion. Criticism has plucked the imaginary flowers from the chain not so that man will wear the chain without any fantasy or consolation but so that he will shake off the chain and cull the living flower. You will notice the difference between these rather splendidly nuanced sentences and their consistent, unvarying one-sided vulgarisation.  

One must have the nerve to assert that, while people are entitled to their illusions, they are not entitled to a limitless enjoyment of them and they are not entitled to impose them upon others.  

Allow a friend to believe in a bogus prospectus or a false promise and you cease, after a short while, to be a friend at all. How dare you intervene? As well ask, How dare you not? Are you so sure you know better? Ask yourself this question a thousand times, but if you are sure, have the confidence and dignity to say so. Remember that saying nothing is also a decision, and that the relativists and the nonjudgmental have made up their minds just as much, if not as firmly. This is simply another way of reminding you that, if you decide to pass judgements and make criticisms and take forward positions, you both can and should expect a few hearings to convene on yourself. A welcome prospect, I trust. It certainly helps prevent the art and science of disputation from dying out amongst us.  

Noam Chomsky, a most distinguished intellectual and moral dissident, once wrote that the old motto about speaking truth to power is overrated. Power, as he points out, quite probably knows the truth already, and is mainly interested in suppressing or limiting or distorting it. We would therefore do better to try to instruct the powerless. I am not sure that there is a real difference in this distinction. Ruthless and arrogant though power can appear, it is only ever held by mere mammals who excrete and yearn, and who suffer from insomnia and insecurity. These mammals are also necessarily vain in the extreme, and often wish to be liked almost as much as they desire to be feared.  

One of the finest moments in our history occurred when Nelson Mandela was visited by the authorities who had kept him in confinement for a quarter of a century. They had been shaken by international condemnation and also by a general rising of the oppressed. The name of Mandela, which was supposed to have been buried by a long and harsh immurement, was on every lip. All right, they nervously said to him, you can go now. Youre a free man. His reply wasI am not leaving. You do not have the power to release me, least of all to release me to gratify yourselves. I shall not leave this cell until I hear that everybody else has been released, and that all the laws of the tyranny have been stricken from the books. At that moment, it was clear who held the keys. (Up until that moment, every sort of pseudo-diplomatic compromise had been proposed to allow the racist usurpers to keep at least some part of their spoil, and to save some part of their face.)

Nate caught him a few times there and he couldn't defend it too well, or as well as would be expected. Eddie caught him twice and it worked out well for him, but once Conor checked Alvarez the plan seemed to go out the window and he was like a deer in headlights. He was done. Amazing performance. Conor made it look so fucking easy, and it's not easy against Alvarez. I think this was more impressive than the Aldo KO honestly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I say "book" because it's simply three talks/lectures with a questions   answers section at the end of each talk, so from a literature perspective it's not complex at all. It's actually a really easy to understand, dumbed version if you will, comparatively speaking anyways.  

That's appropriate too, because Paine wrote in that manner, as did Orwell to an extent.  

I've seen each of the talks a few times but it's nice to have them in written form. I was actually considering putting them into writing myself so this saves the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From Hitchens:

It is perhaps a testimony to the state of affairs in France at that date that Paine did not even have access to a bible when he was composing Part One of The Age of Reason. But he knew the book well enough by heart to make very few mistakes, and was able to continue revising the work in this way while he lay in his dank cell. Upon his release, he was taken in by Ambassador James Monroe and his wife, and in their home was furnished with a bible. Part Two was finished by October 1795. It is somewhat arresting to think of a book being begun by candlelight by a hunted dissident, then updated from memory in a death cell, and finally completed in the home of a distinguished future president of the United States. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In a time when "The New World" was deeply influenced by religion, Thomas Paine was a beacon of reason. He was the first to do many things, such as demand justice for women, highlight animal cruelty, urge independence for slaves. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Thomas Paine was: 

The first to urge extension of the principles of independence to the enslaved negro; the first to arraign monarchy; and to point out the danger of its survival in presidency; the first to propose articles of a more thorough nationality to the new-born States; the first to advocate international arbitration; the first to expose the absurdity and criminality of duelling; the first to suggest more rational ideals of marriage and divorce; the first to advocate national and international copyright; the first to plead for the animals; the first to demand justice for women   

Source: https://books.google.com/books?id=Ja4FAAAAMAAJ pg=PA47 lpg=PA47 dq=thomas+paine+was+the+first+to+demand+justice+for+women source=bl ots=l0jNePvVlJ sig=Azzes1g-5aqzSJxByIi2ZQAW3wo hl=en sa=X sqi=2 ved=0ahUKEwic4qOR_vrPAhWCez4KHXMfCRAQ6AEIJzAD#v=onepage q f=false

At the time, women were deeply subjugated because of the contents of the bible, and men often had several wives. Slavery was rampant, and he highlighted the hypocrisy of christians that owned slaves as their bible said they should treat their neighbour as themselves.  

Where would we be without this man? I shudder to think. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-22 03:47:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I suppose I should preface this with the following: My grandfather was a scratch golfer and he used a 3 iron off the tee. He didn't even have a driver.  

As a bit of an experiment, and as it turns out for good reason, I stopped using my driver recently on my local course. The course really only has a few holes that are what I would call driver-worthy, but prior to getting the M2 I used to use my driver on most par 4s and all par 5s. 

I recently switched from SLDR to M2 (irons and woods), and this added quite a bit of distance. I'm not hitting the driver as well as I would like though. Initially I was hitting it great, but over time I'll screw up a drive every couple of rounds, and it can end up ruining the round for me. It's just not as consistent as I would like, and I'm probably only hitting it as far as my 3 wood from the tee. 

My 3 wood, is something I can hit perfectly every time so it makes sense to just go with that for now. With the SLDR I was lucky if I could hit my 3 wood 210 - 220 from the tee. With the M2 I'm reaching 230 - 250. My driver is going around 250 - 260. It should be going further but I just haven't mastered it yet, and at this point I'm wondering if I'll ever even bother with it. 

Anyone else ditched the driver?  </TEXT>

I played 18 today after work and shot a 71. It could have been in the 60s but I blew up on a hole as well. My back was aching me towards the end of the round (I have arthritis), it happens.

	<TEXT> It was brilliant. The "talk" lasted around two hours, was very engaging and funny, packed with loads of info. Neil reviewed the physics in a lot of mainstream movies, talking about what they got right and wrong. It was actually a very good way to connect with the crowd, and to teach science.  

There were some younger members in the audience that he really connected with as well. He did a little Q A at the end as well.  

My favourite part of the night was when he talked about being at the premiere for Contact in the 90s, and the scene where Jodie Foster tries to explain the Drake Equation but she gets the math horribly wrong. Tyson was sitting a couple of rows behind Drake who was also at the movie. He tried to get Drake's attention, and when he finally did Drake said "It's just a movie Tyson, relax." The way he told this story was hilarious.  

Overall a fantastic experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great thread, with some really solid advice. If I can offer my own experience:  

I was a 7 handicap when I played in my teens, and I gave it up 16 years ago. I played two rounds last year, and then got serious about golf in May of this year. My first round this year I shot 100, and was given a handicap of 30. It's been a quick and steady improvement since then. I managed to get out 3 or 4 times a week, while also hitting a few hundred to maybe a thousand balls at the range. That was a very good week. My wife had surgery recently so I haven't been out as much, but I everything clicked recently so I'll continue.  

For me, I had to find my old swing first. This took a lot longer than I had thought it would, and at this point my swing is completely rebuilt.... but before even shooting that round of 100 I was at the range for six weeks or so, hitting shanks and mishits galore until I started to feel semi-comfortable. I was still doing loads wrong, but I could see improvements and that's all I was looking for.  

Once I shot 100, I joined a club in NC that gives me access to 3 courses. Each is pretty unique, and none of them are starter/beginner level courses. They're all pretty difficult for different reasons, and honestly I solely believe that my progress is a direct result to each course's layout. It made me a better golfer.  

Once I joined I had a lesson, and a lot of easy fixes were applied. My grip wasn't as strong as it should be, my ball position was off, my tempo was off. By the end of June I was scoring in the 80s consistently. Every now and again I'd catch one heavy, but my swing was developing fairly well. 

Then disaster happened. I've no idea why but I didn't play for two weeks due to work and when I returned I just couldn't hit the ball anymore. Everything was slicing, even my bloody 60 degree lob wedge. Back for lessons and I was all over the place. My swing coach is one of the top 40 in the states, a great guy, and he really helped. With a lot of work, my natural shot now is a push right to left draw.  

By the end of July/start of August I was reaching into the 70s. I wasn't that consistent, I'd shoot 78 then a 95 the next time out. A lot of this was mental. I seemed to play so much better on my own than with people, because of nerves or whatever. Stage fright. It's odd I could go out with my swing coach and shoot in the 70s but if I was playing with other members it was a different story.  

I was off from August 19th to September 5th. My mother was visiting and I played every second day, and when I wasn't at the course I was at the range. Lots of iron practice, chipping, putting. I bought a new Scotty Cameron putter which changed my short game. I had a round where I three putted six times and I swore I would never use the putter again. I got the Scotty on eBay for 157 - an absolute bargain as it was brand new. I got it cut, and had weight added to it. It's one of my favourite clubs now.  

Recently I traded in my SLDR irons and woods for M2 irons and woods. I'm a low handicap now, and while the M2 irons are for higher handicap players I find them fantastic. I took 0.75" off the length, added weight so they went from C5 to D4. I did all of this myself. My swing coach thought I was nuts when we met, and he was kinda pissed a bit too because he thought it would ruin my game - I was hitting my irons fine, but I knew something just didn't feel right. I wasn't striking them as well as I would have liked. Every now and again I'd catch one heavy. Something just felt off. I'm only 5ft4 and I was convinced it was because of this.... and it turns out I was right. 

It took a few weeks to get used to the new irons but the change is insane. I played 9 holes yesterday evening after work and shot 34. I didn't have one bad shot, every shot was executed exactly how I planned it. I'm currently a 0.5 handicap and should be scratch or better soon. My aim is to play in the US Open qualifiers next year.  

In summary:  

1. Come up with a plan for when you're at the range. Look at what the professionals do when warming up before their rounds, and copy them. Do the same drills. This is extremely important. I can't play a round properly without doing this beforehand.  

2. Until you develop your swing, spend most of your time practicing irons. Do some chipping and putting too, but you need to develop your swing first. Once your swing is developed, change the focus onto your short game because that is where you'll be able to take shots off your score quickly. I spoke with Graeme McDowell about this. His advice for me was to get better from inside 100 yards. I was a 6 handicap when we spoke. He was right. I hadn't been focusing on this area enough. Now I spend about 30% on iron/woods, the rest chipping and putting. 

3. Come up with a pre-shot routine. This helps focus the mind. You'll get out of your head if you do this. I got this advice from the book Golf is not a Game of Perfect. It has really helped me. I look at where my ball is. I plan my shot - something that's equally as important. Then I go do my routine and hit it. Before this I'd get in my head and fluff shots quite a bit.  

4. Don't beat yourself up. If I play a bad shot I often laugh it off. It doesn't get me down. Bad shots are part of the game. Show me a professional that doesn't hit a bad shot. There's a reel of shanks from the Web.com and PGA Tour professionals on YouTube. Everyone does it. The PGATOUR often post "golf is hard" posts on Twitter, with golfers missing 1 foot putts, etc.  

5. Get golfballs from lostgolfballs - they're on Amazon. I picked up 250 balls for like 120 bucks. It's a bargain and when you're losing golf balls you'll need to save some cash. Believe me.  

6. Try out different courses. This will help you develop your game.  

7. Enjoy yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just had that feeling now haha. Went round 2 under on the front 9 at my home course after work today. On the par 4 7th, I laid up with my 5 wood off the tee. Left me with 87 yards (the hole is around 290), my approach shot my with approach wedge, 3/4 swing, stuck it to the pin. Took a lovely divot. It was perfect. Felt amazing. If only it was that easy every time haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure how much advice I can give. I'm married and I try to play every weekend, although work sometimes gets in the way. I did play quite a bit in July/August but slackened off some now. I plan my golf outings two weeks in advance so we don't run into issues. My wife has been confined to the house for the last six weeks so I haven't really golfed too much during that time. She's recovering from surgery but is back to work this week.  

All I can say is plan your outings and if you say you'll be x hours don't be x+2 hours if you can help it. I'd love to be at the course every single day after work but that just can't happen realistically.  

My new plan is to go on Fridays after work and go again on Sunday, giving us all day Saturday together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just came off on call for work where I had a 15 minute response time so didn't get out for nearly 3 weeks leading up to last weeken(which was hurricane Matthew weekend), so any rhythm I had is gone. Played yesterday, took me 11 holes to get going. Not the best time, but I will be back into it again soon. It's crazy how quick I lose "the touch", and I go on call every 12 weeks too so this is something I need to come up with a plan to address.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice. That's pretty sweet. I was catching my 4 iron heavy every now and again, but hitting the rest fine.... but I took off 0.75 inches and I'm still getting used to the difference honestly. Every 4th or 5th shot I'll catch thin, but holy fuck I'm hitting them further now which is really surprising. I took the length off and added more weight. My 7 iron is going around 15 yards further than it was before the change..... but yeah I'm in transition now and just need to get used to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine has to be my 7 wood. I can't recall the last time I hit a bad shot with it. I use it from 175 - 195 yards. It's a lot easier to hit than my 5 iron and 4 iron. It almost feels like cheating sometimes. The thing only cost me 80 bucks and it's one of the best investments I've ever made. If only my other clubs were as reliable. 

What's your favourite club? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry for your loss. It must be absolutely tragic for all involved. I'm glad your wife isn't blaming herself for some bullshit sleight against an imaginary god. Religion can be a sickness like that. "What have I done to upset our god enough to take our child?"... thinking like that is cancerous of the mind.  

I recently perused the story of a man that lived on The Blasket Islands off the coast of Ireland. People don't live there anymore, and he wanted to tell his tale in pen form so his story was recorded and their way of life wasn't lost forever. Such hardships, crazy poverty and the daily struggle of just trying to exist. He got his first shoes on his wedding day, to give one example. Another example is that he and his wife had 11 children, and every one of them died. Be it from famine, illness or simply an accident. One of his daughters was playing by the edge of a cliff and a bird flew into her and knocked her off. She died in front of him.  

What I mean to say is, we live like kings in comparison to the hardships that people had to go through, but the loss of a child is something that is universal. Whether it's one child, or eleven, it's something that can't be forgotten and something that will take a very long time to get through. You'll never get over it, but you'll learn to live with it in time. Be there for your wife. Don't let the loss of your child create distance between the two of you. It's OK to be sad. Be sad together. I wish you well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a huge issue, and is something I was made aware of in my teens when a fella in my school killed themselves. I'm 33 now, so it was a good while ago at this stage. Almost 20 years. He threw himself off the Cliffs of Moher, which has become a fairly common practice.

A friend of mine volunteers with Bunratty Search   Rescue, and whenever I'm home (in the states currently) I go out on the boats with them. They've saved quite a few lads over the years so this statistic could be a hell of a lot higher. The amount of people throwing themselves into the shannon river in Limerick, and all along the river bank there is on the rise as well. 

Since yer man threw himself off the cliffs, I can name close to ten people I know who've done this over the years, and I'm from a tiny town with 9,000 people living there like. It's brutal. Mostly men too although there was a couple of girls that did it too. I won't name names or provide links here because some of the families still don't want it known that it was suicide, all these years later. </TEXT>
