	<TEXT> statins work against critical cellular functions that may help control tumor initiation, tumor growth, and metastasis. Specifically, statins reduce (or block) the activity of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase and thereby reduce the levels of mevalonate and its associated products. The mevalonate pathway plays a role in cell membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression, all of which are potential areas of intervention to arrest the cancer process. 

http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/causes-prevention/risk-factors/statins-fact-sheet

Pharmacologically, statins may reduce cancer via reductions in inflammation, neovascular formation, and cell proliferation but can also inhibit selenoprotein synthesis and decrease natural killer cell function, which might enhance cancer risk.

On September 8, 2009, Swenson was part of an operation to connect the Afghan government with native elders in the Ganjgal Valley in Eastern Kunar Province in Afghanistan, near the Pakistan border.

According to the U.S. Army's detailed Official Narrative, the coalition force's 106-man column entered the valley and was ambushed at about 6 a.m. by as many as 60 insurgent fighters who soon surrounded the column on three sides, situated on terraced high ground. Within an hour, communication to the front of the column, including four U.S. servicemen, was lost. Meanwhile, Captain Swenson, who initially was positioned toward the rear of the column, called for air support, and with two comrades crossed 50 meters of open space under direct enemy fire to administer life-extending first aid to his severely wounded sergeant. When the column was surrounded by enemy fighters that advanced within 50 meters, Swenson responded to Taliban demands for surrender by throwing a hand grenade, an act of defiance that rallied his comrades to repel the enemy advance.


Swenson and comrades moved his sergeant and other wounded to a helicopter for medical evacuation before returning to the enemy's "kill zone" for at least two more trips in an unarmored vehicle to evacuate additional wounded. Returning even more deeply through the kill zone toward the location of the head of column in search of the four U.S. servicemen, Swenson's party first rescued and recovered several Afghan National Security Force wounded and dead. Finally, Swenson and a small contingent recovered the four fallen U.S. servicemen who had been discovered by a search and rescue aircraft at noon. The 6-7 hour firefight caused 15 coalition deaths, including the four U.S. servicemen; also, Swenson's sergeant, Kenneth Westbrook, died of his wounds after returning from Afghanistan. Swenson's actions are believed to have directly contributed to saving more than a dozen Afghan lives.

	<TEXT> Yeah, I should've imagined... 

I think another idea may be to have a third box - here https://www.reddit.com/r/science/submit - under 'title', 'url', where the 3rd could be something like 'post moderators' comments'. Another useful thing may be to have the source/peer-reviewed paper - and maybe the author(s)? - posted in this box, right under the title of the submission, so anyone can easily see it (instead of searching through the comments for the source).  Or just a 'standard' text-box under the title of every submission, available for mods only, where only the mods can add/edit stuff?

Studies that are in vitro are performed with cells or biological molecules studied outside their normal biological context; for example proteins are examined in solution, or cells in artificial culture medium. Colloquially called "test tube experiments"

	<TEXT> The article OP linked to is 100% free of such thing. And titles like ["Antibiotics as new cancer treatments? Conversation with schoolgirl sparks idea"](http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150128081957.htm) are not that abusive, I'd say. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have expertise on the subject. The idea is that these types of antibiotics would kill specifically those cells with huge mitochondrial activity: cancer cells in the first place, but also other stem cells in the body (that's how Chloramphenicol causes bone marrow suppression, for example) with similar mitochondrial activity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yet! there already is some data - human studies! -  suggesting that antibiotics do indeed have the ability to improve cancer patients' condition. Is just that they didn't really bother to study and to quantify the effect precisely. Also, this would apply to cancer STEM CELLS only, it won't replace chemo/radiotherapy (but should improve survival).


*Edit to add: http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150128081957.htm

In the lung cancer patients, azithromycin, the antibiotic used, increased one-year patient survival from 45% to 75%. Even lymphoma patients who were 'bacteria-free' benefited from a three-week course of doxycycline therapy, and showed complete remission of the disease.
