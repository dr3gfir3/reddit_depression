http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05226

25 out of the total 118 (21%) ministers in government were in the House of Lords. 

This compares to 23% at the start of the 2015 Cameron administration and 20% at the start of the 2010 Coalition Government. 

That's pretty fair representation across three governments...

Mind you, that still requires that you not consider their role in Parliament as somehow "part of government" in the first place. 

Fortunately I spent about ten seconds glancing at your comment history... and before this lovely chat you mostly seem to be telling people to shut up or fuck off. Bit out of your depth here, aren't you? </TEXT>

Also as expected, sadism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism scores were positively correlated with self-reported enjoyment of trolling, all rs  .37 (see Table 1), even when controlling for overall Internet use, all rs  .39. Narcissism, in contrast, was not correlated with trolling enjoyment, but was instead positively correlated with enjoying debating issues important to them. Vicarious sadism was similarly positively correlated with enjoyment of debating, while enjoyment of chatting was negatively correlated with psychopathy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If cost were not an issue? Yeah, I think it would be doable, as others have said there are a lot of materials that are technically available which might not commonly be used due to expense. The problem is that most of them would be unproven due to expense or rarity too, so who really knows?

I mean... I personally think that you could probably roll out something very like MBT armor, only thicker and designed more with resistence to corrosion and erosion in mind rather than anti-tank weaponry, and probably expect it to last for a long damned time. 

You'd need some incredible stone/earth-works to make sure the land wasn't simply buried in dust/sand, and you'd need to pick a spot like... Arizona.

But yeah, it's doable, and although it's not exactly about in habitability, the considerations of long-lasting structures are not new. http://www.wipp.energy.gov/picsprog/articles/wipp%20exhibit%20message%20to%2012,000%20a_d.htm </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To the best of anyone's ability to measure, the universe appears to be flat to an incredibly fine degree, that's why. When you measure the angle subtended by two intersecting lines you would expect differences if the underlying geometry of the universe were positively or negatively curved, vs. flat. 

Measurements so far support a very nearly flat universe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's an old term which describes particular percentages of gold vs. other metals used to alloy it. 


999.999six nines fine: the purest gold ever produced. Refined by the Perth Mint in 1957.[3][4]

999.99five nines fine: the purest type of gold currently produced; the Royal Canadian Mint regularly produces commemorative coins in this fineness

999.9four nines fine: e.g., ordinary Canadian Gold Maple Leaf and American Buffalo coins

99924 karat, also occasionally known as three nines fine: e.g., Chinese Gold Panda coins

995: the minimum allowed in Good Delivery gold bars

990two nines fine

986Ducat fineness: formerly used by Venetian and Holy Roman Empire mints; still in use in Austria and Hungary

958.323 karat

91622 karat: historically the most widely used fineness for gold bullion coins; currently used for British Sovereigns, South African Krugerrands and American Gold Eagles

900one nine fine: mostly used in Latin Monetary Union mintage (e.g. French and Swiss "Napoleon coin" 20 francs)

83420 karat

75018 karat

62515 karat

58514 karat

41710 karat

3769 karat

3338 karat

With the number to the left being the percentage of pure gold out of 1000, so 750 (18 Karat) = 75% pure gold by weight.
