	<TEXT> Niagara Falls, NY. July-August, 2001.  We were standing at on of the viewing platforms looking around with a set of binoculars and my cousin says "Hey, what's that blue thing? It looks like a bumper from a car."  Turned out to be a person in a blue track suit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing about anything I said was "thoughtless".  

Anyone that wants to spend their time worrying is more than welcome to.  If you live is South Korea or Japan, then you probably should worry.  But I'm not going to worry about something that won't do me any harm. What am I going to do about South Korea and Japan? I could contact my congressmen to let them know I feel like we the US should protect them, but that'll only get you so far (nowhere to be exact).  And they're probably going to do that anyway.

I just want all the people that are giving me a hard time to understand that I'm not a fearful person. I haven't been for a long time. If you stare down death long enough, you realize that there are times that you can't win, so it's best to let your mind rest. You can drive yourself mad with fear and worry over things beyond your control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. No. You see it on tv and say "oh man... I hope they stay safe over there."  But it does not affect your life unless you DECIDE to let it.

2. I have felt 0 economic repercussions from the Iraq "war".  I make money, I spend money, the world keeps spinnin'.

3. If you're not living in the area they occupy, a soldier in said territory, and have no soldiers in your family, then the soldiers are not affecting you.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course it's not, because it would prove my point.  You're getting awful worked up over a "random internet person"  Whether these affect you or not isn't an opinion, it's a fact, and they either do or they don't. The examples you gave DON'T or very rarely affect you.

If you're going to mention the fact that I told you to shut the fuck up, then you should also mention the fact that I am deeply sorry if you have lost any family to war. You can't pick and choose like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I'm sure you you're just a saint now... One that only has the well being of others on his mind 24/7...

I am a 23 year old firefighter.  I've helped more people in the last year than some lazy asshole like you will help in your lifetime.  I've SEEN death. I've listened as people begged for their lives. I've heard screams fade to silence. Maybe that's what you need to learn what "affect" really means. 

So, fuck off. I've said my piece and I'm not going to listen to your bullshit anymore.

	<TEXT> 1. The war is funded with taxes that you pay anyway. 

2. National debt is just something that is there, we are seldom in the black. It only affects you when they raise taxes, and only if they raise taxes that apply to you.

3. How about those people? Were you one of them? Were any of them family members? If you answered "yes" to the last two questions, then I am deeply sorry and the war HAS affected you. If you answered "no" to the last two questions, then sit down and shut the fuck up. 

I'm talking effects that affect the way you live. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ways you're "affected" aren't personal! They're choices you make.  You could cut all ties to it if you wanted, but the truth is you'd rather act/feel like it affects you so you have something to complain about and something to connect yourself to for attention.

Tell me. You live your life differently because of soldiers dying overseas? I don't think you do. You live your life differently because your neighbor lost a family member? Nope. You mourn and go right back to your everyday life. 

I'm a firefighter. 343 firefighters died on 9-11. That sucks. But I still live the same way I did when they were alive. I haven't lost anything.  I feel for those that lost family, but I haven't been personally affected by it.  Just because you're surrounded by something doesn't mean you're affected by it.   </TEXT>

Where did I say that other countries didn't matter?  I answered OP's question with my opinion. Others seem to agree.  What good does fear do you? Not a fucking thing.  Yup, that'll suck if NORTH KOREA makes the decision to make innocent people suffer. I can't stop them and I refuse to fear a "bully" that thinks he's stronger than he actually is. </TEXT>
