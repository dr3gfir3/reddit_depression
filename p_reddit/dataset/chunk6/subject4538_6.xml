	<TEXT> Alright, in the past couple years I've been seeing a lot of [these](http://www.tomboyfemme.com/image/110844588804) kinds of shirts, but I have no idea how/where to buy them! Specifically the button down, short sleeve, rolled up, slim fit style I seem to see on so many cute girls but never in stores. I'm kinda small (110, 5'4) especially when compared to most guys, but it seems like the style of the shirt is made for males? So I was thinking probably have to buy xs or xxs, but again, I don't know that many retailers that sell clothes ~for men~ but small enough to fit me.

Anybody have any tips on where to buy these shirts? Or if you happen to own one, where'd you buy it? :p </TEXT>

My parents were saying the same kind of stuff op was hearing, about how I ought to go to a state university, but I keep hearing so many horror stories about student loan debt. Plus, it's not like a dental hygienist makes a ton of money - it'd take a while to pay off those loans. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's one of the more affordable options in my life right now. I'm a 17 year old girl, a senior in high school. I'd like to find some kind of a job in finance, but I'm not sure what kinds of jobs I could honestly get with just an associate's from a community college. Everyone else is going to big state colleges to get bachelor's degrees, but it's so expensive. I've struggled with depression as well and I don't want to put myself in a situation where I could put myself in debt and add more financial strain to myself and my parents' lives. Does anyone have advice for me? Or if you know of  a sub that would be better-suited for this kind of post, that'd be cool too.

Edit: Another option is becoming a nurse. The college is accredited and offers an associates in nursing, so that's something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Freshman and sophomore year of high school was filled with busy work. So much grammar, readings, analyses, essays, and worksheets for each class. 3 to 4 hours a night was normal. Junior year, you were finally allowed to take real AP classes (other than AP Government and AP World History), so the intense kids would take 4 to 5 APs while normal kids would take 1 or 2. At that point, homework was minimal - most of your time was spent studying for upcoming tests. Senior year is chill right now - minimal homework and tests. I rarely get homework, and when I do it can usually be done within an hour. The teachers know we're burnt out so they don't assign us much. It's relaxing.  </TEXT>

In the comments a couple people discussed how the painter was believed to have synesthesia, or possibly extra rods or cones in his eyes that allowed him to see "hidden" colors. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I messed up with my dad. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-25 14:25:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been ignoring my AP Spanish online class for a while, and my grade slipped because I've barely turned anything in. It was at an 81 for a while but now it's a 54 because the teacher (rightfully) put in lots of zeros. If I actually buckle down and work, I can bring it up to a 70 and it'll be okay, but that's not the part that scares me. They sent an email to my dad saying my grade was below a 75 and that I haven't logged on since 15 days ago. I've been lying to him about that. I said my work was on time and that everything was okay because that's easier. It's not even that I don't understand the class - I just feel so unmotivated and I didn't understand the directions for a lot of the projects, so I didn't do them. I sent the teacher several emails for clarification, but she never replied.


I messed up. All the trust and good feelings I've had with my dad are gonna be gone. We went so long without arguing. He's gonna say how I don't love him and how I'm so selfish, and I'l take it. He talks about dying sometimes. He jokes sometimes that we'll have to cremate him in the oven because he doesn't want us to spend money on him. He wants to die in ten years and I say I'm okay with it but I'm really not, which is also selfish. My grandma's dying so mom is stressed too, and he'll say I don't love her either, which is kinda true, but that's neither here nor there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some background before I start: I'm 18, female. For the past couple years, I've had relationships with a couple girls and slept with them - it was great. Thing is, in the past year or so, I've started to become really attracted to older guys. Like, fantasizing about them and everything. And I feel so embarrassed!! Guys that are in their 30s and 40s - they're so much older and mature than me. I know I could never have a relationship with a man thats so much older, but a casual thing or one-night stuff would be nice. I dunno. Is it normal to feel like this though? Do other people feel like this too?I feel like I'm some kind of old man pervert :o </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, smoking weed isn't good for you. Inhaling any kind of smoke isn't healthy, and shouldn't be touted as a miracle cure. Thing is, there are promising studies on the effects of THC on the brain and body, so really, vaping should be encouraged instead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the first (and only time, for a while) that I ate honey was with chicken nuggets when I was little. So now whenever I taste honey in some drink or dessert, no matter how fancy it is, I just automatically think of mcnuggets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally get you - it's sad :(. This is why I don't call myself a feminist anymore. It feels like the name's been taken over by people who think women are better than men, or fat women are better than skinny, and etc, when that's not the case at all. I don't want to associate myself with a group like that. I want women to be able to drive cars and vote everywhere, and men to be able to file a rape claim and not be laughed at or ignored. That's what real feminism is - complete equality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of those dope ones with the weird little brown rhombus thing in the upper middle. It doesn't have to be new or anything - if anyone has a used one, even if it's got a hole or two in it, I'll gladly take it. They look so cool :D  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone know of a song with this lyric? For context, my dad listened to it on a record in the 1960s/70s in Qubec, Canada. We've been trying to find the rest of the song on the internet for the past couple years, but no luck. X-posted from r/self. </TEXT>
