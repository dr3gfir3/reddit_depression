	<TEXT> A photo gallery app that shows all your media in a timeline view similar to how Google Photos or Photo Station shows it.

eg: [image](https://i0.wp.com/www.eteknix.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Synology-DSM6-SS-PhotoStation-1.jpg?resize=800%2C570) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I'm currently on a Synology OS box, however I'm looking towards moving to a more open source solution as the default suite of apps don't have privacy in mind. In particular their Photo Station app (photo gallery) which forces you to store all your media unencrypted.

Can you guys let me know which open source apps you use for your photo galleries? </TEXT>
