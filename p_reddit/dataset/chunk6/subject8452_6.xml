	<TEXT> Never tried it, could work.

I'm at 30 Degrees south, coastal Australia, It's coming into our Autumn (Fall) here. I am planting out some 5yr old trees that I have had in pots, these come from seedlings under a mates trees just down the road from me. Flat land grown Coffee needs water/shade. 

Most of the plantations here don't/won't sell green beans preferring to value add by roasting/grinding. A kilo of decent Coffee beans typically sells for $40AUD.

My mate got 17.5kg of green beans last year, has a husker and a small electric roaster. He dry processes the beans. They (Coffee) don't really do well in pots. I have about 12 plants to  put in and some 20 odd seedlings started. 

There is a small plantation about 2km north of me as the crow flies, which won several awards but has problems as Coffee is a labour intensive crop, Pick/Process/Husk/Roast/Grind. 

It costs too much to pay manual pickers here in Australia, the Blueberry farms in the area pay around $24 AUD an hour/*Most pickers seem to be Korean/Taiwanese students and a few Pacific Islanders on temp work visas. Blueberries are basically Pick/Pack, the largest place packed 52 Metric tons in a week a month or so ago for export and domestic.

That said, it's been a very hot Summer with temps above 40 degrees Centigrade on quite a few days and this last week we have had over 300mm of rain. They don't work if it's too hot or raining, neither do I  :)

Edit: Added Metric to 52 tons. I'll let you guys do  the conversions.

Yes you can

You could also have looked this up yourself.

The trade-off for Sydney is more rain, with twice the amount of annual rainfall than Melbourne
