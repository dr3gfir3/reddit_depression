	<TEXT> "Cast more black people, but only in roles I approve of."

I saw this very article on my FB feed today. SLJ is literally the worst actor she could have picked for this rant. You'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't know who he is, and I think it's safe to say most people think he's awesome. Not only that, he's the most profitable actor of all time (all the movies he's been in add up to the largest total revenue). Casting him is a massive benefit to a movie, not something a director will begrudge. Shit, he's sometimes the only good part of a movie. And what does she think will happen? That by playing a villain everybody will suddenly hate him and then infer all black people must be evil tentacle monsters? I'm sorry, maybe my whiteness is blinding me, but I don't see the harm here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love Kubrick, but I absolutely hate that Halloran got killed in the movie. After reading the book and finding out he lives, it just feels like a cheap joke. </TEXT>
