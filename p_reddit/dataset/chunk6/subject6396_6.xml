	<TEXT> For those of you that are interested, I wrote about Inca stonemasonry over at /r/badhistory about a year ago. These blocks are not as impressive or labor intensive as you may think. They are fairly easy to shape and the closefittedness of the blocks only extends a few centimeters from the surface. There are big gaps and spaces on the other side of the wall.

	<TEXT> Well thanks. I felt bad for the OP because I couldn't find an answer for him and his question was gaining traction. I thought the least I could do is provide a different avenue into answering his question.

I don't know if you saw RioAbajo's post on the variability in the Maya hieroglyphic writing, but he is correct that words can be spelled a number of ways. I do wonder, however, are any of these alternate spellings actually typos? I guess the fact that no one has documented typos on stone monuments may attest to how careful the sculptors were in making these things. You combine that with the fact that there are very few large stone carvings and typos may not be found. Take Copan's hieroglyphic staircase. If you make a typo, all you have to do is swap out the stone block that makes the stair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maya writing is largely syllabic based with pieces of glyph elements combined together to form a word. The Maya also made use of glyphs called logograms. Logograms are glyphs that comprise an entire word, but are not made of the syllabic elements (though some may have syllabic elements incorporated into the design, like a T-shape ik sign for wind on the cheek of a person). Take Wikipedia's examples for jaguar. You have this logogram for jaguar or [b'alam](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/50/Balam_1.svg/200px-Balam_1.svg.png). Then take the [syllabic spelling](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Balam_2.svg/270px-Balam_2.svg.png) composed of three elements, ba (leftmost sign), la (top sign], and ma (bottom sign).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Weren't Mayan glyphs painted?

Not always. On ceramics or on plaster surfaces the glyphs could be painted, but they could also be incised on ceramics or moulded with plaster. The more famous examples of hieroglyphs carved into stone would be the stela the Maya erected around their sites to commemorate their kings or Copan's [hieroglyphic staircase](https://decipherment.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/dsc_0136.jpg). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Abrams uses the formula `m^3 /p-d = Q x (1 / (L/V + L/V') ) x H` after Aaberg and Bonsignore (1975) where Q = the quantity per load, L = lead or transport distance (kilometers), V = velocity (loaded), a constant of 3 km/h, V' = velocity (unloaded), a constant of 5 km/h, and H = hours worked per day 

Q for tuff is assumed to be a 22 kg load. The density for tuff is 1 m^3 weighs 1836 kg. A 22 kg load would equate to 0.01 m^3 .

L is the distance to the quarry. The tuff quarry at Copan is located 1 kilometer north of the Main Group. 

Abrams does not say, but I believe he uses a 5 hour work day.

Plugging this all in you get 0.09375 and Abrams rounded up to the nearest tenth of a meter.

The weight of the material is divided by the output to get the amount of days required to transport the material.

	<TEXT> Thank you for pointing out that I messed up the square centimeters. I also misread Abrams' unit for the rate of work. Most rates of work are expressed in p-d (person-days), but the rate of work for sculpting complex designs was in p-h (person-hour). I edited my post to reflect these changes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I have to admit, I was quite surprised by how quick that is. 

Apologies, it was 89 cm^2 per hour, not per day. I'm so use to seeing p-d (person-day) that I did not notice the d was an h. Also I bungled the amount of square centimeters by a lot to my shame. I fixed the rate of work in my post above.

 Does Abrams offer any comparison to the labor required to procure the substrate (i.e. quarry, transport, and shape the stone before fine carving)?

To procure tuff, Abrams uses the rate of 750 kg a day assuming a five hour work day. 

To transport the tuff, the output is 0.1 m^3 per trip. This is due to the weight of tuff and the distance from the source. So 183.6 kg of tuff would require 1836 days to move. 

For dressing masonry, the rate of work is 1 m^3 per 11.6 days.

Masonry walls that averaged 25 cm thick were able to be constructed at a rate of 0.8 m^3 a day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw this question posted awhile ago and did some hunting on Google Scholar. Unfortunately, I could not find anything that discusses ancient Maya typos. What I can tell you, though, is how much labor may have gone into carving hieroglyphs into stone.

Elliot Abrams is an archaeologist who really pioneered the study of architectural energetics. Architectural energetics is the study of labor through an analysis of a building. You measure a building, find the volume of materials needed to construct the building, and use rates of work taken from replicative experiments to estimate the amount of time it took to procure construction material, transport the material, and ultimately construct a building. This is what my thesis is on, but I will stick to Abrams' case study.

In Abrams' career he has examined numerous buildings at the site of Copan, Honduras. In his 1994 book *How the Maya Built Their World*, Abrams examined residential structures that ranged from a palace for Copan's 13th king to small platforms used by commoners to construct perishable buildings. For Abrams' analysis of the palace, labeled Structure 10L-22, Abrams had to estimate the amount of labor it would take to create the decorative sculpture found at the palace. The sculpture found at the palace ranged from simple decorative elements like bars and dots to more complex designs like glyphs and faces. 

To create a rate of work, Abrams employed a part-time sculptor from the town of Copan. Using stone tools and locally quarried tuff, a light, porous rock formed by consolidation of volcanic ash that hardens when exposed to air, used in the construction of Copan's buildings, Abrams found that the sculptor was able to replicate complex designs like glyphs and faces at a rate of 89 cm^2 an hour. So, if you had a wall that was 2.5 m high by 5 m wide (125,000 cm^2) and a sculptor worked eight hours a day, it would take a sculptor 175.56 days to carve. This assumes the sculptor made no mistakes and knew what he wanted to write beforehand. This rate of work would change depending on the material and skill of the sculptor.

I know this is only a partial answer and may be less than satisfactory, but perhaps it provides a sense of scale and time needed to create such things like hieroglyphs on a wall.

	<TEXT> I thought this was a neat article. While the translation of the inscription is still being worked out, the inscription seems to indicate that a royal family moved to the site of Nim Li Punit. Whether this was the original owner of the pendant or a descendant is uncertain since the pendant was found in a dedicatory offering rather than with the remains of a person. The T-shape of the pendant, which resembles the glyph ik for wind, its inscription, and a ceramic vessel found with the pendant seems to indicate this pendant was associated with the wind god and possibly the need for rain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This answer depends on where you live since each country can be different. If you are in the U.S., you would attend a university with an anthropology department that has faculty who are archaeologists. You cannot really study just archaeology by itself since the field is a sub-field of anthropology in the U.S. You can, however, focus your studies on archaeology. You should do your best to try and narrow your interests in archaeology to a particular culture, region, or time period and choose your school that fits with those interests. If you are interested in Classical Greece, you do not want to necessarily go to a school that focuses on 19th century frontier archaeology in Nevada.

You would not be trained for the job by attending classes at a university. For archaeological work you would have to attend a field school. You may have to pay out of pocket for the field school or you can earn credit towards graduation by attending a field school through your university. The sooner you can attend a field school, the better. Sometimes people who get their BA and then do a field school realize they hate field work. They then have to try and salvage what they learned getting their degree to get a job doing something else.

To actually go out and do archaeology, you have one of two routes. You can simply get your BA in Anthropology, attend a field school, and look for work at CRM (Cultural Resource Management) company. At CRM company you will be doing survey work and salvage excavations in areas where people wish to build highways, construct things, mine, drill for oil/gas, etc. There's not much research involved. In order to get ahead in CRM company you would have to get at least a Master's degree. To get on top you may need a PhD.

The other route for archaeology is academia. In academia you can conduct research on topics that may interest you, but you have to contend with the academic world. To get there you need to get a PhD. Anything less will not suffice. Even if you get a PhD, there is no guarantee you will find a university or museum position. If you are lucky enough to get a position, you then have to teach classes, write for grant money, and publish frequently enough to not be fired. During all of those activities you have to try and squeeze in time for fieldwork and data analysis. If you go the academic route you should know that archaeology is what you want to do and be sure about it. It is a big commitment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one has mentioned it yet, but get a snow blower or [snow scoop](http://www.silverbear.biz). Houghton averages 218 inches of snow a year. You won't survive with just a simple shovel, especially if you have to clear a driveway. Also, keep a large bag of kitty litter and some hard sticks of wood to wedge under your tires in your trunk in case you get stuck.

Personally, I think the best pasties in town are from Roy's. So if you want to try a pasty, I suggest to go to there.

The most stand-offish people tend to be Apostolic Lutherans. They are a Christian sect that are unfriendly to those who don't go to their church. They tend to be mostly blonde haired and blue eyed, drive around in big vans, and have a dozen kids. You have to be friendly to them, though, because they control some businesses in town. Most of us are friendly. Just complain about the weather, ask how the Packers are doing, ask if someone bagged a deer and how many points it had, and inquiry about the area's history. You will get a lot of people asking "What the heck are you doing up here?"

If you want to go thimbleberry picking the best spots are along snowmobile trails, but you have to fight people for them. The Jam Pot up near Copper Harbor and the Jam Lady in Eagle Harbor pay big bucks for the berries to make into jam. It took me hours and tons of driving around this summer to get enough to make a pie.

For outside activities, rock hounding and metal detecting is fun. Agates are the most popular stone to find on beaches as well as green stone. Personally, I've been on the lookout for datolite. The mineral museum has some great specimens. As for metal detecting, hunting for native copper in and around old mining rock piles is fun. Sometimes you can find some huge chunks. Be careful when detecting, though. There are lots of unsealed mine pits and shafts and you don't want to fall through. You also don't want to uncover any copper tools in Old Copper Complex Native American burials and have to deal with NAGPRA.

	<TEXT>  If I understand this correctly, I suppose this slightly supports Richard Neave's ideas about Luzia, which was rubbished by another team who thought she fit within the normal range of Native Americans.

I'm not familiar with this.

 Would this not also mean the Clovis first hypothesis is on even shakier ground?

Clovis first has been a dead hypothesis for a couple of decades now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Natural foods can contain toxic chemicals. It depends on what is in the soil and what the plant is able to absorb and store in its leaves, seeds, fruit, etc.

Take tobacco, for instance. The plant easily absorbs heavy metals from the ground and stores the metals in its leaves. Even if you add no additives to the tobacco, the heavy metals will be released when you smoke the leaf. Those metals can and do increase your chances of cancer.

Or, take tomatoes for a plant you eat. Normally you eat the fruit of the plant and avoid the leaves or stalk. Why? Well, tomato leaves contain alkaloids and if you eat enough of the leaves, you'll die. Tomatoes are natural, yet they can kill you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  even if it was NA why do we allow religious superstition to dictate what we can and can't study?

Because anthropologists study humanity and part of that study is to respect other people's beliefs and customs. The Native Americans in the region, who share a genetic link to Kennewick Man, believe that the dead should stay buried and their bones unmutilated. As anthropologists we must respect that belief. 

 I just was not convinced (nor do I think the professor's were set in stone on the issue) that tribal interests always come first on this kinda thing.

That is somewhat disappointing that you cannot see the point of view of Native Americans. How would you feel if Russia invaded the US, systematically attacked Americans, and did everything else in their power to destroy your culture, history, and beliefs? Would you want them to dig up your family's remains and perform tests on them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Because apparently we think the Bering Strait hypothesis is too late. 

It's not too late. The Bering Strait is the point of origin, that's not disputed. What is too late is the ice free corridor that was hypothesized to allow people to freely move from Alaska, through Canada, and into the US. Instead, the current hypothesis is that people traveled along the coast (possibly by boat) which accounts for their rapid dispersal to places like Monte Verde as early as 18,000 to 14,000 BP. This also takes into account the lack of an ice-free corridor. Multiple waves are also hypothesized with very early and later dispersals, though genetic work is both [clarifying](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep16462) and [obscuring](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/48/17060.abstract?sid=44e3778e-32b1-4fd6-b246-4a31950648ce) that picture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cultivation is different from domestication. You can cultivate wild plants and animals without domesticating them. The Maya, for example, had great pens full of deer at Mayapan to create a steady source of meat, leather, and bone. That does not mean that the Maya domesticated the deer.

The deeper time use of plant cultivation makes sense because domesticated plants do not pop up out of nowhere. It takes many years, decades, centuries, or even millennia before a plant is suitable to widespread adoption for agriculture. Maize is a good example. It went from [teosinte](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k3WhlO8mQNo/UlqIseUIztI/AAAAAAAABeA/7gE5RQT9heA/s1600/Maize-teosinte.jpg) pictured on the left to the cob we know now on the right over the course of thousands of years. And teosinte is not a plant you want to try and eat. The seeds are hard and do not produce a good flour. You can pop them, but the popped kernels are gross. There's not much you can do with it until you get to the middle stage and even then, you'll notice that the kernels are not as large or flesh as our modern cobs.

Seeing as how the Neolithic Revolution was a widespread transition from largely hunting-gathering to farming, I would say the dates are just fine where they are at. Hunting-gathering does not interfere with people creating gardens or experimenting with plant cultivation in their spare time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really know of one. So many factors were at play at play at colonization that to have a book explore each and every thing would create a massive tome. 

For example, you had the condition of Spain at the time after expelling the Moors, you had the Ottomans restricting trade along the Silk Road, you had competeting with other countries to make trade deals or find new trade routes, you had the history of diseases in Europe and how they passed from wild and domesticated animals to humans, you had the role of human agency making decisions about colonization and how to interact with Native Americans, etc. 

And that's just Europe. The same things could be applied to the Americas to understand its history and how it developed and why it developed the way it did. By the time you finished writing said hypothetical book, new research would have come out that changed the way the past is viewed and interpreted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It probably isn't recent. It might instead be very old and was introduced prior to paleoindians migrating into the Americas. 2% of Neanderthal and/or Denisovan DNA is present in some people and that DNA is tens of thousands of years old. I think this 2% indicates a common point of origin for both South American and Australoid populations. Perhaps this common origin split with one group going to southeast Asia and the other heading northeast towards the Bering Strait. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Xavante, Surui and Karitiana people of Brazil all have Australoid (specifically, Australian or Papua New Guinean) descent.

Before you make such grand claims, you should specify two things.

 "We don't know the order, the time separation or the geographical patterns," said Skoglund.

 "About 2 percent of the ancestry of Amazonians today comes from this Australasian lineage that's not present in the same way elsewhere in the Americas," said Reich.

[source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150721134827.htm)

So it's not a significant amount of ancestry and without knowing the time depth, it could be a relatively recent addition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are correct that most epidemics experienced by New World peoples came from the Old World. But as anthropology_nerd discusses in her [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/badhistory/comments/2cfhon/guns_germs_and_steel_chapter_11_lethal_gift_of/) over at /r/badhistory, many of the diseases may not have come from domesticated animals, but wild animals. Buffalo, antelopes, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs can all carry the measles and pass them onto people just as easily as cattle. Tuberculosis could have come from deer, llamas, pigs, cats, coyotes, and rodents. The same TB that infects people was even recovered from a 17,000 year old North American bison and may indicate the presence of TB in the New World long before the arrival of Europeans. And the list goes on.

So take Diamond's work with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

From the context, his troubles sounds like an STD from the "infected females" referenced by the first doctor. In the movie scene the doctor on screen is diagnosing the glaucoma as a result of Bill's earlier STD infection.

I'm sorry if I did not make this very clear in my question. And my question is not about the treatment of glaucoma with a hot wire, but whether STDs were treated with a hot wire inserted into the penis. </TEXT>

In the movie the doctor is telling Bill that his glaucoma is somehow linked to his proximity to "infected females". They just don't discuss what the infection is exactly. I assumed they were talking about STDs and that an STD was the purported to be the cause for the glaucoma.

	<TEXT> Not much in the way of history or archaeology has really explored chilis in Aztec society or Mesoamerica as a whole. That is changing, but the change is slow.

In the Florentine Codex, Sahagun does describe the chilis consumed by the Aztecs in the context of the good and bad chili seller. Chilis in Aztec cuisine came in all manner of shapes, sizes, colors, tastes, origins (Huaxteca, Michoacan, and Atzitziuacan for example) and spiciness (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 67-68). However, Sahagun makes no mention whether spiciness was the most important factor. Instead, chilis were seen as a way to bring out the flavor of foods as salt does. Even the foliage of the chili plant was eaten since it lacked the alkaloids in the leaves like the tomato.

While food can be spicy and the capsaicin levels do have curative properties, it does not seem that challenging each other to eat super spicy food was much of an activity in Aztec society. Such curative properties include treating "roughness of the face". First the face is washed with hot urine and then it is smeared with powdered yellow chili. The yellow chilli is allowed to dry and when the powder falls off the face is again washed with urine or wormwood. This is followed by drinking the sap of the herb called *tlatlauhqui* which will then be urinated out. As one urinates out the herb the urine may be red in color, full of pus, or even contain kidney stones. After the body is purged the person can only drink water and must avoid pulque and spoiled fatty food (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 143). 

Chilis were also used to treat tooth infections. The person first mixes pine resin and ground *conyayaoal* worms together and then applies this paste to the surface of the tooth. Next the person places a heated chili onto the surface of the tooth followed by salt. After that the gums are pricked and the herb *tlalacauatl* is applied. Sahagun says that if this does not work the tooth is removed and salt is packed into the tooth socket (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 146).

Chilis were also combined with chocolate, *tlilxochitl*, *vei nacaztli*, liquid ruber, *mecaxochitl*, and water to cure a person if they are spitting up blood. You can also drink the chocolate and herbs in pulque, but you must not include the liquid rubber or chilis (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 154).

Chilis were also used to cure people from being struck with a lash or stick. On the swollen and or welted flesh *pozaulizpatli* is smeared on. After that, the person must go into a sweat bath where the person drinks a mixture of *iztac patli*, *chichipiltic*, chilis, and pulque. This mixture will apparently circulate the blood and help cure the person (Anderson and Dibble 1961: 162).

The spiciness of chilis were sometimes used to inflict pain on people. In order to discipline a particularly unruly child, parents would hold the heads of their child above a [small fire that was burning chilis](http://www.mexicolore.co.uk/images-6/680_05_2.jpg). The capsaicin would mix with the smoke and create a sort of tear gas which the child would inhale and get into their eyes (Berdan and Anawalt 1997: 161).

The use of chili smoke was even used against the Aztecs by the lords of Cuetlaxtlan in a conflict. The Tlaxcalans had convinced the Cuextlaxtlan lords to rebel and kill the Aztec governor, which they did. And when messengers arrived to Cuextlaxtlan to ask why the lords had not given tribute, the lords put the messenger in a sealed room full of chili smoke until they suffocated and died (Berdan and Anawalt 1997: 123).

As researchers continue to look for chili peppers in the archaeological record and [test ceramics](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0079013) for the presence of chilis, we may be able to flesh out our understanding of the pepper in pre-Columbian times. Who knows? Maybe we can even find the Scoville value of pre-Columbian chilis and be better able to answer your question on spiciness of the peppers.

	<TEXT> Thanks for tagging me. Despite the popularity of posting the article to /r/history yesterday, there was very little discussion on how plausible it was that salmonella was cocoliztli or if salmonella just happened to be concurrent to cocoliztli, as you pointed out. 

When I read this Nature article I feel like it was a bit sensationalized and blown out of proportion. The studies they link to are preprints posted on a server. Who's to say the authors were not going to make changes to their paper? Or that peer-review input was not incorporated yet? Maybe the preprint was to just test the format for the paper before submission? These concerns are not satiated with the samples coming from Oaxaca. Was Oaxaca hit with the same cocoliztli epidemic? Did it have the same rates of death? Do the authors adequately address the geographic and demographic differences between the Basin of Mexico and Oaxaca? 

This is just big news and it generates lots of questions. I know that you and 400-rabbits may not be able to answer them, but maybe we can talk about them.  </TEXT>

 As I understand it 4 priests held a victim over a ceremonial stone and the 5 priest kill them

Is it four groups of five priests? I thought it was only four people doing the heart extraction, not four people total.

Either way, you need to have a lot of people working to get through 10,000 people in four days. It seems too fantastic to have actually occurred. </TEXT>

Kinda, but kind of not. The Postclassic is less understood and published than the Classic period. This gives a skewed view of the past in which the Classic seems to have thrived better than their Postclassic descendants. This paper by [Diane Chase](http://www.caracol.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/dchase92.pdf) and this paper by [Jeremy Sabloff](https://www.amphilsoc.org/sites/default/files/proceedings/151102.pdf) discuss this issue in better detail than I. Suffice to say, though. the Maya were still thriving in the 1300s and into the colonial period. The last Maya kingdom to be conquered were the Itza Maya and that occurred in 1697.

 Great civilizations came and went in the Americas, not everything that happened in the new world revolved around Europeans.

That is very much true. There's no denying that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By trying to link these effects to a single cause of disease completely removes indigenous agency before, during, and after the events of the Conquest of Mexico. You're basically saying they have no will and simply react to outside stimuli like disease. I'm not denying that disease had no role in the conquest, but other factors are at play. The Tlaxcalans choosing to ally with the Spanish. The Aztecs choosing to ally with the Spanish after their defeat. The Purepecha choosing to surrender to the Spanish and join them rather than try to fight it out. People made these choices and disease did not limit their choices to the ones they made in the past. The Tlaxcalans could have fought the Spanish before disease impacted them. The Purepecha could have gone down fighting. The Aztecs could have refused to cooperate with the Spanish. Don't be that person who tries to pinpoint one single thing as the cause for everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, we should be saying Mexico. I disagree with your assertion that Mexica society didn't exist after the Spanish conquest. It's not as if every living Mexica simply adopted Spanish customs in 1521. It took time for Mexica culture to wane as elders passed away and could not pass on their knowledge and Catholic missionaries took over the job of the calmecac to teach the population. If Mexica culture disappeared right after 1521 than Friar Bernardino de Sahagn would never have been able to write the Florentine Codex. You could argue that by 1600 Mexica culture had been greatly reduced, but that would take into account 80 years of epidemics (like the one in the article) and Catholic missionary and colonial government work.

No, Mexico means "place of the Mexica". Mexico is made up of two words, Mexica and -co. In Nahuatl -co is a postposition that can be translated as from, by, to, or on but is also used as place name signifier like -tlan. When you add -co to a word you drop the last vowel. So Mexica becomes Mexico and Mexico means place of Mexica.

Mexica comes from the word mexicatl which simply means a habitant of Mexico. The word moon is metztli and is completely different from Mexica or Mexico.

You can check the Nahuatl in Remi Simeon's *Diccionario de la lengua nahuatl o mexicana* (1977) or Alonso de Molina's *Vocabulario en lengua castellana y mexicana* (1585) or UOregon's [online dictionary](http://whp.uoregon.edu/dictionaries/nahuatl/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I thought that population has already dwindled to a low number by the time westerners arrived.

No. Native populations declined by the time the English set up colonies in the present-day US, but that was well after the Spanish conquest of the Caribbean and Mexico. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Second, the "Aztec" civilization wasn't the only one in Mexico

The Aztecs were the only civilization in Mexico. Mexico means place of the Mexica (aka Aztecs) and that place was Mexico-Tenochtitlan. Mexico only extended as far as the island it was built on. The Triple Alliance, however, did control a large part of Central Mexico. However, that power was shared with Texcoco and Tlacopan. </TEXT>

It's interesting how healthy people can carry the disease, but pass it on to others through poor sanitation.

	<TEXT>  Do you know whether these Colima figures have piercings?

The figures from Colima do not show very many piercings. I normally see piercings on the [solid figures](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/11/02/bf/1102bfe624f7323feee21d4f11a2fb35.jpg) rather than the hollow figures. Depictions of piercings are more common for figures from Jalisco and Nayarit. Their piercings are not like other Mesoamerican piercings. Instead of ear spools and labrets they have [multiple earrings and nose ornaments](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6c/19/c3/6c19c35b9fe6cefba866c12c38d1a71e.jpg). That's not to say there are no ear spools, but they are are uncommon. 

Jalisco and Nayarit figures also show many more [body markings](http://www.archaeology.org/images/ND2013/Tattoos/western-shaft-tomb-tattoo.jpg) than Colima figures. I'm not sure if this is body paint or tattoos. The [shoulder bumps](http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/images/hb/hb_1979.355.jpg) present on some figures have been interpreted as scarification since they appear on figures with and without shirts. </TEXT>

No, this did not happen. Or else you are confusing the epidemics encountered by US Eastern seaboard peoples after the arrival of the Spanish to the Caribbean and Mexico.

 So, when the Vikings landed, they discovered a large and unfriendly population which drove them off.
