	<TEXT> I would say that the copies come out hot and soften the plastic during periods of high demand. The paper finds the soft spots and pushes the plastic outwards resulting in a groove like effect similar to the walls of a deep canyon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What was the test comprised of a visual insoection? Marijuana is not a compound you test for it is the plant. Maybe testing for THC or CBD? If I was looking for marijuana in water I think it would be blatantly obvious it's there. Kinda like "oh hey Steve, you were right there is marijuana in the water. I took a shower this morning and it was raining buds on me" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spots in the woods will fill up fast. You can always go further/deeper into the woods though. There are tons of trees for hammocks. No dogs or bag checks, just be smart. Someone will check your cooler, unless it's super busy.  No one working there is out to get anybody, just keeping the peace. Have a blast! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I've actually done quite a few of these. They always come out unbelievably wonderful. Just need some lump hardwood coal glowing white hot. I use a thin coating of canola oil on the steak and adhere my seasonings of choice. Four minutes a side for medium rare. Rest for 5-10 when its done. Have faith. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ninth or tenth for me. Been going since the beginning..missed a few years here and there. I recommend coming in as early as possible if you have GA camping passes. You will have to take a shuttle from the parking area to the front entrance. Then you have to carry ALL of your things to your spot of choosing. (Sometimes you can catch a ride on the festy shuttles) The woods fill up fast and you are gonna want that shade. Cooler checks are standard so hide your booze. The festival is an amazing, magical place filled with wonderful people at one of the best locations in my opinion. The lineup is killer this year, you will not regret this festival. There are showers too, hit em early or super late if you don't wanna sit in line. If you forget anything vendors and general stores gotcha covered. Hope you are excited it's gonna be here soon!!!!! </TEXT>
