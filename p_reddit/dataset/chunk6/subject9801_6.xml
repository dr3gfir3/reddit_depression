	<TEXT> 15,000 Americans died due to gun violence in 2015. [link.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604)

After sandy hook, Trump supporters told us we couldn't do anything about it. 

After Virginia Tech, Trump supporters told us there was nothing we could do. "Banning guns won't do anything!"

Between 9/11 and now, there have only been around ~3,000 deaths on American soil due to terrorism. [link.](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) That's 3,000 in 16 years compared to 15,000 gun deaths EVERY YEAR.

They want to tell us that banning PEOPLE is ok, but banning guns isn't? HELL NO.

	<TEXT> Again, did you read the letter that the FFRF sent that is included in the article? 

In 2000, the supreme court ruled that student led prayer at football games is unconstitutional. The case was santa fe independent school district v. Doe. 

If it was student led, still unconstitutional. If it were led by a random crowd member, I don't know if that has been litigated yet. Considering it appears that the man who led the prayer is a youth pastor, I imagine there would be issues with coaches allowing a member of the clergy access to the students at a school sponsored event for religious purposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really not trying to be a dick, but did you even read the article or the letter that the FFRF sent? 

In the letter, the FFRF cites numerous court cases that dealt with exactly the situations you're talking about. Contrary to what you've said, the courts have ruled REPEATEDLY that coaches and other school employees are NOT permitted to participate in prayer or religious activities in their capacity as school employees, as that would constitute an endorsement of religion.

Trump pretends to be Christian anytime it is convenient for him. He lies about where he goes to church. [1.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/28/politics/donald-trump-church-member/)

Trump didn't know that it is "2nd Corinthians, not "two Corinthians." [2.](http://www.npr.org/2016/01/18/463528847/citing-two-corinthians-trump-struggles-to-make-the-sale-to-evangelicals)

Trump also said he never asked God for forgiveness. [3.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/18/politics/trump-has-never-sought-forgiveness/)

But anytime Trump wants to woo Christian voters, he brings along a platoon of prosperity gospel ministers and **pretends** to be a Christian. 


Muslim refugees should just take a leaf out of Trump's book and the GOP playbook and just pretend to love sweet baby Jesus. Trump would let them right on in.  </TEXT>

However, if these religious lawmakers really wanted to "protect women and kids," going after sex offenders would be more believable than going after transgender folks. 

Mandating that all churches perform background checks on anyone working with kids would be a good start, too.  </TEXT>

Time and time again, [religious right lawmakers introduce bills](http://time.com/4624009/bathroom-bill-lawmakers/) attempting to ban transgender folks from public bathrooms...as if transgender people are a danger to women and kids. All the while, there are on average 70 reports of sexual abuse in churches per week in the United states. [Link.](http://churchandstate.org.uk/2016/05/kids-more-likely-to-be-molested-at-church-than-in-transgender-bathrooms/)

Transgender folks aren't the problem. 

Where are the bills banning sex offenders from bathrooms? Where are the bills protecting kids from rapey pastors and priests? 

Oh, right... **the religious right doesn't give a fuck about real sexual assault that is happening in their own churches. They would rather demonize transgender folks than deal with the real problem.**

I live near Chattanooga. I used to be friends with a chick who eventually married a Muslim she met online and moved to isis controlled syria. [Link.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/woman-journey-from-chattanooga-to-isis) This is a girl I was getting drunk and smoking weed with ten years ago. 

Then, there was the [Chattanooga shooter.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/20/us/tennessee-naval-reserve-shooting/) He went to high school with friends of mine, who actually described him as one of the nicest people they knew. 

All religions are a little fucked up in my opinion, but Islam takes the goddamn cake. Islam is the **only religion** I have ever encountered that can take normal fucking people and in a matter of months or years turn them into goddamn murdering sociopaths.

I don't know what the solution is, but we have to combat this dangerous fucking ideology or shit like this will keep happening.

	<TITLE> Meet HR 490, the "heartbeat protection act." Filed by Rep. Steve King, the bill would ban abortion NATIONWIDE after the fetal heartbeat is detectable, which can be as early as 6 weeks. This bill would ban abortion before many women even realize they are pregnant. Again, fight like hell, folks. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It is no big secret that Rep. King introduces legislation that is driven by his religious beliefs. This bill is another example of the religious right attempting to legislate THEIR religious morality on society at large. This is a topic relevant to secular folks.

I disagree with senator Cruz on almost everything, but I must tip my hat to him on this one. 

When it comes to protecting consumers and sick people, senator Cruz did a better job than 13 democrats. 

It's simple, folks. It's time to clean house. WE need to run against these senators in primaries.

	<TITLE> I'm doing research on religious indoctrination in public schools. Apparently it is common for coaches and teachers who are religious to use their position in schools to evangelize. I'd be interested in hearing any stories you all may have. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In the past few months I've seen several instances of coaches praying on the field with their teams before games. I've even seen videos of coaches baptizing students at public schools. 

I personally when I was younger had science teachers attempt to teach creationism over evolution. 

I'd be interested in knowing how common these types of situations occur and how extreme the evangelism/indoctrination is. 

You can comment or pm me, if you'd like to share any stories you may have of teachers and coaches abusing their position by attempting to convert or sway students and athletes.  </TEXT>
