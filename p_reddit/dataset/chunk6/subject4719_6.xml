	<TEXT> Yes!  I saw a therapist for many years, but it got expensive.  I stopped going,  but I am armed with a coping arsenal!! Even when it gets bad, I am able to pull myself out.  If you have the ability to see a therapist, I'd recommend it:)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> To my fellow colleagues suffering from Depression and Anxiety disorders </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-05 15:42:11 </DATE>

	<TEXT> We are winning at life. We are changing lives, we are molding minds, even though we suffer so much. We are the big fuck you to this mental illness, we do not let it over take us and distract us from the purpose we have in life. 

I have posted twice on here about teaching with depression and have gotten such great support from everyone, thank you! These were both painful posts about how tough it is to deal with depression, anxiety and teaching all at the same time. However, I forgot to mention how much teaching saves my life. I cannot help my depression or anxiety, it is what it is. I get help, Im working on coping. The best help, however, has been teaching. Even on the days when coping with my mental issues makes teaching hard, I get through it, I succeed. Sometimes there are mornings where suicide and self-harm are on my mind, but I remember how much my kids need me and I get my ass into work. I havent had a good nights sleep in months because of my anxiety, but I remember how much my kids need me, I pull myself together and get my ass into work. I survive the year because I have purpose. No matter how depressed or anxious I get, in the back of my head I have a reason to keep going. 

I hope that our profession is reason enough for you to keep going too. You can do it, I can do it, we can do it. Youre not alone.

	<TEXT> I am a young high school teacher with a baby face so I dress as business casual as possible so I look and feel more 'adult'. Black and grey slacks, a few skirts at knee length, always a nice top. Since I teach high school, some students are taller than me, so I make sure my tops cover my chest completely. (I learned from experience, ew). I tend to always wear flats. On the DL I wear converse high tops most of the school year.... unless its the summer or I'm in a skirt lol  
I have colleagues who dress much more casual than I do, but business casual makes me feel and appear more authoritative and professional.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, yes. No college class prepared me for student teaching, which is when I realized education classes were all just philosophy courses. I learned more about education in my 12 weeks student teaching than I did over the 4 years I spent in college. , </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes! if you have participation points, you can do that!

Homework: I accept late work. I teach math, math is about practice, so even if its late I take it and give a C for the grade. If students are failing due to not turing in homework, (or failing at all!) I first talk to the student about how late work will help their grade, and I will always send an email or give a call home if they cannot take initiative on their own  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wanted to Share A Beautiful Teaching Moment </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-04 18:05:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background story: I teach math to high school juniors and seniors. I ended up with a class of 30 juniors because there was no room on the schedule to make a support class for the students who really needed. Naturally, I ended up with those students along with the high achieving ones too. It has been a very tough class to work with because the differentiation is so vast... and there are SO many students in one room. 

The moment: This happened on top of the whole class being super productive and working the whole time (I worked hard for this!). While making rounds during classwork, I got to witness a high achieving student helping a struggling one. She did not give away the answer, she did not get irritated or upset at how long it was taking him to think and solve. I witnessed him feeling confident and successful and it was so beautiful. 


I hope everyone having a wonderful Tuesday!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a female, I work at a catholic school and i have my ears stretched to a size 0. I wear plugs, tunnels, tapers, etc and it seems to be alright with the administration. I probably wont stretch any larger until I'm in a public school where I feel comfortable. I also have my tongue pierced, no one told me to take it out, and i turn up my septum at work. I interviewed with everything in/turned up and even with the strictness of the private school, They let me have all of this! I think your'e ok:) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> instead of hurting my voice while teaching and curing it after, I drink lots of water and/or tea with honey during my lessons. When you need to speak louder, speak from your diaphragm instead of your throat (ask the music teacher if you're not sure how!).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a major legal issue though.  If you want a camera in your room you gotta make sure waivers are signed by parents.  You cannot record a minor without parental consent! It is a good idea to have,  for self reflection   legal issues.  But getting one sounds like annoying legal hurdles </TEXT>
