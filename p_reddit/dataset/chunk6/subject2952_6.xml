	<TEXT> It will make infusion quicker, but not that much quicker in reality considering you get 3-5 drops in a raid. Having to then infuse them into different pieces of gear will take a significant amount of time IMO.

Say you buy a 280/290 Zhalo Supercell from Xur, I dont know the maths but if you were to infuse a 320 primary into it you would need 2 or 3 to get it to max LL. Considering you may get 2-3 of these per week it would take a fair amount of time to fully infuse all the exotics/legendaries that you wanted to keep. Depending, of course, on how many you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I see your point. I suppose for me I don't want to be still grinding out the raid in 6 months time because I'm still only 312 light. Perhaps, as others have suggested getting more frequent drops could make up for this rather than all dropping at 320 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah perhaps more guaranteed/Regular drops would make up for this in a way, I hadn't thought of that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree but I see your point. I am yet to receive some weapons armour at all despite running NM on every character each week so far so it will still take a while and then after ward you would need to drop this gear again for infusion. </TEXT>
