	<TEXT> I didn't say that the British authorities should have granted the demands. I was just uncertain and looking for clarity in the first comment I posted asking which group were being referred to. I learned about these times in history classes but I'm not going to pretend to know enough about this particular time and issue to write a big answer on it, or to have a very informed opinion, but I do know that the struggle for a United Ireland was something that'd been ongoing for long before these people, in a just way (Michael Collins, Anglo-Irish treaty), so please don't compare that to the RAF. But like I said, I don't really know too much in depth about the 70s and 80s and the struggles of the PIRA and IRA and Sands. The IRA were by and large not a good group of people and did a lot of horrific things, but it is different.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely different cases and it isn't that black and white, but I get your point. The film wasn't made to be an IRA propaganda piece, just a means to tell a story about this man who chose to suffer greatly for something he thought was greater. I think that the director would have chosen to make the film even if this person had been suffering for a different cause or organisation, McQueen isn't an IRA sympathiser as far as I know. The film is so focused on the character of Sands, and not the organisation as a whole, that there isn't even much room to "downplay what scum they were" anyway. It just shows what happened within the walls of the prison.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was watching a George Miller interview about the differences between making the last Mad Max film in 1985 and Fury Road this year, and he said something like the average amount of shots in a movie is now well over 2000, when back then it was just over 1000. It's weird to think that that number could get even higher in future years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There were so many amazing moments in this movie, but I think one of my favourites has to be Han being royally cockblocked by 3PO, in the most OT Star Wars way ever. It was just felt straight out of the Original Trilogy in terms of the humor and I love that so much.

	<TEXT> I hate that it happened, but only because it hurt to watch. It was incredibly done, imo. The lighting, though not subtle at all, gave depth to the idea that this was the decisive moment in Kylo's complete fall to the Dark Side. I also loved the lack of music; there was pretty much no music going on during the scene, which made it completely tense. It was done beautifully imo and it was tragic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the main goal of this film was to introduce a new generation of characters, a new story, while also embracing the original trilogy's characters and themes. I think if they had put in too many characters from the original trilogy, there wouldn't have been that balance; it would have felt too much like part of the original trilogy, when it's the first in a new trilogy. I mean, Luke wasn't really even in TFA, and Leia only very briefly, and it definitely felt to me like the OT was given enough attention in this movie; I think if they'd put Lando in there it just would've been too much. I'm hopeful that Lando will have a part in future though! He's probably the biggest heroic character in the OT besides the main three anyway so I'd say it's probably inevitable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My drum teacher has been trying to drill into me that back fulcrum is the only proper technique, and if you watch videos of most pro drummers who hit at least moderately hard, they're using it. I think it mostly makes it easier to play generally in that it requires less energy if you have your back three fingers supporting the stick, and it makes finger control a lot easier. Honestly I don't see anything wrong with first finger and thumb and I've done it for years, but even already playing has gotten easier using back fulcrum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the exact same whenever I go on a five piece. Like, I'll go to try out a fill I like, and I'll completely freeze up - it's like my brain thinks there are two many options (though there's really only one more than usual) and doesn't know what to do. 

It'd be worth sticking with it for a while though, you might grow into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my god, you've just described my drum teacher at the moment. I've just started college but I've been playing for years, and did my percussion grades with a fantastic teacher, but my current guy is exactly as you said. He's jaded and bitter because he hasn't become one of the "greats", so he remedies it by acting superior in really obnoxious ways. ugh </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it really incorrect to use rebound for double strokes? How else can I do it efficiently? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I hear a lot of drummers who are at an incredibly high standard of playing kind of slagging off rebound - well not a lot, but my drum teacher and a few others I've known. I've always used rebound and find it hard to use just fingers or some other technique. I can't tell sometimes what technique some are using either so it's hard to know where to go from here. Like when Tony Royster Jr. does his fast strokes [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytEMYipwrDw) it looks like fingers, but honestly I don't really know. 

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much for the response! Honestly a lot of my favourite session guys use 5000s anyway, and everything you said makes a lot of sense. Cheers! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Can't find any demos that show this particular use. That's the main reason I'd want it, to loop basslines over leads, but I wouldn't want the octave above the (fake) bassline I'm trying to play. 

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love his style. One thing about this video that I find really interesting is his foot technique - my drum teacher absolutely tears me apart for mine (I went 6 years with no lessons on technique or anything so developed some weird habits), but I naturally do exactly what Matt does in this video, because having only part of your foot on the pedal makes it easier to release, for me at least. 

I don't know, the whole perfect technique vs. good sound despite bad technique argument is never going to end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Not just jamming and playing, but working on specific things

This is vital, I spent so long doing a lot of what I thought of as practice, when really I'd maybe learn one specific thing and then noodle around with stuff I already have down perfectly for ages, or just jam along to songs. There's also the danger of "comfort playing" when you're trying to learn something that's really challenging. Just falling back on something you put time into learning before, so you can restore some confidence in your ability. 

practice is hrd </TEXT>
