Before the Hama offensive some members of Jund al-Aqsa were expressing their concerns about Ahrar al-Sham and FSA Jaysh al-Nasr preparing a raid against JaAq positions.

	<TEXT> Ojo, el estudio se hizo a traves de un examen, donde los encuestados solo responden 72 preguntas y despues los expertos deciden si clasifica como victimizacin sexual (solo respondiendo *si* a un item te clasifica como vctima o perpetrador). Considerando que las preguntas incluian "presin verbal" como una forma de agresin sexual no es sorprendente que hayan logrado numeros tan altos. Tambien un 26% de los hombres encuestados y 16% de las mujeres fueron identificados como "agresores sexuales". 

 Overall, 51.9% of women and 48.0% of men reported at least one incident of sexual victimization, and 26.8% of men and 16.5% of women reported at least one incident of sexual aggression perpetration since the age of 14 

 (...)

 We used the Sexual Aggression and Victimization Scale (...) validated in cross-cultural research (...) It combines three coercive strategies (use or threat of physical force, exploitation of the victim's inability to resist, e.g., due to alcohol or drug use, and use of verbal pressure) with three victim-perpetrator constellations (current or former partners, friends/acquaintances, and strangers)

 (...)

 If participants responded never to all victimization items, they were categorized as non-victims (coded 0). If they reported at least one incident of sexual victimization, they were categorized as victim (coded 1). Perpetration status was coded in the same way </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point of forming the FSA Idlib is that there will not be "other groups" but just one bigger group. But chances are that if JFaS try to mess around with some of them (like kidnapping a subcommander or storming some checkpoints) the group will try to negotiate and appeals to a sharia court to arbitrage instead to answer the agression.

The old AQ linked Nusra might have tried to disband this FSA faction by force, but after JFaS rebranding they will probably try to strenght their alliance with islamist factions: we can see this already happening with Nour al-Din al-Zenkey, a former FSA-friendly group that could have been an ally to the FSA Idlib, joining the JFaS-led Jaysh al-Fatah coalition. </TEXT>

Civilians in Marea could never accept the ISIS presence in their area, as it has shelled their homes, and sometimes used them as human shields, said Nasser. Even during the battle, there were either those who volunteered to fight alongside us [the rebels], or civilians who helped rebels by offering them food and shelter. **Women have also fought alongside rebels against the militants. Even though we dont encourage putting women at the frontline, some insisted.**

There is an obvious PR stunt in the formation of permanent female units, but the claim seems to be perfectly feasible in the circumstances described: under stress, FSA-linked rebels will be open to allow women in combat as a last resort. </TEXT>

FSA and the others are just foreign backed mercenaries without honor. Not only are they armed thugs, but they are committing treason and murdering their own compatriots to advance foreign interests in Syria.

It is almost impressive how some people will try find a way to give ISIS the moral high ground over the FSA. Aparently open genocide, creating slavery markets and terrorism is just a footnote when compared to, God forbid, compromises with international powers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a difference between airstrikes in the battlefield and airstrikes in civilian areas. Rebel and western complains have focused in the latter, and considering that the numbers already give a 40% of dead civilians in total, the proportion would be certainly higher (maybe over 50%) if we could separate the data between those actually killed in combat vs rearguard casualties, which would keep standing the argument of the "western media". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Such cowardly combat behavior reinforces deep suspicions among local fighters and civilians, and the conspiracy theories abound (...) the only rational explanation is that the foreign fighters are really working for their own governments. One ex-Iraqi army officer explains, There are many rumors in Hawija that foreign fighters flags contain a phosphoric material that sends signals to U.S.-led coalition warplanes. Therefore, the warplanes do not shell them and the bases they work in.

That is not actually such a far fetched theory: western volunteers are probably the easiest way that the West has to infiltrate agents and gather HUMINT inside "*al-Dawla*". </TEXT>

Allegedly Zenkey has been trying since then to recover CIA backing, to no avail. 

Under the enormous military pressure that they are right now it makes sense that they thrown themselves to the arms of JaF, as the will certainly provide more support than the CIA will, at least in short term. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They don't have the numbers to hold and advance at the same time in such a wide front. ISIS didn't put much of a fight beteween Jarabulus and al-Rai because they would have been fighting in a salient, with the FSA / TSK just moving in an almost straight line between both towns, but now the rebels have to clean all the towns in the countryside of al-Bab -specially ISIS positions around Azaz and Marea- before trying to take the town directly, similar to the pincer movement that the SDF pulled off in Manbij. But the difference is that the kurds could bring almost 10k soldiers to the cross the Euphrates while the rebels FSA just have 5-6 thousand militants, maybe less, without a river to protect them from counter attacks, and with a potentially hostile YPG at both sides, in Afrin and Manbij, blocking possibilities of making another pincer. Turkish tanks are great force multiplier but they cant teleport to everywhere, so, unless the rebels can spawn a couple more thousands of fighters, the advance to al-Bab will be a lot more slow and less cinematographic than the *blitz* that the TSK armor did along the turkish-syrian border. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Why on earth would they be trying to target SAA in support of ISIS in Deir Ezzor , when they have NEVER previously done so before?*

They regularly target ISIS in Deir Ezor governorate. If the formation is large enough it will be a juicy target, specially if it can be a threat to other US backed groups in the desert (NSyA y FSA between al-Tanf and east. Qalamoun) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They basically blame 2 F-16 and 2 A-10, flying from Iraq, in the killing of 62 soldiers ~~(?)~~ after four airstrikes. Immediatly after that ISIS launched the assault. Complains about lack of will of USAF to coordinate with Russian forces to fight ISIS.

The fact that Daesh was ready to launch the attack makes me presume, ~~if the russian MoD is telling the thruth,~~ that USAF was trying to target those ISIS militants while were preparing the assault. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also believe that the shooting was staged, but this is not the strongest of refutations. The two press teams could have decided to go at the same time to Castello road because that was the moment of the Russian MoD briefing. Incompetence or sheer stupidity can explain the reporters not taking proper cover and the lack of martial attitude between some soldiers. The distance to rebel frontlines to the north its not a problem if they are using 23mm or .50 guns (I could not hear any incoming fire though).  </TEXT>

Take him with a grain of salt, I doubt that the US is trying to antagonize Turkey.

EDIT: there were US SOF in al-Rai to back the operation (before being kicked out by islamist factions), so indeed  the US wasn't against the FSA heading toward al-Bab. </TEXT>
