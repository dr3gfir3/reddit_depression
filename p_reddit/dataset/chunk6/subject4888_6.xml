	<TEXT> I puked more when i lifted my hand from the remnants of my father's skull to attempt and get up. I wanted to cry, to scream, but I only felt searing, white wash anger. 
He looked at my expression and let out a loud laugh, short and high pitched. His parents watched beside him as i struggled with my grasp on reality. They were serial killers. They viciously murdered my parents, and now they are going to do the same to me. 


It was the mother this time who met my eyes, she came closer to me and leaned down until i could smell her rotten breath. Her evil eyes traced me, i snarled, and spat in her face. Her son roared and charged me on all fours like an animal. He put his mouth on my arm and took a bite of my flesh like it was cotton candy. My blood spluttered out, adding to the pool on the floor, and on his face. I grabbed my wound and kicked him and his mother square in the face. They fell back and knocked into the father who was already on the move to strike. I leaped up and ran past them, her gnarled fingers catching my ankle. I toppled down the flight of stairs, and managed to keep crawling until i could come to a stand. Somehow i was quicker than them and ran out of that god forsaken hell and onto the streets.

 
This time i didnt scream for help I just ran. I had nowhere to go, no phone, no parents, and very little sanity left. I heard their footsteps behind me, catching up. All I needed to do was hit the main road and hopefully, they wouldnt be dumb enough to follow me. I was running on pure adrenaline, my mind and body was acting on pure survival instinct. Cars were passing by, and my heart jumped out of my chest before my arms flailed for help. 


Unfortunately the family was behind me,and they were close too. I ran out in front of the next car that was approaching and it shrieked to a halt. I could see the person in the car was absolutely terrified and I screamed that there were people chasing me, trying to kill me. By now they had caught up and the person in the car was so bewildered that she tried to drive away, but the son smashed himself through the windshield. I watched as they ganged up on the woman inside of the car, and beat her until her head collapsed onto the steering wheel. The car horn was sounding around me like a siren, and I turned and ran in the other direction as fast as I could. 


Why me? Was all i could think as my bare feet hit the concrete painfully in each step. I looked back and they had threw the womans dead body onto the road and commandeered her car. They were now heading straight towards me heading about fifty miles an hour. 
Another car was on coming the opposite direction and i just prayed to whatever god was out there that they saw what was happening. I flung myself out of the way as the family passed me, barely escaping death. They slammed the car into the other, flipping it twice. I stood watching in horror as the son turned to me a second before it happened and smiled that sadistic smile of his. Surely the person in the other car was dead from the impact of a head on collision. I didnt even bother to stick around and check to see if i was right.


I had ran about 2 miles, and luckily I knew up ahead was a convenience store that would be littered with people and a phone. My arm and feet were soaking with blood, and my clothes the same. I looked like i had just been baptised in it. I checked behind my shoulder to see if they, by some chance of god were following me. They were nowhere to be seen. 
I hobbled into the bright lights of the gas station, my feet no longer covered by skin. The people who were standing by the gas pumps, mindlessly filling their tanks, gawked at me. I stared right back at them as I walked past and into the store. The guy behind the counter immediately noticed me and rushed around with a double barrel shotgun. I held up my hands in innocence and stammered that I just escaped kidnappers. That sounded better than I just ran two miles from fucking lunatic serial killers. The customers in the store had stopped what they were doing and were know watching the events unfold. 


The kind man who introduced himself as brian, called the police and let me wait in the breakroom while we waited. He bandaged up my arm and my feet in a combination of horror and disgust.

You poor boy, I am so sorry. Did you recognize them? I nodded, and told them exactly who they were. He tied up the end of my bandage and sat back on his heels, searching my eyes with furrowed brows.

Are you one hundred percent sure? Did he not believe me?

Yes, I can describe the way their house looks, the inside, the pictures on the wall, anything.When the police get here I can take them to where the bodies are, and where they wrecked into another car on the way to kill me. He looked solemn, as if his mind had just shut down trying to process the information I just slammed on him. He rubbed the back of his neck in anxiety,

They always seemed like such nice people, I mean the son was a little wonky, but still. I narrowed my eyes,

You knew them? He nodded slowly,

It's a small town boy, everyone needs gas or a pack of cigarettes. Their son Andrew always came in and bought a pack of starbursts and a strawberry cream soda every sunday after church. 

I had to hold back broken laughter, they actually went to church? How the fuck did they not burst into flames upon walking into Gods territory. Those people had to be some sort of branch of satan's offspring. 


The police arrived, and I told the story once more. The sheriff appeared as if he was going to be sick. His thick black moustache wiggled as if it was trying to escape his face. The sheriff and brian met eyes. 

Alright, you feel comfortable with showing me where everything happened? I will also need to get an official report. I shook my head. I thanked brian for helping me, his face was decorated with timid worry as I trailed behind Sheriff Langston. 


Two miles in we saw the car that the family had shamelessly wrecked into, still smoking on the side of highway 24. There was no sign of them, but the car they had stolen was piled in the ditch. The front end was almost completely destroyed, the airbags were deflated, and the windshield was just, gone. 

There is no way they could have survived right? I asked nervously, praying he would say no. Langston looked over at me in disbelief.

Kid, I really wanted to believe you made this up. My eyes widened, and I threw my hands at the scene in front of us. 

Now do you believe me? 

They killed my parents, and however many other people, and tried to kill me. Saying my parents were dead was the most horrid taste i have ever had on my tongue. I choked back a cry as I tore my face away from the sheriffs. 
He called for backup, and an ambulance as he surveyed the scene.
 
They killed the lady who was driving this car. I said as i accompanied him, not really wanting to sit in his car alone. Her poor, helpless face was forever seared in my mind as i watched her die. I never should have tried to stop her, it was my fault she was dead. Shit, she probably had a husband and kids. Now those kids were without a mom, just like me. 
I was an orphan. 
I took Langston to where I assumed her body would be. We searched the road and followed a blood trail into the ditch on the left side of the road. Her body lay still, with her eyes wide open still in horror. She must have still been alive when they threw her out of the car, and tried to crawl away from the road. Somehow that made it even worse.


Backup finally showed, along with the swat team and me and the sheriff got back in his car. The three minute drive felt like an hour, as I dreaded every second of anticipating seeing their faces once again.

Theyre probably long gone by now. I muttered. He half shrugged.

There will still be evidence all over the house, blood is hard to completely erase. There also should still be saliva from the son on your arm, if he is in our system thats proof enough for a warrant.

 I sighed, and stared ahead as we pulled onto my street. Except it was no longer my street, no longer my home, but a horrible reminder that I was completely alone.
Langston reeved it, and raced into their yard, followed by the swat and a few other cop cars. The swat hopped out of their van and ran into the house like a stampede of bulls after a matador. 

I want you to stay here. Langston said firmly, his hand on his gun.

No, I want to see them die. I whispered, not really to him, but to myself. He pointed his eyes at me, and his lips grew tight. Somehow I felt like he understood that. Before he could say anything else, there was a loud explosion inside the house. We both immediately looked up to see flames erupting from the windows where the glass was blown out completely. 

Son of a fucking bitch. Langston cursed and jumped out, as he was running up to the house, one of the swat men crawled out of the house. His protective gear was all but gone, and he struggled to take off his helmet as Langston approached him. I got out of the car and joined Langstons side, as we knelt by the man. A few other cops had arrived at this point, and the other cops were gathering around. The neighbours were coming out of their houses and onto the street to rubberneck on the scene.  

What happened? Langston asked in grave concern. The mans face was sweltered up from the blast, he was wheezing, and gasping for air. Langston looked back at the other policeman and nodded towards the back of the house. They drew their guns and quickly went to scope out the rest of the scene. It was just us and the man now. 

Theyre all dead, everyone of them. He wheezed, tears welling up. Lanston called another ambulance and the fire team to the address over his radio in a violently calm voice. I looked at his face, he was scared. It was horrifying seeing a grown man- a grown police officer so terrified. 


The smoke from the house was billowing up to the sky now, like some sort of signal from god to stop this nightmare. 
I was too focused on the sky, to realize that the man had took his final breath. Langston closed his eyelids in respect, and stood to his feet. He looked at me with the most peculiar look in his eyes, and said,

I want to see them die too. Upon hearing his words, something inside of me snapped. It may have been the little sanity I had left, or the pieces of humanity that my parents and the world taught me. Either way, both were gone. The officers returned from their perimeter search, and brought a note to the sheriff. The officer who handed langston the note, almost couldnt even hold it,because his hands were trembling so hard. I stood beside him, and we read it,


Help me, help me, is what you all will be saying. </TEXT>
