	<TEXT> Not OP but I'm currently pursuing a bachelors in Psychology with a pre-professional emphasis. I'm involved heavily in research- I'm currently working with my department chair doing a few projects. By the time I graduate in 2016, I'll have at least 2-3 papers published that I'm either sole or coauthor on. I've never had this much fun learning and working before. Research is amazing, as long as you know what you're doing and know your way around statistics and SPSS or R. 

If you have a passion for research, it's great. There's tons of people wanting research done and if you can design a pilot study that has promising results it's fairly easy to find money (at least around here). As far as getting into the field, I've talked to numerous researchers at conferences about this topic. As long as you've got a solid research background and a good degree, the field is hiring a lot. The stuff you hear on reddit is mainly pertaining to a BS in psychology, where it's fairly difficult to get a decent job with only a BS. 

If you're considering going into Masters- do it. This is the one piece of advice I'll always stick by- if you want more education there is no reason you shouldn't pursue it. You don't want to look back, 20 years from now, and wish you would've gone for that degree or that certification.  </TEXT>

I asked out a girl to prom every year I was in high school and got turned down every time, only to watch those girls go with other guys and have the time of their life.  It sucked. 

It gets better though. Relationships aren't everything. Enjoy yourself while you're in high school, even though it kinda sucks sometimes.. college is a hell of a lot better. Hang in there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had been talking to this amazing girl for about a year. We met at a birthday party of a mutual friend and really hit it off. She and I had attended high school together but never really bonded. 

Following summer she went to brazil(apparently to a clinic there to get help for mental problems, found this out later) and we kept in touch, got really close. She comes back, we get closer, she starts dropping hints like talking about her sex drive in front of me, and telling me that my "voice is so sexy, I need some chocolate or something to calm myself down after hearing you on the phone".  I even asked other girls about it, to make sure that I wasn't reading into it too much, and they said it definitely seemed like flirting to them too. 

So I obviously went for it.. She acts like she has no idea what happened, denies it all. I keep trying and stay friends with her.. She keeps flirting but denying it all. 

One of my best friends gf talks to her and asks wtf is going on, she denies it, then yells at me for "spreading rumors" about us being together. Truly WTF moment right there. 

Anyway, confronted her and told her that she had been flirting whether she realized it or not and that if she didn't want anything, I needed time away to get my shit straight. She then starts telling me how she's battling with suicidal thoughts and mental disorders and how a relationship is the last thing on her mind.. Ends off by saying she hopes I'm not mad. Haven't talked to her in months. Talked to her ex and he said that she went full crazy on him too. 

Come to find out, now my best friend is going after her even though he knows how crazy she is.. Jesus H. Christ.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not OP but I'm a second year Psychology major. I had a lot of worries and concerns that were addressed by your response- thanks for that!

Increasingly I hear people saying that psychology careers are hard to come by and that I'll be getting a "useless" degree. However, I'm really passionate about the field and I'm excited about the possibilities I've seen at conferences I've attended and by your and others responses.  </TEXT>
