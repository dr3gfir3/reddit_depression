	<TEXT> Irish here. Everybody seems to love the Irish with the exception for the English. Americans go mad when they hear our accent. :) Then seem to think that because I'm from Ireland that I may know the cousin who lives in Cork, which is about 250 miles away from where I live in Armagh... </TEXT>
