	<TEXT> Also you need to now when use aoe, or how to tech in cards vs control or vs aggro like pint potion, argus, twilight drakes etc... pirate warrior doesn't tech a shit because always goes face, even kolento said on stream that dragon priest isn't obviously the hardest deck to play but at least it require some skill or mastering has its merit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because hearthstone have history with 1 drops: "tunnel trogg, cogmaster, undertaker etc".. they now that 1 drops can break the game and they just don't give a fuck about that, we are not the responsables of balancing or seen if cards will be broken or not, they are supposed to have a team of pros on the subject  to do that :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is that they didn't need to test STB, only looking at the card you can tell that it was broken.. they do this all the time with 1 drops, I think maybe its on porpoise, it doesn't have sense :S </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can taste the meta whith decks like dragon priest, pirate warrior, water rogue, midrange shaman, reno priest or reno warlock the core deck of the first I named you are almost the same as standard list.. and if you find that you like wild, later you can craft belcher, zombie chow or piloted shredders.. take a look of the snapshot and maybe you can find some inspiration there ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, black wing corruptor is a core card in almost every dragon deck.. malylock, dragon priest, dragon malyrogue, reno dragon priest, reno dragon mage all of theme run him for some reason, sure you can replace him but the deck losses a lot of it's power. </TEXT>
