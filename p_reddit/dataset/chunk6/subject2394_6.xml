	<TEXT> There are a lot of interesting stories in the history, but I think the average public aren't really aware of that stuff minus a few crucial moments taught in history class. And the fact that a lot of the sites are now in ruins doesn't help. But the most critical factor that deters the average person from enjoying history is the lack of traditional culture integrated into modern life. There are some aspects of tradition, but it's hard to see that in the urban population, especially in comparison to the neighboring nations. Thankfully, I think this is changing, albeit slowly. Archaeological discoveries and restorations are being done. More pop culture works with historic backgrounds are coming out, and more people are appreciating traditional culture and embracing it in various ways. And I think Koreans who are interested in history could be found in major museums. Iksan is kinda in the boonies to be frank. Of course, this can all be just a giant speculation since I haven't asked Koreans about their opinion. </TEXT>
