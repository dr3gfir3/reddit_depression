	<TEXT> Be wary of HP envys, I have [this](https://www.amazon.co.uk/HP-ENVY-15-AE058na-15-6-Laptop/dp/B019H4N8G2). it happened a couple of times before where the mouse would go crazy completely. It would fly all over the screen right/left clicking by itself but went away after a minute or 2. This morning though it was particularly bad and when I eventually managed to turn it off I instead decided to boot up windows 10 and to my shock the exact same thing was happening. So I said to myself this is strange that a problem would persist over the 2 OSs so I did some investigation (on my phone because the mouse was so unusable). It turns out this is a major issue spanning years and 35 pages over here http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Operating-System-and-Recovery/hp-control-zone-trackpad-incredibly-glitchy/td-p/4073164.

Havn't tried yet but apparently reinstalling drivers does nothing, hard reset does nothing, the solution (apparently, on page 31) is to disassemble the laptop and take out the screws holding the trackpad and put them back in because the screws are in too tight. It isn't actually much of a problem for me because I always use an actual mouse so my solution now has been to turn off the trackpad. </TEXT>

Nope your wrong. One of Reddits favourite hobbies is to fellate Todd Howard without end. Just look at /r/gaming or even /r/gamingcirclejerk, its a jerk of only pro Fallout 4 posts and Bethesda apologism. There are only a handful of intelligent people who are seeing through these lies, but I'm one of them, and I'm here. So yeah. The little hate there is for F4 is deserved, since Bethesda scammed us with a fake RPG product. It's a open world shooter with RPG elements, and it needs to be heard otherwise TES VI will just end up the same.

He can't be real? </TEXT>

`To use a custom webrender with servo, go to your servo build directory and:`

    Edit servo/Cargo.toml
    Add at the end of the file:

`[replace]
"webrender:0.11.0" = { path = 'Path/To/webrender/webrender/' }
"webrender_traits:0.11.0" = { path = 'Path/To/webrender/webrender_traits' }`

    Build as normal

Do I have to build all of Servo or can I just do `Go to the servo directory and do ./mach update-cargo -p webrender` (from the top of the README.md as well) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have put in 100 hours in Fallout 4, and i can just say that it's bland. Even tho Skyrim was blander than it's predecessor it's still a remarkably good game, especially because the modding community. Fallout 4 just a step down, it's a remarkable mediocre game. I spent most of my time looking for a replayability that just wasnt there.

...

The 100hrs could've been trying to see if the content was as shallow as it felt but the no replayability comes from for the most part outside of which faction you choose at the end there aren't many big decisions you make that warrant doing the same kinda stale content again.

...

I have 70 hours in Fallout 4 and have nothing but disappointment to show for it. Those 70 hours are basically a product of hoping against hope it's going to get good at some point. I've played through 3 probably 4 times, same with NV. I've tried picking up 4 again and got two hours in before giving up. It's just a horrible RPG and not a very good shooter.

...

150 hours, the only thing that really pushed me was to see every location in the game so I could gauge how much genuine entertainment I could find in the game, that and I already spent 60 fucking dollars on something that was basically soul crushing to me so I might as well get my money's worth out of it. 

All the same comment chain. </TEXT>

I don't know about anyone else, but this just makes my eyes glaze over before I even have a chance to read the example. Like in the Java docs the signature is way more simplified and easier to skim over.

`public int size()`

Simple. Then you have an explanation then at the bottom where it's specified (if you care about). It just seems like a complete overload of information in Rust especially for a beginner or even an intermediate level Rust programmer. </TEXT>

"Migrant" is a racist word because countries and nationalities exist. Ok, got it.

 OP: Severely doubt you have even a bit of it.

Other dude: Please, explain how countries existing, and people wanting to control their borders is a "core tenet of fascist monologue." If you can climb off that high horse, that is.

OP: Look, you clearly don't have a brain, so there'd be no point explaining to you. Go and read some history if you want to try and educate yourself. Even Wikipedia could probably enlighten you to an extent. But it's completely pointless if you're not willing to even consider alternatives, and have no capacity to think critically about the subject. You should probably just stick to the medicine, you might be able to cure yourself of being braindead one day.

	<TEXT> Apparently the word migrant is intrinsicly racist, so you can't use it

Sally is correct in stating that the problem is one of language and syntax.
The use of the term 'migrant' necessarily implies that some people have a 'right' to live in certain countries or parts of the world, whilst other people do not, based on the acceptance of mis-guided conceptions of nationality structured on 19th and 20th century fascist and absolutist rhetoric.

At it's core, the term 'migrant' is intrinsically racist, carrying with it the major connotation of impermanence or temporariness that implies that 'these people' will at some point 'go back to where they came from' as they are not 'natural' citizens of the area they have moved to.

The idea that some people have a natural right to live somewhere, whilst other people do not, is a core tenet of fascist monologue that should be challenged at all times and in all places, by refuting and deconstructing the ideology of nation-states.

What planet are these people from?  </TEXT>
