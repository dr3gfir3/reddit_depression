	<TEXT> yeah and I would also look at the damage with the photos that were taken at the scene with your relative's camera.  But this is super important and if they have been involved in a lot of car accidents you can always use that as proof to nullify or at least negate charges.  Also, if these people are as dumb as you think they are, you can find their Facebook and see if the witness and the driver of the other car are friends with each other on there.   </TEXT>
