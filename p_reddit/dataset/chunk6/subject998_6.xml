	<TEXT>  Surely in a huge team playing game like overwatch every character can make a difference.. 

Yes, but can every character make the _same_ difference in _every_ situation? Are you saying that Widow and Orisa and Lucio are the _exact same heroes_ with the _exact same abilities_?

Different situations call for different powers. If your team died   they're so spread out you can't rez them all, perhaps you'd rather rez Soldier and two tanks than Soldier   McCree and only one tank, so that you have two tanks alive that can contest the objective. Or perhaps the enemy team is low, so you rather rez the Genji or D.va who can finish them all off than the Widow who will struggle to wipe the enemy team if they just turtle up.

 This is only going to create diversity

Wrong word, "diversity" means "many different types of things". But I understand what you meant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  there's an article that says there are compatibility and security problems with wireless keyboards

Security makes sense, for a few reasons. For your computer to accept the wireless connection, it must accept wireless connection. That means you are open to attacks over a wireless medium. And because of how wireless works, your keyboard must transmit everything it does in every direction, creating the potential for snooping.

Unless you work in a very security-oriented environment, I don't see this practically being an issue.

Compatibility on the other hand is more likely to cause problems. Wired keyboards all use the HID standard so they are essentially guaranteed to work with any modern OS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's more nuanced than that, because at a restaurant your customers pay for the food, so it's in your best interest to source quality ingredients.

Restaurants manufacture the product, incurring expenses such as rent and ingredients, and the customer pays.

Websites manufacture the product, incurring expenses such as server costs, and the **advertiser** pays. So really, the advertiser is a closer analogue to the restaurant. </TEXT>

          z

    Then Genji dashes:
    
        g
          z
            o

How does Orisa move in this situation to body-block for Zen?

 Thats when you stop shooting.

Then he walks away and comes back in a few seconds.

 But now he doesnt have the have the surprise factor and your team is more alert so they will be ready.

If your team is "ready" for that they are pulling their attention away from the front. That is why flankers are good: not because they get picks, but because they split focus. With your entire team turning around to focus Genji, Rein gets a free pin, marksmen get free headshots, Hanzo gets a free scatter, Zen gets free discords, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As 'nerdy' as this sub is, howcome there aren't anyone, who build/customize for a keyboard like that?

So I have a theory about this.

There are three kinds of consumer:

* The kind who no longer wants a numpad or nav cluster at all, because they prefer the reduced hand movement of something like a 60% or ergo keyboard.
* The kind who wants a full-size keyboard because they are drinking the Kool Aid.
* The kind who wants something smaller than full size (perhaps they LAN a lot, perhaps they just get irritated with smacking the mouse into the keyboard in CS:GO, etc), but are not so "adventurous" to go with something far out like a 60%. These are the people you'd think would want a numpad in lieu of a nav cluster - but again, these are not very _adventurous_ consumers. They don't think too much about the standard keyboard layout. So in designing a keyboard for them, the simplest thing to do is just chop off the numpad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I was worried you were going to post Space Cadet!

So for your budget, you are not going to find anything right now that looks like that. Basically your best bet is going to be something like the KBP V80s we've been discussing with the cool vintage keycaps.

Once you have your keyboard, if you really want that true vintage aesthetic, you can save up some money to get aftermarket keycaps. You'll notice those Space Cadet keycaps have large, centered legends, and the top of the keycap is sort of a spherical indent rather than a cylindrical one (or flat top). Until recently, Signature Plastics (aka Pimp My Keyboard) was the only company manufacturing keycaps like that; recently, Chinese clones have popped up on Aliexpress and elsewhere. The search term you'll want to use is "SA" or "DSA"
 (those are the names of that spherical profile/shape).

Here's some examples of SP SA   DSA sets you might like:

* [Ice Cap](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-ice-cap-keyset/) - in stock
* [Industrial](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/sa-industrial-keyset/) - sold out
* [Dolch](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-dolch-keycap-set/) - in stock
* [Granite](http://pimpmykeyboard.com/dsa-granite-keyset/) - sold out

Many of these can be found on the second hand market (/r/mechmarket).

You can make something even cooler if you are okay with blank keycaps - if you're a long-time typist this should not be a problem. </TEXT>

The person above you probably says not to take mid Karma alongside a utility jungler, because if that jungler comes to gank your lane, neither of you has the damage to blow up the enemy laner. But if it's a carry jungler, you can slow   root the target and let the jungler bring the damage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first Diverge was basically designed to be a cheaper, better Ergodox. The major points are:

* The Diverge has a more aggressive vertical stagger, better aligning with most people's different finger lengths.
* The Ergodox's thumb keys are widely reported to be hard to reach. The Diverge only has three keys per thumb, but they are much more conveniently accessible.
* With respect to keycaps, the Diverge can be filled out using a normal set of 104, whereas the Ergodox needs a special kit. </TEXT>

Yes. You program the Planck/Preonic/Let's Split etc to work the way you want. You can use "lock"-style layer modifiers that work like Caps Lock, or you can use "momentary"-style modifiers that work like Shift/Ctrl/Alt/Super. And depending on the firmware you can even do more complex shit, like modifiers that stay on for the next keypress, then automatically release. </TEXT>

Just because someone can flank every now and then does not make them a flank_er_. Think about it like this: when we say Genji   Tracer are flankers, what we mean is they should spend the majority of their time flanking. Not pop around a corner to Helix-burst a Zen every now and then - 80% of the time they should not be with their team.

	<TEXT>  Saying a guy is 'mansplaining' something is no different than saying a woman is 'bitching' about something.

No, *mainsplaining* is no different to saying a woman is "bitching" about something. Saying a woman is "bitching" is dismissing her opinions because she's a woman. **Mansplaining is dismissing a woman's opinions because she's a woman.**

 It's not inherently a feminist issue fyi. 

Yes it is. It is a gender equality issue and feminism is the name of the gender equality movement/philosophy.

 Because now you're involving people who are not identified as feminists and saying their opinion doesn't matter because of their genitalia. 

Uh... what? Are you saying feminism is only about gender equality *within the group of people who identify as feminists*? Next you'll be telling me that police brutality vs blacks is not inherently a race issue because it involves people who do not identify as racial equality activists.

Also, mansplaining is one form of saying someone's opinion doesn't matter because of their genitalia.

 Let me be VERY clear on this. I think men and women are equals.

Great! The word for this is "feminist".

 I and many others don't happen to have this issue, however, and maybe we'd like to be heard a bit instead of being told to shut up because we're 'mansplaining' facts that don't happen to suit the agenda of those who use the term.

I'm starting to see the issue: you thought OP's post was referring to you. Are you guilty of mansplaining? Do you habitually override the opinions of women around you? If not, then no, OP's post wasn't referring to you. Notice nowhere did he say, "**All men** do this." All he said was, "There exists a group of men who do this." Is that not true?

 from my perspective all the comments I got were just people getting upset that I feel nothing for this dude based on how interpreted his tweets.

Yes. That is the problem. This person made what boils down to a political argument, and you thought that gives you free reign to dismiss him as a person. "Your views differ from mine, therefore you are fundamentally bad and not deserving of pity when bad things happen to you. In fact, you deserve those bad things for being a bad person."

 Those are my own words there. What did I call his situation? HINT: It's the bold part.

That doesn't discount my statement. At first, you were sorry for him that he got screwed unfairly. Now, you are not sorry that he got screwed unfairly. You view it as a kind of punishment for a political view.

 I don't deal with liars.

Hahahaha

 DISMISSED.

Hahahaha

You don't actually want to debate. "I don't deal with liars" sounds like a line straight from The Donald's mouth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is it alright if I assume negative things of you and act on those negative thoughts every time you speak or do anything? 

No, because I am a specific person not guilty of the things you assume me to be guilty of. But OP did not have a list of names. He made a statement about a group of people that _does_ exist and _is_ guilty of the things he mentions.

Saying Barack Obama is a gangster is racist. Saying a disproportionate number of black Americans are gangsters is not.

 What I'm shocked by is how much you guys seem to care about the fact that I don't pity him based on how he treats others.

**He is not mistreating others. He is having a discussion about gender equality.**

 assuming the worst out of anyone who thinks mansplaining is in fact a sexist term. Which to my knowledge is only used against men to write off their opinions and concerns and never to actually further a conversation.

So then what do we do about the problem of men thinking they can explain everything to women? It's inherently a feminist issue. Having a word for it helps. It helps to highlight the gender inequities in the world. Fuck it, **I** do this all the time with my wife. It's a reflex. It's a real issue that needs to be addressed, and saying "we are not allowed to use the big scary word" doesn't promote healthy discussion.

---

TL;DR: you are extremely offended that you're not allowed to write this person off as a dick because of their political beliefs, but it is _you_ who does not want to engage in a real discussion - your immediate reaction to OP's feminist **argument** on Twitter was, "Oh he's a trash person, I'm glad Youtube fucked him over", not "Let's have a discussion about privilege." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a full-size keyboard makes good ergonomics impossible. This is because it extends too far into the optimal area for your mouse. You then have to compromise: either you push the keyboard to the left, hurting your wrists when using the keyboard, or you push the mouse to the right, hurting your right wrist when using the mouse   reducing your freedom of movement. 

A small keyboard like a Pok3r does not have this problem at all. You have loads of space to use low sens while maintaining a comfortable position on the keyboard. And more comfort means more endurance, and higher precision. 

If you truly need a numpad (and you almost certainly don't), get a standalone one and put it on your left.  </TEXT>

This table will have `event_id` and `contact_id`. So if you have contact `123` and you want that contact to have events `45`, `67`, and `89`, you create three rows in the join table:

    | event_id | contact_id |
    | -------- | ---------- |
    | 45       | 123        |
    | 67       | 123        |
    | 89       | 123        |

So then if you want to find all the events belonging to contact `123`, you `JOIN` events with the join table, and then query the join table `WHERE contact_id = 123`. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Oh so the SA are designed to have a direct feeling of on which row you're, while DSA it's all on the same level (and not as high?).

Yes, (sculpted) SA is like a traditional desktop keyboard. DSA (  same-row SA) is all the same height. See this image: https://geekhack.org/index.php?action=dlattach;topic=71484.0;attach=98897;image The more-or-less most common profile is "OEM", which is most similar to DCS in that picture.

 In the /dev/tty MT3 thread i saw someone saying that on sloped boards some caps may fit better or worse. Is that true?

Yes, but I'm not clued up on which factors affect this. I think sometimes SA has trouble with non-SMD LEDs? I'm not sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the fact that they never call it "double ADC" does go a long way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, she's not. :)

Casters will frequently refer to comps with, say, Graves in the jungle as a "double AD comp". Not "double ADC". And you are absolutely in the minority if you do refer to a jungle Graves as "the ADC". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I've understood that i'm in love with spherical caps, but i still have no idea what are the pro n' cons of SA and DSA.

So SA is normally sculpted (meaning different rows are different shapes), but some SA sets are not.

Non-sculpted sets are a bit like laptop keys - since they are all the same shape   height, you can't really feel on which row you are. </TEXT>

Then you should absolutely 100% not get a keyboard with a numpad. A 60% would be ideal. Look for a Pok3r (aka WASD VP3), KBP V60, etc. Is it important to you that the keyboard needs to be ISO? </TEXT>
