	<TEXT> I got all the basic insurances (don't remember exactly) except Sand and Ash. No hot spot, I did get a SIM card and had a signal at most places, plus wifi in hostels/guesthouses so that was fine.

Yeah I think hostels are really just in Reykjavik and Akureyri, but you should be able to find other "guest houses" in some of the larger towns. I also stayed in Hofn, there were several places there and it's not far from Jokulsarlon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah the rental service was nice, although I have no idea how they compare to others tbh. I imagine they're all pretty similar.

I'm from Boston so used to driving on weird roads and in weird weather, but I was in Iceland in summer (I actually just left) and found it SO easy to get around. The roads are easy to understand and navigate and it's pretty hard to get lost unless you're really going off the main road I think. At intersections, the road signs have the number of the highway (e.g. 1), the name of the city/town you're heading toward (so you might see Reykjavik pointing one way, Akureyri pointing the other), and maybe the number of km. 

Also my rental came with built-in GPS, but I just used Google when I needed to (only to get me to specific locations) and it worked fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Me again - I'm from the US and I didn't have any trouble. Booked my car in advance, had to quickly sign my paperwork as usual, and got my car. It didn't seem any longer than the other folks in the rental office, it was pretty quick and painless. The company I went through (Cars Iceland) also let me pick up the car in Reykjavik but return it at the airport. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not very familiar with Blazent but it looks like they do different things.

Servicewatch does top-down application/service mapping, so it will enhance your CMDB by automatically mapping CI's to the business-related services/applications they support, and then you can use those relationships for change/event/incident, etc.

Blazent doesn't appear to actually discover anything (I could be wrong), but rather analyzes your CMDB to look for and fix duplicates, bad relationships, etc, mostly stemming from multiple discovery sources and/or manual entry.

CMDB reconciliation used to be a bigger issue in SN, but it's been improved in recent releases to help support multiple sources, and like /u/ieatpotatochips said, there's a new CMDB health dashboard in Helsinki that might help with some of this as well. Entirely possible Blazent adds more on top of that, but I've never worked with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as you've figured out, changing the label in one view will change it everywhere - it's the same field, just a different view of the overall form.

You could use a client script to conditionally change the label: http://www.servicenowguru.com/system-ui/ui-scripts-system-ui/modifying-label-form-fields-client-scripts/

A UI Policy can change 3 things about a field: visibility, read-only, and whether it's mandatory. So your other option would be to create a separate field that you only use for standard changes, label it the way you want, and use a UI policy to show that field for standard changes while hiding "requested by".

Out of curiosity, why do you need to relabel it just for standard changes? </TEXT>

I used to use a Google voice number for dating, it's not uncommon. It felt more comfortable than giving out my real one, and it made it really easy to block someone if they got creepy. But it just forwards to her real number and/or she's notified on her phone just like she would be for a regular text message. Sorry bro... she's probably just not that into you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Second date. Spent ~7 hours together at an art museum, dinner, and then an awesomely weird bar that was projecting Coraline and other weird movies on the wall. Did a little too much walking from place to place, but had more fun than anyone should have in an art museum. Great conversation, he's really funny and super smart. 

Unfortunately we're both being slightly shy and awkward... date ended awkwardly with a hug again, I think both of us thought about a kiss but didn't go for it because lack of balls. Walked home kicking myself for being so painfully awkward. But we've been texting since and are planning a date 3.

7/10, lost points only for the awkward ending. What to do better next time: get drunk and make a move. </TEXT>
