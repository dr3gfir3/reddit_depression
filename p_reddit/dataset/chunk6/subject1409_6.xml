	<TEXT> The Catacombs of Paris (French: Catacombes de Paris, are underground ossuaries in Paris, France, which hold the remains of more than six million people in a small part of the ancient Mines of Paris tunnel network. Located south of the former city gate "Barrire dEnfer" (Gate of Hell) beneath Rue de la Tombe-Issoire, the ossuary was founded when city officials had two simultaneous problems: a series of cave-ins beginning 1774, and overflowing cemeteries, particularly Saint Innocents. Nightly processions of bones from 1786 to 1788 transferred remains from cemeteries to the reinforced tunnels, and more remains were added during later years. The underground cemetery became a tourist attraction on a small scale from the early 19th century, and has been open to the public on a regular basis since 1874 with surface access from a building at Place Denfert-Rochereau in the extreme southern part of the city of Paris.

	<TEXT> Original version of the brochure targeted Chinese visitors explicitly and was revised following a backlash:



Following a rash of bad experiences with foreign visitors, the Hokkaido Tourism Organization released an educational brochure last summer aimed at making some subtle cultural differences slightly more explicit. After complaints that it was patronizing and maybe a little too explicit, they recently revised it, and added an English-language version as well, Japan Times reports.


The old guide, Common Sense When Traveling Hokkaido, was released last August, in Chinese only. It featured multiple illustrations of bad tourist behaviorthrowing used toilet paper in the trash; wearing pajamas in the lobbymarked as such with giant red Xs. When Chinese tourists complained that this was patronizing, the bureau softened their tone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Students at Bridge Farm Primary School in Bristol, UK returned from their half-term holiday to find one of the school's buildings had been adorned with an unsual piece of giant doodle art. Yet this image was no act of vandalism - it's the latest masterpiece from street art legend Banksy.

Depicting a child playing with a stick and a hoop, the artwork looks like it's leapt from the margins of a school exercise book. Of course, because this is a Banksy there's an edgy touch, with the traditional hoop swapped out for a burning tyre.

However, there's a charming side to the story, as the children at the school had recently decided to rename their houses after Bristol legends, including Banksy.

Bridge Farm wrote to the artist about the decision to name a school house after him and the painting was reportedly completed last night. As well as a letter from the artist himself that confirms he made the image, the painting also features the rare inclusion of his signature.

	<TEXT> A month after losing control of the governorship, Republicans in North Carolina on Wednesday launched a brazen power grab to deprive the state's incoming Democratic governor of the ability to control much of the state government, from the election board to the governor's own Cabinet.

After calling a surprise special session with just a few hours' notice, Republicans in the Legislature introduced a series of bills that would strip the next governor, Roy Cooper, of the power to control the state's election boards and to appoint University of North Carolina trustees, and would give the state Senate veto power over his Cabinet picks. The legislation would drastically reduce the number of political appointees the new governor can hire and fire, meaning Cooper would not be able to replace more than 1,000 political appointees of the outgoing administration. If passed, the legislation would undermine the results of the gubernatorial election by severely weakening the office of the governor.

I'd call them sore losers, but the implications for democracy in NC are a lot more serious and scary than that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what could possibly be in those documents that would put to rest the myriad concerns about conflicts of interest marring his administration?

Experts I spoke to say any arrangement in which Trump continues to involve his children in his finances  the plan previously put forward by Trump's campaign  will fail to accomplish that task. Trump has compounded conflict concerns of late by moving to put his children in charge his fortune while still involving them in his soon-to-be presidency in a significant  and even unprecedented  way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Behind the overt anti-Trump push is a covert agenda: If the courts establish that individual electors can switch allegiances, supporting candidates other than those who win their states, it would inject so much uncertainty into the process that states may be willing to junk the Electoral College in favor of a popular-vote winner

I'm under no illusions that Clinton will be president, but it would be nice if this push results in our scrapping this asinine system.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...the snaggletooth dragonfish is about an inch long. Sutton said the fish doesn't get much bigger  most are similar in size to the minnow you'd find swimming around in a local lake.

Sutton said the fish likely doesn't have a sting (as some outlets have suggested), but is definitely scaleless. And the translucent fangs sticking out of the fish's mouth? They're used to catch food.

"When you live in the deep ocean not much food around you cant afford to miss a meal, and you gotta really get it," Sutton said. "That means their teeth are out of proportion to their size."

	<TEXT> The animal has strongly reduced eyes that lack pigment, and is thought to be blind. The "hairy" pincers contain filamentous bacteria, which the creature may use to detoxify poisonous minerals from the water emitted by the hydrothermal vents where it lives. This process is known as chemosynthesis. Alternatively, it may feed on bacteria, although it is generally thought to be a carnivore.

	<TEXT> Racket is the standard spelling of the word. Racquet is an alternative spelling used more commonly in certain sports (squash, racquetball, badminton) and less commonly in others (tennis).  Racket is the preferred spelling in tennis.  While some writers, especially those outside North America, prefer the French-influenced racquet, racket is the predominant spelling by a large margin, except among the occasional snobby Redditor such as the infamous Mr_Zoovaska.  Similarly, while some believe that racket came about as a misspelling of racquet, racket is in fact the older spelling: it has been in use since the 16th century, with racquet only showing up later in the 19th century as a variant of racket.  

Put that in your motherfucking pipe and smoke it.  First argument I've won in over a week, so please excuse the overreaction.

We've got to stand with those people and take on the 1 percent, take on the billionaire class and create a government and an economy that works for people."
