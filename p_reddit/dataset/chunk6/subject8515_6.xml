	<TEXT> You can't accurately make that comparison without knowing how many people on this sub rejoined the Church without unsubscribing (probably very few), how many people left the Church without joining this sub (probably tons), how many people the Church still counts among its membership despite their inactivity (pretty much all of them), etc.

But then it's not even a fair comparison, considering the Church has over 80,000 missionaries out teaching all over the world, and this sub has exactly zero. If you adjust the growth based on those modifiers, I think there's a clear winner here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought Dark Souls last June during a sale. It took me 10 hours to get to the Bell Gargoyles fight and another 2 hours to die enough times to give up completely.

I picked up the game again in August and played the series (DS1, DS2, and DS3) to completion over the course of the next month or so.

Today I started a new save as part of RTL, mostly just out of curiosity for how far I've come as a Dark Souls player.

Made it to Bell Gargoyles in about 2 hours, beat them on the first try. So unbelievably satisfying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every "fuck" that came out of the writer guy and producer lady (the two characters who have the conversation on the balcony) felt really forced and unnatural, right? I can't put my finger on whether it was the writing or the acting, or maybe it was both, but I cringed every time they said it. The nudity and violence felt completely earned and necessary, but so far the cursing seems to be there out of obligation more than anything else.

That being said, the episode was brilliant and I can't wait to see more. It's great that something as trivial as this is my biggest complaint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Spider-Man 2**

Finally decided to watch all the Spider-Man movies this week and this was not only the best of the bunch, but one of the best superhero films I've ever seen. Peter Parker struggling with his powers was handled well and Doc Ock was a fantastic villain.

**127 Hours**

God damn, what a harrowing piece of artistry. Entertaining as hell, though. Definitely the best I've ever seen James Franco; it's not every day you can watch a guy stand in one place for an hour and be completely engrossed. I've watched about 60 movies this year and this is easily in the top 10 of those. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know many will disagree with me on this, but one of the things I like least about the Souls games is having to run through so much of an area to get back to a boss fight. It makes the game harder but for me it's not in a fun way. I love the boss fights and want to be able to try them again instantly, so it kills my enthusiasm to have to memorize how to run through the level without getting hit, which usually isn't too difficult but becomes monotonous and puts too much of a gap between attempts. I wish they would put the boss bonfire right before the fog door instead of having it spawn once you complete the boss. That's just my opinion.

A boss rush mode would more or less solve this problem for me, because I wouldn't have to run through levels just to have a chance at fighting them. I think it's a great idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was an eye-opener for me on my mission. We committed my first new investigator to come to church, but he ended up not coming (supposedly he was sick but I'm 90% sure he was lying). Either way, that was my first Sunday in the ward, and it was so filled with weirdos and freaks that I was actually glad our investigator hadn't come. I knew that if I knew barely anything about the Church and walked into that ward, I would never go near the Church again.

This got me thinking: why would any of the groups in God's one true church be that way? So utterly repulsive and unattractive that there's no way you could ever get more people to join it? My companion said the Spirit would help. It didn't.

One of many shelf items I gained on my mission. </TEXT>
