I won't spend my cash on the repaints or rereleased new molds, but I'll continue to collect the "rare" exciting items that give me a thrill and leave me proud to see on my shelf. Thanks again everyone. Keep collecting and stay happy!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there any point in collecting Batman Funko Pop? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-13 01:21:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Batman is the Pop that got me into Funko Pop. I actually got a yellow bat symbol chest print error as my first ever pop, but at the time I didn't know anything about anything, so he sat on my dashboard, baking in the Texas sun for two years.

Between all the redesigns of old pops releasing and the massive amount of miscellaneous Batman Pops coming out, do you personally feel there is any point in continuing to collect? The rainbow Pop had me a little excited, but personally, those redesigns make me feel like the originals I collected aren't as valuable anymore, and lately I've been struggling to decide whether or not I'm even going to bother continuing the hunt for ol' Batsy Pops. How do you feel about it? </TEXT>
