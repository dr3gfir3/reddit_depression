	<TEXT>  what happens if it does not confirm in time?

It will either confirm or get dropped from the network, usually within about 72 hours either way.

If it confirms, the coins go to the intended recipient.

If it gets dropped, you still have the coins.

Try to get your transaction submitted at https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/

ViaBTC takes a financial hit to help users in this situation.

If you control the recipient address, try making a new transaction with a much higher fee to encourage miners to pick up both transactions.

Not that it helps now, but https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ is good for estimating transaction fees.

Sorry for the wait. </TEXT>

Lastly, there is no spam attack, this delay is caused by Bitcoin growing while a certain faction refuses to increase the max block size. </TEXT>

Statistically, 20 minutes is not a large deviation from the standard block time of 10 minutes.

But for what it's worth, there is a large portion of the community deeply concerned by the number of noobs who are being confused by or turned off by Bitcoin because of confirmation times much, much greater than 20 minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Does transferring larger amounts require more confirmations?

That's up to what you consider to be 'secure'.

 Also, does each confirmation take the same transaction fee?

No, but fees are best estimated in satoshis/byte and transactions with a lower fee in terms of satoshis/byte will take longer to confirm.

See https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

 Also, does each confirmation take the same transaction fee? For example, if my transaction requires 6 confirmations and the fee is 1%, am I basically paying 6% in fees?

That's not how it works. You only pay the fee once. It wouldn't quite make sense if someone made a transaction in block 1 and then they had to pay a fee going forward for each of the next 450,000 blocks.

 Also, since I like to prepare for the worst-case-scenario...what happens if I forget to put a transaction fee, or it's super low? How long will my bitcoins be hung up?

The transaction will either get confirmed or get dropped from the network (nullifying the transaction) usually within about 72 hours.

Submit the transaction number to https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ and they will prioritize your transaction.

 I just read a post dated a few years ago saying that people are frustrated over breadwallet's fees being too low. Is this still the case?

Check https://bitcoinfees.21.co/ beforehand and use https://www.viabtc.com/tools/txaccelerator/ if it's still not confirming.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dear Blockstream,

I hereby submit this formal application for the position of CEO of Blockstream.

I will contribute twice as much code to the Bitcoin code base compared the current CEO.

I will pooppost on Reddit twice as much as the current CEO.

I will vanquish twice as many of Roger's paid shills compared to the current CEO.

I will appear to be twice as clueless as the current CEO.

I will do this all for half the salary of the current CEO.

Please see my post history for a comprehensive list of my experience.

Thank you for your careful consideration.

	<TEXT> https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5ukzfr/segwit_is_a_softfork_to_miners_without_supporting/ on both sub-reddits https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5ukz58/segwit_is_a_softfork_to_miners_without_supporting/ and to note that on r/btc it has been downvoted to page-4 whereas on r/bitcoin it is 2nd post on 1st page below an obviously popular price moon post.

Some have claimed that technically brigade downvoting and bot downvoting is not censorship but if you effectively hide content from view rather than allowing people to discuss it, how are people going to be informed or participate in discussion here. you dont have to downvote things. the answer to speech you dont like is more speech not censorship.

I agree that both deletion of posts and heavy downvoting of posts both lead to decreased visibility.

However, someone calling downvoting censorship and trying to make downvoting comparable to outright deletion indicates (to me) either disingenuity or lack of critical thinking skills. I don't mean that as an attack, but I really see no other way to interpret this.

I have been following the Bitcoin community for many years now, and the main reasons I believe you are consistently downvoted are:

* Disingenuous comments (or at least comments that seem to lack any genuine good faith)
* Irrational comments   logical fallacies (shifting of goal posts as a prime example, but many others as well)
* Refusal to loudly and clearly acknowledge and denounce the deletion of posts and comments in r\Bitcoin
* Refusal to compromise with any blocksize change

I think it would be beneficial to take a step back and seriously think about why your posts are being downvoted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What if a different worst case scenario is confiscation of gold or any other currency with a physical presence?

**Executive Order 6102** is a [United States presidential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States) [executive order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order_(United_States%29) signed on April 5, 1933, by President [Franklin D. Roosevelt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt) "forbidding the Hoarding of [gold coin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_coin), gold [bullion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_bullion), and [gold certificates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_certificate) within the continental United States". The effect of the order, in conjunction with the statute under which it was issued, was to criminalize the possession of monetary gold by any individual, partnership, association or corporation.

That's open to interpretation obviously and an average transaction fee graph generated from both of them would be nice. Dare I say it'd be nice if blockchain.info did it automatically, though I think there's some irony there at both of our expense.

It's on my list of graphs to make using the CSV data on those pages. It'd be nice if someone else could beat me to it, but if not I'll get to it eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The median fees provided on every one of these threads, including this one in rbitcoin, isn't enough for you?

https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/5maxng/the_median_bitcoin_transaction_fee_in_jan_2017_is/?sort=confidence

I'm well aware of that post and no, it's not enough for me. It's some person posting a picture and some numbers on Twitter and everyone taking his word for it. There is no data source or method of calculation listed.

https://bitcoinfees.21.co/

This is great for any point in time, but there doesn't seem to be any historical data here. (please correct me if this is inaccurate)

Actually, if you know any good online sources that have all past individual transaction and their fees or have historical daily median transaction fees listed, I'd really appreciate a pointer. Or a good utility for doing the same with a local blockchain copy.

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How is transaction volume trivial?

 The graph linked was for total fees paid.

 Day 1 has 1,000 trades but day 1000 has 10,000 trades. More trades = more fees.

 Completely relevant to the discussion.

Trivial to do or demonstrate. I apologize for any confusion.

If you'd really like to see this, all you have to do is go to the exact same website that /u/mcgravier linked to.

Look, here it is: https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions?timespan=all daysAverageString=7

That was easy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So like I say, you used the mean from a heavily skewed distribution. You're analytical approach is bad and people have explained why it's bad many many times before.

 I may not agree with removing your post, but it is a misleading headline based on crappy crude analysis. So I can understand why they would do it.

Average is a well-defined mathematical function. If anyone finds it misleading, I suggest some quick Googling. Others are free to interpret its meaning in context.

I also think it's telling that the same post you made here in r/btc has a tiny fraction of the votes and comments that this post has. So people seem much more interested in the "CENSORSHIP IN R/BITCOIN" aspect than they do in the crude miscalculation of transaction fees.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5okq9e/358_cents_average_transaction_fee_so_far_in_2017/) currently with 74 net upvotes? I do agree that any number can be a fraction of another number. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hi please use the 'median' transaction fee. Averages are a bad metric because its effected by outliers easily.
 https://blockchain.info/tx/d38bd67153d774a7dab80a055cb52571aa85f6cac8f35f936c4349ca308e6380
 PS I feel sorry for the guy :(

HI please calculate the 'median' transaction fee and let us know what it works out to.

For the average without that single high fee transaction:

This is a valid point and I encourage you to run the numbers to get an exact answer.

For a rough estimate, [I calculated this already on the 7th of January](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/5mra3x/42_cents_average_transaction_fee_so_far_in_2017/dc5psy3/
), and it lowered the average by less than 3 cents. With more than double the total 2017 transactions 9 days later, this would have an effect of just under 1.5 cents.

So without that transaction, the Average Transaction Fee so far in 2017 would be about 34.3 cents.

Please run the numbers yourself if a completely precise answer is desired. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also obligatory comment that the transaction fees for 2017 so far are messed up because someone paid 50BTC for a single transaction by mistake. Messes with the data.
