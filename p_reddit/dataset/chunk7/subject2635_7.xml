	<TEXT> We'd have to be pretty liberal with the definition of "reasonably" to consider that battle reasonably accurate. Don't get me wrong, I love the book, but Brooks clearly wrote that scene as a satiric criticism of the US government, much like he satirized mainstream media elsewhere in the book. 

The military can have problems fighting the *next* war, but gets pretty good at certain fighting styles when they've been training for it. For example, William Westmoreland was the WWII war hero that was put in charge of Vietnam. He treated Vietnam like WWII, and thought that it could be fought like a conventional war. In other words, he tried to fight a war of attrition against guerilla forces that didn't have the common decency to join us in a fair fight so we could blow them up. 

In the book, Brooks says that's the type of war that they tried to fight at Yonkers and that's why it was a failure. The problem is that the military had been fighting in a COIN (Counter Insurgency) environment for the ten years leading up to Yonkers. That's specifically addressed in the book, when Brooks mentions the years of 'brushfire' wars that had sapped the administration's political capital. 

So assuming the military followed its own regulations, training, planning processes and experience, it would have planned the battle very differently. Evaluating the adversary is built right into the planning process, and there was certainly plenty of time to do so. So they would have known that they don't need anti-air defenses, but they DID need overwatch and antipersonnel weapons. I'd go so far as to say that the humans would have the advantage. If you're planning the 'when' and 'how' of a battle, you have the luxury of prestaging every weapons platform and ammunition for it. 

I'm not saying the way things were presented is impossible. It COULD happen that way, but it would take major failures and oversights at every single level for it to have gone the way it was written. So I think we're left to take it as Brooks seems to have intended it: not necessarily accurate, but entertaining and thought-provoking. 

But it doesn't really matter. It was an awesome scene anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You probably would, and that's a good thing. 

Let's say you punch a coworker in a back room somewhere. No witnesses, but they report it. You actually did it, but your company doesn't know for sure right away. 

They have three options: fire you, stop paying you until they investigate, or remove you from the environment until they can determine what's going to happen to you.

1 and 2 seem unreasonable. What if you were being falsely accused? You shouldn't be fired, and it wouldn't be fair that you weren't paid while they determined you were innocent. So you're moved somewhere else or told to go home while they decide your fate. You're not being punished before your guilt is determined and you can't try to influence the investigation by threatening witnesses or calling in favors. Even the guilty... ESPECIALLY the guilty... deserve a fair process.

Putting police on administrative leave should, ideally, give them a fair review while limiting their ability to influence the investigation. I'm not saying it's a perfect process that should be applied to all situations. I'm only saying that it's not designed to be an award. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not agreeing with it, but just providing a counterpoint.

The justification may be that many (most?) officers undergo additional training that other drivers do not. Much like why soldiers are unrestrained in the back of a five-ton truck driven by a (sometimes) trained operator.

That doesn't control other drivers, of course, but I would assume that police deaths due to traffic accidents in a **non-emergency** situation would be lower than the statistical average among all drivers. 

Perhaps, at some level, the decision was made that the remaining risk is acceptable when compared to the risk of getting physically close to a suspect to out their belt on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're referring to the first-sale doctrine, which allows someone to distribute (normally physical) copyrighted works after the transfer of ownership. CDs and books are specifically addressed in this law. 

Digital copies and transmissions aren't quite as clear, because there's no actual transfer of the work. The recipient receives a copy, but the rights to it don't transfer the same way as it does with a physical object. More specifically, the first sale doctrine does not apply if possession is obtained without actually acquiring ownership. 

So, it's complicated and the law needs to be updated to reflect new technologies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The complex political and social environments between two nations are not compatible, you're right about that. 

But that's not what I claimed.

I said that it is not difficult to build and detonate explosives. The fact that they are rarely used in the united States is not relevant, because ability and execution are very different things. 

Perhaps we have different opinions on how easy it is to build an explosive device. Difficulty is a relative concept. But recall that the explosives used is Paris were described as "[easy to build](http://www.techinsider.io/paris-attack-tatp-chemical-bombs-2015-11)". 

Perhaps, also, we're thinking about different types of explosives. Daisy-chained shape charges with victim-detonated triggers are fairly complex. PVC pipe filled with black powder and pellets are not complex nor difficult to build. Neither are pressure cooker bombs. Neither are truck-carried fertilizer bombs. But each have been successfully used in the US and worldwide. 

I'm not disputing your claim that bombings are uncommon. All I'm saying is that we can't honestly characterize homemade bombs as difficult to build or deploy. More complicated than pulling a trigger, certainly, but still an option (and tactic) successfully used by violence aficionados all over the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I see where the confusion is. I said:

So you're right that rural and wealthy areas should have lower crime and murder rates. And they do, assuming that the entire nation isn't exactly the same. Our rates are significantly skewed by inner city and gang violence. 

My intention was to address homicide rates. I can see how that was unclear outside of the context of this thread. So I agree that general crime rates can be worse in rural areas, but I'll clarify my point to reduce the understandable confusion: homicide rates are higher in cities than in rural areas. 

Thanks for prompting me to better communicate my point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally speaking, that's true. I technically live in Baltimore and have never had any problems at all. But when you get into the "blue light" areas, you tend to find more crime. It's not because the people there are all bad, but because there are many factors that contribute to increased crime rates in those areas. 

Related to the topic at hand, your link does conclude that "the risk of homicide is greater in big cities than it is in the countryside" and the safety difference is largely due to automobile accidents. Per capita, you're still more likely to be a victim of violent crime in a city. More so in the inner cities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For your metaphor to be accurate, we can't pretend there's only one tower. If that was the case, then we could just close it down and consider the problem solved! Instead, we have to imagine that there are already many, many towers and we have already lost the ability to close them all down. That's a more analogous to the gun control debate, because the guns are already in our inner cities. 

So let's pretend that people keep falling off tall trees. There are millions of tall trees in the country, and we can't reasonably expect to be able to close them all down. Just like the gun control debate, where we can't reasonably expect to make all the guns go away. Unless you can think of a way- better minds than me have been trying to think of one for a long time. You say it's easy to limit access to guns... how would you suggest we go about doing that? 

So, if people kept falling out of these trees and I knew I couldn't reasonably or quickly stop them from climbing them, I would look at other factors that I could control which would be likely to have a demonstrable impact. If I found that people from certain areas were more likely to die this way than others, wouldn't I focus on the issues that are causing them to climb up, rather than worrying about what the guy in the mojave desert is doing?

This metaphor got a little weird, but I think you see the point. 

You're right that the simplest solution should go first. And identifying why certain areas are more prone to gun violence may be the key to figuring out what that is. I'm pretty sure that MORE gun laws (or, as you seem to be suggesting, confiscations) will not be the easiest of the potential solutions. 

Good thought process though, overall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It certainly is. My point is that it's not the *only* factor, like some people try to suggest. 

Out of all the factors, I think that availability of guns is one of the *most* difficult to influence. The guns are already in the inner cities, and we have a criminal element related to the cartels that brings more in to the southern states. More laws won't significantly change those facts- not when those that are more likely to use guns for criminal acts are, in fact, criminals. 

But there are many factors that are directly related to violence rates- ones that can be statistically attributed, which is at least suggestive. We can start addressing socioeconomic factors, for example, which would reduce homicide rates a lot faster than this endless national debate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a tricky one. 

When someone is on psychiatric medication, there is *already* a mental health concern. Did the medication cause the criminal act? Did it contribute? Would they have done it without he medication? Did the medication lessen the chances of doing such a thing? 

It would be difficult to blame the drug when their mental state is already an issue. It's like the dog that barks at his food because it burns his tongue, who tries it later to find that it's cooler. Of course, the dog reasons, barking at food cools it. Or, to out it another way, I don't think such a link could be positively established.

	<TEXT> Except you're looking at the nation as though it's the same everywhere, which ignores some of the contributing factors. 

Violent crime rates in the US are much higher, per capita, than the rural and stronger economic areas. Let's use the national average as our baseline: 4.5 annual murders per 100,000 people (2013 numbers). Baltimore, as an example, had a rate last year ten times higher than that. 

Compare that number to Napa, California which is wealthy and relatively rural- the type of place that you describe. It had one murder in 2011. I can't find more recent data, but I think that illustrates the point.

So you're right that rural and wealthy areas should have lower crime and murder rates. And they do, assuming that the entire nation isn't exactly the same. Our rates are significantly  skewed by inner city and gang violence. 

In fact, according to the FBI,  gang's uses of guns have increased steadily since the 1980s and homicides in general during the commission of a crime (in other words, by those ready committing a crime and who will be unlikely to follow gun laws) have increased by 50% between 1985 and 2005. 

So there certainly is a problem and the gun-related deaths in the US is higher than other nations. That's a fact. However we can't afford to look at the problem in a vacuum, which some people are doing for political purposes. We have to look at WHERE these crimes are happening and consider what factors are contributing to these statistics.

One time, years back, I ordered The Chronic by Dr. Dre. Yes, believe it or not you could still find records in the early 90s. By mistake, they sent me one of Dr. John's jazz albums.

I listened anyway, because I like jazz. But a few minutes in I started getting light-headed and dizzy. An hour later I was in the hospital.

That's why it really is that serious. People can die if you get their doctor's records mixed up. </TEXT>

I don't think the plumber intentionally tried to block the claim. Or, at least, I don't see why he would. My choice of words was bad, I think. It sounds to me like the warranty company just grabbed onto anything that they could to deny the claim, even if it wasn't related to the actual fault.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, thanks for the reply!

Normally, I would agree with you. However, the plastic bits (if there were any) would have only gotten in the valve- the very same part that failed in the first place and will need to be replaced. So it wouldn't actually change the repair process at all, since I have that entire piece sitting by the tub waiting to be installed! 

I guess it feels a little bit like having your gas tank crack and going in to have it replaced, but having them refuse to do it because dirt got in the tank. If the tank's being replaced anyway, the dirt isn't going to make that any more difficult. 

Now that I think about it, that's a pretty crappy metaphor. But you get what I'm saying, lol

At my old home, we made pretty good use of the warranty. This place is just... just awful.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Maryland] [Update] Home warranty company denied claim for a second time, even though part is covered. The plumber told them that the damage was due to 'abuse'. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-22 16:33:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> e: my title sucks. The plumber didn't use the word 'abuse.' He said that I stripped a part unrelated to the covered part. The warranty company denied the claim based on that citing 'abuse.' 

First post was [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3yjc31/maryland_more_problems_with_the_house_this_time/)

The home warranty company now acknowledges that the damaged part is covered- it's the valve, which they acknowledge. They talked to the service provider (the plumber that they sent out, who first incorrectly told them it was the faucet) who told them that a plastic nut was stripped by me. That part is true- it's the plastic ring that comes on and off and tightens down the faucet. Every time you take it off or tighten it, it wears down a little bit. So the manufacturer sent a new one so I wouldn't have to worry about it. All's good so far. The valve was leaking before I tried to tighten that, and it was leaking before the plumber checked it and messed with it, too. That is not the cause of the leaking, and even the plumber acknowledges that is not the cause. 

When the warranty company called the plumber, they told them about that piece. The company used that to deny the claim entirely, saying that we invalidated the warranty by stripping the piece (in the presence of the plumber). It's not stripped, but the plumber defended ~~his~~ their position (edit: I have no idea why) by saying that any bits of plastic that came off "might" have gotten in the valve and make it harder to fix. That's ridiculous, since the manufacturer sent out a whole new valve assembly, so it would all be replaced at once anyway. 

The terms of the warranty are [here](http://www.longandfosterwarranty.com/id.lasso?tid=263).

I understand that they can use technicalities to their advantage- I get that I might be screwed on that piece. But something about this doesn't smell right. Have they done anything wrong, from a legal perspective? Can I go through small claims court to compel them to fix the covered part?

Edit: The part of the warranty that they cited reads: " the Agreement does not cover failures which may result from other causes, such as without limitation: abuse". The failure was not the result of any abuse, and it was a problem before the plumber even came out. How could that piece even be an issue if the entire piece is going to be replaced by the part the manufacturer sent out? There was no abuse and the fault was not caused by taking off that part.

	<TEXT> Nope. in 1856, the Supreme Court ruled that law enforcement officers had no duty to protect any individual- that they were chartered to uphold the laws in general, but that they have no specific duty to protect or serve any person. This was revisited in in 1982 when the Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit held, "...there is no Constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen."

UC Berkley studied considered this question in 1984, when they noted, "The Williams court assumed that there is no general duty to aid another, that police officers owe only a duty to the public at large, and that the police hence have no legal duty to aid a citizen in distress. As a result, the court applied the Good Samaritan doctrine to the officers' actions." The authors disagreed with the court's opinion on that case, but noted that police officers (specifically, in that case, california highway patrol officers) have no duty to assist in traffic accidents or other emergency situations.

In other words, police officers are chartered to serve the state and uphold laws in general. They don't have a specific obligation to protect and serve anyone. Our taxes pay them to uphold the laws established by the state. If you want specific protection, sometimes that costs extra. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a decent point, actually. I used to work with children, and I've seen both types. The problem is that sometimes it can be difficult to tell one from the other, since it can be hard to gauge intent. But sometimes, there are those exactly like you describe: those that *choose* not to put in the effort to care for their children. Often times (but not all the time), child protective services can get involved which may result in the children being removed from the home.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been ten years since I was overseas, so maybe things have changed since then, but the overriding guidance was that you are to take whatever measures you feel are necessary to protect your life and those of your battle buddies. 

We were trained that the ROE is intended to avoid conflict whenever possible, deescalate situations that can be deescalated and avoid innocent deaths whenever possible. If I remember right, the process is:

**Shout** a warning or verbal direction. For example, if someone's walking towards to your convoy, tell them to back up before they get close. 

**Show** that you're armed and willing to fire if necessary

**Shove**. If possible, use non-lethal force

**Shoot** if you have to. And we're trained to shoot to stop the threat- it's not shoot to kill. But two in the center mass often ends up doing that anyway

I remember being stopped near the Tigris once. I was in the turret of a guntruck manning a mounted .50cal. Suddenly these kids pop up out of nowhere and start running towards the trucks. They were fast, and there were a lot of them carrying bags. I don't know if it was true or not, but we were warned about insurgents using kids as walking bombs. That was a good use of the ROE. They were trying to sell us water (freshly bottled from the river). 

So the ROE could be seen as putting lives in danger, and it could be seen as trying to reduce deaths among noncombatants. All that I know is that I fired if fired on, and I would try to act legally and morally while protecting my life and those that depended on me to watch their back. If that meant firing first, I would fire first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fully support training police officers to better recognize and handle people with mental illnesses, but I think that it's often to late by the time they have that encounter. Our mental health system as a whole needs to be better funded and intervention needs to be the priority. 

According to the National Coalition for the Homeless, up to 25% of homeless people have some form of 'severe' mental illness. For homeless families, mental illness is a factor in 12% of cases. If we can start talking that problem, we can improve the quality of life for an incredible number of people and families. Those that couldn't function effectively in society may be able to not only function within it, but materially contribute to it as well. And, as a result, there will be fewer police interactions when proper treatment has been started. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on vacation, and making passionate, sweaty love to my wife. This was new for us, as our lovemaking tended to be brief and purely functional. But I attributed the refreshing change to the romantic locale and thrill of going on our first vacation in years.

Mid thrust, I noticed something odd about her skin. A flake- not unusual in and of itself, but out of place given her usual, nearly obsessively maintained appearance. 

I flicked at it, but it didn't move. I pulled, and it finally came free. Her skin, however, looked even more unusual after that. Loose somehow. Uneven. I pulled again. She didn't seem to notice, but her skin was now coming off in large, fleshy chunks. And that's when I noticed the hair, which seemed to be growing under her otherwise delicate facial features. My heart froze. I knew then who was under the mask.

Jackman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you were to put something down loud enough to make a point, but not quite slamming it, what would that be called? For example, in movies when a cop puts his badge on the chief's desk and slides it to him, he doesn't quite slam it but very precisely puts it where he wants it. 

edit: thanks, all. I think the right word is in here :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my not-a-lawyer understanding, laws are in place that could be applied to this case, yes. However, extraterritorial laws and issues involving military dependents can be very complex. The experts- the ones that deal with this sort of thing all the time- would be found in the post's JAG office. Also, if you haven't talked to them already, your parents might be able to help you understand what has happened and what could happen. 

Your friend has to understand that this might not just go away if she ignores it. Yes, the person that filmed it doesn't seem to care and likely would do it to someone else given the opportunity. But who knows how many people received it? Did any of them save it? Have they posted it anywhere else? Did the original filmer keep a copy, and does he plan on doing anything else with it? Those are things that she might want to consider.
