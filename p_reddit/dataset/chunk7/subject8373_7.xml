	<TITLE> Looking for used 2008 Mazda 3 2.3L engine </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-17 04:30:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

Just confirmed some bad news that I suspected for awhile. My 2008 Mazda 3 has either a cracked head or blown head gasket. :( A mechanic that I trust told me he thinks it's probably a cracked head since the coolant is leaking into the oil so slowly. 

So now I have the option of having them take the engine apart, checking for a bad head gasket or sending the head to a machine shop to check for cracks. Or I can buy a used engine and feel more confident that the problem will be gone. 

Does anybody have a first gen 2.3L they are parting out? I'm located in Santa Barbara, CA. Anywhere in California would be ideal. 

Would anybody have tips on finding a used engine? Is eBay trustworthy? Or should I exclusively look at junkyards and used part shops around here? 

Thanks in advance. 

Edit: Forgot to mention I have an AT </TEXT>

How much coolant did you drain?

Did you replace the coolant with new or catch it and put it back in after? 

I just flushed the coolant about 8 months ago so I don't really need to replace all my coolant. I ordered the thermostat and a gallon of coolant anyway in case I spill some.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you fully drain the coolant? I just flushed my coolant in December, so another flush would be unnecessary. I'm thinking about using a new drain pan and putting the drained coolant back in to the reservoir after. I've been reading and it seems like about a gallon comes out. I might just buy another gallon anyway in case I spill. 

Also, do you have any tips on burping the system afterwards? I had a bad overheating problem because of a bubble after I did the coolant last time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Car: 2008 Mazda 3 S 2.3L 

I've been getting this CEL for a few months now and clearing it with my code reader, hoping it would just go away, (I know, I've been lazy) but it keeps popping up whenever I accelerate hard when the engine is still cold. Usually happens when getting on the freeway and the engine hasn't warmed up all the way. I also noticed that my MPG have gone done a bit with city driving. My heater still works perfectly fine. My temperature gauge always sits right in the middle, and it takes about 5 minutes of driving to get it there. That seems pretty normal, right? If my thermostat was stuck open or taking too long to open, would the temperature needle reflect that at all? I'm thinking that it's taking longer than the ECU likes to warm up. 

I replaced the thermostat and the coolant temperature sensor in December of last year with parts from O'Reillys. After reading on some forums, I now know that I should have went with OEM for the thermostat. 

Does this code usually mean I'm due for a new OEM thermostat? Anybody else have some experience with this code?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dad's early 90's Bianchi Virata in storage for 20 years. Is it worth fixing up? </TITLE>

My dad has a an old Bianchi Virata that has been sitting in storage for about 20 years. He said I can have it since he has no use for it. My mom told me that my dad only rode it a few times and never rode it again. Haha I asked and he confirmed. 

As you can see from the pictures, it's really dirty, but I'm assuming it's in good shape since it's been in storage. He said there's no rust. I haven't gotten to check it out in person yet since I live far away. I was planning on picking it up next time I go home. He doesn't know exactly what the frame size is, but he's about the same size as me. Hopefully he bought the correct size for himself! 

Does anybody have any knowledge on the bike? Is it worth the time and effort to fix it up? 
I recently bought a 1984 Centurion Comp TA, seen here: https://i.imgur.com/jmXdu0t.jpg
I'm wondering which would be better to keep? Unfortunately, I only have room for one bike. :(

	<TITLE> Need advice on choosing a 2 bike hitch rack </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-27 00:16:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi,

I'm looking for a 2 bike 1 1/4 inch hitch platform rack to put on my 2008 Mazda 3. I'm looking to spend around $200 USD. I'll be carrying two older road bikes, between 20-30 lbs each. I don't bike all the time, so I'll be putting it on and removing it every time I use it, which will probably be maybe once a week or less. 

Here are a few racks I'm considering:

Swagman XTC 2
https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-...an/S64670.html

Swagman Chinook
https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-...an/S64683.html

Saris Freedom 2
https://www.etrailer.com/Hitch-Bike-...s/SA4412B.html

Does anyone have recommendations and/or experience with these racks? I'm leaning towards the Chinook right now since it has the tilting function and comes with the locking hitch pin. (Something I was going to buy anyways if I bought the XTC 2) 

Also, how much does the weight of the rack come into play? I see that the Saris Freedom 2 only weighs about 20 pounds where as the Swagmans I believe are in the 30s. The chinook might possibly be in the 40s actually. I figure weight only really affects how easy it is to install and remove the rack. 10-20 pounds probably won't affect MPG too much.

	<TEXT> Hi,

I'm fairly new to biking, and I seem to be having problems with my Comp TAs friction shifter. The cable seems really tight when attempting to shift to lower gears. I loosened the cable a bit, to the point where the cable was sagging in 6th gear. I shifted all the way to 2nd gear and the lever automatically springs back up and goes back to 6th gear. What could be causing this? 

I'm not a bike expert and this is really frustrating me. I want to learn how to maintain my new bike, but this all seems so alien to me and watching videos and reading doesn't seem to help. 

Somebody please help me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The bike actually ended up being 50cm, which is the perfect size for me. No need to sell! I bought some new tires for it. It's been great so far! There are some little things wrong, like the brakes need to be adjusted and it doesn't seem like the bike wants to stay in 1st-4th gears. It seems like the cables are too tight or something and pulls the lever back to 5th or 6th gear. 

I was recently talking to my dad and he said he has a really nice road bike from the 80s/90s that he only rode a few times he said he would give me. It's been sitting in storage since then, and since he and I are the same size, I'm hoping the bike fits. He thinks it's an old Italian bike, maybe a Bianchi? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, just saw this. I've ridden it about 4 times, a 10 mile round trip ride was the longest. I'm fairly new to biking, especially vintage road bikes, but I really like it! It's a lot lighter than other older steel frames I've looked at and it's fast. I put some new tires on it and I need to fix a problem going on with the lever that controls the rear derailer. For some reason, it seems like the bike wants to stay in 5th or 6th gear. When I shift all the way down, I have to hold the lever or it'll try and switch to 5th or 6th. 
I found a perfect condition Centurion Accordo for my gf, so we've been riding around town and it's been really fun.  </TEXT>
