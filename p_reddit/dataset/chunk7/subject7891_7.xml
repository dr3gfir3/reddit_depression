	<TEXT> Okay, well to address your examples: Lawrence of Arabia is a "great" biopic because of an outstanding performance from Olivier, fantastic setting and cinematography, and it's just a plain old good story; Jaws is a "great" creature feature because Spielberg understands how to take a relatively niche genre and reinvent it as something mainstream, and because of the influence his techniques have had on that genre ever since; The Godfather is a "great" gangster movie because it's not really a gangster movie at all but rather a dynastic drama with a rich script and career-making performances.

Do you see my point? There are so many different criteria that you're going to find it very difficult to pick one and say "if a film does this it's great, and if it doesn't, it's not." Even with celebrated auteurs like Kubrick or Welles, their filmographies cover a wide range of genres and styles and it's problematic to try to reengineer a formula from them. That's why they are considered "great" film-makers rather than, say, talented genre movie directors (like Michael Bay or JJ Abrams who are both very good at basically one thing).

There's a difference between being able to make excellent movies of one type over and over again, and being able to take the language and technique of film and turn it to whatever aspect of human existence you want to explore.

But to get back to your original question regarding whether goodness/greatness is objective or subjective, I would suggest that this is generally a consensus play. Of course all art and entertainment is subjective. That's what the Artistic Bargain is all about - because it happens in your brain and the artist can only create the stimulus. You have to bring the response. But if enough people perceive that there is something special about a particular piece, that tends to become "considered great". 

And note that that consensus doesn't always get it right and often goes back and reconsiders because audience expectations change and it's sometimes difficult to spot what a truly game-changing film is doing until after the fact. Look at the original critical response to Alien, which was lukewarm at best, largely because most of the reviewers were not looking for a reinvention of tried-and-trusted b-movie/horror picture tropes. Now it's considered a seminal work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your main issue here is what you mean by "good". Entertaining? Enjoyable? Exciting? Beautiful? Insightful? Passionate? Intense? Profound? Does it need an exceptional script, performance, cinematography, lighting, score, visual effect, choreography? Can a documentary be "good"? What about experimental, conceptual, abstract and non-narrative film?

I think one could build a good argument around a given film being objectively good/rich/effective/striking/successful etc. on any of these criteria, but just "good" is far too vague. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pink Floyd: The Wall uses a variety of shots and audio snippets from The Dambusters. I always wanted to find out if they synced up if you played the two films together, but could never be bothered to actually try it. My pet theory is that the narrative "now" of The Wall is Pink (played by Bob Geldof) sitting in his hotel room watching The Dambusters before the gig and both reminiscing about the past and fantasising about the future (neither in a good way, you understand). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "...it's a dialect, and not an accent. The distinction is technical as well as political: Immigrants have accents, natives have dialects; an accent is something you try to lose, a dialect is something you use to define your cultural and geographical heritage. "

Uhhhmmmmmmmmmm no. A dialect consists in the words you use; an accent is the way you pronounce them. Pronouncing "man" in any way at all is an accent. Replacing "man" with another word (eg. "blood", "dude" etc) would be a feature/indicator of dialect. 

Both serve to define geographic, cultural and class identity. And both can be "lost" or "exaggerated" as situations require - for example it is often cited that women in groups of same-gender strangers will modify their accent and dialect towards the regional standard and "up" the class scale to enhance status, while men will modify away from the regional standard and "down" the class scale to achieve the same thing - the assumption (which I question) being that women want their peers to see them as sophisticated and men want their peers to see them as down-to-earth.

In any case, researchers would need to argue that eg. "mahn" is a different word from "man", with different etymological roots and connotative connections, in order for this particular set of linguistic features to be called a "dialect". I think that would be quite hard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're thinking of the scene with Rachael and Deckard in the grounded Spinner driving off into the sunset smiling insipidly at each other. The helicopter shots from Kubrick's B-roll are in the Final Cut if I remember correctly (and I watched it on Sunday). Also, Scott claims he was totally onboard with the VoiceOver  after poor initial test screening feedback and gets upset when people say it was imposed by the studio. It was Ford who hated it (and is quite obviously phoning it in throughout). (Source: "Dangerous Days: Making Blade Runner" which is 3.5 hours long, on the Blu Ray Final Cut Disk 2 and completely fascinating.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I remember correctly, he draws left-handed from his left side - ie. pushes the scabbard behind him and turns his left thumb away from his body.

I'm doing the same thing for Halloween this year (shhhh don't tell  anyone), but I don't have a Buttercup and my rapier is not screen-accurate as I already have a blunt one for Western Martial Arts use. It's also too long - 43" so I keep tripping over it. Would love to buy a DPR copy, but they're all sharp and you tend to get a lot of interest from the police if you wander round in public with a blade longer than 3" in the UK :( 

I'll be carrying out the facial topiary as late as possible...

	<TEXT> Absolutely agree. However, there is the non-linguistic part of experiencing the experience (with its attendant emotions and physiological reactions etc) and then there is the conscious/linguistic act of recognising and accepting that experience. I was trying (and failing) to describe how I got around re-triggering or re-experiencing each experience by avoiding "describing" it to myself in too much detail in this second part. The goal is to merge the two together so that it becomes less a linguistic process and more a natural, non-linguistic process that happens constantly. However, that's quite hard to put into writing and certainly beyond me on this sub! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I had trouble with this until I tried abstracting things to a wider category. For example, I would recognise "oh, I'm thinking about my ex" rather than "I'm thinking about my ex and how painful the breakup was and how if I'd only said that differently..." Etc. I realised that example 2 there was actually replaying the thought and therefore holding on to it, as opposed to observing and letting go. Don't know if that helps ... or even makes much sense! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know that feeling, friend. You get into a cycle of self-hatred and you get depressed. Might be worth talking to a doctor about it if this is a regular thing or if it's getting more intense. A fix could be as simple as a diet change.

However, in the meantime, recognise that:
1) while you may be acting badly, at least you're aware of it. This is Step One for everyone.
2) if you're treating the people you love badly, at least you have people that you love. This is not something to take lightly. You are capable of love and you genuinely want to treat these people better. That's a good thing.

Also,  your quest begins when you consider that the thing that is undesirable is not you but your behaviour. And that is something that it's much easier to contemplate changing than changing you. Having these feelings and behaving like this have a cause somewhere - psychological, chemical, hormonal, spiritual, I don't know. But these causes are addressable. That's (at least part of) what mindfulness is. It's about knowing what is and accepting it - maybe with a view to improving or modifying it - rather than wishing it were otherwise and just futilely railing against it because it's not. 

Lastly, try having some compassion for yourself. Not feeling sorry for yourself, but compassion. Imagine that it was someone you truly loved who was behaving like this. How would you feel towards them? Would you still be able to see the person underneath? Would you still love them even if you didn't like their behaviour? Would you turn your back on them or see their anguish and try to help? You are just as worthy of your own compassion as anyone else.

NON-BUDDHIST PRO TIP: when you do something you're not proud of, don't think of it as bad/awful/despicable, but rather as "a step backward" along the path to stopping this cycle. It's a subtle thing, but it really helped me to think of these things as temporary stumbles or setbacks rather than stains that I will bear forever. Honestly, that's also a much more accurate way to view them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an interesting reading. I do think I disagree with you though, and I'll tell you why: in the "first ending" you are identifying with the father very closely. You call out how brutal and shocking is the choice that the father has to make (I would call it a pragmatic choice rather than a moral one, though). But when you talk about the second ending, you have lost that identification and talk about it being all about "bad timing" as if you have stepped back out of the scene.

SPOILERS FOLLOW: Instead, I see the first ending as a tragic but pragmatic choice. They have given up hope. The mist goes on forever. They cannot survive. With only four bullets, only four of them can take the quick way out, so the father steps up and does the hardest thing - he shoots the other passengers including his son and steps outside the car to meet his fate, knowing that he has spared them the agony of being eaten or whatever.

But then he doesn't die. The mist clears. The soldiers turn up. The import of this is not that they all would have lived if he'd waited five minutes. The true horror is in the fact that he *now has to live with having killed his son*. He's never going to recover from that.

And if that weren't enough, we've also stepped from a nightmare world of monsters and violence where people killing other people is a matter of survival, back into the prosaic world where he hasn't just spared his passengers from a fate worse than death; he's just *murdered four people, including his son*. Here comes order and civilisation marching up the street. And that throws into sharp relief The Lord of the Flies -style breakdown of civilisation that took place in the supermarket and everything that followed. I think this is especially important when looking at the narrative that revolves around the crazy religious lady.

So, for me, the "Darth Vader scream" is the sound of the man he was realising the man he has been forced to become. It is the sound of his mind and soul irreparably shattering. And it makes the "first ending" even more brutal, shocking and brave by throwing it back into a naturalistic perspective. 

I think that was what Darabont was aiming for - to re-frame his essentially otherworldly/fantastical movie back into the real world and thereby shed a bright new light on all the hard choices he forced his characters to make, and in this particular case, to make those characters *own* the consequences of their actions. The Mist comes and the Mist goes - how do you live with what you did when it was here? </TEXT>
