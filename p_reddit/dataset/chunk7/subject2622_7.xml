	<TEXT> We watched a video about birth. It was right at the end of class, so he was trying to hurry... We ended up watching a doctor shove a baby back into a vagina on high speed rewind right as the bell rang. Then he said "That's the gist of it. Have a good afternoon." </TEXT>

I've been congratulated on getting married, having a baby, winning a pick-up truck, and bagging a trophy whitetail...

I've never met this man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm saying, there is no "do this and it's all better" scenario... The friendship with this girl is probably over, if it even existed in the first place. She shouldn't tolerate her boyfriend being a jerk to her "friend". For all I know SHE gave him the phone and they both sat there laughing at OP's expense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was maybe three, I accidentally stole a rubber key cover. I was wearing it as a ring. My mom marched me back into the store, made me give it back to the cashier and apologize. Of course, I was upset because my mom was angry. The cashier offered to give it to me and my mom wouldn't let her. 

My mom did this to all four of her kids with the first thing they stole...

We've never stolen anything else. </TEXT>
