	<TEXT> You can't bring those things in carry-on luggage. You can't bring guns in carry-on luggage either.

I'm speaking of before that was made into a rule. At one point in time you could bring liquids on in your carry on. Then one guy brought an explosive liquid and now you no longer can.

There's no good reason to prohibit someone from checking one in their luggage, and there's no good reason to prohibit someone from having one outside the secure area.

I understand your point but its always a tricky situation allowing guns into highly populated areas like airports. Ofc you want to allow someone to check their gun but at the same time these places become a target for mass murders. </TEXT>

I was stating if he did check his gun how are you going to check if he has a separate carry on or not?

	<TEXT> Maybe the red flag should have been that the only thing he checked was a gun with no carry on and not just that he had a gun.

That is so hard to check. How are you going to keep track of what every customer brings for a carry on.

But because one person does it it should be banned for everyone?

This is literally how the TSA runs. The entire reason you cant bring liquids on a plane is because one person had a liquid explosive.

The law won't prevent this in the future, it just means someone's going to start shooting before they get in the door or once they are out of it.

Very true. But I do argue that something should be done here. Guns have no place in or around an airport.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well... at every entrance there is at least one security guard. Ofc they still could of walked through but at very least a security guard might of noticed them. This guy literally went unnoticed until he started firing. Yes i understand the concept that murder is already illegal and banning guns wont stop murderers from getting them but this entire concept is about making it harder for the murderers to get into these crowded situations. As of now if a security officer sees a gun he has to question is that gun legal or not and is this person a threat or not. If you outright ban guns in airports that cuts reaction times down dramatically: If you see a gun disarm that person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> then if the grocery store refuses to sell you food because you don't pay your bills, then you're screwed.

Or you just go to a different grocery store... sounds like you're trying to create a community of debtors.

so you must somehow be selecting who you feel sorry for and who you don't.

Yes its called a conscience. 

So the government asks government for permission to go onto your property? Still shows who owns the property by who is giving permission. In a private property system, then the owner is the only person that can grant permission.

So say someone is running a meth lab out of their house in a residential neighborhood. Whose to stop them? Will it be perfectly fine since its on their property?

Assuming I didn't know it was a scam, then yes

And you believe a system like this will end up with a balanced society? Cause i can very easily see that turning into a couple people owning monopolies and swindling the rest of society until they are poor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but that's because I'm a capitalist. You don't want such a system, because you're a socialist.

If someone could just default on everything and have nothing happen to them why would they ever pay a bill?

Why do you care about helping the poor then? If you don't think your success is related to their failure, then why do you feel that you owe them anything?

Because i feel for other peoples struggles. I'm just a person who doesn't want to see people dying because of lack of food while others are just throwing food away.

So if a cop or code enforcement is on my property, then I can demand that he leaves? No, clearly not true. The owner always gets access to his property, therefore the government owns the property.

Unless they have a warrant you absolutely can demand that they leave.

 If someone left a trade worse, then they would be unhappy.

So if you get scammed but you left the trade happy its a win-win? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your argument here is that taxes are the price of services rendered. The problem however is that they are services that people don't ask for. So the natural response to not paying taxes is stop the delivery of services.

These services are things such as garbage removal and street cleanings, etc. They are not things that you can just say "no dont do my house".

Imagine for a second that this was to happen in capitalism, where an unpaid bill gave the service provider the right to seize whatever private property they wanted to pay the bill.

Thats often what happens now under capitalism. It may be the govt enforcing it but what you would rather have a situation where someone can default on a loan and have nothing happen?

OK fine. Do you feel any guilt for being born into a system that has kept your family richer than some other people?

Why do you have a fixation on guilt? No i do not. Guilt implies that you could of at one point done something to change the situation.

As long as government can seize anything it wants, that makes everything public property. At best "private" property today is people just renting things from government.

Not at all. You can demand that anyone you do not want on your property leaves your private property. There are far more rules to private property then you are aware of.

 You realize that a bank is powerless without a government court first approving everything? When the men with guns come to drag someone out of their home, it's government employees that hold the guns.

So what your solution would be to give the guns to the company's employees? Can't see any way that can go wrong.....

Right, it's win-win because you are happy when you walk away with a $200 bottle of water.

A win-win trade does not just mean that both parties are happy. It entails both parties coming out for the better which often does not happen in capitalism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just land, but any property. The government can seize anything it wants to. I can share videos of government stealing farmers milk for themselves to show that no private property can exist as long as government is allowed to take whatever it wants in the name of the public good.

I already stated that i don't think the govt should be confiscating things but this has nothing to do with govt activities and everything to do with corruption. But what does that have to do with taxes. They are not charging you for simply existing they are charging you for the services that they complete around you.

And yet you don't feel any guilt or responsibility for the system making you richer than them?

The system doesn't make you rich. The system can help keep you rich or help keep you poor but it does not decide for you.

That's because today's system isn't capitalism, so you can't use examples from today's system.

Today's system is absolutely capitalism. What do you think makes it not capitalism?

Foreclosures are carried out by government.

No... foreclosures are often carried out by a bank.

we respect each others property

Right there is where this moves into a fairy tale situation. A win-lose trade can happen anytime but an example would be if one person owns a monopoly on a needed good. Say there is only one lake of fresh water on this island and its on my land. Say the going price was $2 per bottle and one day i decide to change that to $200 per bottle. You would still need the water so you can call that new trade still a win-win but really I'd be taking advantage of you.

	<TEXT> Well true capitalism never existed either. So what are we living under right now?

True capitalism has absolutely existed. What we are living under now is capitalism with rules. Rules that have been designed after seeing previous failures of capitalism.

Right, so as long as government can tax and confiscate whatever property they want, then it's not private property. Private property means that it is out of reach of government or anyone else.

Private property has nothing to do with taxes. But i do agree with you that the govt should not be able to confiscate land.

Why were they poor in the first place? Was it the system or their own fault (i.e. lazy)? I would say it was the system.

Yes its the system. The system is designed to keep the poor poor.

As long as a trade is voluntary, then both people walk away happy. If someone wasn't happy, then they wouldn't make the trade.
Only government forces people to act in a trade that they don't want.

Absolutely not true. Plenty of corporations force people into situations that they would not like to be in. And just because someone is happy with a trade does not make it win-win.

Can you give an example where someone walks away with what they don't want?

Foreclosures. That's a prime example of a private entity taking your property to disclose your debt. But either way its not about what people want. You said capitalism is comprised of win-win trades. Win-win trades are not subjective. A win-win means that both people came out better than they were before. A majority of trades in capitalism do not pan out to a win-win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure you meant to say that, but it comes across as you want the poor to stay poor.

No i want the poor families to have access to facilities that would allow them to break out of the cycle of being poor.

Definition of capitalism: an economic system characterized by private or corporate ownership of capital goods, by investments that are determined by private decision, and by prices, production, and the distribution of goods that are determined mainly by competition in a free market

There is nothing in there about "win-win trading". Win-win trading is so rare that it could be considered a myth. In almost every trade you will have one loser. In capitalism whenever you expand your wealth you are taking it from someone else.

 Which is socialism, which is what has been happening for the past 100 years almost. The income gap is not a result of capitalism, but rather socialism.

False. True socialism has never existed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're weirdly reading guilt in a place where there is no guilt. I feel no guilt for being in the position I am in. I do know that I have had a good upbringing that has helped me a lot but I have put in a ton of work to be in the position I am in. The reason why I feel like the poor should have access to more is to ensure that their kids have access to everything they would need to bring themselves into a similar situation. You seem to have this idea that if we can not provide them with a similar experience to what people would pay for that we shouldn't even try to give them anything. I see that as just giving up.

We have data and studies that the income/wealth gap is widening each year.

The system (capitalism) is designed to widen the wealth gap. Capitalism with or without a govt overlooking it will eventually end up in a situation like we see today where 1% of the population owns a majority of the wealth. The middle class is unsustainable within capitalism. The most we can do is to subsidize the lower class to give them a better chance of sustaining a middle class.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't we agree that government did the worst possible thing?

No... Govt does not always do the worst possible thing. They might not do the best possible thing but worst is a stretch.

Why do you insist that it must be absolutely free, rather than just a minimal fee? By leaving a small fee, it allows us to eliminate taxation and therefore redistribution of wealth.

Cause a small fee would not allow you to eliminate taxation.

You admitted that they were not all that great compared to the paid museum experience. You seem to want to shove anything in front of a poor person, just so long as you appear to be giving them something.

No they are not great compared to paid museums but you get what you pay for. You have some weird misconceptions about money and valuation. 

You seem to have some obsession about the system rather than the results it brings. life for poor people would be much better without the oppression of government and a free museum doesn't make up for what was taken from them in the first place.

Govt does alot more for our poor population than free museums. There are plenty of organizations meant to provide support for those who are poor. I dont understand why you think life would get better for our poor population without a government...

 So I think you recognize that they have been screwed over by the system, so you have some guilt that you think will be made up for by making museums free.

I do realize that a lot of people have been screwed over by the system but the solution is not to throw out the system. Without the system a lot of people would by much worse off then they are now. At this point you're taking this beyond free museums. You want to just throw out everything and hope that people will live on better. Its an optimistic view but I don't believe its realistic. </TEXT>

Same thing that governments do with criminals today.

What makes you think that these people who have lives that are already stressful with jobs will do any better than a government.

Which means that you're fine with giving poor people low quality stuff. I suppose this is why Flint Michigan has lead in their water.

Not at all the filnt issue should of been solved immediately. But ofc free resources are going to be lesser quality than paid.

Chances are you won't, especially if there are a lot of poor people there. I probably care more for poor people than you do and even I will admit that going to a park filled with poor people is not all that much fun.

Why do you keep trying to make accusations about me? I donate and voulenteer at charities pretty often...

Now compare that to the private museums I went to and they were much more peaceful and enjoyable. I will admit that I felt cheated by the fact that i had to pay, but the experience was a lot less hectic.

Ofc it was less hectic. Lots of people were not able to go because of the cost. I dont get why we cant have both private museums for people who want a less hectic experience and public museums for people who can not afford it. Really the taxes you pay toward museums are minuscule compared to the taxes you pay for schools, military, housing, property etc... Literally these places are supposed to be public spaces for those who can not afford to pay or simply don't want to pay. They are an incredible resource and abolishing them over a tiny tax is just absurd. Public spaces like these are honestly one of the best things our govt uses our tax money for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone taking care of their own property or perhaps forming a neighborhood group to coordinate efforts locally. This is not government, since government enforces it's decisions through threats of violence (i.e. locking people into a cage). A neighborhood group would be voluntary.

Does this neighborhood group pay? What are you going to do with public property? What are you going to do with criminals?

Notice that those are all things that are doing poorly and rich people pay to replace the moment they can afford to.

Ofc cause there will always be better options if you throw enough money at a situation but what about those who cant throw money at the situation?

government still took your money and made you buy a car. Doesn't matter if you say "I didn't support it!", they don't ask for your consent, they just take. By this i mean they gave GM the money and you got nothing in return that you wanted.

Im not arguing with that it was a bad decision.

Same thing with a museum or a park.

No... a park or museum is something that i could use at any point that i want. The GM bailout gave me access to nothing. This gives me access to a museum or a park. </TEXT>

Ok. I agree. No govt should be able to control your health. But if you get sick and go to the hospital who would stop the hospital from gouging you with prices.

what power? The #1 way that rich people get power is through government. No government = much less opportunity for abuse.

Yes the #1 way the rich get power is through govt BECAUSE govt controls regulations. Without something/someone putting in regulations the companies would be able to do whatever they want.

Taxation. I refuse to visit museums, so you make me pay instead for museums through taxation.

Same thing that happens with schools, libraries, city hall, parks, yes.

Same thing happened with the GM auto bailout. I refused to buy crappy GM cars, so the government taxed me buy a car from them.

I did not support the GM auto bailout because that is a private company.
