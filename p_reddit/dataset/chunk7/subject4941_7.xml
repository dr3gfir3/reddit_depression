He even admits he didn't know what he was some of the time and "winging it". del Toro had a year and a half getting his vision in place, which then wasn't given to PJ. It's no fault of anyones except the studio for the way the Hobbit turned out, I just wish so many of the people who seem to genuinely hate PJ here could understand that. </TEXT>

Pretty much all encryption methods today use 1 of these. If he's created a totally new method for encrypting data then I suppose it's possible it's immune to Quantum computers. Without extensive and *extremely* thorough vetting no one is going to be using it and when vetting does occur I'm going to guess that's the last we'll hear of it. </TEXT>

It's definitely in Schengen. You can drive from the southern tip of Portugal to the Northern tip of Norway and you won't see a border guard. It's when you fly in first you get it stamped. I'm guessing Cohen either forgot about Schengan or possibly wasn't even aware of it. </TEXT>

It (and the rest of the Deluxe editions) always seem to be on offer on BookDepository.com. I actually have it but haven't read any of it *yet* so can't comment on the content.

[Unfinished Tales (Deluxe Slipcase Edition)](http://www.bookdepository.com/Unfinished-Tales-Deluxe-Slipcase-Edition-J-R-R-Tolkien/9780007542925?ref=pd_detail_1_sims_b_p2p_1). I also have this which is what I'm currently reading. Everything about this book is amazing, literally everything. The binding, the box, the paper used, the content 10/10 would *highly* recommend.

	<TEXT> Did you even read the article? It clearly states why they're being investigated and the accusations aren't "vague" they're very clear.

Le Pen is accused of breaking the Parliaments rules by having two assistants  Thierry Lgier and Catherine Griset  carry out non-parliamentary work while being paid by the EU institution.

Why would the EU pay her assistants to carry out work that has nothing to with the European parliament? It's hardly without precedent either since her own fucking father and founder of the party was ordered to repay money last year.

The financial penalties against Le Pen echo those imposed on her father, Jean-Marie Le Pen. The former chief of the National Front, who is also an MEP, was in June accused of misusing resources and ordered to repay 320,000.

	<TEXT> Not lack of interest it's just Rust is a very young language so a lot needs to be done but only so much can be done at the one time. This is a comment on debugging from the [Roadmap for 2017](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/1774). 

The work we're planning for 2017 on IDEs does not really touch on debugging, more on the editing facilities like jump to definition, refactoring, or displaying errors as you type. Debugging in IDEs needs two things - better integration between the IDE and a debugger (as you suggest, this is purely down to IDE integration) and better handling of Rust code by debuggers (this is happening slowly, both in the Rust compiler and in debuggers such as GDB, but, although we agree it is important, is not likely to be a focus in 2017).

For Intellij [this is the open debugging issue](https://github.com/intellij-rust/intellij-rust/issues/535). Apparently there is ways of debugging Rust (in particular in Eclipse) but if you're looking for the same debugging experience you'd get with Java in Intellij or Eclipse I'm afraid you're not going to find it yet :-/ </TEXT>

You need to try C# with Visual Studio + ReSharper Ultimate, if it wasn't for Visual Studio crashing once every week or 2 it'd be the ultimate (heh) experience.

Can't comment on Racer because I can't even get it to work but the Rust Plugin for Intellij is getting very good. Goto and autocompletion work very and if you use something in a crate that you don't have a `use` for it'll ask if you want to `use` it. It's still in a state of rapid but it gets better every time. The only (very) big problem is that there's no debug support.

Edit: A few people are making test comments with the word crazy over there to see if it's true (maybe because they don't believe me?). . .so I'll save anyone else the trouble and post the message I got back when I originally made the comment and inquired about it.

We have comrades with mental illness; using "crazy" or "insane" when we mean to say something is evil, ridiculous, sad, wrong, etc, helps place even more stigma on them than they're already living with. So the automoderator screens out "crazy". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Russia has major problems with hooligans, just look up 'Russian hooligans at Euro 2016'. A lot specifically train in gyms to go fighting at games, probably the worst example at the Euros they showed up with gum shields and ufc gloves and starting attacking random people at the end of the game. [Here's a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW6YScsDhOo) that *kinda* shows that example, I watched it live and it was a lot worse than what's shown here.

The Russian minister for sport actually did condemn it...A higher up in the Russian football Union not so much.

 I dont see anything wrong with the fans fighting. Quite the opposite, well done lads, keep it up!

I dont understand those politicians and officials who are criticising our fans. We should defend them, and then we can sort it out when they come home.
