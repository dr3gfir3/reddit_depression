	<TEXT>  To play a game that is no longer fun is idiotic on my part

More people on this sub need to realize this. The biggest incentive the devs have to make changes is if they lose players, they've already shown that they don't really care about proper feedback, much less all the anger on reddit. If you're not having fun then don't play.

Edit: I hope the game becomes fun later down the line, and it'd be great to play then, but putting yourself through something you don't currently enjoy, especially if it's something you do TO enjoy yourself, is just silly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "i have it worse than you/ you have no right to be depressed"

It is difficult for people who haven't had a mental illness to appreciate just how debilitating a mental illness can be. It can be difficult to compare physical and mental ailments, so saying "I have it worse therefore you have no right to be depressed" is an invalid statement, at least in my opinion.

People in psychological distress of any severity deserve help, no less than those with physically detectable problems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't undermine your situation. The very fact that you have depression means you don't have it easy. In fact given how intolerant society is of mental illness in general, I'd say you've got it harder than a lot of people. Just because your illness isn't physical doesn't mean it's any less debilitating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can honestly say nothing makes me more unhappy than other people. Unfortunately, nothing makes me happier than meeting people who are nice and I get along with.

I don't think I've felt more alone than when I realized how strange it was that I am actually nice and considerate of others' feelings. It's so rare, and I can't understand why. Pfft, niceness?? Like, who does that amirite?? 

Fuck this world. </TEXT>
