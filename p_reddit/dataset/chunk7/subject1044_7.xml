	<TEXT> I met OK Go twice when I was in highschool. I'd say they're recognized these days, they make cool music videos AND they were on Sesame Street. GZA asked me backstage after a show once. His bouncer told us we could drink, smoke, whatever... But not to eat his hummus. He then invited me back to the Holiday Inn. I politely declined. Sorry, Gary.  </TEXT>
