	<TEXT> I've racked up 100 hours in Elite:Dangerous (because I'm a space junkie and I have HOTAS and piloting your ship in VR is just AWESOME). 

Second close is Onward with 50 hours (it doesn't look much, but it's unreal). It's a MilSim (which I normally don't like) but playing like you're *there* changes those games completely.

I loved Arizona Sunshine, which puts you in a zombie apocalypse scenario, Vertigo, which feels like a Portal Game, and the Gallery:Call of the Starseed, with the adventure feeling. 

Yesterday I had a great night by doing the Quest for the Golden Trophy in RecRoom, which is a VR-sports game.

I liked Adr1ft and The Assembly for the story, House of the Dying sun for the space setting, The Solus Project because I explored an alien planet, Universe Sandbox because it's amazing being god in space, Vanishing Realms because it's the first RPG like game I've tried in VR. 

The list can go on! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're not talking about a specific brand but a whole technology. Your comparison doesn't stand, but it gave me a good idea.

In the 1900s, Henry Ford said that if he asked to his customers what did they want, they would have replied "faster horses". He built cars.

So basically, I'm pointing to you that in the cars subreddit no one is really complaining about something that you only see complaints about in the horses subreddit.

Who has it right? People that actually have and use the new technology, or the people that only see it from outside?

Trust me - I've demoed VR to plenty of people and no one got sick. VR made right doesn't make people sick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The GabeN comment that's running up top Reddit is backed by so many people that never tried VR but only read journalists articles and think VR = pukefest.

I know it's the internet, and everyone has an opinion based on no facts/experience, but it saddens me. 

I bought the VIVE in April 2016. It cost me a lot of money and when I slipped it on the first time, I was worried - worried it would be a gimmick.

My worry disappeared in three seconds, the time it took me to realise that I could move my hands in a virtual world. 

I've hosted countless demos for people of all ages. Not a single one got motion sickness. Everyone went out thinking that this was the future. They were mind-blown. 

Three of my friends were so blown-away that they bought their VIVE (or PSVR) in the immediate coming months. They love it. I had the best experience ver yesterday evening in RecRoom by playing the Quest for the golden Trophy.

And that's only the beginning! I can't imagine what's in store for us. GabeN knows that those first people are the early adopters, he knows VR can only get better from now on. 

But of course, click-bait journalism is king. IT's better to dismiss something as a fad than to stop and think about what impact can it have. In the beginning of 1900, journalism looked at technology with awe. Now everyone is an expert on nothing, and the outlook is always negative.

**Mark my words, VR is gonna be a revolution as big as the smartphones**.

(full disclosure: I actually got motion sickness from VR. Three times in total. The first time was in Minecraft VR - the acceleration while flying just caught me off guard. The second time was in Elite: Dangerous while riding my rover on a rocky planet and jumping from one dune to the other. The third time was in Adr1ft, floating in space)

	<TEXT> It's not. 

Go to /r/oculus, /r/vive, /r/PSVR. The motion sickness is marginal and only happens either if something's wrong with the game, or with weird fast movements (i.e. riding a horse, flying etc).

The messenger should verify the data either with provable anecdotal proof or with wide-spread studies. If the messenger only spreads one video and talks without data/proof, then yes, I shoot the messenger.

	<TEXT> This phrase out of context sounds bad. What he said in the interview is that embracing the inherent risk of a new technology without worrying about money loss it's what enables them to push for it just to advance it (without a real eye for profit now).

He also says that VR as it is right now it's "barely sufficient   very expensive" - things that are true and are there just to say Hey, don't judge this as the finished, final product - this is gen 1 and is the worst is ever gonna be.

Valve is definitely pro-VR :)

Oculus sold 240k headsets, Vive sold 420k, almost double. I understand PSVR is the leader from.a numbers perspective, but an easy fix to make the game work with Revive would basically improve your reachable user base by 200%!

	<TEXT> I guess you haven't been involved with early adoption of technological products. 

When the iPhone was launched, there was no App Store. Apple opened it to developers one year after the original iPhone came out. 

You needed to shell out an insane amount of money for a stock experience, limited to browsing (without flash!!) and watching YouTube videos. 

VR has been here for less than a year, and we already have plenty. OP was whining about the current state, and I was relating that current state is awesome for a gen1 product, and that in a short timeframe it will be better. Also, he said we need games, which is a narrow point of view - VR is much bigger than gaming alone! </TEXT>

AR is gonna be big for professional use. Think a mechanic fixing a car and having the engine specs superimposed, or a surgeon, or architects to check out existing spaces.

But VR has the ability to transport you to a different world, and that opens a lot of possibilities for gaming, virtual tourism, education etc.

I think we're gonna see both techs taking off, with AR more mainstream but VR more impactful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, VR is in its infancy. What we need is **patience.**

We're already "spoilt" with the quantity (and for some, quality) of indie games. Onward is a game you can easily sink 100+ hours in, Elite:Dangerous 400+, plus all the others smaller games that can keep you entertained for 10+ hours.

Given the proper amount of time, we'll have more and more polished content - but I think we're pretty swell already:

**SOCIAL**

Things like RecRoom, AltSpace, VRChat are already incredible glimpse at the future of social VR - it's gonna be huge. I have friends all over the world, and being able to spend time with them in VR while chasing monsters or just walking in a forest is gonna be awesome.

**EDUCATION**

We've been able to witness the Moon Landing already. I was shrunk atom-size and passed through blood cells. Yesterday I walked in a virtual museum and I was looking at the Birth of Venus and was in awe at the incredible beauty of that painting. I can't imagine what's in stock for the future.

**VIRTUAL TOURISM**

I mean, look at Google Earth VR. That's already incredible. With time, we'll have LIDAR scans of Street View, we'll be able to walk on Mars (oh wait! We can already!) and visit anywhere. ANYWHERE.

**ART**

Tilt Brush and other million programs. They'll only get better with time. Being an artist right now is AWESOME. I think Leonardo DaVinci would spend 100% of his time in Tilt Brush.

**GAMES**
I threw some titles there already. But honestly, the best is yet to come. Arizona Sunshine was a great example of a polished indie game: a story arch, good mechanics, it kept me entertained for 6 hours more or less. I can't imagine what would be playing Fallout 4!

**STORYTELLING**

I think VR really shines here. Allumette, The Rose and I, Pearl, Colosse, Gnomes and Goblins. Telling a story in VR means living it. Just amazing. Wait until big studios get involved, and you'll need another headset for your SO!


*tl;dr: VR is in its infancy, but avalable content right now is already mindblowing. in a short timeframe (1 year) we'll be flooded with quality stuff and OASIS here we come.*

	<TEXT> I like it. I know the community is a bit burned out by wave shooters, but this one is very very polished and fun. The lobby of the hotel with the concierge guy (who is the actor in the movie) gave me a very good presence feeling (we miss good 3d models of people in VR). Not a lot of content apparently, but yesterday night I've played for one hour and I did only the shooting range and mission one (there's three missions in total).

My only gripe is graphics - it has great graphics but Unreal engine is either blurry or shimmery for me. 

Plus, this game made me realise that for high-end polished games, my GPU will struggle (I have a 970 and have to play with Low settings, of course with reprojection on). 

Time to save up for a 1080ti when it's gonna be a thing! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Inside-out tracking might work in the future, but the issue with cameras is the bandwidth for the real-time calculations. to improve accuracy you need to improve resolution, and higher resolution = higher load on CPU/GPU.

The lighthouse system is what sold me on the Vive - it's simple yet effective with zero overhead. 

I don't think the Lighthouse system will be replaced in the next 5-10 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mahyna school clearly teaches us to avoid eating the flesh of other beings. 

Theravada says:
"I declare there are three circumstances in which meat can be eaten: when it is not seen or heard or suspected (that a living being has been purposely slaughtered for the eater)"

Not a single cow/chicken/pig would be slaughtered if no one was buying meat. They are purposefully slaughtered for consumption - your buying it sentences them to death. 

Of course, the interpretation serves the purpose to feel less guilty about it. But choosing to buy meat = knowing that the animal has been slaughtered for your consumption. 

I agree that everything is illusory - but in my passing on thus planet, I strive to inflict the least amount of suffering that is possible. I've eaten meat for a long time and would eat it again if circumstances would occur; but I think  we should be aware that buying meat in a supermarket equals creating suffering. That's no argument - we can argue on the interpretation not the facts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started early. Super Mario Bros (the original). You could not save, so you had to guard the console from sisters/mothers etc (it happened twice that my friend's mom turned off the console because we were taking a break. No breaks while gaming is now a rule).

So I can retrace some of my kinks as a gamer back then. Then I got a thing for RPGs deriving from the old adventure games (Zak McKracken, Monkey Island etc) which exploded into mature love with Final Fantasy VII but more importantly, with Xenogears. 

Multiplayer (local of course, what's this Internet you're talking about?) came with Jikkyou Winning Eleven 4 (Japanese only).

3D graphics struggled to live up to its beautiful promise for a while. Sure, we got Resident Evil, and Silent Hill, and Colony Wars: Vengeance - but the race to "best graphic in a videogame" started, and kinda got in the way of playability, longevity, and story.

So I stopped.

But then Witcher 3 came out, and boy oh boy. For the first time in years I felt I had to play a videogame until I knew all of its secrets. the Witcher 3 is what re-ignited my gaming passion. 

And then, I bought a HTC Vive, and again, the 8yo inside of me wondered at the marvel that were about to happen - VR is the future! Graphics are not there yet but it's like playing video games for the first time again. All is new, a virgin land to explore.

Thank you Sapkowski for the books, and CD Projekt RED for The Witcher 3.

Thank you Palmer Luckey for having re-ignited the light of VR, and Valve for the development of the VIVE.

What a time to be alive! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. 

Aside from the fact that buying meat in a supermarket perpetrates a suffering much bigger than the buying meat from a farmer during the times of the Buddha - The whole mass-production + horrible living conditions + forced pregnancy and yada yada yada - the fact that you don't "see" the animal being abused/killed doesn't shy away from the fact that this thing happens and you know it. 

We have to reduce the suffering in this world as much as we can. 

Understanding that means not killing an animal to eat its flesh unless your own existence depends on this.

You yourself say that "It is impossible to live in the world without some unintentional slaughter" and I agree wholeheartedly. It's impossible indeed. But buying meat is not unintentional, is directly tied to the killing and suffering of the animal. 

I'm not advocating becoming a vegetarian / vegan (well, I am) but mostly to be aware of the suffering that there is behind your steak/sausage/whatever, and try to reduce it until your actions are not involved in that cirlce of suffering anymore.

	<TEXT> Yup I agree on the slow burner. What we need is price reduction as you say, and this will come naturally albeit slowly - but to drive adoption we need also content. Big AAA level games will justify the purchase - also, entry level GPU prices will drop as new GPUs will become more popular.

	<TEXT> I'm not saying  it wouldn't be a blow. It would. But VR/AR are at the edge of becoming mature technologies. Apple is investing in it, Google is investing in it. We (gamers) have been at the bleeding edge of this tech because a gaming enthusiast (Palmer Luckey) decided that it was about time, and sparked interest in the gaming community, but VR/AR investments were already being made. Oculus has the great merit of having attracted the spotlight early on thus guaranteeing a bootstrap of the market. If you look at it, we're actually a bit early - premium content is not ready yet. No one thought it would be that early, but VR is here to stay!

Side note: I don't think Zenimax is gonna block anything. They'll take the money after the appeal and then sell whatever game they'll make. Money is in the content, that's why FaceBook wanted to be there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's early to talk about high-end competition. Oculus   Vive are the first real VR headsets, PSVR is an incredible early attempt at real consumer VR. There's no standard for anything yet, that's why we have the Kronos consortium. 

Competition will arise in late 2017, 2018 when there's gonna be plenty of manufacturers around. Headsets will be just like monitors, and the real important thing will be content/engine/tracking/accessories. 

Even if Vive / Oculus died (and I hope and think they won't! IT's too good already :)) this wouldn't mean the death of VR as a mean of communication/gaming/etc. It's kinda naive thinking that if Oculus died, there would be no VR Market anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your CPU is fine. Not the best, but fine. You "perceive" framerate loss but senses are deceitful.

Do this:

- Open SteamVR, Settings.

- Disable reprojection.

- Activate "Perf Heuristics" and "Notify in Headset".

once you do so, play at least one Unreal game and one Unity game, something that's been out for long enough, SS set to 1. 

You should have everything butter-smooth with no warnings of lost frames (maybe during loading screens, the only time that CPU might matter).

At this point, raise SS +0.1 for every game session - so one session at 1.1, one at 1.2 and so on - and check when, in the different engine, you'll start getting stuttering / missed frames notified in the headset. 

That's the most reliable method to see if you're keeping 90FPS steady.

If at any point (but loading) you'll get missed frames before reaching 1.4 SS, then there's definitely some issue. It might be software, it might be hardware. Hard to tell. 

So you'll have to do troubleshooting. Check temperatures of your rig, clean it from dust, and play again. If temps are stable and normal, before thinking your card is "broken", you'll need to rule out SW issues. So you'll need to remove all the crapware on your machine, possibly perform a clean install of the GPU drivers (did you try to use Display Driver Uninstaller before installing the new GPU?). If you can do a format and fresh install, I'd do it.

If after all that you still get missing frames, then yes, it might be a hardware issue. Either the CPU is failing completely (it happens and you don't notice) / bottlenecking (but it shouldn't), or the GPU has some issues. You can stress-test both of them with benchmarking software. 

After all that, if benchmarks are good and stable, I'd look into changing CPU. The one you're using should be fine as I've said, but still, if you want to upgrade go for a SkyLake so you can use DDR4 RAM. </TEXT>
