	<TITLE> What to get for a first tattoo </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-10 23:51:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay so I'm not fussed about a meaning of a tattoo, but I really like the idea of adding colour to my full white skin.

Now I've never had a tattoo and I am young (turned 18 in October) but do you guys have a really cool concept of a first tattoo?

I was going to go with something with things I like (tardis; space; avatar TLA; gym; etc) but I can't seem to think of something good.

I have been thinking about getting a tattoo for well over a year now and I genuinely feel as if I should; it's just a matter of what and where I guess.

So what are your tips, and thank you for your help! Cheers! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey;
Since Christmas I've been hitting the gym at least 3 days a week where I do only upper body as I cycle 5 days a week. During this time I was just winging it with the weight as I didn't know how to find my 1RM because I don't know what my potential is.
So how would I find my 1RM? Would I get help? Would I just say "try 100kg bench"? How would I go about doing it?

Cheers </TEXT>

Edit: so I had to change the bandage after 2 days and this was what it looked like http://i.imgur.com/yTltBv6.jpg (Probably NSFW) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so I don't know if this is just me or it happens to all of you, but after I've climbed a hill, say 800m, why do the flats after feel so much worse than the hill did. I usually climb my hills on a high gear (I don't know which) because it's easier for me than climbing on a low one, but after the hill, I go much slower and my legs get tired quicker.
Is this normal/does it happen to you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, so I've been put on a new program, and Wednesday is supposed to be my leg day. Now I cycle to work every day, not far, but enough to get my legs a little tired. My thighs and my calves are actually quite big, and I know that endurance can make muscle smaller but more efficient, but would it be okay to skip leg day, and still be relatively normal?
Edit: Calves not that big, calves small, I lied sorry </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I just want to share with you a little story

So about a year ago I was "going" to a gym where I live. There was always 4 people doing weights and the rest of the resistance was just machines. A lot of them. I was always put off by the people who would use the gym as an ego test, which was very common; while people were exercising, there were the others walking about with their snapbacks on and their super tight track suits wearing white Nike air max. This was a very toxic environment to me, and the problem was is that it was all people my age at the time 16-18. So after only going about 5 times in a month I decided to just not go to that gym.
I read a lot of stories on /r/fitness and every time I do, it makes me want to go to the gym. I have a very friendly gym environment now, the instructors aren't egotists, and the facilities as a whole are a lot better. It's a 15 minute walk, 3 minute drive, or 5 minute cycle, easily accessible on the way home from work. People who go to this gym are middle aged people, super friendly, super healthy, and super fit.
So I started going properly again at the end of December, hitting about 4-5 times a week on average, sometimes 7 times a week, and even if the workouts that I am doing aren't making an impact (which they are), it just feels good to be in a good environment.
So the start of January I weighed in at 81kg, 17.1% BF. I am now 76kg and 16% BF. And my general build is better. 
So the things that had a positive effect were
Changing gyms to a more local, friendly one
