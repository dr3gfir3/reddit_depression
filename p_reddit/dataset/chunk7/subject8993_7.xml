5gb is $40 + $20 line - $5 AutoPay = $55 + tax 

2gb is $35 + $20 line = $55 + tax

4gb is $50 + $20 line = $70 + tax 

UDP is $65 + $20 line - $5 AutoPay = $80 + tax 

8gb is $70 + $20 line = $90 + tax 




So a single line should only do 5gb or UDP. Unless you hate money.  </TEXT>

What if I had your personal information and wanted to order an S8? I would access your account, use a prepaid card, and order a 700+ loan in your name. And Id keep the phone for tax. Which is why when you don't use a credit card you can get flagged.  </TEXT>

This happens because you've paid the lower amount for the current month. When the plan gets backdated, the amount for the current month is now higher so you gotta pay the difference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what the promo is on the new phone you buy. If you get an S8 or S8+ you can be getting up to $480 in trade in value, which would be over time and you would get no gift card because the bill credits are more than you owe. 

If you got a pixel, there are no trade in promos. So you'd get $200 in a lump sum vzw gift card and $250 on a  prepaid Visa. 


If you want an S8 or s8+ but prefer a lump sum for the promo, then request to trade the phone in as a guest at the store so it's a vzw gift card and not Bill credits.  </TEXT>
