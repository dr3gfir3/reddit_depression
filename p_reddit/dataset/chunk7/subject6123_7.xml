	<TEXT> I can understand that. I've checked out a lot a Youtube video's and some Twitch streams. Not any lengthy ones because I don't want see spoilers. 

I just loved the N64, skipped everything after that so being able to play a console quality (read : Non Nintendo DS) Zelda in bed on a sunday morning when my GF is still asleep sounds like a dream come true :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't own a Switch yet BUT I can't wait to play the current release of Zelda. Why?

[THIS](http://i.imgur.com/telUB8v.jpg) - for me - embodies everything zo awesome about Zelda 'back then' and I think I am going to get 'that feeling' again when playing the current release. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This! Exactly this! I was 16 at the time. The N64 just came out, I had a long two week Christmas vacation and I bought myself a N64 with Zelda (worked hard for that). 

You described every feeling I had during that time :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Morning :-)

[This is the build](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1808586/page/1) I was talking about. It has been updated for 2.6 and I'd recommend checking out the other pages for some changes. 

I thought I reacted to your reply but on my phone it wasn't the case.

Hope you like it, I know I did :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And that build is giving you those stats now? Cause at lvl 60 you should really have maxed out (75% with penalties, except for Chaos res.) resistances, you're going to be in Merciless in a bit. HP should be around 2K by now. 

If you don't mind starting over I know a really nice Blade Flurry build (my favorite skill) </TEXT>
