	<TEXT> This is a minefield for the ego is it not?? There are several highly regarded big name directors who's work leaves me completely cold. Generally my ego tells me that I know best - that these directors are not very good and their fans are misled and basically not as clever as me. Some of them I would indeed think of as 'pretentious' - very much so. But maybe it is, as you say, that I simply don't *get* them. Often though, I find that when I try to *get* the films by asking others - 'what was that about for you - what was the director trying to say here?' - they don't know. A really good example is *Birdman*. I have yet to meet a single individual who can explain to me the meaning of the firey commet in the sky. In fact, I have even had people denying the existence of the firey commet in the sky - firey commet deniers I call them. But it's there God damn it - and nobody has any idea why! (Challenge for the *Birdman* fans out here!).

Of course this is complicated by the fact that 'getting' a film and 'understanding' a film are not the same thing. You can connect with a film on a level you don't understand, without understanding why. I had exactly the opposite reaction from the top commenter here, in that the first time I saw *2001* I was absolutely electrified by it. I didn't know why. I *got* the film - I didn't understand it. Now I feel I both get and understand the film, but the understanding took effort.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would never normally comment on this film as I have quite a low opinion of it and it seems to be pretty universally adored. But I totally agree with what you say. I find with Aronofsky that he's one of those directors who is intent, above all else, on *blowing my mind*. He attempts to do this with a full on visceral assault, employing every trick in the book, flashy editing, sound, and all kinds of clever effects. Unfortunately, such an array of tricks add up to a pretty blunt instrument. For me, before *Requiem* is anything, it is *hard hitting*. I switch off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the end of the day, there are just too many 'fuzzy' elements in this film make to it a suitable springboard for discussion on something as divisive as race. One fuzziness is the characterisation. Another is, as you point out, Chazelle's apparent lack of enthusiasm for jazz as an artform, and, come to that, for music in general.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  can anybody who truly adores this movie account for why Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) never exchanges a single audible line of dialogue with all the venerable black jazz musicians he moonlights with?

I don't adore the movie but I think I can answer this. Gosling's character, and Chazelle's characters in general, exchange lines with an absolute minimum of other characters, black, white, blue, or any other colour. He has a rigid and very specific vision of high creative achievement which is absolutely centred on the *individual* artist. As a review in The New Yorker cleverly observed, the same criticism could be aimed at Stone's character and her 'play' that she, apparently, writes, rehearses, produces, and stars in without the help of so much as a stage manager to switch the lights on and off. This is just before she runs off home to spend time with her faceless 'shadow family'. See where I'm going? For better or worse (depending on whether you love the film or hate it), Chazelle likes to keep his characters in as isolated a state as possible - as if they exist in a kind of exclusive bubble. The result may imply that he's somehow in denial of the intrinsic blackness of jazz music, but this is just an unfortunate by-product of his rather under-developed (*just in my opinion folks!!*) characterisation. 

(edit for grammar)

	<TEXT> Just one best film entry from me - **HyperNormalisation** by Adam Curtis (2 points). This is a feature length documentary made for the BBC. It's billed as a documentary, but in fact Curtis's work inhabits a unique category all on its own. It's not true documentary really, as what he presents is a bold interpretation of events, rather than attempting to present reality in an absolute way. Through his highly expressive use of music, sound, heavily edited archive footage, and text, Curtis is creating a form of his own, somewhere between factual documentary and abstract video art. I find it thrilling. *HyperNormalisation* was the only film in 2016 that made my hair stand on end, and also the only film that made me cry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't know how much your comment means to me. I've truly been wondering if I was so far out of touch with cinema that my views are more or less irrelevant. I had exactly the same thoughts about Chazelle with both of his movies. I mean - *New York New York* - *L.A. L.A.* - he even references Scorsese in the title! Knowing I'm not *completely* isolated is a relief. Unless, of course, you are in fact completely insane....? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So, you don't like it when I call you arrogant?

I don't like it when you call me an asshole. You need to learn the difference between challenging someone's point of view in a constructive way, and allowing your passion for a subject to lead you to become angry and attack an individuals character. We are, after all, only talking about a movie here. In retrospect the tone I used in my original comment is perhaps verging on this behaviour itself - I admit that. But I think it's important to notice I was not addressing an individual with my comment. If it contained a personal attack it was aimed towards the movie itself, and at the end an abstract concept of 'America'. There is never a good reason to refer to a stranger as an arrogant asshole in an online discussion about a film. Think it - sure. Don't say it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes - I know exactly what you mean. First time I saw MF was in McQueen's superb film *Hunger* - and he is really fantastic in that. But I get the impression he's one of those potentially great actors who got lazy really quickly. Having said that, he has an intensely masculine presence and confidence on screen, even when he doesn't seem to be doing much acting. It makes him wonderfully castable! I would add that you do have to look at the possibility that Fassbender is a fantastic actor and there simply have not been the great films for him to star in. His relationship with McQueen looked so promising - it's not his fault McQueen decided to start boring everyone to death all over the place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No - I don't believe cinema can experience another revolutionary wave of new film making, at least not in the way you're thinking of with the *Breathless* example. I think this has to do with the waves of youth culture that began after the Second World War in Europe and the US. The beat generation - rock - mods - hippies - punk and all the rest - each wave of popular/youth culture superseded the last, and each counter-culture reinvented the world in its own way. But the waves have subsided. Counter-culture these days has become subsumed by the wider culture as a whole. Popular culture *is* culture. 

Deeply enmeshed with this development is the emergence of post-modernism, which, with its inherent ironic stance and skepticism towards any entirely hopeful ideology, is very effective in disabling the kind of confidence and bravado displayed by counter-culture movements of the past (e.g. the jazz influenced 'beat generation' from which *Breathless* sprang).

What I think you *can* observe might be 'quiet revolution' films - those that change the game in their own way, but do not draw universal attention to themselves or have any particular connection to a youth culture. As someone else has pointed out already in these comments, the work of Thai auteur Weerasethakul could be offered as an example of this. For me - and this is a very personal POV - Weerasethakul is exploring the last hopeful frontier of human belief systems, which you might call the spiritual. This quiet spirituality is as far as you could imagine from the destructive dogma of organised religion, and is characterised by its uncertainty, and above all, its humanity. I would add some works by Haneke, Oppenheimer and Anderson among others to this... what would you call it? A 'non-movement'? It must remain undefined, because to define it might well be to destroy it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They didn't end up together because why exactly?

They didn't end up together because DeNiro and Minelli didn't end up together at the end of *New York New York*. I agree with every element of your comment - but please tell me, what was it about this movie you found so funny? Where were the funny parts? Gosling (who I really like as an actor) did his best to inject some life into the thing by giving his character as much of a wry self-knowing edge as he could extrapolate from the script, but even this was what I'd call charming and attractive rather than 'funny'. I laughed *once* - when a woman in an audition said 'lady why is you trippin' in a dead pan voice. I don't know what this film was. For me it had no identity. It was not a comedy. It was not a drama. It was not a satire. It was not a satirical comedy-drama. I guess it was a romance (?), but what film is 'a romance' and that's it? Romances are funny or tragic or both. Being 'a musical' doesn't cut it either for the same reasons. I'm going to stop commenting on this film as I feel like I've wandered into a parallel universe where the definition of a good movie has turned on its head. It's actually starting to freak me out. I feel like Catherine Ross in *The Stepford Wives*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not alone! :-)  I've thought about this film a *lot* because of this thread, and I would now say it's giving the audience two choices (and I'm going to get a bit *Team America* here): Be a pussy, or be a dick. Now pussies are, of course, pussies, and that's pretty much all they get to be. The down side of being a pussy is you abandon your dream and you end up apologising to guys in movie theatres who hit you in the head with their popcorn carton. You get a family, but there's nothing all that enjoyable about the family and it's all pretty hollow and superficial. You don't get to enjoy your life because deep down you're full of regrets about the past and your lost dream still haunts you. Dicks are dicks. The downside of being a dick is that you act like a dick and you don't get friends, romance, or family. But dicks get glory. Dicks realise their dream. Dicks get to experience a magical, creative transcendence that is so much more awesome than dinner with your phoney broken family or a pizza with some directionless pussy girl there really is no competition. The choice seems pretty simple to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I more or less hated *La La Land*. I felt like it was pretty vacuous if I'm honest. It reminded me very much of those GAP commercials with Sarah Jessica Parker. As with his previous film, *Whiplash*, Chazelle is concerned with characters who have an undiscovered great talent, and their great talent is what brings them to success at the end. A far more interesting film would have been about a couple of losers with no talent, and how they set about finding value in their lives. As with *Whiplash* the special talented people sacrificed love for their art - it seems for him this is mandatory for success to be achieved. I find this idea less than fascinating and, anyway, inaccurate. His thesis on 'old' culture vs 'new' culture was beginning to look interesting, but he took it nowhere and it completely fizzled out. My overriding thought throughout the film was - *please don't make a film about how movies aren't as good as they used to be and make that film a very pale imitation of how movies used to be, thereby reminding us that movies aren't as good as they used to be*. In effect Chazelle is gleefully stubbing out a cigarette on the dying corpse of cinema. Nice. 

But more than any of this I'm kind of dismayed that no-one is talking about how much this film owes to Scorsese's *New York New York*. There *must* be some stuff about this out there but as yet I have been unable to find it. *La La Land* is simply a lighter, dumber version of Scorsese's earlier film. Now - *New York New York* was itself a kind of knowing, post-moderny homage to the golden age of Hollywood musicals. Now we have *La La Land* - a dumbed-down homage to a post modern homage..... stop - the cultural redundancy is making me nauseous. I remember after *Whiplash* thinking - 'isn't he kind of doing *Raging Bull* with bits of *Taxi Driver* thrown in?' My suspicions are confirmed by *La La Land* - his *New York New York*. Can't wait for his next Scorsese reboot. 

And this is going to win a bunch of oscars right? Well everyone loves bright flashy colours and a bit of a song and dance - especially in this day and age, huh? OK - keep singing America - I'm sure everything's going to be *just fine*...... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate your POV - actually I think we have similar interpretations of the movie, but just view the interpretation from a different angle (if that makes sense!). I just don't see the question mark at the end of the film. I don't think it's there in the film - but I think the question mark occurred to you as a viewer, and this is absolutely valid. I mean it's not hard to figure the question mark out for yourself right? It's not hard to see the story of the musician who committed suicide as a sort of premonition of Andrew's future, right? I agree with you. But, just for me, the absence of any doubtful note at the end of the movie (and it need only have been tiny) left me feeling the film was telling me it *was* all worth it. In writing this I'm remembering the Father's astonished face peering through the window of the stage door. Remember that? *This* is the kind of questioning note I am looking for - but the problem with this is the Father was such a sketch of a character this potential questioning note just didn't land. The Father was a 'pussy', and that's about it. We knew that from the first encounter with him when he apologises to a man who walks into him. OK - he's a pussy. And that's about all we find out about him. So Andrew is avoiding becoming like his father. He is avoiding being a pussy all his life. That's good isn't it? It's simple no? Where was the *worth* in his father's life? What did his father have that Andrew didn't that Andrew was giving up to become a great musician? I needed this balance in the narrative. I needed to know, for example, what his life had become during the period he gave up drumming. We knew nothing. Andrew seemed to be exactly the same as he was before. At the end, when his father was staring at him through the door, all I read was 'see? he aint no pussy bitch'. At the end of the day perhaps the flaw we are arguing over here is simply that Andrew's relationships outside of his musical life were terribly underdeveloped. For example, although we were led to believe Andrew was kind of a loner, it didn't really seem all that difficult for him to ask the movie theatre girl out. He seemed pretty cool and suave about it, and he didn't seem to struggle particularly with the dates. He didn't seem all that elated about it either. The stakes were just not high enough - they really weren't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  To my mind, the film isn't saying it was worth it so much as asking whether it was worth it, with the rest of the movie mostly supporting the response of "no."

We will have to agree to disagree there. For me the character of Andrew is just not fleshed out enough for me to understand why he is suffering particularly (apart from the physical and mental suffering he endures as a direct result of his music training). The relationship woth his Father and with his girlfriend could have been way more developed to supply this information. For me, the moment a director chooses to exit a character's narrative is a strong indication of how he wants the audience to respond to said narrative. In the case of *Whiplash* we were left with a great surge of an upbeat and a climactic triumph (to my mind we can assume that the Lincoln Centre scouts or whoever we had been told were in the audience would surely be talking of nothing else than the incredible young percussionist who stole the entire show from everybody else and created a moment of musical genius on stage.... no?)

 As for your edit, that's an extremely interesting idea. Could you explain more what you mean by irony? Haven't seen Raging Bull (I know...) and it's been a while since I watched Taxi Driver.

Travis Bickle is aiming for greatness, but in a dark and deranged way. The audience know that his definition of 'greatness' is likely to prove catastrophic for him and for others. We know that he is in fact mentally ill and is using the irrational and warped logic of a phychopath to justify his violent fantasy. Travis realises his fantasy.... and for a short time becomes a national hero. The woman who spurned him for being a creepy wierdo reappears, forgiving and open to rekindling the romance. Travis rejects her - he has moved on, his crusade apparantly having allowed him to re-enter 'normal' society for the time being at least. This is a highly ironic outcome - very similar to the comic re-telling of *Taxi Driver* Scorsese created with *King Of Comedy*. It's ironic because Travis is a creepy wierdo.

LaMotta's ending is actually not particularly ironic, so I take that back. It's tragic.

	<TEXT>  And again, I agree with you on that final scene not feeling good. It's the culmination of this twisted mentality and I was honestly terrified through it.

That's very interesting - I read it quite differently. I saw the scene as triumphant (although I was not buying it) - the camera tricks - the fading in and out of sound - I felt like the director was attempting to communicate an extraordinary, transcendental experience - almost an out of body experience where the musician was entirely subsumed by his performance - at one with the drums. I felt like we were witnessing at last the creation of greatness - of great art. I felt like the film was saying 'see? it was all worth it in the end'. If the intention was otherwise, I feel like the film should have ended in a different way, and not with this extreme experience during a performance. 

(Edit: Just when I was writing that I realised the similarities between the way this and other drumming scene were filmed and the boxing scenes in *Raging Bull*. This is interesting to me, because I remember when I was watching *Whiplash* the scene where Andrew calls his x-girlfriend very much reminded me of a similar scene from *Taxi Driver*. It's becoming apparent to me how Scorsese-influenced this film is. Was Andrew intended as a sort of Scorsese/Deniro style hero? If so, what the film greatly lacked was a level of irony. Travis Bickle - Jake LaMotta - anti-heroes who's narratives are imbued with deep irony. Andrew in *Whiplash* - no irony at all. The unseen character in *Whiplash* who committed suicide halfway through the film - **that's** who the film should have been about. **That's** the film I would want to see.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Sacrifice is necessary in the creation of art.

Sacrifice.... or a kind of masochistic submission to a brutal, mentally ill dictator? And, while we're at it, I would also take issue with calling what our hero was aiming for as the 'creation of art'. He was aiming for a kind of iconic *greatness*, and in the world of *Whiplash* this can only be achieved through a kind of 'marine core' approach to life. It's just depressing tbh - and also retrograde. Have we not outgrown this kind of machismo? It's so destructive in this day and age. Is this what we need? The final would-be spectacular drum solo was less an enjoyable piece of music and more operation desert storm! 

Just on a side note, I was also annoyed by the strange homophobic/homoerotic undertones at play. The regular homophobic slurs were unnecessary, and therefore offensive. At the same time there was this corny sexual tension between the central pairing. More than once I murmured 'jeez - get a room' as the clumsy s m relationship developed. As for the finale - I've rarely seen a more extravagant simultaneous cum shot. All in all I felt this film was the bastard child of *Fame*, *Rocky*, and *50 Shades Of Grey*. 

Thanks for your advice on *La La*. I think I'll wait for the DVD release! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Everybody - this post will be a bit of a rant but also a question. So I'm intrigued by *La La Land* and was planning on seeing it ASAP when it's released here in the UK (this week I think). In the meantime I thought I would brush up on Chazelle by watching *Whiplash* which is available on Amazon. Well - I just don't know - I found *Whiplash* to be one of the most ridiculous films I've ever seen, with a truly detestable narrative which could serve as propaganda for some fascist dictatorship. You know, the Germans and the Japanese used to make films like this in the 1930s. It was overblown macho bullshit from start to finish, and I immediately cancelled my plans to see *La La Land*. If the USA is entering a new Reaganite era, I thought, I'm not going to sit around watching whatever dumb *Top Gun* narratives it's going to start telling itself in the process. But listen - to those who have seen both *Whiplash* and *La La Land* - would I be missing out by not seeing the new film? Is it a *very* different beast? Anyone hate *Whiplash* as much as me but loved *La La Land*?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both the theory about the way you cut the onions and which parts you should eat, and also braising them for a FOS. Interesting ideas - but maybe the cutting one is getting into that 'chefy' area that's probably too pernickety for home cooks :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See - this link is exactly what I as looking for - but it also leads me to think that maybe I need to change my attitude to midweek winter veggie eating (that is if my current locavore diet is to continue). This lady seems to have come to view side dishes as dinner. Maybe I need to do that too....? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh thank you so much for your comment - trouble is I'm *allergic* to Ottolenghi. The man seems incapable of making so much as an omelette without adding a bit of sumac and finishing with a sprinkling of za'atar.  Dedicated followers of Ottolenghi have *large* pantry cupboards. I do not! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh how often you will find me hovering over a pan of veggies with a handful of chopped bacon thinking - 'will I or won't I?'. Usually I will, and I can fully concur that bacon does wonders for root vegetables - especially swede. It's breaking the mid-week veggie rule though - gah! Thanks for your comment. But can we just call Stamppot Bubble And Squeak?  :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! Thanks for replying to my post. I have HFW's *Veg Every Day* and it's really a great book I would recommend to anybody. But funnily enough it's this book that has kind of inspired my post! At this time of year, even in HFW world we're talking mostly pasta and risotto. Or side dishes! Gah! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tall order - seasonal cookbook for winter months? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi everybody. Bit of a tricky question this - not least because I'm in the UK and most reddit users are in the US. But anyway, I enjoy buying food at the farmer's market and am a dedicated locavore (within reason - I'm not about to start living without lemons!). I'm also very into seasonal eating. In addition I recently began a loose 'meat-free weekdays' thing, so I buy meat at the market on a Saturday and once it's gone there is no meat till the following Saturday. But I'm beginning to find this way of eating a bit of a struggle. My dream is to find a great cook book that will help me out. I want to eat veggy mid-week meals made from local seasonal (to UK) produce. I don't want these meals to always be risotto (or any variation on risotto eg 'speltato') or pasta. I don't want them to always be Asian and I don't want them always to be soup. As if all this wasn't demanding enough (!) I don't want to feel (as I often do) that I'm serving a side dish for dinner. Tall order I know - but any ideas out there? :-)

Edit: regularly available to me in winter are big old roots and tough old greens: carrots potatoes cabbage swede (rutabaga?) kale beets spinach - I also can get the odd cauliflower and also celariac - you get the picture. Apples are still around too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi - *obsessed* with french onion soup. I've found it's one of those recipes where different 'authorities' will give you a variation on the recipe (e.g. chicken stock or beef stock) and swear theirs is *the* authentic version - so searching for the definitive french onion soup is a bit like searching for the definitive Salade Nicoise. Enjoyable but inconclusive! The best version I've made at home came from David Leibovitz's My Paris Kitchen. Apart from anything else, this is the only recipe I've found that gives you a realistic time for the onion caramelising process - at least a couple of hours. He uses chicken stock but I go for veal - only because I use a lot of chicken stock and this makes a change. IMO the quality of the stock is the key to a good FOS. It should glue your lips together. It's also important the weather is right - for me, FOS is for a freezing cold day - one that merits a slug of brandy to finish the soup off. I don't think it should be too thick, overly full of onion, or have chunks of meat in it! It should not be bitter.  </TEXT>
