	<TEXT> I know! I made my own throw away account for it and everything. 

To be honest, now I can't fuck anyone without being insecure about the scars on my thighs or thinking about whether or not anyone will think I'm beautiful. I ruined myself with my own hands because of my own stupidity. If you want to think that two years ago I began hurting myself and then hiding it for the next year nonstop for attention, go for it.  </TEXT>
