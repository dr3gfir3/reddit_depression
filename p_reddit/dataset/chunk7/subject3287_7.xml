	<TEXT> Actually this happened to me too. On OCE and hit G5 at the end of last year, last week over easter break I decided to grind back up and spent a lot of time in s1 where I feel like I equalized my MMR (ended up against mostly s1/g5 players in my non-series games and had ~20lp gains and losses.) When I got to promos however I kept being placed against (and only against, never on my team) high gold or even plat players. And I did promos 4 times before I got into gold thanks to the promo helper giving me two free wins and a lucky afk on the enemy team in a third game. I figured that this type of sudden mmr jump must have just been normal in promos and brushed it off - is it not intentional? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean I don't think they're necessarily chronic chokers, both carried Uol in series last year (Hyli was mvp vs SK in spring and Csaci vs Roccat in summer) and never played...this bad when it counted. Looks more to me like the pressure of having to be the backbone this year caught up to them : (. Hopefully it's a one-off that they'll work on for next split. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like I can't call this series just yet. Multiple members of both teams looked sloppy but UoL made the first mistake and it landed OG with a lead on their core player (like the casters remarked Ori and Kindred could do fuck all but keep Zven alive and OG would still take any fight) and that conveniently won them the game. IF next game it's OG who makes the first mistake, I could also see the reverse happen. Looks like the only thing I can call at this point is that it looks like it's going to be a sloppy series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd make a case for Bunny too (technically hasn't been 2 years since his debut on Curse :p) who always looked like a shining mechanical prospect and solid support. Come to think of it, all 5 of my picks for best new NA talents (Hauntzer, Bunny, Dardoch, Matt, Lourlo) played on Curse/Liquid Academy before making it in. Say what you want about Steve's success as an owner, but he probably has the best eye for scouting fresh talent in NA.

	<TEXT> Not necessarily true. The top 6 teams in points overall will have a shot at Worlds (2 autoqualify + 4 go to gauntlet). Won't get into the math but barring a very weird situation (where 3+ teams that aren't even in playoffs this split somehow manage to take top playoffs positions next split) the loser of this game will still at least get to run gauntlet provided can make summer playoffs. Of course they'll probably have a low gauntlet seeding, but as C9 proved last year, if they deserve to go to Worlds at that point they ought take the opportunity to prove it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i played a game with a tahm and the draven head isn't even fit on his model, it's floating on top of his head like a hat only not even touching it - was pretty silly looking. </TEXT>
