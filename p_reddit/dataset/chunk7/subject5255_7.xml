	<TITLE> Did seeing my dad die triggered my anxiety attacks? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-13 18:03:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since how I saw my dad died.

It was 2 and a half years ago, it was around 3 A.M he was screaming and he felt his heart hurting, then he started fainting. And we we're too slow to get in to the hospital in time.

That really triggers me because for some reason, I get panic attacks and I really don't know why!
I'm not a stressful guy, I always try to be calm and happy, I don't do drugs, I eat healthy and I barely drink alcohol.

I start to worry about my health more than I usually do.

Whenever I feel the feeling of having anxiety, it really doesn't help that it so alike how my dad died. It reminds me of that everytime.

Also how the fuck do I make these panic attacks stop?  I'm not a stressful person but these panic attacks are making me one! I don't know what cause it! It's pissing me off!

	<TEXT> Everybody gets so furious when they see product placement in movies.

Seeing a brand in a movie for some reason piss people off, but for me it does absolutely nothing.

We see brands/logos all the time in real life.

 If the studio just want to make a little extra more money,

Then fine! Let them! What's the big deal?


Who cares seeing a pepsi or a nike in a movie.


Okay maybe the ones that kinda bothers me that the movie actually stopped just to shamelessly market a brand kinda like what Power Rangers did, but other than that yeah...

Even if they do it subtly in a movie like,

"Oh I see a product placement in the background! Boo that's so shameless"

and I'm like "Really dude? Get over it!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now I wanna start a discussion on this because I have conversations with people on movies that "oh the movie sucked cuz I already knew what was gonna be the ending".

Yeah I know it would be better if a film would surprise you,

From the words of M, Night Shyamalan "What a twist!"

Even though the ending of a film is obvious, but how the overall story was come to play brilliantly and come into full circle.

But don't get me wrong, there IS a difference for films that are unbearably predictable that failed miserably in every way of storytelling

Y'know </TEXT>
