I literally have no idea what im going to do when my parents' insurance doesn't cover me anymore. I NEED THAT SHIT. And I'm sure, come time in a couple years, there is no way I will be able to afford a pump for $100. DAMN!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, these kids would be entirely dependent on OP. That's not fair. She doesn't have to give up all her life and free time to take care of very small children that aren't hers. It's wrong of OP's fiance to push this issue because he may not be home for a majority of the time.  Same with parents. There are always others. You can't push big responsibilities onto your partner when you can't even help out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im going to give you some popular YA books that are used a lot for getting people into YA. I recommend them to everyone who is looking to get into YA. They also happen to be about magic. 

The Graceling Series- Kristin Cashore

Poison Study -Maria V Snyder

Cruel Beauty- Rosamund Hodge

The Burning sky (more YA fantasy) 

Snow Like Ashes -sarah raasch

Seraphina - Rachel Hartman 

Personally, I think Red Rising is a little too heavy for an intro YA book, and unless you really like YA you won't be too into it. It is very good though if YA is your cup of tea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would bring him into one appointment and have a health care professional help him talk through his concerns about vaccination. Have the doctor present the facts. Oh and talk to your doctor before hand so he or she has time to prepare the educational material they need. Sometimes people need a push from authority to see the light. Your husband may be one of those cases. Good luck and thank you for standing up for your child. Do NOT give in on this matter. Vaccines are SO SO important, but you know that :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally understand!! My grandfather (father's side) died a couple years back.  He was a...not very nice man who didnt really like women. As the oldest grandchild and being a girl, I was treated like shit whnever I went to visit. Fyi, buddy, I'm not your servent and don't deserve to be treated terribly because I was born a girl. My mother felt the same way and we both decided we would not be attending the cremation. 
My ony regret is that it wasn't my grandmother who kicked the bucket. She's even worse. 


Edit: just read your comments below. I don't get how you feel, but instead of saying I'm sorry, I'll say congratulations on getting your life together. Congratulations on your mother dying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SO TRUE. To be truthful, I would have never believed how debilitating anxiety could be till I failed 2 semesters of college. You know what didnt help? Therapy alone. You know what did?

I wouldn't haven't gotten this far without it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Goodness that is scary! 
Often times, with a mental illness, talking through those monsters with someone helps fight them off. There is no better answer than "get help" but if she's not at that stage, she needs to be able to talk to you or someone else when she hers these monsters. 

Tell her to call you or be near you every time she hears those monsters. Your presence can help. 

This helped someone I know, I can only hope it helps your girlfriend. 

Don't try to talk her into psychiatric help when she's in a mood or she hears those voices. That's another tip. It will probably just make her angry. </TEXT>
