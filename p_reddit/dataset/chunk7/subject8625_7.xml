	<TEXT> My friend uses to work as a health care assistant in a nursing home.  There was an elderly lady there,  who kids would visit her for less then a 5 minutes,  do paper work,  pay fees and leave. 

My friend would sit down and talk to this person every shift,  she lived such an amazing life which was full of stories. 

Her family would never send see her holidays or birthdays,  yet my friend would always get her something. 

When she dead she donated millions of dollars of her assets to cancer research,  as her husband died from it. 

But she left my friend quite a nice cash inheritance,  and jewellery. 

Her family got jack shit haha </TEXT>
