	<TEXT> Are you refering to this one?

http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786

According to wikipedia your claim that "CNN couldn't help but publish" is not correct:

[On January 10, 2017, CNN reported that classified documents presented to Obama and Trump the previous week included allegations that Russian operatives possess "compromising personal and financial information" about Trump. CNN stated that it would not publish specific details on the memos because it had not "independently corroborated the specific allegations.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

Or do you refer to something else? Just googled this information. Maybe you mean something different. This certain instance can not be blamed on CNN in my view. Can not judge the accuracy of the BBC report, but the dossier does not seem to be completely baseless. 

Buzzfeed published it, but other journalist did mostly not agree:

[Many news organizations knew about the document in the fall of 2016, before the presidential election, but refused to publish it because they could not independently verify the information.[25] Buzzfeed was harshly criticized for publishing what Washington Post columnist Margaret Sullivan called "scurrilous allegations dressed up as an intelligence report meant to damage Donald Trump"[26] while The New York Times noted that the publication sparked a debate centering around the use of unsubstantiated information from anonymous sources.[27] Buzzfeed's executive staff said the materials were newsworthy because they were "in wide circulation at the highest levels of American government and media" and argued that this justified public release.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump%E2%80%93Russia_dossier)

For me this looks like the main stream media did their job here. The question is whether Buzzfeed was wrong in publishing it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are completely right. I noticed this pattern not only on reddit, but also for comments on newspaper websites. 

Comments always argue against the content of the article no matter what it is about. 

I guess this is a motivational bias. People who agree, click upvote, maybe read the article and move on. People who disagree are much more motivated to tell others why they think the article/conclusion/author/protagonist is shit. 

People are only bothered to put energy into writing a comment if they do not like something. 

So if you look at the comments it gives you a biased view of the opinion of the people. 

It may be the case that people complaining about shitty journalism are not the same as the ones upvoting shitty journalism. But very often the complaints refer to political bias. In that case the "biased" journalism is mostly replaced with even shittier journalism. The only difference being that the second one confirms their political views. 

If everyone who complains about shitty journalism only were to upvote high quality, well sourced, non-sensationlist pieces a lot could be done. This would move ad revenue to those paying for this kind of journalism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I remember. I learned from German main stream media that it was bullshit. 
Trying to tell this to others in such threads is like fighting windmills. 

Anonymous sources should make everyone sceptical. Especially if is an outlet without any real investigative journalists like The Independent. They merely rewrite other stories and have no correspondants themselves, so it is extremely unlikely that they get first hand information that others do not.

	<TEXT> Theres a lot to criticize about Trumps plan for a border wall. It will be enormously expensive, bitterly divisive, and most likely ineffective; it will also slice through Big Bend National Park and other wildlife sanctuaries, disrupting the migration of more than 100 threatened and endangered species. But the reason why many Texans oppose the wall boils down to one simple fact: It will require them to give up their land.

Curious how Trump will try to solve this. Obviously he did not put a shred of thought in this whole wall thing. But someone will have to come up with some ideas on how to handle this. Would be glorious if there would a conservative pro-landowner + anti-wall movement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article says that this negative correlation does not disprove causation. This is one of the topics that is hard to research in true experiments. Still I think this correlation is interesting enough in itself to discuss it. 

Social media bubbles may make people more partisan. But people who do not use social media very much, are getting way more partisan much faster. So something else has to have a much bigger impact.

	<TEXT> Reddit likes to lament the decline of journalism all the while mostly upvoting clickbait bullshit "journalism" that has no ethics or fact checks whatsoever. And complaining that some outlets do not report on rumors fast enough when a new story breaks. 

I'd argue the behaviour to upvote articles and therefore generating revenue merely on basis on the headline is the greatest reason for the decline of journalism. It creates an incentive structure in which clickbait makes you money. Thorough research does not. Journalists that do multiple sources checking and non-sensationalist headlines do get drowned in the breaking news /hyperbole bullshit that gets voted to the top. 




Edit:
Just wanted to include one recent positive example of a great, well-researched article. It is a topic you will encounter very often on reddit and mosty with shit sources that push a certain agenda. [It is about Trump and Russia. And more specifically about the tactics Russia applies in foreign politics. 
It lays the facts bare and shows that there is a lot less evidence for collusion than some parts of reddit want you to believe (r/politics), but also there are some connections, (which other parts like like r/the_donald deny). People from both sides of the aisle could learn a lot from it. 
Click here.](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-cold-war)

Also from a more conservative outlet, another calm and informative article about the same topic can be found [here](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/446339/donald-trump-russia-2016-election-controversy-explained)

Both of these articles do not much to evoke emotions like clickbait articles do, but they have the advantage of being more likely to be true. They take some time to read. But this is time well spent compared to spitting outraged comments on here in reponse to stuff that turns out to be wrong.

	<TEXT> Any evidence whatsoever that connects any PAC / interest group to the comments in the other threads?

As there will most likely be none, I would settle for a logical conspiracy theory. As far as I know Trump is the one who pushes a war on NK the most aggressively right now. Why should PACs opposed to him do the same? Or do you argue government-loyal ones are spreading propaganda to drum up the war machine? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Submission Statement**

Interesting article that shows contrary to popular believe political polarization is not highest among people who use social media the most (the bubble concept). Old people who are least exposed to social media show the biggest polarization. That means other forces apart from social media bubbles are a more important cause of political polarization. 

Their approach is simple. Using data from the American National Election Survey, they compare the most web-savvy voters (the young, where 80 percent used social media in 2012) and the least web-savvy voters (the old, where fewer than 20 percent used social media in 2012) on nine different tests of political polarization. The measures cover everything from feelings about political parties to ideological consistency to straight-ticket voting, and the data shows how polarization changed among these groups between 1996 and 2012.

The results? On fully eight of the nine measures, polarization increases more for the old than the young. If Facebook is the problem, then how come the problem is worst among those who dont use Facebook?

Does this mean the internet isnt making us more polarized? Not necessarily. The young are becoming more polarized, and its possible social media is part of the reason. But given that older Americans who dont use social media are polarizing faster than younger Americans who do, its clear that this is about more than whom you follow on Twitter. 

Whatever is tearing our politics apart is deeper and more universal than the digital filter bubbles that get so much attention  and it seems to be most powerful among the people least likely to get their news from social media. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While many, including party leaders, have fallen right back into the same anti-Trump pattern they say cost them 2016 in the first place, top Democrats now say theyre working on a strong, sharp-edged, bold economic message, as Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer put it Tuesday.

The package will be populist and designed to unite both wings of both caucuses, one senior Democratic aide said. Infrastructure and trade are expected to be key components, another aide confirmed. 

Though Democrats have long diagnosed their failure to put forth a compelling economic message as a root cause of their crushing 2016 losses, their pursuit of a populist package this year reflects the lasting influence of Bernie Sanders presidential bid on their longer-term agenda.

	<TEXT> This sounds kind of hopeful:

IA, whose members include Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, argue that consumers would benefit most from preserving the rules, which Republicans in Congress and at the FCC have indicated a strong interest in rolling back.
The internet industry is uniform in its belief that net neutrality preserves the consumer experience, competition, and innovation online, IA wrote in their ex parte. Consumers want and need their internet experience preserved and protected, regardless of the legal or regulatory mechanism.

But the bad news:

With Republicans having the majority in the House, Senate and at the FCC, there is little stopping them from advancing their agenda against net neutrality.

Democratic lawmakers such as Sens. Brian Schatz (Hawaii) and Edward Markey (Mass.) have countered the Republican perspective in Congress, arguing that preserving net neutrality rules protects consumers from internet service providers who could favor their interests over their customers.

People better get ready to defend net neutrality against Republicans.  We need to show them the costs. They need to suffer in elections and approval ratings for attacking net neutrality.  </TEXT>
