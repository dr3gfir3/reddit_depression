	<TEXT> Shrugs internet is not nearly as huge in the middle east as it is in america. Newspaper ads and billboards are still the bigger market over social media, at least until most of the old generation dies off in 10-20 years to make way for the new gen z of social media users and internet content creation and curation. 

Perhaps you haven't done your own research.  </TEXT>

But if I *were* to upgrade, should I stick with RX or does GX 460 series have some bigger legroom, more features, better handling, that kinda thing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For example, the CW's izombie is one of the best new shows in recent memory, and easily the best on that particular network. 

Lucifer is another show that's "so bad and cliche it's entertaining in a way" category, being a typical fox procedural with an added twist and a delightfully charming leading man playing the lucifer devil himself. 

More shows like this (especially ones that are actually good like izombie)  are more than welcome.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um... what the hell? It's just the opposite actually concerning accidentally skipping text, because you sometimes want to press the confirm button quickly so all the text appears at once and accidentally miss a sentence when you press too fast in succession. This problem wouldn't exist when the text appears all at once, so you don't have to do that until you read the entire dialogue box, without waiting for more words to slowly scroll into view.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is it that some video games (especially jrpgs) have scrolling text instead of instantly appearing text? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Especially for those that don't have the option for the text to appear instantly onscreen. Honestly it's unfathomable. When you read a book, you're not waiting for the goddamn words to scroll onto the pages, they're right there for you to read.

It seems like such a little thing, but when you're playing a text heavy jrpg with a lot of reading, or a visual novel, or text adventure, or whatever it may be, you don't want to be constantly waiting for the text to scroll, since most people don't just read one word or letter at a time, we take it all in...

I dunno, it's just one of those things in video games, like crappy sound mixing and tiny font, that no one ever complains about despite it being a pressing problem that hasn't been fixed and keeps getting worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing with Holt is that the first time he subverted the audience/jake's expectations by participating in jake's shenanigans/roleplays, it was *hilarious*. It completely killed everyone in the audience. 

But come season 4, they kept doing it and it sometimes didn't feel as natural, like when jake skates across a recently waxed floor in his socks (gross by the way) and Holt comes into the office holding jake's arm up in celebration shouting "full room!" Or whatever. It just didn't feel as funny or nearly as organic as the time he yelled "hot damn" when guessing the correct reason Santiago was late, which was a pretty 10/10 moment.

But otherwise I don't notice a problem at all with Holt being... casual? Casual how, what do you mean by that? </TEXT>

I love Lizzy Caplan, and enjoy her in pretty much everything I've seen her in.

But now Cece is still fierce and awesome,  just not a stereotypical ice cold person. Last season when she told jess about Schmidt rubbing off on her and crying at the old couple in the bank commercial, I cracked up like crazy.  </TEXT>

I'm on Sequence 7 right now. I'll do more Homestead missions and see how much it improves.

As for scifi, I think the only book series I've read that could be classified as scifi (at least somewhat) is KA Applegate's *Animorphs*, my childhood's favorite book series that will always hold a special place in my heart. *Remnants* was okay, but *Animorphs* pretty much defined my childhood.

 I mostly like books that deal with the human experience, something that's fundamentally lacking in my life, embarrassing as it is to admit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mostly find myself reading classic literature the past few years. Anything from The Count of Monte Cristo to Oliver Twist to Moby Dick. I liked Rudyard Kipling's the jungle book 1 and 2. 

I especially like mystery novels, was **really** into Agatha Christie, anything from the classic *And Then There Were None* to my favorite of the bunch, *Crooked House* and several more. 

Also read the collection of short stories of Sherlock Holmes, vol 1. I have vol 2 but still haven't read it (saving it for the summer depending on how my plans go)

So really most of the oldschool stuff. I have read young adult books, like darren shan and percy jackson, but they were a bit after my time. Oh you know what book series I was able to get 2 years ago, was the Silverwing trilogy. I read one of the books in middle school in the library but never was able to find the sequels. Still haven't read it but sometimes I enjoy something small like that just to breeze through before sinking my teeth into something heavier like *A Tale of Two Cities*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're telling me! Hehe. 

It doesn't help that I live in the mideast so it's a completely different culture to one I'd prefer. The odds of me finding someone are increased a hundredfold compared to if I lived in the US with their conventions, meetup places, population of 300 million... compared to my population of only 1 million and lack of any events catered to my interest or even the english language.

Sigh... I have thought of moving to the usa a couple of times but it's easier said than done expense wise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe even video games, although the top 3 are more conducive to my interest in talking and reading about them. 

I dunno, it just seems there aren't any with level headed people who like me have no choice but to turn to the internet to be able to talk about all the different types of media that interest them. 

I tried this reddit website but the television and movies sub are both more concerned with movie news and gossip, than the actual movies themselves; more concerned with behind the scenes going ons and props or movie posters being used than the actual movies themselves. Nothing wrong with that but... they're the highest thumbed up posts with like, 1000 comments! While any post I make wanting to discuss specific movies and shows, and similarly hear input by others on them, well they only get 3-4 posts at most. Sometimes if I'm lucky I'll get more posts and think I've finally found people to discuss it with but I honestly don't understand the format of this website and what determines which topic will become popular enough to receive a lot of input.

I dunno. Just feel like there have to be others in the similar boat I'm in, I mean nearly 8 billion in the world? Just has to be...  </TEXT>

He was okayish, and his return in season 3 was a bit rocky, but when season 4 hit they finally found a perfect balance and he was Brad level amazing. That was the only silver lining to happy endings being unjustly canceled, that we at least got to see Brad again outside of happy endings.  </TEXT>

I never was into the phase, I just happened to catch the show on a whim and liked it (a lizzy caplan episode from season 1, whom I love) and as such I'm also not part of the jess backlash that's been going on if you check the new girl sub </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the one time that money is needed (relative to the others) in the game... there isn't a really big method to get it? I don't get Ubisoft. They've been throwing money at us since ac 2 with it being all but useless but then include really expensive stuff in ac 3 and not much of a way to make money?

Ah well it's not biggie. I won't bother with naval missions, but the thing is I was looking forward to playing AC 4 since people kept telling me it was "the good one" but if the game is entirely comprised of sailing then I can't imagine that to be true. Even if it's improved over AC 3, the core of sailing that I have seen so far is very tedious and not fun. I dunno, hoping for the best here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm liking ac 3 so far, and the Frontier is quite beautiful to run through. 

However the naval missions are beyond vexing. I tried doing the chase and kept losing the objective to keep the merchant ship I'm supposed to protect above 50% hp for the duration of the mission. 

So I thought maybe ship upgrades would render the naval missions super easy, at least I hope. Of course said upgrades are like, SUPER expensive and I haven't found a real way to make bank yet. 

I started sending my 3 recruits so far on assassin missions, but the money turnover is kinda pennies compared to the extreme price of ship part upgrades. 

Are there any practical ways to make money in this game, or no more bank getting 20,000 money every 20 minutes like in the ezio AC games?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first thing I thought of during the opening was that the upside down buildings and running on them was *exactly* what I wanted out of inception, which teased walking vertically up a building in the trailer but never **did** anything else with it. The psychedelic nature of some of the scenes was the kind of thing I wanted out of a movie about dreams. 

Anyway, the movie was amazing, with extremely sharp, well placed moments of comedy to relieve the tension, very well done. I particularly loved the mister doctor exchange. I honestly couldn't get enough, when the movie ended I could have sat for another 2 hours and watched more, more. It sets up for sequels while still maintaining a good resolution on its own, unlike some other movies. 

But oh shit, Mordo becomes a bad guy? Damn. That was... sudden. I do recall Mordo being a bad guy name but I didn't think... not like this. The whole sword on his back totally gave me flashbacks to The Operative from the Firefly movie Serenity. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-26 20:55:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Family Matters was supposed to be this typical 80s family sitcom, almost Cosbyish. But one day they introduced this new character Steve Urkel who 90s American people seemed to love for some reason, like a black guy in suspenders and dorky glasses was automatic humor (I dunno)

The point being, when that happened it turned into the Steve Urkel show, focusing entirely on this guy's exploits and shunting off the rest of the family to appear if only briefly.

New Girl on the other hand started off revolving around this quirky Zooey Deschanel type who gets into wacky or perhaps even zany adventures, but people watching the show started to love the side characters way more like Nick, Schmidt and Winston, especially Schmidt.

So instead of the one quirky character, the ensemble was loved in New Girl, while in Family Matters the one quirky character was loved.

Just thought that was interesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder where they're going with this. Especially the LMD bots still roaming around right now, and all the daisy clones, wonder what the implications there are.

It would be nice to see Ward again... is it weird that I like him? I do love to hate all the bad things he's done, but... I dunno. I just really like the actor.

Ideally I'd like to see bobbi again, can't believe they booted her off, isn't Mockingbird like an integral part of shield? I know they were going to do a spin off with her and the dogface hunter, but even I knew that wasn't a good idea and I love AoS and Agent Carter (shame it got canceled)

Think we'll see ghost rider before season's end or has that been put to bed? I always wondered if the person on the bike who gave robbie his ghosting powers was the original ghost rider, like from the comics.

I also don't understand, the whole person who was funding watch dogs and an American senator was some random russian nobody? That's anti climactic (and yes I know the actual show makes fun of this but still doesn't make it any less weird). Why would an american senator with a fancy house and s*** call some russian nobody "the superior" ?

It just makes no sense. Speaking of I wonder if not robbie but rather the senator's inhuman brother, will we see him again? Still 6 or 7 episodes to go I think? Well this season is definitely shaping up to be a lot more interesting than last.

Shame about radcliffe. Even when he was so clearly evil I liked him, the actor just has this charm about him. Liked it less when his end game was some minority report esque matrix paradise situation, since I'd rather he just be mad scientist evil...

Wonder if we'll ever get more explanations about the "Darkhold" or if it will continue to just be this macguffin like thing that holds all the keys to the universe and is more powerful seemingly than even the infinity stones or whatever.

Young may was adorable, really liked the scenes with her and phil, love the banter.

However, I'm really not a fan of this recent... ugh I can't even say it. Why can't a man and a woman on TV just be really close friends? There are other forms of love besides romantic. Was anyone else put-off by that, especially the kiss? Just wondering. </TEXT>

I tried doing them last time and ignorantly used olive oil. Shape wise they turned out perfectly, and were incredibly soft instead of dried out and hard.  But the taste... was off. I don't know if it was just using the wrong kind of oil and just wanted to make the simple dessert since the Brownie mix is all ready, I just add the eggs and water and stir.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I can smell sheesha and cigarette smoke from a mile away, I'm completely averse to the smell, and especially hate when it's faint but still lingering in the room. Is there a strong enough air or water filter that completely eradicates the smell? Especially if the $800 prices on amazon are anything to go by; I'd rather not be paying top dollar for something that only sort of works.

I need it for the workplace because of the lower floors having people smoking and it wafting all the way up to our floor, and need a temporary solution since there's no permanent fix unfortunately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The workplace is in a building with several floors, and unfortunately no one cares about no-smoking laws so people just smoke and the smell carries all the way up, 3-5 floors to our floor.
I need a temporary solution since there's no permanent fix, and I'm wondering if those water based air purifiers are actually able to remove the smell completely and replace it with literally anything else. I'd even prefer dettol or that heavy smell of antiseptic that hospitals have because the smoking is that bad, like something out of mad men/old school newspaper bullpens x10 </TEXT>

But yes other than that Another Period is definitely its own thing, and hilarious in its own right, with a great cast, a lot of whom were together for another show from the same studio Burning Love.
