I seriously considered getting this set, but what really turned me off was the brickset review. The lack of detail on the back of the gate as well as ion cannon just completely turned me off from this set. For $270 there are so many other, better sets I would rather get. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have the following minifigs for trade: [image](http://i.imgur.com/6EDR6YX.jpg)

~~I also have just the speeder from the most recent Mos Eisley Cantina: [Image] (http://i.imgur.com/1sZx5xz.jpg). It's missing one [Trans-Clear Plate, Round 2 x 2 with Rounded Bottom](http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=2654 idColor=12#T=C C=12) and one [Light Bluish Gray Hose, Rigid](http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=75c20 idColor=86#T=C C=86), otherwise it is complete.~~

I also have a sealed 76021 and 76038, I can provide pics if anyone is interested. Only looking for Star Wars or LOTR sets to trade for those, or if you have a majority of the figures I'm looking for, something could be worked out.

I'm mostly looking the following minifigs: 

* sw439--501st clone pilot 
* sw445--501st Legion Clone Trooper
* sw243--Chancellor Palpatine
* sw452--Ahsoka Tano
* sw453--212th Clone Trooper
* sw441a--Droideka, Flat Silver Arms Mechanical
* sw178--General Veers
* ~~sw090--Luke SKywalker~~
* sw219--Yoda (grey hair)
* ~~sw538--Plo Koon~~
* ~~sw537--Senate Commando (x2)~~
* sw244--Wolf Pack Clone Trooper (x2)

Thank you for looking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I think I'm going to pass. I'm happy with my complete set, and although the incomplete 1st edition set is probably more valuable, I'll have to go through the hassle of getting those last 6 cards in first edition so my set will be complete again.  Would you want to maybe trade just the common, uncommon, and non holo rares? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand you not wanting to sell all of your 4500 cards individually, but I thought since you had whittled that number down significantly, you might be willing to split up some sets. I also thought 24/34 cards would have been a big enough chunk for you to be happy. I understand though. Thanks for the response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes down to it, it's poor writing and continuity by George Lucas. You can do all the mental somersaults you want, but there really is no logical way to rectify Han Solo's lines about a hokey religion with the reality of the Jedi during the clone wars. You just said there are 1 trillion people on Courascant. So I'm willing to wager that the majority of them knew about the Jedi temple. I bet every kid on Courascant grew up taking filed trips there at least once in their life. There's 1 trillion people with practically direct encounters with Jedi. </TEXT>
