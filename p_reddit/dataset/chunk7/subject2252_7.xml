	<TEXT> if you actually google the phrase it only gives you 44,000 results and most are in reference to the scene in The Room.

Knowing Wiseau I'd say he's referencing Salinger here deliberately to give us a deeper view into Johnny's psyche </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so you probably all know the scene where Johnny asks Mark "Anyway, how's your sex-life?" which seems weirdly out of place. The interesting thing about that is though that it's a direct quote from the J.D. Salinger novel "The Catcher in the Rye" taken from a bar-conversation Holden Cauflield has with an intellectual "friend" of his who can't really be bothered talking to him and Holden asks him "How's your sex-life?" exactly as Johnny does in this scene. 

So my interpretation of this scene is now that Johnny is secretly trying to tell Mark that he knows that he's a phony, that he knows about his affair with Lisa, simply by asking this little question. Johnny probably sees himself as Holden in this scene, a lone fighter for what is right who is surrounded by phonies like Mark who act nice to him but betray him when he is not around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hard to say, it's pretty volatile since it depends on placing at the tournaments, subscribers to their stream and how much their sponsor pays. 

You would have to calculate it for every player individually, like Mango's tournament winnings + monthly pay from mangonation + sponsorship from cloud9 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading TCITR the other day and then it hit me, the guys he calls phonies, those are people like most of the guys here. Posers, who only read a novel to be able to say they've read it, that's why lots of people here have lists of novels to read, that's why Infinite Jest is such a popular recommendation. Most people here don't care about the art, they want a sticker in their notebook, a cookie and a pat on the back that says "well done".
