	<TEXT> You're just trying to obfuscate the basic question here. Seems pretty non-controversial to say that assault-style rifles are more capable firearms than handguns. If your goal is to shoot stuff -- targets, rabbits, intruders, innocent people, whatever -- you'd pick the best tool for the job. Doesn't mean that you can't find a handgun that doesn't compare, but they're not the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little bit on Australia and what the nation actually did after Port Arthur. They held a mandatory buyback of banned weapons types and destroyed automatic and semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. This was not the kind of "confiscation" many people try to scare us with today. Brown-shirts did not go door to door grabbing guns. And while they did raise the bar for gun ownership and create a registry, there are still plenty of guns in Australia today.

	<TEXT> Depends on your definition of "better." They could make an intruder more dead than a pistol could. They could also fill your house and your neighbor's house full of stray bullets. I don't think anyone *needs* an AR-15 for home defense. A shotgun has always seemed like a more sensible choice. But I can see why gun-lovers want them. I can also see why making them available to civilians poses and inherent, though infrequent, risk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No person who has a remote grasp of this issue, politician or otherwise, thinks we're ever going to get rid of civilian gun ownership. Even those who wish we lived in a utopia where people didn't ever need firearms understand that it would be impossible, both politically and logistically, to get rid of 400 million civilian-owned firearms. Once we get this conspiratorial distraction out of the way, we can have an open discussion about whether the proposals we're seeing now are actually effective or worthwhile. If they're not, it's because the proposals are shitty, not because it's impossible to find an acceptable middle ground that will address gun violence and satisfy legal gun owners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not true. Assault-style rifles are better tools, plain and simple. Easier to shoot, better accuracy, better range, are in most cases capable of carrying significantly more ammunition, have higher muzzle velocity, less recoil, highly moddable, the list goes on. How are those the exact same characteristics? Both guns shoot bullets? </TEXT>
