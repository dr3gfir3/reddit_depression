	<TEXT> I would like to know why you'd say that though? Genuinely asking. My knowledge of Rodriguez stretches way before the documentary was conceived and I will never forget the day my dad told me the story. As far as I know he never knew and I doubt that they would hide the fact for dramatic effect. If that was ever the case South Africans would've called bullshit on it long ago  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a South African I can say I pretty much grew up on his music. My dad and his friends had bootleg tapes of him when they were in the border war. Usually the women back home would have to make and send these tapes by mail as his music was banned over here at one stage. It was actually more of a shock to us that he didn't know he was famous.  </TEXT>
