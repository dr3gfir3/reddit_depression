	<TEXT> Yeah, the SK President was impeached on March 10 due to corruption charges (the whole scandal is a crazy web of bribery and abuse of power, and also a blacklist of ~10,000 leftists who criticized the President. I highly recommend everyone look it up because it's interesting to say the very least), and a new president will be elected on May 9. 

The acting President is an old-school conservative, meaning he is extremely focused on national security and hard on NK.  As a prosecutor, he fixated on the National Security Law, a broad Cold War-era ban on engaging with anyone from or speaking positively of NK/communism. 

He is *not* running for the presidency, and both of the two frontrunners are to the left of him, and both believe in opening up relations to the north. 

As far as I can tell, the only way SK will back the US is if the hawks in DC can convince the acting President to go in, like, immediately.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That inching towards the center started in 1972. 

In '72, George McGovern was the Democratic nominee facing Nixon. McGovern promised immediate withdrawal from Vietnam, amnesty for draft dodgers, a 35+% decrease in defense spending, guaranteed minimum income for impoverished families, and supported the Equal Rights Amendment. He was an outsider who ran a massive grassroots campaign in the primaries.

He was a decorated WWII veteran who, after witnessing innocent civilians starve to death, became devoted to ending hunger worldwide. 

But, because he was a populist outsider and his platform was somewhat more radical in certain respects, he was smeared by Democratic party insiders (including Jimmy Carter) as "too liberal." He was branded an elitist despite his humble upbringing and plain manner of speaking. 

A right-wing pundit branded him the candidate  of "amnesty, abortion and acid," which probably would've *won* him votes if he ran in 2016. 

Meanwhile, Nixon was spying on the DNC and attacking McGovern ruthlessly, trying to paint him as a radical whose liberal values and pacifism would make the country weak. 

Side note: the Clintons led the McGovern campaign in Texas, and it could be argued that watching the smear campaign destroy a genuinely good candidate's campaign pushed them to remain publicly centrist. 

We need to embrace progressivism again. McGovern is one of the best presidents we never had.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She really is. She's got pregnant with her first at 16 by a drunkard 8 years her senior, was forced to marry him, and ended up with 5 little boys before she was 25. The original pregnancy was not caused by a consensual encounter, but being a southern woman in the 50s, she didn't have much of a choice. He beat her and sometimes the boys whenever he drank, which was whenever he was home. She finally left him because of my youngest uncle. She got pregnant again and bio-gramps told her she could either give the baby away or he'd "beat it out of her." Grandma made adoption arrangements and cut off all contact with her family in order to keep it secret. 

He was a trucker and wasn't in the state when grandma went into labor. She called her sisters and that went to the hospital. Holding her new son, surrounded by her boys and family, she decided to leave her husband. She couldn't give up her baby. 

Her family packed up what little was hers and she moved in with one of her sisters. After she found a job waiting tables, she got a tiny rental home and kept them all fed for five years. Then she met my grandpa, who married her, took in five little boys (all under the age of 10), and raised them as his own. 

It's literally my favorite story. Between grandma overcoming her fear and circumstances and the beautiful love story aspect, I want to write it into a novel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My grandma was born and raised in a picturesque little Iowa town. The kind of place where the main street is paved with bricks, just like pretty much all of the buildings on the square. Just about everyone who lived there was either an immigrant or first generation, and seven members of my extended family are buried there. The men in that town worked in the coal mine, and the community was vibrant. 

That is, until the coal dried up. That was 30 years ago, and the town is unrecognizable now. I never got to see it when it was a happy place, besides in old, grainy photos. Now, the main street's brickwork is crumbled and broken, all the shops are boarded, and my grandma's childhood home has collapsed due to neglect and the elements. 

A few houses are still occupied (Lord only knows why), and in the woods by the cemetery, someone's parked a rusted-out trailer, nailed a plywood "TRESPASERS WILL BE SHOT" (misspelling and all) sign to a tree, and hung the Stars and Bars off their siding (in Iowa. Ffs. Literally six Union soldiers/veterans are buried not 100 feet from it). 

My grandma was middle class. Her father was a miner and her mom was a schoolteacher. They saved every penny (she was born right before the markets crashed and the soil dried up), and lived like paupers so that their girls could go to college, because they valued the hell out of education. My grandma and her sisters left that town for bigger and better things, as did most of her neighbors. The few who still live there are the miners who didn't leave 30 years ago and their kids and grandkids. 

I don't feel bad for the people who decide to stay in a dying community when opportunity exists elsewhere. I have even less sympathy for that racist illiterate who makes me cringe every year when I visit the cemetery. 30 years ago, college was still affordable and the job market wasn't oversaturated and hypercompetitive like it is now. Hell, if they'd moved 75 miles in any direction, they could've gotten a job in one of the other billion coal mines in the area. 

Does it suck that a prosperous town withered away? Yes, absolutely. But that's life. There was no more coal, no more money coming into the community, and people left. That's what happens when a town is built around one single, finite economic resource.  People have to quit complaining and go find something else. That's what Americans are supposed to be best at.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the girl in the OP lost 20 lbs, she would be very very sick. 

Dude's a fucking idiot. A closer friend of mine is 5'0", weighs 100 lbs, and needs a reduction because her size is 28FF and get back is being destroyed. It's just easier for him to assume that this is women's fault because this doesn't effect him even remotely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother chose a "chad" bad boy foreigner who got her pregnant and then "suddenly"* turned into a violent drunk. 

*He has always been a heavy drinker and a jerk to everyone, including his siblings. My mother chose him because he was the loudest Alpha monkey in a gaggle of monkeys who wanted a ticket to Europe in the early 90s.

**the loudest Alpha monkey in a gaggle of monkeys who wanted a ticket to Europe in the early 90s.**

Bonus racism, I think that is. And he's being racist against half of his own DNA. I almost feel bad for him.

	<TEXT> Or not. I am a girl who has no idea how to flirt, and apparently sometimes my actions (like fucking with my hair because it's loose and in the way, or wearing comfortable active wear and then doing yoga at a gym) has made men think I was flirting. I wasn't.

I go to class in light makeup and yoga pants all the time. With my hair in a messy bun. Guess what, though, it isn't for the dudes in class. It's because it's common courtesy to not be slovenly in public, and I want to be comfortable.
