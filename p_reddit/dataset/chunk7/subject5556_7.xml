	<TEXT> I thought that was ridiculous too--that they went from a social-media company to a "camera" one--but about a week ago I checked if anyone was actually selling and buying Snapchat Spectacles (their camera-sunglasses) on eBay, and as of right now, over the 90 days, over 2,700 pairs were sold, and the most expensive 150 of those were sold for $500 or more. Here's the link, and just to be clear about my own interest in the company, I have no desire to ever use the app or wear those glasses, but I do think the company will be very successful.

	<TEXT> It's not about violent vs. peaceful, it's about reasonable reactions vs. overreactions. Marching would not be an overreaction to a tweet? That's the point he was making: about overreactiveness. There hasn't been an actual march dedicated to rebuking one of Trump's tweets, and at all the protests thus far, I didn't see any sign that was about something he tweeted. So he was saying it figuratively to make the point about the constant hysteria and outrage in the mainstream media and expressed by Trump critics over multiple things every day. 

How have the protests been successful? Because the mainstream media reported about them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  With luck in 4 years Trump will be voted out

The odds are not in favor of that: There's a Republican majority in the Senate, House, and governorships was just reinforced, and the large majority of states voting in the 2018 midterms voted for Trump in the general election, including 5 of the 6 states that flipped from Democrat to Republican (WI, MI, OH, PA, and FL, not IA). With the absolutely nonstop coverage of him on TV and online (not to mention in print magazines and newspapers), the people who voted for him saw more of him and more about him than they ever did of any other candidate in any U.S. election, and he still won 30 states and 1 county, which gave him 77 more electoral votes than the Democrat candidate. You're hoping that tens of millions of Republican voters turn against him and against the Republican party and vote for Democrat or something else. I don't see that as possible. The media has been trying to stop him since his candidacy announcement speech in June 2015; we are now in the third week of his administration, and his Attorney General and Secretary of Health and Human Services were both confirmed in the past two days.

	<TEXT> *As noted on Hacker News:*

There's a missing parameter here: the number of recharge cycles a battery can have without losing large capacity , because over the long term - decades, like done in this business, that's what determines the cost per kwh charge stored and supplied, i.e. what end users pay for.

Without those numbers, it's not possibe to judge Tesla against the competition, for example Alevo, which claims more the 50,000 charge cycles, vs ,i believe, 5000 charge cycles for Tesla.

For Alevo, the final cost per store/supplied should be ~3cents/kwh, over 20 earss lifespan, which should make grid storage very economical.

*And another commenter responded:*

$0.03/kWh delivered is an order of magnitude less than current lithium ion systems which ranges $0.285/kWh - $0.581/kWh delivered to the grid after storage. [1].

Since the data going into Lazard's models are probably at least more than a year old, I wouldn't be surprised if its currently $0.15-$0.30/kWh to store and then deliver a kWh of electricity.

The largest price difference in Southern California Edison's time-of-use tiers is from $0.11/kWh to $0.47/kWh, so I expect that the systems that Southern California Edison is currently installing are fairly cost efficient for them.

If Alevo can actually deliver at $0.03/kWh at scale (and personally I'm skeptical of something that sounds so good), then that's game over for all fossil fuels and nuclear on the electrical grid.

	<TEXT> Similarly, as a commenter in /r/Science said:

Potential confounder: many of us who started young were doing it to escape from violence, sexual assault or other trauma/drama. Lots of depression and other mental illness in this population.

Trauma and depression/mental disorders are independently associated with similar outcomes. Hard to know which way the arrow is facing from an epigenetic perspective.

Still a great study, my takeaway: smoking that young may be more of a red flag, help needed here, vs a risk factor for long term cognitive performance loss.
