	<TEXT> Love this question Kristina! I started out writing for adults as I'm drawn to writing dark themes and then it was funny - I had a young voice in one book (the main character who then grew up) and my editor said I had a natural young voice. So I decided to explore it! I took a class in writing a children's book in 7 months and had the first in the Lightning Road series! The story grew from a tale I told my son as a young child and as he got older he was my perfect audience. I fell in love with writing for kids, especially fantasy! Your imagination can go anywhere and the world is full of magic. I am actually writing picture books now too :) . Funny enough, they contain some of the same themes in all my books that are personal to me: adoption, being an only child, and being abandoned by your family.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know- you are soooo right on that! LOL! I do literally mean SPEED as in racing queen. I cartwheeled once down a mountain and tore all the ligaments in my knee speeding down it. I've also crashed my bike twice and once split the helmet wide open. I just love to fly! It makes me feel supernatural. (and don't tell my dad but my first car was a Mazda GLC and the speedometer said it went up to 125 so I had to make sure. And it did.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for joining in! Ha ha - actually that math fact is the one thing that isn't true! I actually was an ENGLISH teacher for a day. Spent all summer preparing then had a huge anxiety attack and quit. I went the alternative route in NJ where at the time if you had a degree they could accept you to teach in a full time role - without any experience. WTF was I thinking??

I do love my antihero characters! I do adore Batman I admit. Let me slink off to his cave with him. ha ha. But I wouldnt write about him. I am not into writing fan fiction but rather would love to make up my own characters and setting. My favorite tormented hero is King Arthur (and actually have a new middle grade idea for a book involving him right now that is wacky!)

I like to think I keep the material fresh as I write in a blend of genres - mixing fantasy, horror, supernatural, romance, and sci-fi.  I also love to create characters we may perceive as being one way...but then find out they are something entirely different than that initial trope.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always wanted to be a writer since I was 7 and wrote my first piece - a murder mystery screenplay that I had the neighborhood kids act out. There's been murder, mystery and mayhem in most of my works ever since! LOL. I always knew I wanted to write novels though and started my first one 19 years ago. I wrote the first 2 chapters and shelved it for 10 years. Then my mom died. I was devastated and started writing that novel again to focus on anything but my grief. It became my first published novel. I think of it as her little gift to me that she left behind. I don't think I would be a novelist otherwise, so while I'm sad I can't share it with her - I feel like she has passed on her legacy through me. It's a bittersweet feeling. </TEXT>
