	<TEXT> you have to be creative living as a hiker in Indiana! Turkey Run is awesome in the winter time when no one is there.Browny County State Park and Morgan Monroe have wonderful hiking. If you're in Indianapolis, Fort Ben and Eagle Creek are amazing options. My boyfriend took me to Clifty Falls for my birthday last year and it is by far one of my favorite places to hike in Indiana! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember the carnage i saw in Daniel Boone National Forest. My boyfriend and I came up to what looked like an abandoned picnic. plates, food, bags of trash (enough for 10 people) just left there. these people decided they were finished and just left all of their supplies and trash. I am going to GSMNP for a birthday hike in a few days and I plan to take a couple of garbage bags with me. </TEXT>
