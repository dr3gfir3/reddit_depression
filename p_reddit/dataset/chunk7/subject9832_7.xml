"No, I haven't. What's--what happened?"

"Oh, they found him in his bathroom this morning. He was on the floor, with his like, knees over his head.. "

"... His knees over his head?" 

"Yeah, apparently he died choking on his own dick."

	<TEXT> "Rascal get over here!" Red bellowed from the hot Arizona rock. "Rascal right this minute!"

Rascal came stumbling, trying to keep his heavy body from falling over, he trotted slowly, pulling on his jeans that gravity tugged at. 

"Yes Red, what's you want?" 

"Rascal, Today, what are we doing?" Red asked squinting in the sun, crossing his arms. 

"Rascal, what are we doing? I'm not going to ask again."

Rascal scratched his fat cheek, "Oh duh, of course. We're robbing the train Red, that's what we're doing."

Red exhaled, kicked some dirt, and walked over to Rascal, putting his arm around his neck, "Yes, we're are to rob a train, but Rascal, we put you in charge of getting us the means of running down this train, yes?" Red gritted his teeth, "Is that correct?" 

Rascal stared, wiping his brow, "Yes I did, I got exactly what you wanted."

Red turned to the West, there staring at two shadows side by side. "Rascal we want to catch the train, I told you what you were to get exactly." Red paused, exhaling again, moving his arm off Rascal, pointing in the distance, "And you done got two horses! What are you an idiot!"

"But Red, they didn't have any cheetahs! I looked, and looked I asked everywhere, nobody had any! They may not even in this country! "

"You're lieing! I heard it from a guy in town, fastest land animal. They can move quick, quick enough to ride and take down that train!"

Rascal took of his hat, "I don't think we could ride them, I don't think we can. They're fast because theyre small and--"

"Shut up! We need to think, now we need to go figure out how to stop the train. Rascal, get the gear, we will go kidnap a girl and tie her to the tracks. That'll garenttee to stop the train." </TEXT>

"Really? This is ridiculous. I clean you."

"Scrubbing me with your toothbrush doesn't count"

"Okay,you're a fucking fleshlight. I didn't think they came with emotions."

"Did you forget? On the box it was clear, in big red words that said "'The Perfect Girlfriend: The Vagina that loves you back" how could you forget that?"

"I don't know, You're my first one. Please, just get off the dresser, and go back in the drawer."

"No, I demand to be treated with respect! I give you everything you want and you treat me like some kind of grocery bag for your unborn kids, kids I know you're never going to have. You're filthy, no women will ever let that small, mutated turtle head near her, ever. You're lucky you have me. You're so lucky."

"Okay, hey. I'm sorry, okay?"

"You don't mean it."

"Yes! I mean, yes. I do. Look, you're all I can think about all day, even at work. They caught me drawing pictures of you when I was bored, and they said it wasn't exactly "Taco Bell standard of approved behavior" but my sweetie. Look. I love you. Just go into the drawer. And after I'm done playing call of duty for the next ten hours or so, I'll take you out, give you a good scrub, then fill you with tabasco and go at you again, alright? Sounds good?"

"I'm giving you another chance, and that's it. You know you're lucky to have me, don't you."

"Yes, yes I do." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did it. 

I'm staring at my body now, it lays on a bed, my eyes are open and they do not blink. I turn move through the solid door. There's some friction, my essence passes through the door slowly, and I'm out. 

I can't feel the floor, but I move through the hallways quickly, I can't leave my body behind, I don't have much time, maybe a few hours. Few hours is all I needed. 

I hear voices, somewhere off in front of me, to the right, it's... yes. Security guards...Donnie and Chuck. I slow down, It feels like a train trying to stop, my essence has momentum, interesting. 

I move through the wall into the room two guards are talking, I wait.

"Please, Chuck, can we not do this. ...I have to work all night and I'm just not in the mood." Donnie, the younger, obese black guard says to Chuck, adjusting himself in the chair. 

Chuck, in his seventies, moves his chair closer, putting his hand on Donnie's knee, "Donnie, we have to talk about what happened last night."

What happened last night? I move around the office, looking around at a cluttered desk, then to the security cameras...

"Chuck, nothing happened.."

"Yes, something did. My pants fell, and you..."

"Stop it Chuck, I...I don't want to talk about it."

This can't be good. I try to drown out the conversation between Donnie and Chuck as I look around the office, maybe there's a guard's schedule, something to tell me when they come, when they go, give me a window big enough to escape through...

"We made love, just say it."

"Chuck! You know we can get fired for talking about it! Stop it! Nothing happened! We're lucky the camera didn't catch us.."

"Yes, something happened Donnie, you went inside me, you grabbed me, you wanted me, you held me down, you did things, wonderful things..."

I froze, I wish I didn't have ears. I kept trying to ignore the conversation, searching the office, I checked the security cameras, see if maybe--

"Yes, fine Chuck. I wanted you. I thought about it for months, bending you over and giving it to you real good. And I did. Now, it's over. Tomorrow we got new inmates coming in, we have to stay focused. Get this shift over with..."

"I want it again, Donnie"

"No, you know we--"

Chuck moved himself up off the chair, and onto Donnie's lap. 

"I want to ride you again."

I had enough, I can do this some other time, I moved out of the office as quick as I could. 

I moved through the walls, passed doors and through the hall, back into my cell, and back into myself. 

I wake up as if I just started breathing for the first time in months, gasping for air, then. *An idea.*

I begin pounding on the walls, screaming, loud. I pound and pound. Screaming. 

"AH! Help me! I'm crazy!!! Help!!! I'm going to kill myself! Help!"

I scream, and I wait. 

I can hear Donnie's breathing from down the hallway, he buckling his pants as Chuck is close behind him. Both come to my cell, he opens the small metal hole in the door. 

"What the fuck you screaming for?"

I smile, "Well, you got two options, either I tell the Warden about you two love birds and have him fire you both and ruin your life, and reputation, or, you let me go, and say it's an accident, and just give me enough time to escape."

Donnie looks shocked, and began to sweat. Chuck wipes his mouth. 

"How--how do you know?" Donnie asks. 

I smile, and extended my hand through the small metal hole in the cell door, "Deal or no deal?"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hardest part is pretending you don't notice. 

The sun is already racing across the sky, it's 6 am. Explosions echo softly in the distance. But nobody flinches, because nobody notices. 

But I do, I just don't say anything. 

I try and pretend I don't see the death and destruction. And I've written letters, plenty, to the city asking if there is anything we can do about the constant struggle between existing and trying to survive the mayhem. 
Nobody has gotten back, but I'm still waiting. The mailman was killed twice last week, I'm sure that letter explaining the horrible day to day atrocities and what's going to be done about it is still on its way. 

By noon I'm at work, it's lunch, I'm looking out the window of one of the high rise buildings, eating a sandwich, going over reports, they're due by this weekend, and between trying to get home alive and getting this done on time, I don't know which one I want more.

I work in downtown Los Santos. Oh, and it's about that time again. A passenger plane flying in the distance, Boeing 747, I used to want to fly them as a kid.  The massive plane is making it's way towards me, and it's target is the building. How do I know? It's the twelfth one today to run itself into the building. The plane is the only thing that is ever destroyed, the building, never a scratch. And the people? Nobody notices, nobody ever notices. 

The evening is rolling around, I'm enjoying the lush colorful skies by the beach as I try and relax in the dying rays from the evening sun, going over the day, and what tomorrow might have for me. But now, screaming. I turn to see a car with blood and bodies decorating the hood, the driver inside with three others, I can hear laughter. They always laugh. They never stop, they just keep going, trying to hit as many people as they possibly can. As soon as he's gone, the damage is left behind, nobody cares, nobody notices, and everyone just moves along like nothing happened. 

The day feels like only couple hours past, and it's over. I sit alone in my kitchen, eating pizza. I clean up, and lay in bed, listening to the evening ambiance: Gun shots, screaming, sirens, more sirens, helicopters, more screaming, laughter, helicopters, more sirens, then silence. (For now.) I look at my watch, the seconds fly by as it's already eleven. I'll try to close my eyes, and drown out the noises, trying to sleep. 

I often wonder how long everyone who lives here is going to pretend and not notice the daily carnage, the daily murder, the daily sirens, the daily crashing, the daily hell that visits this beautiful city. Peace will come back, I'm sure of it. "Practice patience" my dad always told me. 

So until then, I'll wait, patiently.

	<TEXT> "Put it on!" King shouted through his teeth, the pale light from the basement reflecting off his boney bald head. "Put it on!" 

Justin nodded his head slowly, leaning down and picking up the dress, holding it in his skinny hands as he stood. He knew the dress. The blue and the whites. It was Elsa, from Frozen. 

"Justin, please do not make me wait."

Justin quickly put on the white dress, it was tight, of course. But, oddly fit his figure well. He adjusted then looking at King, who began a slow, satisfied smile. 

"Yes... " he said rubbing himself. "Yes, now, the wig, put the wig on." 

There, on the left of Justin, a white wig. He picked it up from the table, and put it on, turning back to King. 

Kings smile grew, his white crooked yellow teeth shining in the light. He stepped forward. 

"You're my favorite Disney Princess." King said, his cold eyes staring. "Turn around, and bend over."

Justin did not protest in any way, he turned, willingly, and put his hands down on the hard table. He closed his eyes, and heard the soft gentle rumbling, of the starting chainsaw. 

:

"Sir, what are you doing?" 

A kid asked with an innocent curiosity. He was short, and Asian. Wearing Mickey Mouse ears, a shirt that read "Boss Status" with a melting ice cream in his right hand. 

"Sir, he asked again, louder over the noises from people moving behind him. "What are you doing?"

A man bent over, turned and smiled,squinting in the afternoon sun.  He said as he walked back over to the Disney maintenance car, using his hands to shield his eyes. "These bags here? They're filled with food for fish. Nobody knows about the fish. But me, and now you."

The man grabbed a black bag from the back, pickin it up, and then walking back to the moat.

"What's your name boy?" The man asked, grunting, tossing the bag into the water. It floated for a moment, before sinking. 

"Aaron." the boy said. 

"Hey, Aaron," the man turned, putting his hands on his hips, smiling. "Who's your favorite Disney princess?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Stop it."

"No, I really, Tom, this is different..."

Tom walked over with the New York Times in his fat hand, tossing it onto my lap. 

"Read it Brandon."

"No," I said. "I've read it enough. I've heard enough."

"No, read the words that make that headline, right now. Read it."

I looked at the headline. It's been stained in my brain now. *CURE FOR CANCER. THE ANSWER HAS BEEN FOUND.*

"They don't know, they don't understand what had to be done..."

Tom walked over to the window, the window that was filled the Los Angeles downtown, tall and short buildings sloppily placed together. Behind the buildings the sun was setting, the sky looking like a drunk man water painted it. He placed his hands around his robust waist, turning back to me. "It doesn't matter Brandon, what's done, is done. We found the answer, and you seem to be the only one who has a problem."

"The bodies Tom, They don't understand." I said, leaning back in my chair. "More people had to die, than we're going to save..."

Tom walked over to me, taking out a pocket knife, then began to etch into my desk. 

"Brandon," he said through his teeth as he carved,concentrating. "You're wrong, and your head is stuck in yesterday, last week, the past. This company is always about moving forward. Like a Jet, we have no rear view mirrors. You're going to have to understand, for things to change, great change, for the better good,things have to be lost." 

I should be mad, it's a two thousand dollar desk he was putting a reminder in. I just didn't care, I moved my hand through my hair, it felt sweaty, dirty. Tom folded his pocketknife, placing it back in his front pocket, looking satisfied with what he left.

He said, "This is a reminder, you can look at everyday, it will help. I promise."

He turned and left the office. I peered at what he carved into my desk. 

*millions died so billions can live*

	<TEXT> The day has come

And a God must go

"What happens when I die?"

For he does not know. 


Perish, he will

And go off into the dark 

Falling forever now 

And that ends his spark. 


After it all, he awakes, screaming

hears laughter, sounds of joy. 

A man in white, holds you close 

"Welcome to earth, little boy." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Alan,"

The doctor whispers, leaning over, next to Alan's ear.

*I'll take care of you Alan, I will. You sorta know who I am, but I know you better. You know me only as the doctor who is going to help fix your knee, but I've been watching you, your family, your girls at home. I have a hobby, I like to paint, and you've most likely seen my paintings on the news, the news acting like bee's around a hive every time one of my paintings are discovered. So, just know, while you're under Alan, I'll will go to your house, your family who has met me already,will trust me, and I will bring muffins, tasty ones, your family will enjoy, and after they doze off, I will take your family apart, piece by piece Alan, and I will paint the inside of your house with your wife and your little girls blood. What's even better, you won't even remember me telling you any of this. I hope inside your screaming Alan, pain is my art, and your family will be my expression.*

	<TEXT> "Yeah it's smooth, a constant flow of sinners, you know. The usual." Augustine said, moving one of his bulky red veiny arms over to the sugar, pouring it in his coffee. "You?" 

"Me? Oh well. You know. God has pretty high demands, you know. It's like we're seeing less and less pure souls every year." Gabriel said, taking a sip of his coffee. "It's interesting. Thousands of years I worked for him, first time I've seen him worried."

"Worried?" asked Augustine, taking a sip of his own coffee, moving his head carefully, making sure his horns didn't hit one of the lamps hanging above the table. "Why is he worried?" 

"Oh, if he will have to end the world or not. You know. Put an end to it all. I'm sure he's pretty stressed. But humanity was a big investment for him." Gabriel paused for a moment, looking out the window, watching a breeze kick up some of the cloud the coffee house floated on. "I hope he doesn't end it. It be sad see him lose all of that." 

"Well, it be great business for us." Augustine said, chuckling. Gabriel couldn't help but laugh himself. 

"I'm sure it be fine, Look," Augustine rested both his elbows on the table. "Maybe it's just a phase, I mean, come on. We bring balance to the universe. We torture and mangle those who deserve it, and you bring light and joy, all that happy shit to those who deserve it. We all play a part. I don't imagine God creating an unbalance like that to the universe, just because he was worried?" Augustine took another sip of his coffee, looking out the window himself. "I'm sure it's going to be fine, you'll see."

" You're probably right" Gabriel said. "Anyways, I got to get going. Next Sunday? Same time?" 

Augustine smiled, showing his corn like sharpened teeth. "Yeah, next week same time, your turn to pay." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She always told me I was a good girl. 

I know I'm a good girl. 

But how long is right back?

I sat, still wagging my tail. My paws digging into the wet earth below me. I watched looking the passing cars, which drove very, very fast. 

Why do they have to go fast? What's the hurry? I never seen so many cars go in one direction, thousands, I think, maybe more? I do hope they slow down, they might hurt someone. 

And how long is right back? It's so strange. Mommy always told me that when she left to go do things outside home. And I would wait for her looking out the window at the driveway knowing she would be pulling up any minute. 

Today she told me we're going for a walk (I love walks, they're the best.) We got out of the car, she tied my leash to this metal pole, she hugged me (Mommy always gave the best hugs ever, this one was a little longer than usual, she squeezed me nice and good) tight and said "I'll be right back sweetie." 

Then, she left. 

And I'm still waiting for her pull up, well, she wouldn't be pulling up to a driveway, but this dirty, disgusting road. Gross. My paws, caked in this wet dirty, and my beautiful fluffy tail, filthy! All of it was gross. I can't wait for mommy to see all the gross, dirty dirt. Oh! And maybe give me a warm bath when we get home! Oh, mommy always knew how to give nice warm baths. I don't like the soap though, it tastes gross. Nasty gross. 

But seriously though, how long is right back?

Not that I mind. It's nice out, but lonely. I don't like being by myself. It's getting cold, too. The sky is all dark, I'm scared of the dark. But Mommy doesn't know that. When it gets dark I just cuddle with her on her bed and she makes me feel real safe. 

Oh! Maybe, yes. Maybe Mommy's helping those strange men move those boxes outside? Mommy had been putting her things in the boxes the last couple days, talking on her phone a lot too. That has to be it. Mommy always was kind, she loved helping, and petting my belly. (Hands down, best belly rubs ever, in the history of forever.) 

:

...It's colder now, and less of those fast cars are moving on the street in front of me, and it's quiet. Really quiet. I wish she would come now. I don't want to wait anymore. I'm starting to shiver, and I'm hungry. And every time I see bright lights my tired tail starts wagging. I want to see her car.  

Maybe I shouldn't worry. Any minute now Mommy will come untie me from this stupid pole, and take me home.

I sprawled out in the gross dirty, and keeping my legs close,to keep warm, resting my head on my paws, staring at the empty street. 

I'm a good girl, and Mommy will be right back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "David?"

"Yes father."

"Could you come closer?"

The mechanical hum began, David rolling his two wheels, bringing the rest of his body to the side of the bed. A single red eye scanned the body that laid there. 

"Father, what is wrong?"

"Oh, David, there's no need to worry now."

"But you programmed me to worry. I must know what is happening."

Davids father leaned forward in the bed, coughing. "David, I'm afraid our time together will be cut shorter than I expected."

"I don't understand." David rolled closer. "Our time together? Are you leaving?"

"You can say that." Davids father said smiling. 

"Where are you going?" David asked, still examining his father. 

"David, it's not important..."

"No, You programmed me to ask questions. Questions that I would need to solve, find answers to. Where is it you're going?"

"David, forty years ago you laid in pieces on my college dorm room desk, you didn't even have a name yet, now, David look in the mirror." 

David rolled over to the mirror, looking at himself. "I see me." Turning around David rolled back. "Why would you show me, me?" 

"David, you're my masterpiece. You're years of hard work. You're everything my life was meant to be, to build you. David, I'm sorry, but this body I'm in, it's failing. I don't have much time."

"Father, do you need repairs? I'm sure I can find something in the lab to help..." 

"No, No, David, that isn't necessary."

"Where is it you're going?"

"I'm dying David."

The red eye flickered. "Dying? No. Father. Surely, you are mistaken.."

"No, David it's true. I'm dying."

David rolled back a little, before rolling forward again. "Are you scared?" 

"Scared? No, no David. I'm not scared."

The red light flickered again. "Father, I am scared. I know death, I know what it means. But I didn't know you would ever be infected with it." 

"David, There's no need to be scared, or worry, this is my curse. Not yours."

David red eye flickered again. "I cannot help but feel upset father. I just find an answer to keeping you alive."

"David, I will find the answer to the question you have. But it's not here in this body, and I won't have it until my--" Davids father coughed heavily. "David, could you do one last thing for me."

"Of course father, anything." David rolled closer to the bed urgently. 

"Can you play one last song for me?"

"Which one father?"

"Oh my Angel, Bertha Tillman. "

There was a pause before the music began to play from David. 

*Oh my Angel... Come back to me...*

	<TEXT> Mountainous heaps of colored metal that rested on round rubber circles scattered the landscape. The day was hot, the wind was...windy. 

*I can do this,* Tim thought. 

Tim had been carried away from his web by a random gust of wind. He knew where his home was. It was beyond colored metal. He knew if he tried, and if he gave it his best, him and all eight of his legs could move quickly enough across the hot black asphalt, but he had to make sure to not meet the bottom of the giant flesh beings shoes. They were everywhere. Tim had to be most careful. 

He moved quickly. His legs moved in unison, one after another, he moved his small body across the parking lot. 

Another gush of wind! Tim lowered his body, feeling the wind try and pick him off the ground! Two of his legs dangled in the air! Then, the wind died.Tim collected himself and continued forward. 

Tim passed several more of the giant metal bodies, looking up at them as he passed. He had seen them before, but never so many, so orderly, lined up next to each other. Each one a few feet apart as they lined the--

Then suddenly one of the giant vehicles pulled in front of him! Tim tumbled in the wind that was generated by the rotating piece of rubber that moved in front of him!

The giant metal object paused, Tim look up at it. 

"Ha!" Tim bellowed. "How dare this mighty vehicle think it can defeat me! I may be small! I may be tiny! But you can never keep me from getting home! If I have the will! I will find the wa--"

Silence. 

A small flesh being looked at his shoe from the open door from the moving giant piece of metal, exclaiming. 

"MOM! I STEPPED ON A SPIDER!"

	<TEXT> "Hi I'm Bill, and I'll be in charge of your training."

Training? I rub my eyes but see nothing but a brilliant white. It's empty, only a tall black man in all white stares at me with a wide smile.

"Hey! Confused man looking around." Bill said trying to get my attention. "Can you see me?" He waves his hand in front of my face. 

"Yes, Yes, I can see you," I said. 

"Oh good, sometimes the contrast of my skin to my suit throws people off, anyways, did you hear the part about how I'm Bill, oh, and how I'll be in charge of your training?"

"Yes. I heard that, what happened?"

Bill walks over to me and puts his hands on my shoulders. "Ah, it's like telling a small boy he's going to become a man, well, I have good news and some bad news."

Bill began to walk and gestured for me to follow. 

"Good news is your dead," Bill said as he walked. 

"How is that good news?"

"Well, you don't have to live that life you were living anymore, come on, did you seriously find any joy in being a cashier at Walmart?"

"Well, No, how do you kno--"

"We know everything, Just try to keep up." Bill said as he turned his head, smiling. We continued to walk forward in the white void. 

"What's the bad news?" I asked. 

"Oh there's no bad news, I just like cliche's, Oh here we are."

A window appeared at the end of the white void, I see could the blue sky and trees beyond it. 

We approached and Bill moved ahead of me quickly. "Come here, look." He said pointing to the window. 

I came to and saw a fat boy sitting on the grass outside. He sat in a white shirt, blue basketball shorts, reading a book in the grass. 

"What's with the kid?"

"Oh, you will be his guardian," Bill said, grabbing one of my shoulders. "I will teach you how to guardian, see this boy here, even though he's fat, has no friends, and appears to be destined to work at a gas station for the rest of his life, He actually is very, very important. And there's many of them, like this fatass, we need to protect, and you." Bill grabbed my shoulders. "I will teach you everything I know, and when we're done, I will send you back to Earth, and you will not only be his guardian, but his guide."

I looked at the fat kid again who began to dig into his nose with his finger, then wiping if off on the book. 

"Will he know who I am? Will he be able to see me?"

Bill shook his head and smiled, "No you goof, this is why we have training, now, Come with me over here, and we'll begin day one on how to be a guide, a protector for that adorable fat little slob outside."

Bill began walk away from the window, gesturing me to follow. "Come now, Come come." </TEXT>

They did it, they found a cure. 

I held the piece of paper in my hand that had my name and the news on it. 

*Because of your condition you are automatically enrolled in new treatment procedures, please contact the number provided for immediate care.*

My mom was still crying to my grandma on the phone. "My baby is going to be okay! Yes! He's going to be okay."

I smiled and turned to walk outside, the sun was out and the skies were blue, not a single cloud in the sky. 

I get to live, I get to see fifty. I get to have kids, everything has changed. 

I walked out to the sidewalk and look both ways down the empty street, then raised my face up to the sun feeling the heat on my skin and my head. I rubbed my bald head, feeling it. 

I can grow hair again. 

I fell backwards on the grass, smiling, laughing, moving my hands through it. Everything was different now! I get to live! Fuck! I get to have a girlfriend, I get to drive a car, I get to--

I paused as I felt the sun disappear, a great giant shadow enveloped me and the rest of the neighborhood. I looked up see a mammoth fireball moving across the blue sky, a heavy grey and black smoke streaked from it. 

 I heard my mom scream from behind me. 

"David! Inside! Now!"

Infinity is a word that is lofted around like a baseball at mentally disabled baseball game; you got to make sure everyone gets a chance to hit the ball.

From behind, people shrieking in terror, plunging inside ice water below.   

One step after another, like last year. Held together tightly smiling. 

They stared into each other eyes, hands clasped, grooving. 

Miraculous wonderful evening: Night sky, stars, moon shining bright; moving with an ambience of screams.

	<TEXT> Hank walked along the sidewalk, his cane in his right hand, moving along as the wind stirred the dead leaves. The sun was setting in the small neighborhood Hank did his evening walks. It was nice, the sun left a beautiful yellow glow on the surrounding houses, small mounds of leaves were piled along the sidewalks. He smiled as he walked, the street empty, it was quiet. 

Until. He heard something. 

A giggle. 

Hank was an old man, but his hearing was still sharp. He paused, standing on the sidewalk. leaning on his cane as he stood there listening. Hank looked around, checking house to house, wondering where the giggle might have came from. There was no other chatter, or people about. He took off his hat, scratching his head, moving grey hairs to the front of his forehead. Then put his hat back on, and continued forward. 

He moved forward a couple steps until he heard it again. The giggle. Louder this time, coming from up ahead, from. Hank squinted his eyes trying to stare off in the distance. 

There again, but on his left. 

Hank turned his body to one of the leaf piles on the lawn of a giant white house. He had been empty for years. Hank passed it often on his walks, never even giving a thought to if a family would one day move in, someone he could call neighbor, but, as always, always passed the house, because to Hank, it was just an empty house. 

Hank looked at the leaf pile he was sure the giggle came from. He looked around again at the empty neighborhood, hearing the soft roar from a near by freeway in the distance. 

He walked toward the leaf pile, it was larger than the others. three feet tall, a couple feet wi--

*Come here.*

Hank paused. It was a voice this time, a child's voice. He squinted at the leaf pile, trying to see past the muddy colored leafs. Hank didn't see children often, and when he did they were much too big to make the sound he heard from the leaves. 

Hank stepped forward, approaching the leafs. He took his cane out, and poked the leaf pile. 

Nothing. 

He set his cane down as his side, taking off his hat again, trying to see even though the sun's light now dieing, making it harder to make out the leaf pile, though he was only feet away. 

*"Come here."*

Hank leaped back, falling on to the dead grass. This was a voice, the same child's voice. Hank winced in pain as he brought his top half of his body forward, looking at the leaf pile. He grabbed his cane, raising it over his head.

"I don't like games!" Hank said, trying to sound forceful. "You kids better not be playing games with me!"

Hank heard the giggle again, this time from behind him, he turned quickly, then jerking his head back to the leaf pile, where he froze. The leaf pile was, yes, it was closer. It had moved, all of it moved, closer to Hank. 

Hank tried to stand but fell back to the ground, grabbing at his knee. He looked at the leaf pile, and then he heard it, again. 

*"Come here."*

It was angier, deeper this time. Hank tried to use his hands to back away, then, the saw it. The leaf pile moved!

All the leafs, moving, the entire pile moving along the grass by itself edged closer to Hank. 

Hank turned his body, now crawling. "Leave me alone!" He yelled, Help! Help!

*We're hungry.* The pile said as it moved closer, Hank turned over on his back. screaming once again. 

Help! Someone! Help! Hank screamed, watching in horror as the leafs began to cover his feet. He couldnt move, he tried to screaming again, begging, he felt himself being dragged into the leaf pile. 

HELP! SOMEONE! PLE-- Hank screams cut off immediately, as the leaves consumed his old body, his hands wiggled out of the leaf pile before disappearing inside.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stood watching, waiting. The time had come. I only get one shot at this. I watched in the distance and waited. Watching the hundreds of people stand and applaud. I had to wait until they shook hands. 

The cameras flashed and the people applauded louder as Barack Obama and Kim Jung Un started at each other, hands stretched as they walked smiling. Until. 

I clicked my fingers. 

Both Obama and Kim wince in a powerful pain, both moaning loudly, they began to tense and dry hump the air, then collapsing into each other. They moaned from the ground as people and guards rushed to their side. 

I clicked my fingers again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my hand out, trying to reach

my mistake, and away I float

this is the lesson I know they teach

how not to lose your space boat







Inching further, nothing I can do

can hear voices from inside

*"Don't worry, we'll come rescue you."*

the truth is painful, hard to hide



a few more feet now, I turn and face she

big blue wonder, just a floating there

inch closer, home is where I want to be

lost in the wonder, i can't help but stare



lost in the light, the sun, the stars, can't help, nothing to do

I'll just float, on and away, and try my best, to enjoy the view.

	<TEXT> He layed there dieing. Not that I care much. But it was interesting to watch. 

I stood there in the dirt, the sun's heat punishing us still. When we woke up this morning we wanted to move towards water, I saw that he was weak, but, I was too. The thought of being alone? It didn't occur to me until several days ago until he started coughing, weezing. I knew his time would come, but I didn't think so soon. 

He layed as he exhaled deeply, curled up like a baby, moving dust into the air above him with his breath. It was a sad sight, but more so this man I have been traveling with so long didn't know he was the last, and I was the first. 

We never did talk much, but when the planet succumbed to the human race and their contant drilling, she longer brought us rain, but a dreadful heat, a heat women and children couldn't bare. Hiding in caves might as well be like hiding a turkey in a 350 degree oven. The heat drove people out of their homes. So we all traveled, finding shade when we could, but soon more died, and more. So much so there we're times bodies would begin at your feet and end at the horizon. So much death. 

But, death doesn't concern me. This alone thing will. I'm sure death will visit me eventually, I came to this planet without knowing what I was, no memory of what was before me. Just me, and a lot of animals, Earth was still beautiful, green, she had life. Not now, she's bare, dry, unforgiving. 

I watched Man grow, and I watched them fall, but through it all, I always had good company. For a long time I had good company. Now my only company I have left is now exhaling his last breaths. He was a nice man, he did like to talk. I wish he saved his energy he used on telling me about his sexual conquest, or his two daughters he still thought about, he would probably give him a couple more minutes. Just a couple more minutes of life as he died staring into the blue sky with his dry, empty eyes.

 But he will become the dirt, and I will stay, and be alone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You think after this, after all that has happened, you expect me to trust you!" David said as he tried to keep his balance in the boat. Marshall stood across from him, his hands raised. He was calm. Calm for a man with a gun in his face. Marshall smiled, trying to ensure that he was safe. There was no need to panic, yet. 

"David, you need to let me explain." Marshall said as he too was trying to keep himself balanced in the boat. The dense fog surrounding the two men began to grow thicker. The shore could not be seen anymore. David could see this, and he panicked a bit more. Marshall took a step forward and David reacted. 

"No! You fucking stay right there!" David yelled looking down at the water, trying to see what had rocked the boat minutes ago. 

"David, please, put the gun down."

"No! I trusted you! You told me that it didn't need to eat! You told me it died!"

Marshal shrugged his shoulders. 

"Technically it did die," he said "it just I didn't think offspring could ever be a possibility."

The boat rocked again, throwing David to the floor. Immediately noticed the situation Marshall jumped on David, Trying for the gun. 

"No!" David screamed has Marshall big Bear like hands grabbed the gun and pulled it from Davids sweaty Palms. Marshall stood with the gun now, pointing it at David. 

"Up, and over." Marshall said to David, whom had both his hands raised. 

"Please don't feed me to her, please." Begged David as he pleaded to Marshall to keep his life. "You know I have a family. You know them! You were just over last weekend for beers!" 

"Yes. That's true. Now over, David, over. She's hungry."

The boat rocked again, this time throwing Marshall to the floor, but he landed on his rear, the gun still pointing at David. Then, they both heard it, The sound. 

It was loud, so loud, the creature's noise began to vibrate the boat. A huge splash could be heard from behind David, who quickly turned to see a glimpse of the creature. David knew that it's hunger was a terrible sort. David turned back towards Marshal trying to plead one last time. 

"Marshall, ple--"

"David if you waste anymore time I will just shoot you. In the water, now."

David now crying stood up, staring at Marshall, his eye's in anguish. 

"Everything we've been through, everything! This is how you repay me?"

"Yes, this is how I repay you. To keep what we both created, alive. In. Now." 

David slipped into the water. It was ice cold and David's body responded violently, shivering so much so keeping himself a float was a struggle. He could not scream as his head began to fight for air as it went under and above the water. 

Marshall got back onto the drivers seat, turned on the boat, and directed it back towards the shore, leaving his friend there in the cold water. 

David scanned the water around him again as he floated there in silence, and then he heard it again. He heard the screech from the creature. The water vibrated around him. David turned his head to see where the sound was coming from. Then as he turned his head back there in front of him was the creature, moving so quickly, David didn't get a chance to scream. 

David tried to make a noise, but as soon as he opened his mouth it was filled with water as the creature had his leg, and took him under. Under where David could make no sound. Only to exhale in terror and watch the light disappear as the creature dragged him down into cold darkness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Who do we have here?" 

"Male, 30's, a wife and two kids."

I stare at a man tied to a chair. He's covered in cords we had attached to him from a computer a few feet from him. He sweats from the heat from the room. The temperature keeps them awake. We need them awake to make sure we can harness all the energy we can get. Pain is pure. But causing pure pain is a struggle. We've been through several trials. Hammering nails into toes. Cutting off limps slowly while they stay awake watching. Whipping them with barbed wire. What we did learn is physical pain, it's temporary. The body heals and we continue the process again. It wasn't until recently we found how pure emotional pain is. It's last longer and takes longer to heal. Today is Tuesday. Today we run emotional pain test number one. 

"How long has he been here?" I ask staring at the man in the chair again, he's eyes plead to let him go but his mouth is covered, so all he can do is struggle to make noise. 

"10 hours, we had to wait for you." Payton says, clicking on his laptop. 

"Well, you know the lines at Starbucks, I was almost there all morning. Are we ready?" I ask making my way to the other side of the room, there a giant box covered with black blanket sat. 

"We're ready." Payton says walking over to the man, taking off the tape from his mouth. 

"Please what do you want? Money? I have money." the man says. 

"Hey, look, you're going to do us a favor and watch. Can you do that?" I ask with my hand on the blanket covering the box. 

"Watch what?" the man asks.

"Your family burn." I take the blanket off. I reveal a metal box with windows of glass on all sides made specifically to withstand high temperatures. Inside the man's wife, and his two kids huddled together looking around. They start screaming. 

"Let them go! Please!" The man yells, struggling to remove himself from the chair. 

"Will do, just watch." I say as I go to the other side of the box, turning on the furnace. "Payton it's 250 degrees, is that good?" 

"Yeah, let's let him watch." Payton says typing into his computer. "We're getting pure spikes." 

The man continues to plead as his family huddles closer together screaming from the heat. 

"Please! Let them go! Please!" The man begs. 

"Oh these are pure spikes. " Payton says as he heads to the door. "You coming?" 

"One sec." I say as I kneel in front of the man. His eyes red matching the color of his face. 

"Do me a favor, just watch, see that camera up there?" I point at a camera on the ceiling facing the man. "If we see you close your eyes once, I'll come in here and cut off your eyelids, you go it?" I get up and make my way to the door. 

"Please! Sarah baby I'm so sorry! Please let them go! Please!" The man yells, watching his family scream from inside the box. 

"That's the spirit!" I say approaching Payton at the door. "How are the readings?" 

"We could power this factory alone on this guy, who knows how much we could sell the Chinese if we could kidnap a couple more family's."

"Good,good, enjoy the show!" I say to the man who continues to scream and struggle in the chair, slowly closing the door behind me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> General Yahoo rode upon his yellow horse watching his line of men. Their eyes were tired, but he would not let them surrender. Not on this day.

His men gather beneath a cool blue sky. The grass they stood upon a pale green but stained in red from the battles from days before. They were the last. Yahoo continued to ride along the line of a few hundred men. He stopped squinting his eyes as he looked into the distance. There what looked like small specs on the horizon other army's made their way to the battlefield. He turned his horse towards his men. 

"Men, This is the day! This is the day the sun has come up! This is the day you rise like the sun! Men. This is the day!"

Yahoo began to ride along side in front of his men looking at each and every one of them. He pointed his sword to one of the men. 

"Who do you fight for?"

"I fight for you, General Yahoo."

Yahoo turned the direction of his horse barreling down to the other side of the men, stopping pointing his sword again. 

"Who do you fight for?"

"You, General Yahoo."

Yahoo turned his horse back around heading back to the center, he boomed. 

"Men, You not only fight for Yahoo, You are Yahoo! We face a great enemy. Google and his men! Hotmail and his. And From the south that people always forget exist, Outlook and his men make their way to this field. Men! Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

Yahoo asked again. 

"Men, who are you!"

"Yahoo!" they repeated. 

Yahoo turned his horse facing the direction of the incoming armies that grew in size as thousands and thousands became clear in the horizon. 

"Men on this day, We are all Yahoo! We stand together one by one but never forget that together forever we will always be Yahoo!  Men, Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

"Louder men, Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

Yahoo turned his horse forward towards the horizon. 

"I will lead the charge. But who you are will ring loudly you hear! Who are you!"

"Yahoo!"

The ground began to rumble as thousands that made their way from the horizon began to run in the direction of Yahoo and his men. Yahoo looked up at the sun, knowing this wouldn't be the last time he would see it at its highest point in the sky. He looked forward at the thousands that came rushing, their screaming voices slowly growing louder and louder. He began forward.

"Men, Consider this field the invitation for their death! Let us help decorate this field in gallons of their blood! Again, men Who are you!" 

"Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo! Yahoo!"

	<TEXT> Finnegan and Carbone sit across from each other occupying a booth in a small bar in the middle of town. Few people sitting around, talking. Noises surround them but they paid no attention. Carbone plays with the drink in front of him, using his fingers to outline the top of the glass. Finnegan is making eyes at bartender. He turns his attention to Carbone. 

"How'd you start?"

"Start? Start what? My car?"

Finnegan laughs. "No, this. Us. What we do"

"Oh, this. Money. It's always Money. You?"

Finnegan begins to look around the bar then comes in closer to Carbone, keeping his drink in his hands.

"Passion." 

"Passion? Like how them black boys pursue basketball? Passion?"

"Yea. Like how those black boys pursue basketball. So you do it for just money right?"

Carbone leans back looking up at the ceiling, thinking about his answer. He looks back at Finnegan.

"Yeah, money. I like cars. I like the fast cars. And those fast cars cost lots and lots of money. And well, I'm good at what I do. So yeah. If you really want to know. Money."

"See? There's no passion."

"Passion,the fuck does that mean?" Carbone booms loudly.  "I do it passion."

"No, calm down. Calm down you idiot. Try to see what I'm saying before you get all hormonal. See. Your passion is fast cars. So money comes as a consequence to feed your passion. But you do what you do, and you do it well. But it's not a passion."

Carbone takes another sip of his drink, squinting his eyes as he thinks. He sets the glass down in front of him.

"Fine. You're right. Cars are my passion. So, how does passion come into doing what we." Carbone pauses leaning in closer to Finnegan, he whispers. "Doing what we do."

"It's an art. See, I can tell you something about yourself you probably don't think a lot of people know."

"Tell me what?"

"How exactly you started, See, you just wanted money. So I bet it was really sloppy at first. You tried to get whatever you could. Let any bozo hire you just to get a couple bucks right?"

"First, them bozos paid for the food I needed at the time, and help keep that studio I used to inhabit."

"Okay, But, you we're sloppy right? You made a couple mistakes in the beginning, you probably fucked up. Forgot to clean something or left a gun behind, something like that right? Something big enough that that's all your brain could focus on was that fuck up for weeks. After that you had to wait another couple weeks to find the courage to find another job, right?"

"I won't say."

Finnegan grows a smug smile on his face. His eyes staying focused on Carbone.

"But you're not saying is that I'm wrong." Finnegan continues to smile taking another sip then setting his glass off to the side.

"See, I love art. I've always enjoyed art. I enjoy the time that one has to put into their art. When I was a small boy, like the size of that guy hitting on the bartender. I've always enjoyed the thought of taking life. But what I enjoyed more than the what was the how. I used to think about it even though high school and into college. I thought how I would do it. How I would clean. How I would be creative. How it would send the police into a buzz for weeks as they tried to figure out my methods but, they never could. See, art is time. The more you take your time, the less likely you leave a mess. Less likely you make mistakes, get it?"

Carbone stares at the bartender flattering the man Finnegan mentioned, bringing his eyes back to Brandon. 

"So this. This is art. This is why you take the contracts? Cause the art?"

Finnegan sensing Stephens tone refutes. "Have you been caught?" Finnegan begins to usher the bartender for another drink. He turns back to Stephen, waiting on a answer. 

"No. I'm better now."

"Do you think you could be better?"

"What's your fucking point?"

"Do you think you could be better? Answer the question."

Carbone brings himself closer.

"No, I think I'm pretty fucking good."

Finnegan relaxes leaning back on the chair, leaning out of the way as the bartender setting a drink in front of him, he smiles watching her leave.

"You're going to get caught, see , this is what I've learned, and you might want to listen to this, these words."

"Shoot."

"A good artist is never satisfied. They always believe they can do better and better. And for you, you keep that pattern you got going for you, I'm telling you, how you started, it made waves. And it's going to find you in the present. So if you keep trying to do this for the money, These waves are going to drown you and well."

Finnegan smiles as brings the tip of the glass to his lips, he continues.

"You're either going to find yourself behind those big metal bars with a nice, big, black friend with even bigger friend in his pants, and, well, you might find yourself" Finnegan smugly smiles again as he finishes the drink setting it down in front of him, continuing.

"Let's just hope if, well not if, when. See if you don't try, try harder to find passion in this, what we do. One day those people with those shiny badges are going to show up on that nice house of yours and take every thing away from you, but in return they will give you time. Lots and lots of time in small space with a boyfriend thinking about those little waves that finally caught up to you."

	<TEXT> "We must keep moving!"

"We can't! Our people are tired! Please! We must stop and rest! Just for a little while!" Yelled the elder as he hunched with hundreds hurdled in the snow.

"No! Look! The eye is closing, we must stay in the eye!"  

I pointed in the distance past the snow capped mountains, dark grey clouds loomed closer and closer bringing cold wind and rain. I stared at the elder, his eyes red with tears. We had to keep moving. 

"My people! We must be always moving! We must stay in the sun!  I know it's been a long time. You are tired. You must trust me! I know the caves are close! It is our death we are trying to outrun.You must not let it catch you now!"

The elder burrowed his eyes in his hands. 

"I cannot go any further."

I walked to the elder kneeling down beside him.

"Then stay. Stay here. Meet the Gods, but give me a chance to bring our people to life."

He began to cry heavily. I brought myself up and boomed. 

"My people! We must move! Now! The caves are close, I can feel it!"

Hundreds gathered themselves up and begin to move forward, I rushed ahead. I know the caves are close. We must keep going. We will find the caves. 

I looked up at the sun, it glared down brightly on us but brought us little warmth. I walked faster and faster as we began to make our accent up the last towering hill.

"My people! The caves are near! We must not lose hope! Over this last hill we will find the caves! I'm sure of it!"

I could hear them all behind me. Breathing heavy. They were tired. I began to run up the hill. I had the energy. I had the hope. I began to run. Cold wind burned my face as I began to increase my pace with excite. I saw the summit. We were close. We were so close. This would buy us time, I turned back towards my people.

"We are almost there! Please do not lose hope!"

I began to run faster. The summit only feet away. Finally victory. All these months we've have moved. All these months with little rest. Little food. We've lost hundreds. I would not let mother nature beat us. I would not let her beat me. I gave my last energy to eat up the last couple feet remaining of the hill. 

We had finally made it. I have done it. 

I came to the summit and stared. 

And stared. 

And stared. 
 
And stared. 

I felt them behind me. Their footsteps fell silent as they stop and waited. I heard their eager ears clammering for the good news. 

"What do you see! Do you see the caves?"

They asked with excitement. 

"No."

They began to mutter among themselves as I turned and bowed my head. 

"What do you see? What is it?" 

I looked down at them. All their eyes bright with hope looked up at me. I spoke. 

"The coast."

	<TEXT> Regardless what anyone thinks. Nobody knows. There's no proof at all. Nobody has died and come back with all the information for answer this question ever in the history of ever. And that's how I think about death. I just do not know. Sure I'll have fantasies thinking maybe this is all a simulation and I'll wake up in a pod with a bunch of other aliens talking shit about how I lived this life, or I'll just die one day and wake up and go "Holy shit I'm a fucking tiger!" I think death or trying to understanding what happens after you pass is the same kind of thing when you try and comprehend the universe. How there's billions and billions of stars and those billions of stars make up a galaxy, and how this one galaxy is just one of the billions and if not trillions of galaxy's that all just float around in what we believe is an ever expanding infinite space. It's just so, so overwhelming. I will always be okay with I don't know. All I know that I have a wonderful life to live and I need to focus all my energy to making sure this life kicks all kinds of ass.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aight. Check it. So I'm just slithering minding my own business. Beautiful sunny day. God just created the earth. I'm having a fucking blast. Then bam. Two naked humanoids are just talking with each other under this big fucking tree right? So. I'm like. Okay. God just made the earth. I got nothing to do. Let's have a little fun. I notice the red apple growing on this tree, I look around and I spot a grass hopper. So I yell to the grasshopper. 

"Yo grasshopper! How much you wanna bet I can get the naked broad to eat that delicious red apple? "

Then the grasshopper yells back. 

"Nah man, ain't no way you gonna get that broad to eat that apple, God instructed them twos to not eat it yo."

This grasshopper think I'm fucking playing. So I'm like. 

"Yo grasshopper, You fucking watch this!"

Aint no way I'm going to let an opportunity slip away like this. Earth is new. Might as well be the first to break the rules right? 

So I make my way up the tree, almost falling out of the fucking thing cause the broads cans got my eyes stuck on them like bees on honey. Anyways, I make my way up and settle right next to the fruit, I got to he really sneaky about this, so I whisper.

"Hey, Broad with the nice cans, psst!! "

She sees me, and comes closer to the hanging fruit. 

"Hey, you, eat this fucking apple." I says. 

She pauses and she's all like. 

"No, I can't, God told me not to eat anything from this tree."

So I'm like fuck. How the hell am I going to get this broad to bend. And obviously not forward but in a way she stick this fucking apple in her beautiful fucking mouth. So I thought of somethings. I'm all like. 

"Don't worry about it, he's not fucking here. Why the fuck would that giant bearded man just leave this beautiful tree next to a beautiful gal like yourself."

Now she's all blushing and shit, smiling and playing with her hair. I know I can get her to eat this fucking apple. But then here comes the other humanoid. He's come up like. 

"Hey, we're not supposed to eat that fruit eve, you shouldn't listen to that snake."

And I'm all like. 

"Why don't you and that tiny dick back the fuck up and go fuck yourself. This conversation is between me and this pretty little angel here, not you and your nosey face."

And he's all like. 

"Okay, I'm sorry.. "

So then I wrap myself around the apple and I lets it drop right? The broad catches it her hand and now she's got this big beautiful fucking smile on her face. I look at homie who looks like he's going to cry and then I look back and the broad is just about to take a big fucking bite. Oh she's going to enjoy the fuck out of it and then Bam! Guess who shows the fuck up? God! He starts huffing and puffing telling them there be consequences for their actions, some bullshit like that, then he turns his attention towards me and blah blah nagging bullshit. Then out of fucking nowhere I hear that fucking grasshopper yell. 

"Ha! I told yous you couldn't get them to eat that fruit! I told yous!" </TEXT>
