On the sci-fi side, Brian K Vaughan's Private Eye and We Stand on Guard might satisfy. </TEXT>

I like meats (pretty much the regular stuff minus fish), fruits, **bread**, raw vegetables, etc. Pretty much the regular stuff, excluding seafood. I can't really afford to be picky anyway haha.

I think we have the usual appliances if that's what you mean. My roommate used to really like baking so I'm guessing the staples are there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Moved out a few months ago, and I've been living primarily on cereal, top ramen, Carnation Breakfast Essentials, and peanut butter sandwiches.

I can tell it's definitely starting to affect me.

I've never really shopped for groceries before, and I don't know a lot about nutrition.

My budget is fairly flexible but $50-100 is what I'm looking at realistically. There is a WinCo and Grocery Outlet near me so I can stretch that a bit. I have started working out again and I don't know if that changes what I'll be buying much but I figured it's probably good to know. Also I don't have much time for cooking anything very complex, not that I could if I did have the time.

I know this probably sounds like a tall order but I don't have a ton of options. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First one I had was Deadpool: Circle Chase because my grandma got it for me when I was really young.

First I bought myself was some random shitty Iron Man comic, where Tony just goes on a walk with his girlfriend.

The first I bought in earnest, and actually cared about, was the Watchmen TPB. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He could have at least acted like he cared about giving the movie a review rather than his opinion.

For example, I love Hot Rod. I know it isn't a "good movie", but I like it regardless. If I was going to review it, I wouldn't say its a great piece of cinema, I would acknowledge it for what it is. That's the point of a review. No one cares about some asshole on TV's opinion, they wanted to know what the movie is like. </TEXT>
