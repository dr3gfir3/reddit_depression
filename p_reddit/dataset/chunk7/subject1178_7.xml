	<TITLE> Desperately in need of a flat by Xmas </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! 
I'm a 20 something guy desperately looking for a place by Christmas. A flat I had lined up fell through for various reasons so i'm crashing with my parents at the moment. This is,to put it bluntly, doing my nut in. So i'm looking for a place ASAP. I work full time in a high end cocktail bar in the city centre (my dream job) and have a love for cooking, books, films (especially Humphrey Bogart) and loads of other stuff. I enjoy hanging out with people but i am really not looking for a party flat of any kind, I've done that bit now and need somewhere a bit more chill. My budget all in is around 450 including bills and council tax etc. If anyone knows of a room going or is looking themselves - hit me up!

Cheers  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> as some of you may know I'm being a jammy git and I'm currently in week 2 of 3 weeks holiday in Italy and the states. The only downside to this is that I opted to wear my kilt to fly in as I'm going to a Halloween party in it and it's a bit too heavy to put in my case... All went well until BA left my bag in Heathrow so now I'm stuck for 2 days in North Carolina with n o clothes other than the aforementioned kilt... Sodding yanks won't stop mentioning it either. </TEXT>

I'm flying all the way from Scotland and I'm looking for things to do - in particular I'm looking to take her for a nice meal at some point. When she lived back in Edinburgh we used to get all dressed up in our finery and go for really good food every now and then, so I'm looking for something like that if that makes sense. Thanks folks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah exactly - food that feels like they're selling you what they think Brits think of Italian food... Everything's just a bit naff - no one really wants to be serenaded with dinner/drinks/boat trips... Why are they alway's singing?!? And badly I might add. Urgh Bruxism is rough at the best of times. My teeth are a horrible mess at the back from that a while ago. Big doggy licks are both a blessing and a curse. Which fun stuff you thinking of doing? The LDR is good actually, at least, easier than I thought it would be. It's only for a year, 2 months in already, although it does feel like a lot longer. I'm just glad we have a few moments where we can see each other  - spaced apart by about 2 months, longest gap being 4. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last Tuesday. My capacity 64 bar was sitting on about 200 at 1am. It's the middle of the Edinburgh Festival so we have a 3am license because of it. To drum up some midweek trade we gave discount cards to all the bar staff in a 2 mile radius for 2 vodka mixers (all my absolut flavours) and 2.50 pints of Budweiser. It was quiet so I sent the new guy home around midnight - I was not expecting a rush at all. By 3am we had taken 1800 pound entirely from the discount cards. I plowed through 3 kegs of Budweiser and an unholy amount of vodka. Ran out of tequila, Jagermeister and sweat by the end of the night. Worst part? 5 total in tips AND THEY WERE ALL BARTENDERS!!! Bastards. </TEXT>
