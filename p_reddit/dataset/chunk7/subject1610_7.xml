	<TEXT> There's an interesting book on the subject: [The Great Beanie Baby Bubble](http://www.amazon.com/The-Great-Beanie-Baby-Bubble/dp/1591846021).

In summary: Beanie Babies were introduced at the Chicago Toy Fair but were largely ignored, aside from a few toy collectors. But then a fabric shortage for one of the original Beanie Babies meant it couldn't be produced anymore -- and, rather than simply discontinue that Beanie, the Ty company said "You know what, we're going to **retire** this Beanie." This introduced the idea of scarcity, which ignited interest. 

(Side note: Disney has been doing the same thing recently by saying "You'd better buy the Blu-Ray for *The Little Mermaid*, because soon it'll be locked away in the Disney Vault").

So now Beanie Babies had a ticking clock: you gotta buy them fast before they retire and disappear. A bunch of moms in the Chicago area started collecting Beanie Babies and saw that there was no price guide -- so they made one. These moms literally pulled dollar figures out of thin air and assigned each Beanie (current and retired) an utterly arbitrary price, and it stuck. Whatever they decided, that was the price -- because no one was saying otherwise. The moms compiled these figures into an (unofficial, but de facto official) price book, which spread amongst collectors.

Now we have a ticking clock and a price guide, but the craze still isn't taking off: Beanie Babies are appealing to collectors -- but not kids. So the Ty company adds two elements to the Beanie Babies' tags: a birthday, and a poem. Now the Beanies have **personality**. They have birthdays that kids can celebrate. And the public goes crazy. The Beanie Baby mania is unleashed. 

At the same time, a brand new technology is introduced, and the Ty company pounces on it: the Internet. Ty made themselves a website (one of the first toy companies to do so), and now kids could connect with the Beanie world even further. Kids could even "chat" with Beanie Babies on the Ty website. But as the internet evolved, the Ty website did not. It still exists today, and it looks like it's straight out of the 90s: http://www.ty.com

Another brand new website sprang up around the same time: eBay. With eBay, Beanie Baby collectors now had a way to buy and sell the toys across the state, across the country, across the world. An entire market was born almost overnight. Beanie Babies would not have been perceived as easy money, without Ebay paving the way.

But then, the downfall. Ty Warner -- the inventor of Beanie Babies, head of the Ty company, and kind of a crazy person -- **completely** over-saturated the market. New Beanie Babies were released rapid-fire and retired just as quickly. And suddenly, scarcity wasn't so much an issue anymore and the craze died down. 

The final nail in the coffin came at the turn of the millennium. Ty Warner announced that, at the stroke of midnight, *all* Beanie Babies would be retired. Ty thought this would reignite the frantic obsession -- but the public saw right through it, and identified it as a marketing gimmick. The mass retiring was a failure, and the Beanie Baby craze was officially dead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Script reader here. Here's my explanation from a previous post. In my experience, script coverage is generally this: 

- Up top, note the script title, author, page count. And draft date, if the script has it. 

- LOGLINE: A concise one-sentence summary of the premise. For example, "*A New York cop must save his estranged wife from terrorists who have taken an L.A. office building hostage on Christmas Eve*."

- SYNOPSIS: A page-long summary of the story, covering the major beats from start to finish.

- COMMENTS: A page-long collection of your thoughts: what about the script worked, what didn't, and what could improve. In very simple terms, it's this: A) How inventive/original/dramatic is the premise? B) How strong is the execution of that premise? and C) How thorough are the characters? Is the story dramatic? Is it engaging? Is it original? Would you recommend it to your boss? 

- VERDICT: Verdict is one of three options: PASS (meaning it sucks), CONSIDER (meaning it's not great, but not bad), and RECOMMEND (meaning it's good). 

RECOMMENDs should be used sparingly -- only if the script's really fantastic.

CONSIDER is the one you really have to justify with your arguments, because it's kind of a weaselly answer. 

Some companies also use CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS, which is self-explanatory. You like some things about the script, but you also have reservations. 

PASS is pretty much the default. You'll be writing a lot of PASSes. 

Out of 300 scripts I'd covered, 203 received a PASS, 89 received a CONSIDER, and only 8 received a RECOMMEND.

A lot of studios/production companies will give you a coverage template to use, and you basically just fill in the blanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's referred to as "special shoot": the trailer/teaser contains footage that was shot specifically for the trailer, and does not appear in the movie. It's also fairly rare (since it's an entirely separate production), and it was rare even in the 70s. 

But the truly "teasing" teasers and the special shoot teasers haven't disappeared. They've kept on coming, ever since *Alien*:

- and especially [Star Wars: The Force Awakens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMOVFvcNfvE), which only has eleven shots total.

Special shoot teasers from the past two years:

- [Zootopia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9lmhBYB11U)
