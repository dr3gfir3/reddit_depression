That winter, my brother and I were bored (my brother was in 5th grade) on a Sunday so we went to mantinee showing of Dr. Zhivago with an intermission. I just remember being mesmerized by the movie, especially the scene in the rural cottage and the freezing cold weather.

I've only watched the movie twice, but I loved that first showing. Just something about it. </TEXT>

"The only two reasons to watch this movie are on Phoebe Cates chest. This is better than the movie it copies "Blue Lagoon", but that is saying very little. The best way to watch this movie is to have your finger on fast forward. There is a lot of wasted time that will put you to sleep. Unless you are specifically interested in seeing the the reasons previously mentioned, don't bother with this mess." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted this before:
Back in the late 80's, I was in the Ohio Army National Guard. We were having our Annual Training up at Camp Grayling, Michigan and were involved in a long, time based vehicle movement. At the time, we drove M-113 Armored Personnel Carriers and I was a driver of one of them. We had been driving for close to 15 hours (with food and piss/stretching breaks) with no sleep when I turned my head to the left and saw an Indian in full regalia and headdress riding a horse next to our column. In retrospect, what's I find so amusing about this is that I was so tired, I didn't freak out but just smiled as though it was the most natural thing in the world.
He rode next to me for about 1 minute and then rode off into the woods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was once a Pallbearer at a funeral in Wisconsin during the winter and it was cold as shit with alot of snow and ice on the ground. As we were carrying the coffin down the stairs, one of the pallbearers slipped and fell down which caused all of us to lose our grip and the coffin fell onto the icy sidewalk.
The thing is, it didn't just sit there on the ground but it started sliding down the front walk (the church was on a hill, in the middle of the town) and it went out the front gate. Now we are all chasing this coffin down the street and hill but the damn thing just kept picking up speed and momentum and we couldn't catch up to it.
At the bottom of the hill there was a drugstore and this coffin slid up the handicapped ramp and through the front door and slid right down the front aisle to the Pharmacy counter where it hit with some force. When it did that, the coffin lid popped open and the body flew forward against the counter, much to the dismay of the pharmacist and his employees.
Then the cadaver looked at the pharmacist and asked "Excuse me sir, do you have something to stop this coffin?". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a sophomore in high school, I rode my bike home for lunch during football two-a-days. As I was leaving my house, I witnessed a small Japanese car (this was early 80's) run into the front of a RTA bus. I was the second person there. The guy was all smooshed up in the front seat with his knees in his chest and was breathing fast and shallow. I reached in to comfort him and as I did, he exhaled loudly and his head turned to face me. He looked me in the eyes and died. I can still remember thinking I could see the life leave his eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, thank you. FYI, it is actually written in the paperwork that I am paying 0 in child support as long as I pay the mortgage and private school tuition. That will continue until the house is sold or I can't afford private school tuition. Then it will be revisited.
But thank you for your advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, child support is 0 as I'm paying the mortgage and private school tuition. Those payments are in lieu of child support. When the house sells, child support will be revisited. That is in the decree. And I'm not paying alimony now because I really wouldn't be able to afford it with me having to pay tuition and she knows that. Plus, she's getting part of my retirement. BUT, what I am  worried about is 13 years from now her suddenly swooping down from the sky and telling me she wants all the back alimony payments. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Virginia]  I have a pretty straightforward question regarding my
Divorce decree and paperwork. 
I just went back and read the original paperwork for the divorce, which was the property settlement agreement. In it it states that in lieu of child support, I'm paying the mortgage and private school tuition (which I am).

She is not asking for any alimony. She will receive a portion of my
Military retirement along with 50% of my retirement accounts. But my big question is a portion that is written under the title "Spousal Support". In that paragraph, it states "but shall be entitled to a reservation of spousal support for a period equal to the length of the marriage (which was 13 years). 

Does this mean that if she wants, she could retroactively come back and claim child support from me to equal that of 13 years of alimony?

Thanks for any help.  </TEXT>
