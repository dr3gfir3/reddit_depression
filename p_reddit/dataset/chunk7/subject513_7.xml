	<TEXT> I understand why the charge is in the game I just have a couple suggestions on how to make it less frustrating for those of us that die to it.

I believe that there are two things that need changing. First, the Bayonet charge should have a "wind up" time. If somone bayonet charges from 2m away they shouldn't get the kill, they have no momentum behind their charge. The way the charge is currently set up allows players to "panic charge" in super close quarters and kill you instantly in pretty unavoidable fashion.

Second, I'd like for the death animation during the Bayonet charge to start later. It seems like I'm locked into an unavoidable death animation while the charger is still 9m from me.

Anyone else have suggestions?  </TEXT>
