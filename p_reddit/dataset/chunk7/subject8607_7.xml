	<TEXT> Who or what is that "disrespectful" towards? Dick Cheney?

One of the first things the new Iraqi regime did was privatize the oil fields which had been nationalized under Saddam and open them up to foreign investment. Saying "we went in for the oil" does not mean "we" the American people went in to get lower gas prices. It was about private ownership of oil reserves which had until the war and regime change been inaccessible. 

 Oil remains fundamentally a government business. While many regions of the world offer great oil opportunities, the Middle East with two-thirds of the worlds oil and the lowest cost, is still where the prize ultimately lies, even though companies are anxious for greater access there, progress continues to be slow.

Dick Cheney, 1999

 Link to Syrian Obersavatory for Human rights statements about casualties please.

 Cause according to my Google search it's state run media and Syrian officials who are putting out that information: https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrian-media-say-u-s-attack-caused-damage-to-air-base-multiple-casualties-1491535071

 Looking into your post history you even posted an artlcle on this sub that states that the information came from the Syrian army here: http://www.france24.com/en/20170407-usa-strikes-syria-base-with-cruise-missiles-trump-gas-attack

 So why the are stating to me that it came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights when you know in fact that it didn't?


You know if you had *any* sincerity about gathering information at all you would've asked a simple question to my comment but instead you decided to launch an investigative tirade and order me to produce evidence for you. That's fine, just don't expect me to respect you for it.

And don't lecture me on defensive when you put *seven* obnoxious question marks in your last comment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm more concerned about what happens when the US opens up an entire new front for the terrorist cause in Syria by bombing the country's last remnants of government. ISIS has already used the US missile strike as an opportunity to stage an assault on Syrian bases, and the people's loyalties are already divided. Trump is playing with volatile fire, and I doubt the people who say this is all controlled.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (also known as SOHR; Arabic:    ), founded in May 2006, is a UK-based information office that has been documenting human rights abuses in Syria; it has focused since 2011 on the Syrian Civil War. It is frequently quoted by major Western news media, such as Voice of America, Reuters, BBC, CNN and National Public Radio, since the beginning of the uprising about daily numbers of deaths from all sides in the conflict and civilians killed in airstrikes in Syria. SOHR has been described as being "pro-opposition" and anti-Assad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blaming Hamas goes hand in hand with exonerating the IDF's civilian kills. It's completely explicit. From the IDF, regarding the bombing of UN shelters in 2014:

 Hamas chooses where these battles are conducted and, despite Israels best efforts to prevent civilian casualties, **Hamas is ultimately responsible for the tragic loss of civilian life**. Specifically in the case of UN facilities, it is important to note the repeated abuse of UN facilities by Hamas, namely with at least three cases of munitions storage within such facilities.

Therefore, you can't blame IDF if we bomb UN schools and hospitals from an altitude of 5,000 feet - Hamas made us do it! </TEXT>

 Hundreds of Roman Catholics who live next to British army installations on Northern Irelands border believe they are being used as human shields to deter IRA attacks.

According to the agreement between the players' union and the league, players get two-thirds of the money made by selling jerseys. The other third goes to the union, some of which is pooled for all NFL players.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's anti-capitalist, drawn by Robert Minor in the July 1916 issue of *The Masses*. *The Masses* was a short-lived revolutionary socialist magazine published in the U.S. from 1911 until 1917, when it was shut down along with hundreds of other left wing publications under the 1917 Espionage Act, for opposing WWI. 

The attitude of all the left at the time was that WWI was an inter-imperialist war and a total waste of human life -- "when the rich wage war, it's the poor who die." Considering WWI was started by three quarreling royal cousins, they were pretty right.

 *Strike against war, for without you no battles can be fought. Strike against manufacturing shrapnel and gas bombs and all other tools of murder. Strike against preparedness that means death and misery to millions of human beings. Be not dumb, obedient slaves in an army of destruction. Be heroes in an army of construction.*

Helen Keller, notorious socialist </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A week after Colin Kaepernick took a knee in protest during the national anthem, his jersey became the [NFL's top seller](http://www.forbes.com/sites/darrenheitner/2016/09/07/colin-kaepernick-tops-jersey-sales-in-nfl/) heading into the regular season. All it takes is one middle finger to Trump and any athlete can double their sales and become a national hero overnight.  </TEXT>
