	<TEXT> AFAIK, the point of Wireless@SG isn't specifically to cater to tourists or foreigners, it's just a nice bonus for them. They can easily get everything setup at the airport. 

And I don't agree with what you said about HK. Over the past few years, I've spent upwards of 2 months and above in HK every year and there are absolutely no free Wifi hotspots other than at Starbucks. All the others are run by telcos and require payment. There's a free tourist trial but I used it once 4 years ago and it hasn't reset until now. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-13 07:58:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I tried overclocking the 4790K in the past and it would just crash all the time. Even applying stock voltage (~1.28V) at stock clocks was unstable. The only solution was to leave everything at Auto. 

A week ago, I was looking through all the CPU options and discovered that 'Enhanced Turbo' in the MSI UEFI settings was on Auto. I disabled it and now I've been running a 4.6GHz overclock at 1.261V without much problems! 

IntelBurnTest (10 runs) is done in 124 seconds (~122 GFlops), although temps can hit 95C. But that's just because my Noctua CPU fans max out at 1100rpm. Other than that, in everyday use, it doesn't exceed 75C, which I think is okay with a 31C room temperature.  </TEXT>

The CPU cooler's a Corsair H110 with 2 Noctua NF A14 PWM fans (with Low-Noise adaptor). Perhaps 1050rpm at max is insufficient? Or is this because of the casing, which is a Fractal Design Define R5 that's trapping a lot of heat due to the soundproofing? My room temperature is around 31C. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-29 10:26:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My current Logitech keyboard has served me well for the past 3 years but the keys are suddenly starting to jam up. Tried cleaning them but it doesn't seem to help.

I'm looking for a new keyboard that's extra quiet. I don't really like keys with long travel either. Basically, I like laptop keyboards. Is there something like that, but full-sized with a numpad? I don't need special function keys. 

The HP Wireless Elite Keyboard v2 looks about right. Any ideas whether that's any good or do you guys have other suggestions?

Edit: Thanks for all the suggestions. I honestly dislike the feeling of mechanical keyboards, so I don't think I'll consider those at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have never used iMessage other than to receive online verification codes in my 6 years of owning iPhones. It's always unreliable, sending SMSes more often than not when the other party has an iPhone. Most people use WhatsApp instead, even if they have iPhones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This issue happened when I was using Windows 8.1 too, so I don't think it's got anything to do with software. Strangely, sometimes it doesn't shut down and restart. Sometimes it goes into sleep or hibernate mode randomly when I'm gaming. Since the problems only happen when gaming, I'm more inclined to think it has got something to do with the power supply? I'm not sure though. </TEXT>

**Describe your problem. List any error messages and symptoms. Be descriptive.**

My system is sometimes restarting on its own during gaming. I thought this was a CPU overclock problem, so I disabled it. My GPUs run a mild overclock, but I think this isn't the problem since the drivers usually crash, but not the entire system right? Is this a sign of a PSU problem?

**List anything you've done in attempt to diagnose or fix the problem.**

Disabled CPU overclock, updated the BIOS, updated GPU drivers, ran MemTest.

	<TEXT> Not saying this is right or wrong, but I think for most people the 'invasion' of privacy has not negatively affected us. In fact, like in the MRT example, it's used to enhanced security. So perhaps we think the benefits outweigh the costs in most cases.

Honestly, for me, the only consequences from the invasion is that I may be indicted for internet-related and traffic-related crimes. </TEXT>

And the BYD, even if available for sale, is quite a terrible car in general. The interior's full of cheap hard plastics and the electric motor makes more noise than my car's diesel engine, which is quite an amazing feat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the stock app is accessible from the lock screen. And shooting in RAW means having to fiddle with the Brightness/Contrast/Shadows and Highlights. Basically what I'm complaining about is that the stock camera app (basically an Auto mode) has too much noise reduction. In other areas it's fantastic.  </TEXT>
