	<TEXT> So I live in Texas, and I am currently working on obtaining my pharmacy tech license. My trainee license will expire at August 31. I have signed up to take my ptcb exam on September 7 which is the soonest opened schedule date. My question is if there is anyway to extend my trainee license? I know in Texas there is a renewal for a trainee license,  but from what I understand is that you can only obtain that when it is expired... Will I get terminated from my job if it does expire? Also I know I shouldn't have waited last minute to sign of up the exam but I was 17 when I signed of the trainee license and was going through depression/suicide attempt atm,  and didn't step a foot into the pharmacy until 5 months ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seemed to notice that s health was inaccurate on my S4,S6,  and note 5 compared to my fitbit surge and a treadmill reading at my local gym. I noticed that it would say I walked more steps and would run faster miles. I think the reasoning behind this is because your phone is usually in your pocket and can make the tracker on s health not as accurate as fitbit watches which are in your wrist  </TEXT>
