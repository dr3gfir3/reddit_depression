	<TEXT> An iPhone or iPad would work perfectly. You can set one up stationary and use an app to remotely control its camera controls and shutter. Some apps even allow you to have the photos directly sent to a computer as you take them, allowing you to leave the camera still without having to move it to do anything. 

Edit: Here is a link to the one I've used with much success.

Edit 2: Here is another similar app, however I have no experience with it personally but it seems like it would do the trick.

	<TEXT> I have actually. I plan to open a shop on Etsy and sell various gaming related items, dice trays, dice towers, card holders, and more higher end, larger items like hardwood gaming tables, as those seem to be quite popular. I'm currently in the process of making a few more test pieces and drawing up some designs for more products! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I own this piano and I must say, for the price point, it is one of the best value/performance that you can get right now. The tone leaves a little to be desired, however, running a USB to my MacBook, I can use a better sounding piano for recording and live play. 


As far as the weighted keys, they seem a little heavy to me, it takes a few minutes to go between my digital and an acoustic piano, but again, for the price, I can't really complain. I would definitely recommend it if you're on a budget.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking over the pre-gen characters for the Starter Set and I'm noticing their initiative modifiers of -1, 0, 2, etc. I can't seem to find how those numbers are determined. I've searched through the basic rules to no avail. Does anyone have any insight into this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm relatively new to DnD, 5th Edition is the first I've played of it. I know how previous editions used miniatures and grids extensively to aid in battle tactics and distance/speed control. I read through the basic rules as well as the starter set rule book, however I can't see how you are supposed to be able to do it without using minis and a grid. Can anyone expand on this for me? Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it true that under Marshall Law, authorities are legally allowed to weld shut your fallout shelter doors? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-17 00:56:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was watching a documentary on fallout shelters, and in the discussion someone had posted this:

"Know this, if and when Marshal law is in effect, the decision has been made not to try to evacuate those whom are in bunkers, the reason is the safety of the officials and the public as the occupants are heavily armed, and equipped, so as in such an event, the order will be made, if no answer is to come from the located bunker in short time given warnings over radio, or international Morse code .. order is to . weld them shut."

Is this a true statement? And if so, I how could that possibly be legal?

edit: Martial law. Brain fart. </TEXT>
