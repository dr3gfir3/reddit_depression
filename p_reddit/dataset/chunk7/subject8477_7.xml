	<TEXT> I find it kind of funny that the medication I need to take to feel better, stops me from doing something else that also makes me feel better.  However, without the medication, I would probably have never hooked up with her. I'm not even mad about it though....because of the medication. Truly a scenario that when looked at from the outside, is kind of funny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You would be correct in you assumption. The only problem in following your advice is that while we are attentive to each other in regards to foreplay, we're more into the kind of rough sex that can't really be achieved without penetration. </TEXT>
