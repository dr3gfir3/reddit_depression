	<TEXT> I drive an '03 Legacy with a manual transmission (which is basically the same as an '03 outback). I get about 23mpg city and 30ish highway. Most new Subaru models will offer about the same (or better) gas mileage since they have the same engine as I have (2.5L naturally aspirated engine). My normal mileage (about 50/50 city   highway) is 24-26 mpg so it's not too bad, but not the absolute best either. 

In the snow however, it's fantastic. I like to drive a bit fast so the AWD is awesome, it's very controllable in slick conditions like gravel or snow. You want to drift? Great. Just hit the gas, spin the tires a bit, then bump the steering straight when you want to stop sliding. Don't want to slip at all? Just point the steering wheel where you want to go and that's where you'll go. 

From 2004? to 2012 the Legacy models had a turbo factory installed, but in 2013 they discontinued this feature and therefore dropped the horsepower but increased the gas mileage. The Outbacks have changed as well. The newer models have become more boxier and SUV-like than older hatchback-style models which is a bit disappointing to me, but many people like the increased cargo space the Outbacks offer. 

The WRX and STI models are fast as all getout, but they're looking to revamp the model in 2015, so if you're looking for a hot hatchback then I might wait until the new model comes out so you can decide if you want the old style or the new style. They're fast, and therefore give up a bit of gas mileage, but damn they're fun to drive. 

The Forester and their other bigger models are alright, but they keep the same 2.5 liter engine every other model has, so they tend to be slower than the rest, although you get more cargo space. The newer models that run the 2.0 L engine (like the Impreza, Crosstrek, etc.) are generally underpowered (in my opinion) and I wouldn't advise buying one. I tend to slow down on the steep mountain hills with my 2.5L displacement engine, so I can't imagine what a half liter loss would do to its performance. 

Finally, I love that Subaru offers manual transmissions in most of their lineup. If you can't drive manual or prefer not dealing with the hassle of a clutch pedal that's fine, but the control you get with AWD and a manual transmission is unparalleled. You can easily slow down, speed up, and control yourself in the worst of conditions with a manual. 

I'm also currently looking for a new car, and the two I've settled on (based on by budget) are the Outback and the WRX (both manual transmission). I like the WRX in that it's fast as shit for such a cheap car (4.7 sec 0-60mph), and I like that I can sleep in the back of the Outback in addition to hauling a bunch of gear, and it can tow up to 3,000 lbs with a towing package installed. 

The choice is up to you, but based on my experiences I'd definitely recommend the Legacy, Outback, and Impreza WRX and STI models. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Arborwear pants and shirts are fairly nice, but I wouldn't call any piece of clothing BIFL. All clothes wear out, it's just a matter of when. From my experiences when you're doing heavy work especially around sharp pieces, pointy rocks, etc. Arborwear tends to wear out pretty fast. If you're doing easier things like painting or garden work or welding they're great, but for hard work like trailbuilding they tend to go by relatively quick. 

I prefer Carhartt pants and jackets for their resistance to wear, but I *love* Arborwear design. Their pockets and little knife/tool sleeve in the pants and shorts is just great. So if you're working relatively light and need something a bit sturdier than jeans, get Arborwear. If you're doing hard work all the time in abrasive conditions, get Carhartt. I haven't tried the [Firehose](http://www.duluthtrading.com/store/mens/duluth-ingenuity/fire-hose-workwear/mens-fire-hose-pants/mens-fire-hose-pants.aspx) pant by Duluth Trading Co yet, but I've heard good things about it as well.

	<TEXT> I was in an unfamiliar shop working on my car, and needed to quickly find a tool. I walk up to their tool cabinets and [something akin to this](http://bangshift.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/shop1.jpg) is what I found. 

Good lord holy jesus, I was just looking for a 3/8" drive ratchet and it took me nearly 20 minutes to sift through all the crap. And a 9/16" socket to use with the ratchet? Forget about it. No organization at all, and the fact that I was on a deadline made it that much worse. I had debated bringing my nicely organized toolbox to this shop just in case, but I decided not to. After the fifth time picking up a 7/16" socket with hope in my eyes I nearly just threw my tools on the ground and left. 

Organize your damn tools people! Even if it's a community shop there is no reason why things shouldn't be labeled and preferably [shadowboxed](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cf/5S_Tools_drawer.jpg). It's not OK to just have drawers and drawers of randomly assorted tools, nuts, washers, picks, and O rings. 

**TL;DR [Shadowboxing](http://www.cribmaster.com/images/AccuDrawer_Drawer_4.jpg), labeling, and 5S 4 lyf!** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just remember, you NEVER want to buy footwear based on looks alone. Yeah, you'll look all cool and fancy stomping through puddles and kicking logs, but if they don't fit you'll have blisters within hours. On a several day backpacking trip, this will mean unending misery for you and frustration from your hiking buddies. I've admittedly got a kind of weird looking pair of boots, but DAMN they feel good. I can hike for 20 miles with a full pack and my feet will still be just fine at the end of the day. 

Go try them on, and not just Vasque shoes either. Spend quite a bit of time with a shoe salesman who knows his stuff. Ask questions. Make sure you really feel them out when you try them on (don't just put them on, walk 2 feet, then buy them). Vasques tend to run a bit more wide than other shoes, so if you've got skinny little feet like me you'll be hating life very quickly. 

That said, Vasque shoes are very well made. No shoe or boot is BIFL, but these will hold up better than many.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so most snowboarders can't ride moguls. It certainly takes a bunch of practice, but it can be done. You just have to have the will to practice something uncomfortable and not regress to doing something easy like riding the park. I almost exclusively ride with advanced-level skiers, so warming up on a mogul run then moving over to double black chutes is a normal day for me. 

The first thing you have to realize is that your front foot is your pivot, and your rear foot is your "rudder' so to speak. Weight your front foot more than the back foot and swing your rear foot around your front. Practice this on flat ground, it might feel a bit funny, but you want to do 90% of your turning with your back foot. It's your control foot. 

To really nail this down, I spent alot of time in thick trees where not being able to turn quickly meant you crashed hard into a tree. It really gives you motivation to learn proper quick turning techniques. Start slow, incredibly slow, and make sure you brake before hitting any trees. Learn to control your speed. Go quicker and quicker through the trees until you don't crash (as much).

Next, you need to learn to read lines through moguls. Believe it or not, each mogul run isn't comprised of uniform bumps. Some of them are cut out into nice turns (which you should ride), and some are horribly undercut (which you shouldn't ride). If you get onto a bad line, you end up riding down lefthand turns when you should be turning right, and vice versa. This situation isn't fun.

To start out, traverse the slope 4-5 moguls at a time and look for a nice sweeping turn cut into the mogul, not a steep dropoff at the front face of the mogul in front of you. Practice practice practice. Find the easiest route down and practice your font-leg pivot. 

Once you get good at this, narrow your turns down to 2-3 moguls each. Make sure you only take lines with nice, sweeping turns. Practice finding good lines through the mogul fields. 

After 1 or 2 seasons of practice, pin it to win it. Slam down the slopes in a single line and ride it all the way down to the bottom. Spot your lines. They constantly change, so look to see where the path of least resistance is. It takes effort, it takes skill, but by the end of all your practice you'll be leaving mediocre skiers in your dust. 

At the age of 10 years old I was just starting to get the hang of moguls on skis, but then I switched to snowboarding. It took about 6 years total to be able to ride moguls well, and now after 13 years of riding, I can honestly say that on most days I'm the best snowboarder on the mountain with regards to moguls and big mountain riding. 

The key is practice. 99% of the time I ride with skiers, so moguls are a big part of the day. Being forced to ride them day in and day out really helped me gain an appreciation to the work and skill that goes into riding moguls, and it gave me an incentive to ride them well. Most snowboarders ride with other boarders, and are content to just trying to spin and grind off of jumps in the terrain park all day. Being able to spin a 720 off a jump is neat and all, but it takes considerable effort to be able to ride real terrain like moguls and steep mogul-and-ice-ridden chutes, and the payoffs are tremendous. Ramming down the steepest slope on the mountain while skiers watch you with awe is one of the best feelings ever.

	<TEXT> Most resorts leave the moguls there to make the terrain more interesting. Who likes boring flat groomers all day long? Plus the low-angle mogul runs are great for beginners just starting on moguls. When you get to 35+ degree slopes then you're in the not-possible-to-groom territory and the moguls are 100% natural and unable to be altered. These slopes are for more aggressive skiers and boarders, and probably aren't a good fit for a new learner.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few friends and I were playing around with fireworks one night. They were the kind that explode, then a whole bunch of crackling explosions go off afterward. Well fireworks on the ground are cool and all, but throwing them in the air is awesome. After a handful of these, someone got the great idea that standing directly underneath the exploding fireworks would look super awesome. So I volunteered to be the thrower. I lobbed fireworks high over their heads so they could explode. Well inevitably one of the fuses was a little longer than the other fuses and the firework exploded right around head height in the middle of the group. 

After that we decided to stick to the relatively safe sport of bottle rocket wars.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad has told me that on numerous occasions he and his friends would play "scissorball" in college. Everybody in the room would find suitable cover, the batter would grab a big couch cushion, and the pitcher would lob a pair of scissors towards the batter and seek cover as quickly as possible. The batter would hit the scissors with the couch cushion and run towards a base before the scissors could be found. He said that on several occasions the scissors would stick into the wall and they would have to find a poster or something to cover it up. 

Don't get me wrong, I've done a few crazy sounding things in my life, but nothing as blatantly dangerous as scissorball.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've thought this one through a bit, mainly on a local level, but expansion is always a good long-term goal.

First, I'd make every wireless network unlocked and able to be accessed by anyone, as well as removing any data caps. Free wifi is great, right? Second, I'd rename every wireless network to either "It's a goat, see?" or "It's Goatse" and ensure that every 5 minutes they switch names.

When labeled "It's a goat, see?" the very cutest baby goat you've ever seen would be displayed prominently as the background of your browser.

And then... 5 minutes later the network would change names and instead of staring deep into the soulful depths of a cute baby goat, you would be drawn into the dark, swirling abyss of Goatse's anus. The only respite from the storm would be a quizzical glance towards his ring finger </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had my camelbak M.U.L.E. for close to 7 years, and it's still holding strong. I bike quite a bit and was doing mountain bike guiding for 2 summers. The design has changed over the years, but it's still a great pack for going on longer rides or where it might rain. Holds up to 3L of water, rain gear, maps, tubes, 1st aid, etc. and can also cinch down real thin when not very full. 

I almost always ride with it and would definitely recommend a pack similar.

	<TEXT> My friend and I built a bike frame out of bamboo and carbon fiber and had to cobble together a frame jig ourselves. I've done some TIG welding and once I finish a few more projects I'd like to weld a frame together for myself.

How much did your Anvil frame jig set you back, and how much effort was it to make your own jig (pictured a few times in old photos)? What was the price difference between the two?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the thing. I really like the adjustable ones because you can fiddle with it throughout the day to make it fit better depending on how you're feeling or if you need to throw a hat under there on really cold days. Also when you're in the store you might overlook something small that barely registers as something annoying. But throughout the day that small annoying thing grows until you're miserable with your helmet by the end of the day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Here we go:**

* They're really comfy if you get a good fitting one (don't just buy a snazzy one off the internet, actually walk into a store and try them on). 

* They keep your head warm (or cool if you open up the vents on top).

* If you ride backcountry or trees like I do, they're great for deflecting branches. Not the big ones, but the ones that make you think "dangit, that one kind of hurt". 

* If you're into the whole gopro thing, you can mount a gopro on your helmet. 

* You can get ones with integrated music playing, or get aftermarket earpads that have music players in them.

* They hold your goggles in place (another thing you should be wearing every time. Eye sunburns and eye damage is additive). 

* [It's](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23117389) been [proven](http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/news/media/releases/helmets_save_lives_of_skiers_and_snowboarders) many [many](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440468) times [that](http://www.cpsc.gov/PageFiles/108689/skihelm.pdf) helmets [save](http://www.nsaa.org/media/68045/NSAA-Facts-About-Skiing-Snowboarding-Safety-10-1-12.pdf) lives. Just because you don't expect to fall doesn't mean you won't fall. 

Now I can't force you to wear one, but for the safety aspect alone they are worth their weight in gold. Get a good helmet that fits well and you'll never go back. 90% of my helmet usage is in the trees where little branches just bounce off my head without a care. And for big mountain or backcountry riding it's fairly essential, you don't want to knock your head on a rock submerged just a bit beneath the snow. I know with 100% certainty that my life has been saved by a helmet before.

I personally love the [Smith Variant](http://www.backcountry.com/smith-2007-variant-brim-snow-helmet?CMP_SKU=SMI0835 MER=0406 skid=SMI0835-MATGRA-M CMP_ID=PLA_GOc001 mv_pc=r101 mr:trackingCode=F749F9AC-0F6C-E011-9898-0019B9C043EB mr:referralID=NA mr:adType=pla mr:ad=44515981905 mr:keyword= mr:match= mr:filter=62930445465 mkwid=sIJYNEigO_dc|pcrid|44515981905 origin=pla gclid=CLK6i837iroCFcFAMgodAVcA1w) helmet as it's adjustable and has a great venting system. Super comfy, and I hardly notice it's there. But like I said before, don't just hop on the internet and buy the first shiny helmet you see, try them on and get a good one that fits or else you'll end up just throwing it away like your last one. 

**TL;DR** Try on a bunch of helmets, buy one that fits well and is comfy. Spend a little extra to get a nice one. 

**Buy a fucking helmet.** </TEXT>
