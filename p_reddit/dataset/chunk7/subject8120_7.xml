Defense has more swagger so far ( not been trashed on yet) mariota hasn't thrown pick but also has not been perfect sailing some balls only a matter of time until first int comes. Going to be a rough year running the ball it looks like. Sankey pulling ahead as lead back through 6 days of training camp. WR corps are huge. Now if only they can catch the ball. Green-Beckham looks like a beast but probably won't contribute much for at least until last half of season.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

I was having a hard time getting the X1 controller to recognize in a windows 10 VM

Error message i would get would say there was not a Xbox controller connected on trying to stream even though the controller was showing in device manager...

the fix is to go into the VM settings and change the usb controller operation from USB 3.0 to 2.0

ex. [imgur](http://i.imgur.com/72Gchbr.png)

took me forever to figure this out so thought id share

After initial waivers cleared this week Percy Harvin and Jonathan Stewart were dropped..

Which one should have higher waiver priority for me? I'm sure i'll get sniped out of one of them since i'm pretty low on the waiver chain but you never know..

Rest of Roster:

* QB: Nick Foles/Tom Brady
* RB: Matt Forte/LeSean McCoy/Brandon Oliver/CJ Spiller/James White
* WR: Dez/Kelvin/Justin Hunter/Gordon
* TE: Cameron

Note: Planning on dropping James White after NE game if I don't see any usage from him. </TEXT>
