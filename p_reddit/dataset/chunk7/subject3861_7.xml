	<TEXT> Damn, that sucks. Just the idea that these AP credits are really necessary to get into good schools when not everyone can afford them is disgusting. Someone's profiting off the backs of students in what should be a totally free education experience.

	<TEXT> It's genuinely frustrating. The "just work harder" response to poverty is just not in touch with reality, and often come from people who have never worked hard and merely exploit the wealth they were born with. Most of the people who can't get health care do work, or are trying to but can't find a job. It's not just lazy people who wind up desperate for basic necessities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess it's Macron to win next round. As long as the polls are within 20% accuracy, France will be fine. I would have preferred Hamon, but Macron is the best candidate left in. You know, because getting rid of the Euro and leaving the EU would reck the economy. And banning North African immigrants, cutting total immigration by over 90%, and banning face veils is just paranoid nonsense. And don't even get me started on that foreign policy. </TEXT>
