	<TEXT> Link to letter from Menendez to Mnuchin: https://www.menendez.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Mnuchin-PdVSA-Rosneft-Letter-FINAL.pdf

 Menendez formally asked Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to proactively monitor a loan that Rosneft, an oil company majority-owned by the Russian government, has provided to Citgo Petroleum Corp.s parent company.

 Petrleos de Venezuela, Venezuelas state-owned oil company, used 49.9 percent of Citgos shares as collateral for a loan.  
 
 If Venezuelas economic crisis continues and the company defaults, Menendez said Rosneft may take control of the shares, which would combine with the Russian companys other interests in the company to give it majority control.

 This could leave Rosneft, a Russian company controlled by oligarchs with close ties to [Russian President] Vladimir Putin, in control of critical energy infrastructure in the United States, Menendez told Mnuchin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow Jake Novak's deductive reasoning is incredibly strong.  He'd fit right in at the Trump WH:

 What a difference 24 hours and 59 Tomahawk missiles can make.

 Yesterday if you mentioned the words "Russia and Trump," you were probably having a conversation about the enduring allegations that the Russians somehow colluded with the Trump campaign and that they somehow tipped the 2016 election.

 But now those words are likely a part of a conversation about how President Donald Trump broke with Russia in his decision to respond to the alleged Syrian nerve gas assault on its own people with Thursday night's missile strike.

 ....

 Again don't be fooled, President Trump's opponents are still angry as ever and many of them will use this missile attack to form a new series of political attacks against him. But now they have to start over and their range of attack has been significantly narrowed. In fact, in light of President Trump's clear challenge to the Russians, a good case can be made to end the House Intelligence Committee's hearings and ranking member Adam Schiff's crusade to uncover some kind of Trump-Russian grand conspiracy. Something else will catch the Democrats' anti-Trump fancy to be sure, but it will have to be something else.

His argument is, essentially, that you'll see more than just articles about his ties to Russia when you search for the keywords 'Trump' and 'Russia' now and that means Democrats are a bunch of losers and the House IC should cancel their investigation. </TEXT>

 U.S. President Donald Trump suggested on Twitter that the runway itself had not been the target of the missile strikes.
 
 "The reason you don't generally hit runways is that they are easy and inexpensive to quickly fix (fill in and top)!", he said.
 
 A senior military source in the alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad said the airbase had been mostly evacuated thanks to a warning from Russia, which has deployed its military to Syria in support of Assad.

 The senior military source, a non-Syrian, said only a few out-of-service jets were destroyed.

	<TEXT>  Justice Department attorneys are asking the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to delay oral arguments scheduled for later this month in a lawsuit challenging the Obama rule, while the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reviews the regulation and its position on it.

 Under the Obama administration, attorneys were defending the pollution rule against a coalition of business groups and conservative states, led by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  
  
 The regulation lowered the allowable concentration of ozone to 70 parts per billion, from the previous 75. Ozone is a byproduct of pollutants from burning fossil fuels and a component in smog. It is linked to respiratory ailments like asthma attacks.

Reduction from 75 to 70 parts per billion apparently is Pruitt's definition of an 'activist agenda'.  Unlike this 'coalition of business groups and conservative states' led by the totally sane U.S. Chamber of Commerce, of course.   </TEXT>

 The National Security Council has presented President Trump with options to respond to North Korea's nuclear program  including putting American nukes in South Korea or killing dictator Kim Jong-un, multiple top-ranking intelligence and military officials told NBC News.

 Both scenarios are part of an accelerated review of North Korea policy prepared in advance of President Donald Trump's meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week.

This is for legislation, to be clear.  They're not looking to undo the vote from yesterday which would be laughably transparent.

 A bipartisan group of 61 senators sent a letter to Senate leaders Friday urging them to maintain the 60-vote threshold for filibusters involving legislation, which they said is needed to ensure bipartisanship remains a component of passing bills through the chamber.

 The signatures of 28 Republicans, 32 Democrats and one independent is evidence that a broad mix of senators will back the filibuster for legislation.

And just to compare to yesterday's vote:

 #####Vote to keep the 60 vote threshold  
To block the nuclear option, 51 votes needed

  | Yay | Nay
---|---|----|----
Republicans | 0 | 52
Democrats | 48 | 0
Total | 48 | 52

	<TEXT> OK, so for the record, McConnell "expects" Trump is legally justifying this through the AUMF:

 It was perfectly executed and for the right purpose, McConnell told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt Friday morning.  
 
 I support totally what the president did  a precision strike to make it clear to Assad that the use of chemical weapons is unacceptable behavior, McConnell said. This step, of course, will be widely applauded by all of our allies, particularly our Sunni Arab allies in the Middle East who really wondered whether America could be depended upon again after eight years of Barack Obama.  
  
 I think that this is not a situation that requires an AUMF, an authorization for the use of military force, he told Hewitt. We passed one in back in 2001 and 2002, I believe, and the previous president thought that it authorized what we were doing in that part of the world and I expect this president thinks the same.

edit: Hugh Hewitt, who conducted the interview this article is drawing from, of course did not ask the question I would have liked him to ask: does the 2002-2003 AUMF actually cover use of military force against the government of another sovereign nation (and UN member-state)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a plausible explanation of why, from [Paul Wood's BBC article on 3/30](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-39435786):

 Members of the Obama administration believe, based on analysis they saw from the intelligence community, that the information exchange claimed by Steele continued into the election.
 
 "This is a three-headed operation," said one former official, setting out the case, based on the intelligence: Firstly, hackers steal damaging emails from senior Democrats. Secondly, the stories based on this hacked information appear on Twitter and Facebook, posted by thousands of automated "bots", then on Russia's English-language outlets, RT and Sputnik, then right-wing US "news" sites such as Infowars and Breitbart, then Fox and the mainstream media. Thirdly, Russia downloads the online voter rolls.

 The voter rolls are said to fit into this because of "microtargeting". Using email, Facebook and Twitter, political advertising can be tailored very precisely: individual messaging for individual voters.

 "You are stealing the stuff and pushing it back into the US body politic," said the former official, "you know where to target that stuff when you're pushing it back."

 This would take co-operation with the Trump campaign, it is claimed.
 
 "If you need to ensure that white women in Pennsylvania don't vote or independents get pissed in Michigan so they stay home: that's voter suppression. You can figure what your target demographics and locations are from the voter rolls. Then you can use that to target your bot."

 This is the "big picture" some accuse the FBI of failing to see.
 
 It is, so far, all allegation - and not just the parts concerning Donald Trump and his people. </TEXT>

 In the briefings, the C.I.A. said there was intelligence indicating not only that the Russians were trying to get Mr. Trump elected but that they had gained computer access to multiple state and local election boards in the United States since 2014, officials said.
 
 Although the breached systems were not involved in actual vote-tallying operations, Obama administration officials proposed that the eight senior lawmakers write a letter to state election officials warning them of the possible threat posed by Russian hacking, officials said.  
   
 But Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican majority leader, resisted, questioning the underpinnings of the intelligence, according to officials with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. McConnell ultimately agreed to a softer version of the letter, which did not mention the Russians but warned of unnamed malefactors who might seek to disrupt the elections through online intrusion. The letter, dated Sept. 28, was signed by Mr. McConnell, Mr. Reid, Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the ranking Democrat.

EDIT: Per NYT's edit, comma added between 'resisted' and 'questioning'.  Thanks to /u/thomascj85 for pointing this out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> VP is indeed the Prssident of the Senate but when they are not presiding over the session (which nowadays is most of the time) the Senate must choose someone as the President "pro tempore".  

Some more information on it: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_pro_tempore_of_the_United_States_Senate

Edit: another important part, from the Wiki page:

  In practice, neither the vice president nor the president pro tempore usually presides; instead, the duty of presiding officer is rotated among junior senators of the majority party to give them experience in parliamentary procedure.[4] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reid changed the rules for executive nominees in 2013 after 79 votes of cloture in a row were required to be taken by Democrats to get nominees past Republican filibusters.  So Reid changed it to allow 51 votes only, and that's the precedent McConnell is referring to.  Unfortunately for him, as the Senate President has stated, that only applied to executive nominees, not SCOTUS nominees, so it's not really a precedent.

 ...  
  
 The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to the learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power, Nunes said in a statement.  

 I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims.

	<TEXT> [Nunes Statement](http://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=775)

 Several leftwing activist groups have filed accusations against me with the Office of Congressional Ethics. The charges are entirely false and politically motivated, and are being leveled just as the American people are beginning to learn the truth about the improper unmasking of the identities of U.S. citizens and other abuses of power. Despite the baselessness of the charges, I believe it is in the best interests of the House Intelligence Committee and the Congress for me to have Representative Mike Conaway, with assistance from Representatives Trey Gowdy and Tom Rooney, temporarily take charge of the Committees Russia investigation while the House Ethics Committee looks into this matter. I will continue to fulfill all my other responsibilities as Committee Chairman, and I am requesting to speak to the Ethics Committee at the earliest possible opportunity in order to expedite the dismissal of these false claims.

	<TEXT> It wasn't a lie because it wasn't intentional.  If that was false, it's false.  I have no problem admitting that.  What then has Susan Rice herself confirmed?  Nothing?

Just as a heads up so you don't think I'm evading you, I won't be able to respond for about 45-60 minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry man, relax, I guess I'm a bit confused on what you're arguing.  If she didn't claim she unmasked the names in relation to the investigation, then besides the lying, what is the problem?  I'm still trying to figure out what's being debated.  Can you tell me what Susan Rice did wrong other than lie in an interview?  Or is that it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  None of what you just said proves how you know for a fact the intelligence she requested to see had anything to do with Russia. You're operating purely on assumption.

What does that have to do with anything?  The NSA can request redacted names be unmasked in intelligence reports.  What does it matter if it has to do with Russia?

 She did not say at all that the intelligence she requested the unmasking of had anything to do with Russia, only "foreign officials".

Again, what does that matter?

 Huh? Not one publication I have seen reported they confirmed she did something illegal. Bloomberg and Fox are the only two major publications reporting on this at length and none of them have said that. That's provably wrong.

I'm talking about Trump's base and the fringe media outlets, not the mainstream publications.

 Oh Jesus man. Now apply that reasoning to how this sub reacts to Trump or anyone in their team lying. Every single time it's used as evidence of wrong doing. Every single fucking time.

"Every single time".  And how many times has that been exactly?  How many coincidences can you feasibly dismiss away?  Whereas for Trump's bogus claim, so far all we know is the NSA supposedly requested names be unmasked which again is legal.  And there's zero evidence she did anything improper except perhaps lie in an interview, or as Michael Flynn puts it, "gave incorrect information".

 How can you not personally realize the hypocrisy of this statement when you yourself just used Trump saying "I having nothing to do with Russia, no person that I deal with does", to deflect from this story?

Hypocrisy of WHAT statement?  That I don't immediately jump to the conclusion that Susan Rice illegally spied on the Trump campaign and then illegally leaked it to the public?

Once again, the FBI has been running a counterintelligence investigation into Trump's ties with Russia since last July.  The investigation is ongoing, which means whether or not there was collusion is the subject of an active investigation.  Are you truly suggesting to me that no information of this would EVER be fed to the NSC?

	<TEXT> That may be a valid question but this is a flatly false statement:

 If there had been a real need to reveal the identities  an intelligence need based on American interests  the unmasking would have been done by the investigating agencies.

Because the NSA is legally allowed to unmask names, Susan Rice most likely unmasked many Americans names during her time as NSA.  The fact the provision for the NSA to even do so means that statement cannot be true.

Same here:

 If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests.

Again, because it's legal for her to do so, it's safe to assume she used that power many times.  So how can you possibly conclude this time for Trump it was politically motivated?  I completely understand how you may suspect that, but I do not understand how you conclude it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that's just flatly false.  


From the [Eli Lake article](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-03/top-obama-adviser-sought-names-of-trump-associates-in-intel) which broke the story to the mainstream:
 The standard for senior officials to learn the names of U.S. persons incidentally collected is that it must have some foreign intelligence value, a standard that can apply to almost anything. This suggests Rice's unmasking requests were likely within the law.

It would be better for me to quote you the relevant law, but I'll take his word for it: NSA is able to unmask names in reports they receive.  I'm not arguing it's good, I'm arguing it's legal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How could you possibly no that? Up until yesterday, her story was she knew absolutely nothing about any intelligence collection on the Trump campaign.

I know that the FBI has been running a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign's ties with foreign officials from Russia since last summer because that's what Comey stated, and I know that the FBI shares information with the NSC.  I don't know for a fact that she was reading reports coming from the IC, but since she confirmed she requested names unmasked in relation to the investigation, I figured it was safe to assume she was.

 Because the 4th amendment in this country has been shit on and lit on fire the past 16 years so it's "legal" to do whatever the fuck you want.

I'm not going to argue with you on that.  The sentiment rings true.

 I also never said it was illegal, only that Susan Rice is a liar, which I just proved.

Fair enough, but that's not the angle the current scandal is running with because most are implying or directly stating this is evidence of some wrongdoing.  The lying in an interview could be a wrongdoing, sure, and it raises a very slim possibility that it is indicative of something sinister underneath, but it's certainly not on the surface. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should relax.  I'm acutely aware of whataboutism, but seeing as how she was investigating the very substance of that Trump claim, it's not really whataboutism.  It's certainly not a 'completely different issue'.  I'm just trying to figure out what I should be defending her from because it's not illegal for the NSA to request masked names to be unmasked.  

To be clear, I don't feel the need to defend any alleged instance of her lying about not unmasking the names.  Until there's some sort of evidence that she leaked the names, I'm not sure what you're searching for in those alleged lies.  Can you enlighten me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The FBI and NSC are separate yes but the FBI shares information with the NSC.  It's the hub of information and decision-making for the executive branch in national security matters.  The NSC most likely received reports from the FBI and DNI with blacked-out American names, and then subsequently the NSA asked for the names to be unmasked, which is legal.  

I'll withhold final judgement but until I get some new knowledge on the matter, that's where I'm heavily leaning. 
 Maybe I'm missing something but I just barely even see the angle for a scandal here and I'm frankly surprised GOP senators have jumped on it with the fervor they have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true that they gathered intel that involved him, but it's also true the FBI has had an ongoing counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign since last summer.  The FBI claims the names were unmasked in the process of this investigation, not "to disrupt the future president".  

Do you not think it is acceptable or fair that the FBI had picked up Trump and his campaign's communications with Russian operatives in the process of surveying those Russian operatives?  Or do you not think it is acceptable that the names were unmasked to members of the NSC?

Just trying to get a feeling on where you are drawing the line, because the leaking of the unmasked names is an entirely different thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you know who they were targetting?  The only evidence out right now, from both crooked Nunes and from the SIC and FBI, is that the Trump campaign was incidentally caught up in legal surveillance.  If you speak to a Russian ambassador, expect your call to be tapped.  If the call has national security implications, it's perfectly legal for them to "unmask" the American's name on the other end.  When you're under investigation by the FBI's counterintelligence teams, the unmasking of your name in communications with foreign agents is legal, routine, and expected.

Unless you have proof they collected his communications directly, not incidentally, and that Susan Rice personally leaked the information to the media, you are being willfully misled. 

I know you don't want to believe Trump can do anything bad, but that shouldn't shape your understanding of reality. </TEXT>
