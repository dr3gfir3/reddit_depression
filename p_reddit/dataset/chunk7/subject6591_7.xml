	<TEXT> Ace, thanks! Can't wait for 6.1 to come out, too scared to launch the RC version after reading through the bugs people are getting in the support forum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you launch photostation  settings  photo, there's an option at the top called Re-index media. That'll do the trick (though it may take a while). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on 10.12 (from a fresh install not an upgrade), and I'm able to ssh into my box. Sounds silly, but have you tried disabling the ssh service, then re-enabling it? Can you ssh into other servers (maybe it's blocked by the firewall)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good point! I read "Encrypt pre-existing shared folders", and assumed it would also work with default shared folders such as "photo", but you may need to use the workaround I described above if they allow only user-created shared folders to become encrypted.

Yep, cloudsync will further encrypt the data based on another password you select, I've spent the past few weeks configuring the hell out of my new NAS, so I'll make a video on it very soon if you don't manage to figure it out yourself by then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the new version of DS 6.1, one of the features is being able to encrypt the photos folder. So maybe it's best to wait for that (RC is available now, full version should be available in the next 2 months).

For 6.0, my work around is.
* uninstall photo station
* delete default photo shared folder
* create a new encrypted photo shared folder
* install photo station

This way photo station will use the encrypted version of the photo shated folder.

To sync the folder to Dropbox, you can use Cloud Sync.
Just point it to the photo shared folder and specify encryption. </TEXT>
