With exposition Waller sets up Suicide Squad so they can send bad guys to go after 'Superman if he rips the roof off the White House and tries to kill the President'. That's right if Superman ever goes full evil she thinks the best way to stop him is a girl in clown make-up, a guy who ties knots real good, a guy's with a skin condition, a drunk Australian and a guy who shoots good, which would be mostly useless against a bullet proof guy.

The team should have been Enchantress, the fire guy and situations vacant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The biggest flaw with telling people to 'vote with their wallet' is that not everyone has the same amounts of votes. For some people the inflated prices don't really hurt them much so they buy them without second thought. Maybe they intended to buy a reseller ticket because it was easier than waking up at a specific time and logging on to try and get tickets.

Other excuse are valid too. If you only go to a festival every five years maybe you can justify the expense. There is no excuse for ticket prices to be hire than flights and tickets to a festival in Europe.

Wait until TD's can't get tickets to a Springsteen or U2 gig or some other bnd that they like to be seen at to seem hip and we will suddenly see the government take action. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So we need alcohol to have a conversation?

For some people. There is a reason people go to the bar to meet people. I know plenty of people who can talk to friends easy, but completely clam up when around new people. After 2 or 3 their anxiety is down and they can talk to others. There is a reason why drinking is a social activity.

And you are right, I do have a desire to drink. Maybe I drink too much, but that's not what we are discussing. 2 or 3 drinks is what you have when you meet up with people for a quiet one. That's the same as two people sharing a bottle of wine. It might take an hour and a half or two. The current definition of binging includes these people. It might be enough to get them drunk and way too much for them to drive but it is a risk most people find acceptable. The benefit outweighs the risk.

The current definition of binging takes into account the exact moment drinking becomes unhealthy, not excessive. That would be like calling drinking a 500ml bottle of Coke binge eating. It goes above your rda of sugar and Coke is rarely healthy, but a person having a coke is different than a person who sits in front of their couch with crisps and coke and chocolate.

One person is taking a calculated risk because even though they know the Coke is bad for them, the enjoyment is probably an acceptable risk. The person on their couch is showing problem eating behaviour. The same way catching up for friends with 3 pints is different to downing a shoulder of vodka straight.

One is a mature calculated risk, the other is extreme.

Also I'm glad that you have faith in the government health warning which are made up from a group of alcohol companies, whatever health consultant they can find and government officials all either working towards a conclusion they already decided before looking at facts dependant on the interest of the three parties. Health experts can often be kicked from these panels if they don't fit the narrative.

Remember how recently fruit went from 4 a day to 5? That was because grocery companies decided sugary drinks counted as a portion. The US food pyramid is just pulled out of lobbiests arse. David Nutt was fired from a UK government body as a health advisor when he said that taking certain drugs could be considered as dangerous as boxing or horse back riding.

If government want people to take health warnings from the government seriously, they need to implement warnings in a serious fashion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you know that medical professionals are also the most likely to be substance abusers?

The 4 unit limit was decided by a government body. In truth, any amount of alcohol is probably too much because technically it is a posion. You probably should drink any. Also so is chocolate and McDonalds. You probably should never put those in your body either.

But there is a trade off. For most, drinking is social. For some it helps them overcome shyness. Telling people binge drinking is just 2 pints, is like the DARE movement of the US. It is a ridiculous standard and does nothing for public health except get people to ignore the public health warnings.

There is a real issue of people drinking too much and too fast. Telling people that people who drink 3 pints and people who drink 8 pints, 2 shots and a mixer are both binge drinkers, is stupid and does nothing to public discussion. 3 pints is what you have when you go for 'one'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my honest opinion, very few games need to be over 15 hours. Haven't played BotW yet, but AAA games are shooting themselves in the foot all trying to be Open World. The best Batman AA game was by far the first one. It had a tight story and gameplay. There was about an hour or two of post game bonus stuff to 100% as well.

In Arkham City I feel like I spend most of my time just gliding around the city, the side quests set up some stories that were written out in the DLC. It's a good game but it's just not as fun. Yes it will keep my interest longer and maybe there is more meta game to play, but it is not as fun. It really is the race of quantity in time over quality in experience.

I'd rather play 10 hours that is great 95% of the way through than 40 hours where it is 60% good. So I would rather 9 and a half hours fun from a game over 24 hours good, because with that 24 hours good, I still have to play 16 hours of side quests that could be more engaging or just travelling from one mission to the next. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but they're some of the smartest people on the planet! they could have gotten that drill to work without Bruce's help.

That's giving them undue praise. NASA is full of smart people and geniuses but geniuses aren't all actually like Tony Stark who can learn a topic overnight and become an expert. They make mistakes.

Either way, in the scenario presented they didn't have much time. They were working off a stolen design of Bruno's drill, which he said they built wrong, so they were already behind on a very time sensitive project. 

So instead of waiting around any longer hoping they could out-genius the construction and usage of a drill, they called in the designer. The designer called in his team, who also had their own geniuses (Bruce Willis designed this high tech drill that NASA wanted so we can safely say he was quite the engineer + Steve Buschmi's character was suppose to have a crazy high IQ) and roughnecks. Then they work with NASA. It's relatively plausible, especially compared to some other scenarios in the movie. 

Remember that great SciFi movie that got nominated for Oscars and everyone loved a couple of years ago? Gravity. Bullock didn't work for NASA, she was installing a component she designed. It is the exact same scenario.  </TEXT>

Have you a source for this? Maybe not the conservative Cato think tank. Even so correlation does not mean correlation. Also I'm not even sure what 'relaxing' you are referring to, to be honest. I don't recall hearing about any radical change in policy in recent years.

The increase could be down to people being surveyed being more honest because they know there will be less chance of it being used against them, it could be a general societal shift in attitudes unrelated to the legislation. I know people's attitude towards weed has change significantly. My parents would see it the same as doing heroin.

Or the relaxing could be coming from the other end. There was a general increase in drug use, the current policy was too expensive to maintain or police so it was relaxed. In other words it was reactionary, not the cause. All  </TEXT>

Maybe Bay told him to shut up because he had only read the scenes he was in. Watch it again. The only person in NASA wanting to send the drill team up was Billy Bob Thornton. Everyone else was happy with sending only the astronauts to drill.

But NASA stole Bruce Willis's drill design and couldn't get it to work to the required tolerance levels. Willis insisted on using his own team.

There are a lot of stupid things that happen in that awesome movie. Sending drillers into space wasn't one of them. </TEXT>

At the time, parents were more likely to shrug it off and think, at their age I was working, it is time they could find their own way. Or worse, they would report it to the police and the police would shrug and never put much effort into runaway cases. After Manson there was a huge anti-cult hysteria and if your kid ran away parents would be afraid that their kids were brainwashed or would wind up being part of another Manson murder.

	<TEXT> I think after the Manson murders, people kinda decided teenagers weren't really ready to be adults. The hippie movement was a trend and trends keep moving, so to say something 'ended it' is like saying something ended leather jackets or quiffs. But after hearing about how young some members of the family were, I think parents became a bit more weary of letting their 14/15 year old daughters hitchhike across the country and putting it down to them 'being practically of age' now and lead to the idea of the kids being shown the front door as soon as they were old enough.

I could be wrong, but that is how I've read the Manson connection to the end of the Hippie era. It was the start of basement dwelling bachelors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of programming doesn't require you to be 'good at maths'. Computers are the best at maths, so you don't need to be good. We literally invented programming for this very reason.

You could show someone the formula for calculating a quadratic equation and they might have trouble working it out, even with a calculator. You can also teach that person how to break down a formula and plug the data into a program. You can teach them to refactor code. You can teach them logic operators. No maths required.

Maybe someone working with vectors through 3D space might need more knowledge of maths, and sometimes maths can be used to make cool shortcuts in programming but you can program something to do complex equations without knowing diddly about those equations.

But neither are really a fix. They work in a specific story for that specific reason. The same can be said of the Assassin's Creed games where the story tells us we are in a simulation that is an approximation of genetic memories. The stories facilitated this model, but nothing has been fixed. We don't know if this was a design choice and it is not a fix or band aid we can plaster onto the next open world game. If there is a big threat, we will still need some suspension of belief as to why we are doing all this busy work that could be delegated instead of facing the threat straight on. </TEXT>

As for other feminist worthy of praise, I personally think that is a false start. Progression isn't a competition about who puts the most work in or suffers the most for the cause. If we required everyone to get shot in the face like Malala be a feminist, we would have a pretty high bar and progression would be stagnant. Malala herself said she was inspired by reading Harry Potter and about Emma Watson, so women in entertainment are important for inspiring people, even if there are bad asses out there like Davis. They are just people using the tool set available to them.

	<TEXT> I'd be the first to say Hannibal us a better stand up in my opinion. I just see a lot of people criticize Schumer for talking about her vagina, even though male comedians make dick jokes all the time. Like, is there some reason Amy shouldn't make jokes about vaginas or people she's had sex with? Even though I have never seen a male comic in recent years criticized for making similar jokes about their body and sex? 

Not liking Amy is fine but saying she's not funny because she makes vagina jokes just comes across as sexist. </TEXT>

The special wasn't her best work, but it's also obvious that a very vocal group of people put energy into hating Schumer, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are one star reviews out of spite. That said, it still wasn't great so the low score isn't surprising. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A good workaround would be a tiered system.

A quick test that means you can drive unaccompanied, but with a plate. Then a full test which means you can drive without a plate and drive professionally, plus reduced insurance, etc.

Then re-test people every 5 - 8 years. If they fail, they go back to the quick test level. Professional drivers like taxi drivers etc., have six weeks - three months to retest or they risk losing their license to drive professionally. It is stupid that my car needs to be tested every year or two for road worthiness but the driver, only once ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there is a case to be made that if someone watching over your shoulder and you mess up that badly, you probably shouldn't be driving. There are enough bad drivers with licenses, we don't need to be putting more out there.

Consider that 9 faults is a fail. He failed catastrophically. I took my first test way before I was ready, because I needed to take a test to renew my provisional license (I pass the theory and then just never bothered doing the learning to drive part for about a decade). I took the test knowing I would fail (and I did) but I didn't '37 faults' fail, despite being very nervous and knowing I would fail.

If he does truly believe he is 'backlisted' he could go to another testing center. Also I think there is a big hole in our system if you can drive for 50 years without a license. </TEXT>

That's not just failing, that's failing badly. Get this menace off the road. Maybe he had no accidents, but by making 37 mistakes in the 45 minute test, I'm sure other drivers suddenly become more alert when they see him on the road.

As for the'blacklisting', I have never met anyone who failed the test who wasn't sure they failed because of quotas or the instructor being a dick or having it out for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really more about having a macabre story, in a grim setting and trying to survive a town suffering from a plague as everyone's resources diminish. The original game is notoriously difficult because they went for quite a realistic approach. Also because the translation wasn't great.

It's an experience, but it is unforgiving. I think there are spoiler free guides now available to help you experience the story.

It deserves its cult status, but at the same time it is quite experimental and was a difficult to play game even in its day. Dated controls have been less than kind. If you have the patience, it is worth playing. [Here is one of the definitive articles](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/04/10/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body/) on the Pathologic experience.

In short to answer your questions, no to the 5 Nights at Freddy-esque jump scares, yes to the dialogue choices, but telling you that doesn't tell you much about the game. </TEXT>
