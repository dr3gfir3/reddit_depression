	<TEXT> Look, don't take this the wrong way (and I'll eat the downvotes) but games like Fallout and Diablo  have been dumbed down for the Console Tards - if you're a PC and console gamer you are not one. Developers reduce the complexity to appeal to a wider audience who they think don't want to bother with the details. 

I guess I am the opposite of a Console Tard - a PC Curmudgeon. I have 3 kids in the house and we have an Xbox One, two Xbox 360's, A Wii U, and two Wii's and I've only played the Wii. I'll be the guy playing Solitaire and Mine Sweeper when they finally stop making games for the PC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a matter of perspective. The focus in this subreddit is networking and not IT management. I am an IT manager, but we are a small department, so I also do a ton of  networking (which is one of my passions), but my ultimate focus is delivering services to my users at the least cost to my organization. Moving services to the cloud makes sense to me, but we have 8 locations and over 3500 users - there will always be work to do on the network, desktop support, and help desk.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been in IT 22 years, currently an IT manager, but started as a bench tech back in 1994. I agree with some of the posts here that Brother has an agenda. With that said Network World is not a real networking magazine - it is free and funded by advertisers. Do not use it as a source of information with understanding that it's articles will always favor some vendor. 
IT is changing and more is going to the Cloud. You careers in networking are going to center around large companies and managed service providers (MSPs). Brother is not completely wrong in their assessment (despite  the fact that they are selling themselves as the solution).
I will eventually move as many servers and services out to the cloud as I can. If you told me 3 years ago that would be my strategy, I would have laughed. 
It doesn't mean that IT is gone, just changing.   </TEXT>
