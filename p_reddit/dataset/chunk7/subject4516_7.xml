The search resulted in a bunch of forums on vaginal health and cures for thrush and bacterial vaginosis. My issue with your original comment was not so much the dairy product reference but that you were describing something that would be abnormal as normal. You've cleared it up now and I can see what you meant, so all good. All the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is great information, I very rarely get thrush, usually only if I have been unwell and taking penicillin which is rare. But the last time was earlier this year and the first pharmacy I went into on my way to work wasn't quite open yet and the retail assistant was horribly rude to me (probably because it's in a bad area and she thought I was a junkie...in my work suit no less, bitch) so I walked out and cried because I was so dang itchy and uncomfortable. I can't imagine how horrible it was to have multiple bouts! I've filed the info away in case I or any of my friends have similar issues. </TEXT>

Edit: just in case you forgot, cottage cheese looks a bit like the below. I have never spotted anything similar in my undies.

Edit #2: cottage cheese like discharge may = yeast infection. Now at times of the cycle when the natural vaginal lubrication is thicker adding friction can stir things up a teeny bit, but it should never look like cottage cheese, if it does, there's a problem.

Another thing that may be contributing to it is your pelvic floor strength if you are quite active, I find myself becoming aroused to the point of almost orgasm when I do any sort of core workout or if I'm absolutely busting for the bathroom. All these muscles are connected so it's not surprising that they jumble up their jobs sometimes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A woman's lubrication changes during her monthly cycle, before ovulation it can be creamier, whiter and thicker, sometimes gel like. Another poster mentioned cottage cheese, this is incorrect, that would indicate a yeast infection. During ovulation the lubrication becomes clearer and wetter. I'd say that your lady friend was very turned on and it was early in her cycle before ovulation. Some ladies might have a lot more wetness around the time that they cum, some might not. The lubrication isn't any indication of wether a woman has orgasmed as it would be with a man. If you want to know if she had cum, pay attention to her body, her reactions, even ask her. But if she does cum, I'm pretty sure you'll know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Feeling constantly aroused is fairly normal for any 17yo regardless of gender, the fact that you're feeling it more when you are anxious or worried is also normal. Anxiety can cause muscular contractions in the pelvic floor, some people experience this as cramps, stomach ache or diaoreah. Some experience it as butterflies in the stomach, a tickling in the genitals or feeling of arousal. If it troubles you excessively please seek advice from a medical professional. I really think you'll be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I my experience this is true, but it should have read that the threat of death is incredibly high in relationships with intimate partner violence and the violence is almost always ramped up if the woman attempts to leave. The threat of death to women and children increases when the relationship ends. Along with emotional abuse and financial abuse, threats to children, this is why so many women don't leave. The ultimate conclusion to a violent controlling relationship is death, services try incredibly hard to avoid this, but still, seeing as though one woman per week is killed by an intimate partner, you can maybe understand my exaggeration. It's quite terrifying and OP's friend needs to be very careful, particularly since this man has already viciously killed her dog. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my country, one woman per week dies as a result of intimate partner violence. I work in community services and social justice and have first hand experience in just how dangerous it is for a woman to leave a violent partner. Often the violence is stepped up when the woman attempts to leave which is why women return to the relationship, very often when she leaves for good this results in the death of the woman and quite often children also lose their lives.

	<TEXT> The first 24-48hours are weird. The first week is weird, the first year, the first decade. It gets easier to integrate as you go along. When I read stories like yours I realise that I never stopped grieving. But I see the stages of grief as a semi-circle, not a circle or a straight line, and me as a pendulum, the grieving process is not one you go through but one you absorb I think, and you may swing back an forth between the stages, many times, and that's normal. I'm so sorry, I don't know what to say. Honour her memory, make her proud, know she loved you. May her spirit ever rise to the magic of eternity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not as simple as that, I think it's quite the opposite, it's cheaper and easier to mass produce cute bras in smaller sizes, so there is a glut of them on the market. It tricks consumers into thinking the department store has a huge variety. It also feeds into the sexualisation of youth and younger girls that the sexiest bras are in the tiniest sizes.

Larger sizes (anything over a D cup) require a bit more technical know how and a lot more fabric. Add that to the fact that traditionally those big boobs are supposed to belong to lactating mums or older women who society decides shouldn't want to feel sexy anymore and that's how you get the matronly, no-frills plain black/white/beige bras in the big mama section in the department store. Add to that most of the bras in this section have large band sizes to go with your cup sizes, so if you have F cup boobs the company assumes you also must have a 16-24 size body, it's ridiculously hard to find bras with smaller band sizes and larger cup sizes. It's impossible to find a 12F-G cup.

There are "big and tall" or specialist size bra shops where they make the larger sizes and mastectomy bras in the pretty fabrics, I have to travel 2hours to get to my closest one. I can order online but really I need to try on in the store to get the right fit. Walking around in the wrong size bra is as bad as wearing the wrong size shoe. And, because this is a specialist store, the exclusivity of the product is reflected in the price. I can expect to pay between $60-$120 AU for a bra in my size from the specialist store, where in a department store I might be able to get 3 for $20 AU if I had smaller cups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is Taylor Swift were talking about here? Good for her. This got me thinking, and I might be really slow on the uptake here so bear with me, the media reports on Taylor Swift's love life with such shock and horror, the fact that she's had a bunch of relationships that didn't end up in marriage is an endless source of speculation, but really she's no different than almost every young woman I know. Is this what slut shaming is? I seriously could give a fuck who she hangs with, she's young, she's attractive, good on her. Tom's on a good wicket! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is he on any medications? Does he have any health problems such a depression, sleep apnoea, high or low blood pressure?
All of these can lead to a lowered libido, and there are many other factors besides. Stress isn't the only factor to consider. I'm only saying this because I recently made a discovery about my low libido partner and some medication he had been taking for 10 years and it's link to low libido. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, this happens to me. The vagina actually expands during arousal and this is a slightly uncomfortable but good sexy feeling, but then if intercourse doesn't happen it can be quite painful as the vaginal walls contract again. Apparently the pain gets more intense as a woman gets older-so please don't give a lady blue walls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a slippery slope argument. It's illegal to abuse a child, it is just as illegal to film the abuse of a child, it is still just as illegal to consume media that depicts the abuse of a child. In my country, and also in the UK. Beside the fact that the television studio that aired this and every viewer would be complicit in the act of child abuse. Your point was???

This has nothing to do with showing the dangers of radical beliefs and everything to do with using the abuse of a child to generate income for corrupt television employees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sweat! Omg the sweat, it's the middle of winter here now and I'm like all rugged up when I go to bed with big fluffy blankets and during the night I slowly strip because of the boob sweat. I used to wear a crop to bed but I've found that bra-less is the only way to combat the slippery cleavage. It's still bad but not as bad as when they're all pushed together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the heads up, when I go back in time I might give them a burl instead of my useless major. But in reality, my unique experience and critical thinking gives me an edge with outside-the-box solutions to the behaviours of concern I come across in the population I work with. Solutions that seem to elude the psych and behavioural science majors I work alongside.
