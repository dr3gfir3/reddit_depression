Bulls are violent when mating, and have a low success rate for fertilization.  Artificial insemination also allows for artificial selection and spreading genes to reduce inbreeding and promote stronger animals.

There's plenty wrong with the ag systems in the US, but this is hardly one of them.  Even the ranches that promote focus on proper animal treatment artificially inseminate. </TEXT>

"We will utterly destroy ISIS. We will carpet bomb them into oblivion. I dont know if sand can glow in the dark, but were going to find out. And we are going to make abundantly clear to any militant on the face of the planet, if you wage jihad against the United States of America and try to murder innocent Americans, you are signing your death warrant."

When it comes to a question of legalizing marijuana, I dont support legalizing marijuana."

Im a Christian first, American second, conservative third and Republican fourth...Ill tell ya, there are a whole lot of people in this country that feel exactly the same way.

"I will stop illegal immigration, build a wall that works, triple border security, and put in place the surveillance and biometric tracking to secure the border."

I would say these are very stark contrast to Johnson's positions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a group of armed citizens, who on tape explicitly said they would not go back to jail.  Run from the feds, then attempt to ram through a road block. Jump out of the car, and run away, in what many would say (I agree) looks like reaching for a weapon.

This is the same as a woman getting raped because of what she's wearing and where she is.   Actively breaking the law (whether or not you agree with it), carrying weapons, and implying you will die rather than go to jail, is the same as an innocent victim being raped by a perpetrator.  

Terrible, terrible victim blaming analogy.

I try with this sub sometimes, but half of the posts on here are indistinguishable from /r/conspiracy.  The "burn this down" is hilarious though, as I'm sure the release of this tape has even further alienated the group from the public </TEXT>

There are a few other people talking about a cash account.  I'm actually not sure what that entails, as I've only had margin accounts which is what a broker will typically set you up with.

Edit:  Sorry I've been a little confused as well as I don't trade equities which have a settlement period.

With that gone, any decent sized premium caused by geopolitical or other reasons will be filled by basis arbitrage, especially with how flush the world is with oil. 

Physical, locational basis pricing wise, it's complicated to say the least, much is priced against either futures contract, much is priced against another PRA benchmark. </TEXT>

Platts bought Kingsman Sugar, and is still probably the best for pricing and deals although they aren't a brokerage anymore so use the Platts' methodolgy for assessment.

TR Eikon has a tender tracking function that follows most of the national oil company transactions, and last I checked had pretty decent reporting for ME transactions, but it's been a while.

Any idea if smelters are profitable running at a smaller capacity, or intermittently? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you not see the almost always?

I'm asking a question, why the hostility?

 But don't you think that if they needed guns and couldn't get them legally, that they would get them through whatever means necessary? 

Honestly, I think for a lot of the mass shooting they wouldn't.  I can't imagine the Newtown kid being able to find a gun on the black market.  Sure, some of them would, especially the ones are planning it out.

The biggest issue with mass shootings that has come up over the years is that a lot of those shooters have some kind of mental health issues.

Isn't one of the big pushes for gun control to get mental health screening linked to the background checks?

How about instead of criticizing people about whether or not they own guns, and we all focus on getting funding for better mental health services across the nation?

Completely agree. I think many of the same people who are anti-gun control also very much want to cut public funding for mental health services.  I have yet to see how they would be replaced by the private market... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A big part of it is that an overwhelming majority of gun owners obtain their guns legally. Background checks are all well and good (as a gun owner, I don't mind this). But the people who are committing crimes with guns are almost always obtaining the guns through illegal channels.

I know that mass shootings make up a small portion of the total gun murders in the US,  [but what about these?](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/03/us/how-mass-shooters-got-their-guns.html) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This case took 5 years, a warrant, and an advanced hacking technique to nail these scumbags on, in my opinion, one of the most horrific crimes around (the making and supporting of kiddie porn), and highest of priority for the FBI.

I'd say it seems pretty secure for someone who just wants to not be watched online.  For me, Tor is just a pain in the ass.

The quotes in that article are pretty funny though.  How terrible would it be to be the lawyer defending a child porn peddler. </TEXT>

This includes federal funding for military bases, national parks and forests (WY MT), national labs (NM), among others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Farming is unprofitable *because of the government subsidies.* The market is sending a price signal to stop producing because your marginal costs and higher than your marginal revenue.

The price floor subsidies artificially inflate your marginal revenue so that it is above your marginal costs, sending the exact opposite signal, and producers increase production *further reducing marginal revenue.*

People talk about corn because it is not only top 3 crops by acreage, volume, dollar amount, subsidies, but also because the demand side is artificially created by the corn ethanol market, an "environmental" product with a terrible EROEI.  Sugarcane ethanol has 5x the EROEI, but quotas and tariffs are crazy for imported sugar.  

The government inefficiencies go deep in corn. </TEXT>

Burned?  But you are correct, I've seen nothing but stupid nonsense in your arguments.

Also for the record Creationism is a fraction of the population and it's their religious belief.

You've learned fractions, congratulations!  Per Pew Research, that specific fraction is upwards of 48/100.  I've yet to see an argument against evolution that isn't based in religion.  The point is when you use fairy tales as a basis for scientific opinion, why would that opinion be valid over researchers who base their opinion on the scientific method and decades of experimentation.

I know this actually takes some thinking, but /r/conservative is super welcoming to the kind of garbage you spout. </TEXT>

You should understand skepticism and nuance if you're in Libertarian. But maybe not if you prefer to be bathed in depravity and call it science.

Skepticism is fine.  Using your political biases to come to a decision, then rejecting scientific evidence and consensus because it disagrees with your political biases while endlessly searching for garbage blogs which agree is not libertarian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few comments from a disheartened leftist who has been coming here for a while.

 Wants to defund planned parenthood

Pandering.

 Against equal rights for gays to marry

I truly think he is for getting the government out of marriage.  Unfortunately in the Republican party, you have to pander to evangelicals to get anywhere.  That's the state of our terrible system.

 wants to cut corporate taxes

[Highly suggest this planet money podcast on what economists across the spectrum agree on.  "Three: Eliminate the corporate income tax. Completely. If companies reinvest the money into their businesses, that's good. Don't tax companies in an effort to tax rich people."](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/07/19/157047211/six-policies-economists-love-and-politicians-hate)

 supports funding charter schools

You are against charter schools?  

 doesn't support federal education standards

This is a tough one, but teaching to testing is not a strong educational policy.  Having lived extensively in China, this is exactly what they do, students work ungodly hours but learn nothing.

 wants to end the department of education

I really think we need some big shakeup in our education system.  We spend more money every year, and tests get worse every year.

 wants to repeal all regulations against pollution and fossil fuels
 wants to sell public lands for resource exploitation
 doesn't think EPA should be able to regulate greenhouse gas emissions
 supports mountain top removal mining
 pretty much has 0 support for anything environmental related unless it lowers taxes

Some of my big issues, and the question of pollution, climate change, etc. is brought up in this sub regularly.  This is a tough one for libertarians, and there are many opposing views on this.  I personally don't agree with him on any of these. </TEXT>

Not at all.  Many of the people who support Trump have even less knowledge of the internet than him.  Think of *A series of tubes* meme.

And watching Rubio defend bulk collection of metadata was just plain embarrassing. I think Paul was right on the money.

	<TEXT>  That is one solution. Businesses can also be legally bound by contracts to minimize their levels of pollution. They can also be taken to court since pollution is a form of aggression. Polluters can also be socially ostracized. All of these things are legitimate practices in a Libertarian society.

My issue with this is that libertarian solutions I typically see are reactionary rather than preventionary (word?).

Even if you can prove in court that someone polluted and get money from the entity (if they are still solvent), which is costly endeavor in itself, that doesn't prevent the action in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Colbert analogy was a poor one.

Getting a job after college requires a massive amount of work, no matter the degree.

For a STEM major, it requires a huge amount of work in class, and a decent amount outside - extracurricular, networking, etc.

For a FA major, it requires a small amount of work in class, and a *massive* amount outside.

I think FA draws people that don't want to do the work.  I wrote this in a comment below:
