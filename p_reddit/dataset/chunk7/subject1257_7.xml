	<TEXT> Oh yeah, I understand. I've just ovulated for the 2nd time, but I'm still in denial that things are all okay and that it might work, I just can't believe it'll work this time around.

Anyway, I'm so glad for you that your body kicked last cycle's ass and now you get another try soon :)

I'll be optimistic for you ok? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha!

Were your periods regular, or were they lighter than usual? I would think that a 30-day cycle would be ovulatory, but if you'd have had a super-long cycle followed by a really light period, then that might have indicated possible breakthrough bleeding vs. a "true" period </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

I'm in the awkward  stage in-between TFAB and stilltrying... In a similar situation to yours, I never had regular periods before starting HBC at 15, and when I stopped in August, it took me 3 months to get a period... I don't have PCOS (that I know of, my doctor seems to think I'm not a prime candidate for it even though I've got some symptoms) but my cycles are not regular at all. I never managed to get a positive OPK either thus far, but I've ovulated twice as shown by temp rises on FF. So we've had 2 "tries" in 6 months, and it's made me realize how quickly time passes and how much we want this.

I like that you've set yourself small, relaistic goals for 2017 :) Hopefully you can add a baby in there soon! I just wanted to say hi :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh, I feel you.

I got off HBC in August and my cycle lengths were 106 days (no ovulation), then 55 days (with CD41 ovulation). I just ovulated on CD22 of this cycle, so just want to say hang in there, be patient and good luck!

I don't know where you are, but I know some doctors readily prescribe Provera to induce a period so you can at least start a new cycle without having to wait 100+ days.

Keep temping, keep talking to your body (haha! I hope mine wasn't listening to all the insults I gave it) and read all you can about TTC in the meantime :) </TEXT>

I feel like I almost never get CM, what I put in was what I say but there's never that much of it, and my "positive" OPK was *almost* positive.

	<TEXT> Probably 4DPO (FF is not able to pinpoint my ovulation, and I'm not 100% convinced either)... Going to see my doctor on Thursday and I have no idea what to tell her/ask her... Was planning on asking for more blood tests for hormones to make sure things were okay since I had been having super long cycles and only ovulated in January (stopped HBC in August)... But now I've just ovulated again on CD22 instead of CD41 like last time, which is good, but kind of makes me feel like a fool for asking my doctor for more tests to know what's wrong with me!

* The OPK on CD22 was *almost* positive, I put it in as positive as it was the closest I got (I took it at 10-11 p.m. and think I may have missed the surge earlier that day)

Thanks Coog!

ETA: My temp went up this morning, it's the exact same pattern as last cycle.

When I changed the detector to FAM instead of advanced, I got dotted crosshairs on CD22, but Advanced just tells me I may have ovulated between CD22-24 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Soooo I ovulated for the second time since August, yay!

However, it happened on CD22, whereas last cycle I had to wait until CD41 to ovulate. We were trying to have sex regularly and I was doing OPKs, but never got a clear positive (got an almost positive on Thursday). Let's just say we weren't quite ready for ovulation haha, so I'm not that pleased with our timing, and now I'm puzzled about FF's prediction that I ovulated on Wednesday... And my temps are not that high, which has got me worried about the strength of my ovulation....

Argh, it's like I just can't win! From worrying about not ovulating, I'm now worrying about the timing and quality of my ovulation! </TEXT>

Last cycle I was at 97.7... It's also only the second time I ovulate since August so I'm just afraid there's something wrong with me...

My recommendation for next cycle if you feel up to it temping. It's the only way to confirm that you did in fact ovulate and really helps to avoid this kind of guesswork.
Even if your cycle is usually regular, longer cycles can happen for many reasons. In any case, good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I never expected to feel that slump after a race (that went well!). It probably doesn't help that we started TTC in August, and so the *plan* was to take it easy after the race to concentrate on TTC... Well 6 months later I'm just out of shape, not pregnant! Lol. To top it off, my half-marathon buddy (best friend) was actually 2 weeks pregnant during the half (she didn't know it yet), and is now 6.5 months in...

Late December I got tired of everything being on-hold for TTC and signed myself up for a 5K in May, a 10K in June and another half in August (took advantage of early-bird rates haha). I almost regret entering just a 5K in May, a bigger mileage would have forced me to work out more to get in shape, but I feel so run-down that I was afraid I wouldn't even be able to do more than that.

As for food, planning is key. I just need to do those fool-proof tasty healthy recipes in my repertoire :) Congrats on the weight loss and staying healthy :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugh, I get you on the diet.

I'm usually one for doing about 80% healthy / 20% indulgence, and that works well for me, my weight is usually pretty stable and I've always been active. In May I left a job I hated, and turns out I hate my new job even more. Old job had a gym onsite, this one doesn't.

I ran my half-marathon at the end of August and I feel like I've been in a rut since then. Less exercising, more crappy eating, less motivation, more tired, etc. I get short bouts where I'll eat a bit better but I just feel like eating junk food all the time...

I've gained maybe 5 pounds (I know it's not so bad but it still pisses me off) and I just can't wait to find a bit more energy to actually work out more and cook better.

I'm glad you and DH have been motivating each other, keep at it! Truth is we feel so much better with healthy food :) </TEXT>

OP, did you mention your super light periods to your doctor, did she say anything about that? I've also had periods lasting 2.5 and 1.5 days since getting off HBC with very little blood (still used tampons but they were never full). I'm seeing my doctor next week and will mention it, but I wonder what it could mean (I also have irregular cycles and don't seem to ovulate very well/very strong and sometimes not at all) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, your pre-HBC periods do not sound like they're regular... I'm just chiming in as someone who had stopped HBC 6 months ago and has only had 2 periods since, if you know your cycle is not regular it may be worth looking into stopping it in advance in order to give your body some time to adjust. Of course, talking to your doctor about other options with regards to antidepressants and other options for your skin is a must. You may also want to mention your irregular cycles and your doctor might want to do a few basic tests to see if there is anything that could be causing that and be easily fixed. In any case, good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always knew I wanted kids, but when did it become a big black hole of yearning when I think about it? I can't pinpoint the moment, but to me it feels like it was the difference between holding a baby and finding it sweet and cute, and holding a baby and still finding it sweet and cute, but also wanting to cry because I just want one so bad!

I also think that seeing pregnancy announcements, there was an evolution between "OMG they're having a baby!" and now it's "OMG they're having a baby? But I WANT ONE TOOOOOOOO :("

What killed me is the first time DH told me about yearning for kids when looking at a young family. Oh the feels 3

Edit: I agree about having a baby vs. having a member of your family. I can't wait for every stage from baby to having adult kids when your relationship can evolve and you become less of a "parent" and more of a friend :) </TEXT>

I forgot to take on on Tuesday, and only was able to take one last night at 11 p.m... It wasn't positive, but the 2 lines were almost the same color (it's still the darkest that I've ever seen).
I guess I was not expecting much of this cycle, I ovulated at CD41 last time and am currently at CD23. My CM wasn't telling me much (I never have a lot).

Well last night when we had sex holy moly EWCM :O

And my temps? The last 4 days have gone from 96.2 (my lowest ever), 96.6, 97.1 and then 97.3 today!

I have no idea if I ovulated yesterday and missed my surge, or if I'll be ovulating today, but man I can't predict shit with my body... And since I wasn't prepared for it we didn't BD nearly as much as I would have liked. Oh well, it's still a good thing if I ovulated 20 days earlier than last cycle.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've got an activity with DH's coworkers, skating and other activities in a little village (with animals woot!), then Sunday we're supposed to go skiing, I'm excited, which I haven't felt in a long while, so I guess that's good.

Your weekend sounds nice too Coog, enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, this is good to know. Glad to see that doctors can help with some details like that. I'm not there yet but I think our insurance is not that great, and the costs covered by the government's health care plan was recently cut, so we may have to go down that road eventually.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not alone. TTC is stressful even when there is nothing wrong fertility-wise. It's great that you are taking steps to figure out what's going on and being proactive to fix what you can. I echo what u/Icussr said about doctors being amazing and going round obstacles to get you a baby. She also has a great point about voicing what you're thankful for. It helps to see those other things in darker times.

Good luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CD21 still WTO. I'm pissed at my temps, they are *so* rocky! :( 96.2 Tuesday, 96.6 yesterday, 97.1 today, what's up with that? I'm pretty sure I didn't ovulate, took OPKs and all negative..

I'm so so tired. All the time. I fell back asleep after my alarm went off this morning and then had to rush to get to work on time (barely made it). I'm feeling a bit queasy and zero motivated. Also stressed for a meeting with my Master's Director, meetings with him are never really fun and they just make me feel stupid.

Silver lining? I'm off work for a 3-day weekend tomorrow and supposed to go skiing this weekend, the weather is supposed to be great :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly this. Such a weird mix of feelings that are conflicting and then this layer of shame for feeling that way...
My best friend is almost 7 months pregnant by now (we started trying at the same time) and I *still* have trouble faking a smile when I see her, I can't get over the yearning to be in her place. DH doesn't really get it, thinks that I'm overreacting :( It's just, I can't control how I'm feeling you know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome to the club! We've (almost) all been there when we first started TTC..

When I think back on how I started taking HBC at 15 because I had acne and irregular cycles and never asked any questions, I just feel like facepalming myself, seeing as 12 years later I'm now *trying* to get pregnant and hey, surprise! My cycles are still super fucked up and irregular, and the acne's back :(

Bright side if we're all educating ourselves, and if |I have a daughter I will make sure she knows all this too :) </TEXT>

Let me do my math... Went off HBC in August and first O'ed on Jan. 10. That's 22 WW! Not nearly as bad as you but holy crap I can't believe the women who have regular 25-28 day cycles hahaa, crazy to think of that!

Let's just hope for my sake it doesn't take another 22 weeks :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome!

Just adding a tidbit, it's always good to get a basic work-up done when starting to TTC (past ED or not), to just cover your bases to know if anything is blatantly wrong. 

I wish you the best of luck :) </TEXT>
