	<TEXT> Basically, he would have uploaded it earlier but he needed to install ImageMagick (a tool to create/edit bitmap images) on his computer. Due to some unmentioned Apple-related issues, he couldnt just download ImageMagick so he tried to compile it from its source. To do that, though, the source *needed* an old version of his compiler. To build the older version of the compiler, he had to build a whole bunch of other dependencies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, I'll try and take a stab at this

One major pain point is that it has been around for so long that it has many vestigial UI's. Throughout the last five years or so Apple has played with a couple UI designs and seems to have settled on a Frankenstein's Monster UI that's not really seen anywhere else. There's a drop down menu/tab bar/web browser button bar on top. There's the tab bar on the left that delves deeper into each of the sections selected by the top dropdown menu. The music UI has been constantly shifting and has never felt right since the initial song list UI. Recently Added and albums share an Album UI (that used to have adaptive color which has since been removed). Artists and Genres feature UIs a-la the Mail client. Songs has the old songs list UI. Playlists have the own UI, as well. That's *just* the "Library" tab of the Music sub-menu.

Another issue is that Apple Music was just shoe-horned into an already bloated app. Search now makes you pick "Your Library" or "Apple Music." If you "add" a song from Apple Music, it puts it in your Library. If you cancel Apple Music, those songs are still in your Library but are unplayable. On top of that, iTunes Match is a *separate* $20/year fee so paying for Apple Music doesn't even let you listen to "Your Library" on your phone without syncing it. 

Oh yes, device syncing. iTunes houses all of the iDevice syncing stuff which would be better suited in a separate app. Why do I have to open up iTunes to back up my iPhone? Why do I need to open iTunes to put a document in the Pages app on my iPad? 

Honestly, there's a bunch more. "iTunes" for some reason selling movies, tv, ringtones, audiobooks, iTunes U, podcasts, and phone apps. The multiple rating systems per-track. How slow it runs on Windows computers. The twice-failed Ping/Connect "social network." Not offering over 256kb music (in this day and age!). Not offering 4k content. Etc, etc, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not really a feasible solution for a handful of reasons:

1. That limits development to places where you have the internet.
2. Apple would need an unbelievable amount of servers to make this work because developers can't wait for one to be free to compile the build.
3. The time it would take to upload large projects to be compiled and then download all of the compiled files once done would be a large waste of time.
4. Trade secret issues with having to send Apple your code.
5. The servers would have to be configurable for each developer because no two projects are alike. That means Apple would have to let devs pick which compiler, libraries, runtime, etc. are in each of their dedicated slice.

Those are just off the top of my head </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As it stands, MacBook Pros aren't as fast as many devs would like them to be. Moving development over to ARM processors would make compiling take f o r e v e r. 

Beyond the obvious speed issues, I could not stress enough how *fucking stupid this move would be.* Sure, they can *try* to move iOS development to iOS. What about Android development? What about web development? What about open source/UNIX development? What about all of the developers who use boot camp to work on Windows projects?

At the moment, Apple has made HUGE inroads into the enterprise business because every developer uses their machines. Dropping development support means every developer would just go back to using a Windows machine and thus (presumably) boost other ecosystems while simultaneously drying up the iOS ecosystem.

There is absolutely no way that switching to iOS-based development would work out for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you can't downgrade atm without the use of those 4 apps. (At least with what we're talking about here). Instead of launching the dsiware hack which enables the 3DS downgrade you can now launch FBI. Since you don't have a CFW, though, you can't patch the sig checks to install pirated or homebrew cias. You can still install legit cias though because those basically lack a signature so the 3DS treats it like it was preinstalled on the device </TEXT>

Listen, no one is talking specifically about _you_ when they discuss "white people" in the context of society. You didn't write the laws. No one is asking you to take "responsibility for anything." Please learn to separate yourself from the discussion regarding how society treats minorities.

I'm sure you're a great guy. I'm sure you try hard to be a nice person and I'm sure you say hello to strangers and hold doors for them, too. Nobody is saying that _you_ are the one oppressing minorities nor that you have to apologize for it! Honestly, it's not about that!

In 2015, hate crimes towards Muslims [rose 67% year over year](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/topic-pages/incidentsandoffenses_final.pdf). Similarly, the FBI [has reported](https://ucr.fbi.gov/hate-crime/2015/home/topic-pages/victims_final) that in 2015, "59.2 percent of the victims were targeted because of the offenders bias against race/ethnicity/ancestry." Of that percentage, "52.7 percent were motivated by anti-Black or African American bias."

No one is saying you did that. Nobody is asking you to apologize or take ownership of those terrible actions. Honestly, we just want these issues to be _acknowledged._ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's because white people are in the majority and thus benefit more than "any other race." It's shocking to me that there are people who adamantly believe that white people aren't given more of a leg up in America than blacks, hispanics, arabs, native americans, etc. I'm not saying that white people are good, bad, perfect, evil, better, worse, whatever. I'm just saying that society has historically been nicer to them than other races. For example, the sentences for cocaine (a drug historically done by white, middle-to-upper class people) are far more lenient than the sentences for crack (a drug historically done by black, lower class people) despite being nearly the same chemical compound. Heck, there was a _5 year mandatory minimum_ on simple _posession_ of crack cocaine.

For what it's worth, I'm a white male in his mid-20's whose father had a crack addiction for 10 years </TEXT>

* "Of course she was raped, why was she alone?"
* "Did you see what she was wearing? She basically asked to be raped."
* Instagram banning content with female nipples but allowing male nipples and butts. (This preserves the "sanctity" of the female body).
* "Blurred Lines" a song about a "good girl" saying no but a man knowing what she really wants being the runaway song of the summer. 
* "A key that works everywhere is a master key, a lock unlocked by any key is a shitty lock."
* Any "coming of age" film surrounding a boy who is trying to "get lucky" by fucking a drunk girl

These instances and many, many more help create "rape culture;" a social enviornment where it's encouraged to sexually demean women. Yes, most people agree that rape is bad but many people also find nothing wrong with the above. </TEXT>

As an amateur emulator developer, I'm not sure how that's possible. If you were to run 3 separate VMs in parallel and allocate 4GB of RAM for each, then wouldn't those three "machines" need an addressable 4GB range of memory? I could see using the disk to cache some of the memory but that would really degrade performance, no? This is a genuine question :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, I'll break the situation down a little bit if you don't know. 

America and Saudi Arabia are political allies for largely 2 reasons. One is that SA is positioned in the Middle East and, frankly, America needs as many friends there as possible. The second (and most important) reason is oil, of course! SA is the largest contributor to OPEC and its de facto leader. We need to be nice to these people so we can get a great deal on oil to power our grid, cars, planes, etc. The US is the number one importer of oil in the entire world so keeping its price down is obviously very important to our economy's health. Recently, we have been working towards addressing this issue by fracking. The short term results have been generally positive for the US because the price of oil has dropped (which has had devastating repercussions elsewhere [see: Venezuela]). Long term, we hope to be able to solely rely on our oil in the next 20 years.


If we were to piss off SA (which we are due to "suing them for funding 9/11") then the cost of oil is going to skyrocket. That would translate into expensive gas on the way to work, increased bus fares, higher electricity bills, more expensive flights, etc. All of that would _greatly_ harm the economy because people couldn't afford to commute or travel as much. We really do need to move to more alternative energy sources...

This isn't a dystopia, really. It's just that macro politics are complicated and everything has a butterfly effect. </TEXT>

He used to write for 9to5Mac and leaked many things such as 128GB iPads, [photos of the 5th gen iPad](https://9to5mac.com/2013/01/28/is-this-the-back-of-apples-redesigned-fifth-generation-ipad/) 10 *months* before announcement, all of the [iPhone SE info](https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/17/iphone-se-5s-12-megapixel-4k/), [Siri on OS X 10.12](https://9to5mac.com/2016/02/24/apple-siri-osx-10-12-2016/), and so much more.

Recode is a tech news publication (which is now owned by Vox Media, owner of The Verge) that is known for its serious reporting and its tech conferences.

	<TEXT> Trust me, I mostly agree with you. I was just stating that freedom of speech has nothing to do with whether Reddit should allow T_D.

That being said, I *do* believe that Reddit should ban the subreddit if they truly are spamming other subreddits, using bots to game the system, or vehemently harassing individuals. There *should* be a place on Reddit for conservative-minded people to discuss the news but that doesn't mean it should be allowed to break the site's rules. </TEXT>

Freedom of speech means that someone can express their opinions without fear of the government censoring or sanctioning the speaker.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There seems to be this big mystery around the format of next week's episode. All we really know for certain is:

1. The "reunion" was filmed last week.
2. No one knows who the winner is because RPDR films all outcomes and then airs the real winner. That way there are no leaks about the winner. That means the girls learn who won at the same time we do.
3. Going by Alaska's ex's leak, we presumably know that the top 3 was picked a year ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Columbus actually has a pretty great gay scene. I used to live there a few years ago before moving to SF and the gag is that Columbus might have a better scene imo.

Columbus is actually a very, very gay-friendly city. It doesn't have the sheer amount of gay clubs SF has but that works in its favor. There's pretty much a designated bar (or two) for each part of gay culture. Want to dance through the night with college twinks to pop? Axis. Want to catch a drink and meet a lot of 20-40-somethings? Union. Want to go to a nice little gay dive bar to chill and potentially sing karaoke? Local Bar. Want to go see the bears and fetish-types? Exile. The reason this works so well is that the gay community is able to go wherever they feel they fit in without truly splintering. In SF there are multiple bars, clubs, cafes, etc. for each faction and that really splits up the whole community, imo. </TEXT>

While entirely anecdotal, check [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salary/Apple-Salaries-E1138.htm?sort.sortType=BP sort.ascending=false) to see the amount of jobs making 200k+. Presumably these security researchers would be either hired on as a senior security specialist, researcher, scientist, or even director (depending on their history). 

Start ups are actually the ones that tend to normalize salaries due to either revenue or "equalizing" pay. I know many start ups don't "believe in job titles" and thus pay everyone as an "Individual Contributor" rather than junior, standard, senior, etc. positions. </TEXT>

With that being said, I've heard good things about [this textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Structured-Computer-Organization-Andrew-Tanenbaum/dp/0131485210). Hopefully whichever book you pick up on ARM assembly will have a few chapters going over how the processor functions.

Good luck! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For your purposes, I would learn C, Cbj-C and (most importantly) ARM assembly.

Please note that security research is much, much harder than just learning a language. Before understanding assembly, you have to know how a processor works (at a fundamental level, that is). Once you understand what registers, memory addresses, clock cycles, etc. are then you can learn assembly. This is important because assembly is basically the language that tells the processor specifically what it should do. Once you have assembly down, then start learning exploitation techniques. This covers buffer overflows, rop chains, and more. To understand how these work you need to know how computer hardware works (which is why you learned it earlier). Finally, you can begin to reverse the code use IDA Pro (if you like) and are able to deduce how the logic flows. While going through the logic, you should eventually be able to find holes in the logic which might lead to exploits.  </TEXT>
