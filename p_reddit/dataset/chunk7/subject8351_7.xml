	<TEXT> Yes but there is something there, not to mention the Tax Reform benefits Trump greatly. Just because there is nothing showing yet does not mean to give up hope. That is what Trump wants. He wants people to give up and lay down and just succumb to his wishes....we need to resist and fight for the American people AND the country as a whole. 

Even if Trump supporters are not with us, we can see the writing on the wall with the disastrous EPA changes, Tax Reform (Tax break for the rich), and the constant breaking of the Emoluments Clause with his pay to play Mar-a-Lago retreat for him and his swamp.

Keep fighting, because when we give up we lose and we cannot risk a loss for ourselves or the future generations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The net effect of these comments can be summarized by one word: stonewalling, the tactic of the Confederate Civil War General Stonewall Jackson, whose motto was mystify, mislead, and surprise. Jackson died after he was shot accidentally by his own troops  and Trump needs to watch his right flank in days to come.

And his supporters will turn on him if they believe he is not for them. I am just surprised it has not happened yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  President Obama increase the natioanl debt more than anyone else by far. We might as well try the opposite of whathe did since clearly thst didnt work.

So do you just ignore Donald's golfing every weekend? How about the tax payers paying for Melania  to be away from Trump 24/7? What about the the last "Health Care" repeal that the Republicans tried to pass which was just a tax break for the rich? This is not even throwing in Ivanka and Kushner with all the money they are fleecing while in power.


I doubt you noticed anything since you are a T_D poster and try to do mental gymnastics to justify everything your "God" does.


Don't forget that Donald would make MILLIONS on this Tax break for himself and his appointed swamp. Drain the Swamp...more like Drain America.

Try harder T_D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It points to a GOP bloodbath in that many knew something and will be shown to have known it.

Just to show you how deep it might be in the Republican Party, when Comey was testifying he said he "used to be" a card holding Republican. Just might be that the GOP is all corrupt and thankfully Comey cares more about his country than his party. </TEXT>

edit: Oh, well I knew it was some committee that he did nothing in. Oversight Committee is pretty damn important. It is interesting to note that:

 The chairman of the committee is the only committee chairman in the House with the authority to issue subpoenas without a committee vote.

Does that mean with no chairman that there has to be a vote to ever get a subpoena for information? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Lawyers representing Dow, whose CEO is a close adviser to President Donald Trump, and two other manufacturers of organophosphates sent letters last week to the heads of three of Trump's Cabinet agencies. The companies asked them "to set aside" the results of government studies the companies contend are fundamentally flawed.

I wonder why they think a letter will work when there is all the bad......

 Dow Chemical wrote a $1 million check to help underwrite Trump's inaugural festivities, and its chairman and CEO, Andrew Liveris, heads a White House manufacturing working group.

....oh...pay to play.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In the latest example, the EPA Wednesday called the The Diesel Emission Reduction Program "one of the most cost-effective federal programs," noting $13 in health and economic benefits for every $1 in funding. Also winning recent public praise from the agency: the Energy Star program for appliances and funding to clean up abandoned gasoline storage tanks.

 Each of those programs is on the list of more than 200 the White House targeted for elimination or steep budget cuts, as it seeks to reduce EPAs budget by 31 percent. The budget proposal was turned over to Congress, where appropriators say they will be writing their own version, not approving wholesale the one offered by the president. </TEXT>
