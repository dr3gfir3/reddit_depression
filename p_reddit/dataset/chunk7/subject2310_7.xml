	<TEXT> Finished an LGD cycle with Torem for PCT (last day March 7th) 
Been running MK677 on the background for the last 4 months...and still on it.
i have scheduled a blood work with a TRT clinic on April 3rd and i want to get a clear / true results as possible.

Can you guys help me guesstimate the following questions?

- How many days before blood test should i stop MK677 to get a true reading? 

- Blood test scheduled for 1 month after last Torem dosage, do you guys think is enough time to get a true reading?

thanks!

EDIT: The final question being: if i stopped everything today, how long will it take to the body to go back to normal levels so i can get proper readings and plan accordingly with better knowledge. 
(I realize i should have done this before anything else to get a baseline, i wanted to test the waters and see how my body reacted to the compounds )
i am trying to get things proper now, so your knowledge and/or advice is appreciated.
Thanks!
