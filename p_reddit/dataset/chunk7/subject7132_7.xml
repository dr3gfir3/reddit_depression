I next called my wife, an engineer (and, more to the point, an aspiring astrophysicist), and she went full-on 1960's screaming Beatle fan. I joke that at that precise moment I forever added Kaku to the list of people she's not allowed to ever visit without me. Obama comprises the remainder of the list. :) </TEXT>

Glenn surprised me. He always seemed confident in his worldview. Milo for some reason just smacks of someone who is putting on a front, pandering, attention seeking, behind which is a terrified child. I think that Glenn found something, and I was surprised because I never realized he was looking. I think Milo is running away from himself. Milo will continue to refine himself into full blown sociopathy, or, as I hope, he will implode, drop the bullshit, and in the process find his humanity. If the latter, then I'll be the first to welcome him into adulthood. If the former, then I hope the world rejects him like a cancerous cell, because cancer is fucking dangerous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Hitchens comparison surprised me. Other than that, the interview struck me as well handled. He kept Y (sorry, don't even want to gratify that kid with placing nam in print) from embarking on a troll feeding frenzy, and he still managed to elicit from Y a very excellent demonstration of the childishness that drives his perspective. Maher also gave the other panelists great latitude in roasting Y, which they handled exteemely well. That rounded it it. To me, Maher won. </TEXT>

I know and respect that his stance on reverse time travel is - on the well established basis of prevailing knowledge of physics - negative. However, in context with, say, simulated universe theory, the worldview is expanded, as are the permutations of interpreting why no attendees, allowing for alternative logical constructs:

- they choose not to be seen;

- it was chosen for them not to be seen;

- they convinced him that, hey, best to shut up about their presence.

I just hope, for the sake of healing your festering sore of a last name, that the baby is not your DNA popping up in yet another Spicer. </TEXT>
