	<TEXT> A weird mixture of pot, insomnia and caffeine. I'd been up on my third day straight, I'd hit a day off of work so I was home alone. Somewhere around 10am I heard a voice, the voice of someone who had passed recently. I walked around the house coffee mug in hand and joint in the lips. Shadows began to take shape and move like persons of different sizes. My inner voice was argueing with a voice I swear I could hear with my ears. After going into some kind of a fit I woke up almost an entire 24 hours later in bed. </TEXT>

My cat let's me pet it and sits on my lap some times. Every now and again I'll bust out a toy and it'll bat at it for two minutes before it gets bored. But it shit's in a box. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to have the same problem, no one really tells you that it's a developed skill that you get over time. Not just some natural trait you born with. Just practice on some nobodies you're not intimidated by and it'll get easier over time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, pussy is one of the most valuable assets our species has. It gives life, it brings men and woman alike to their knees both metaphorically and literally. A dick pick is in unwanted abundance but a pussy pick can rake the bucks in. Own your super power you whiny douche. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get some social skills and make smarter friends. Or maybe talk about subjects in common with the friends you have. Try to sound less arrogant, I once underestimated one of my dad's dirty old friends because he had the speaking capabilities of a toaster. But the man knew more about the plumbing layouts of different types of structures than I know about anything I'm proficient at.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was younger and working at a department store. I saw a customer service rep come into the backroom where I worked and whip out his phone and start texting. When I asked what it was doing he responded with "Customer asked me if we had more of something and I said i'd check, i'm going to shoot some text messages off and tell them we're out," </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Make an example of someone that takes advantage publicly. It doesn't have to be violent. The other day we all ordered pizza for a get together and my buddy always just neglects to be there when it comes time to chip and takes advantage of the fact that we'll all pay. Thought it was a coincidence at first but after the 12th time in a row I was over it. So out loud I said "wait let's give ___ a chance to chip in after he gets out of the bathroom, he wouldn't want us to spot him AGAIN," </TEXT>
