	<TEXT> Haha! Saudi sucks, to be sure. But I'm an American. The most they can do is kick me out unless I commit a major crime; like murder or grand theft or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still in Saudi Arabia for a couple more weeks and I was telling my "therapist" here about why I'm leaving and how even though I haven't been Muslim super long, I'm grappling with feelings of indecision regarding leaving it (Islam, not The KSA. I am running out of The KSA on the day of my flight) due to it having become my life and all my most loved friends being Muslim, etc. I was explaining to him some of the reasons, like how people glare in Islamic countries if you laugh in public and how in general I've been told by many Muslims "you laugh too much." And his response: "My sister, I must warn you that too much laughing is Haram. There is Hadith about it" 

WHAT THE FUCK? Is this true? What's the Hadith? And why in the hell is laughing not okay?! Are you supposed to be joyless in Islam?!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're correct, they aren't. But Trump (and many other billionaire Americans) do business with the largest Muslim population countries. So...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm mixed-black, but "ethnically ambiguous" and often mistaken for Arab. Bearing the aforementioned in mind, plus arriving from an Islamic country (even though it is one that is heavily in bed with America), I fear even without my hijab I'll likely be detained. I've also been to Syria and Yemen in the last four years, but it was done so other than legally, so I'm not sure if those trips are on their radar...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm only going to wear hijab and abaya until I'm on the plane, then I'm taking them both off (wearing yoga clothes under it, obviously lol). I'll definitely post once I've made it to US soil. Technically still a revert as I haven't committed "shirk," but I'm not practicing and have no desire to ever again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I posted a couple weeks ago about wanting to leave Islam and my Salafi husband and The KSA. I'm thrilled to say that I'm getting out! Ticket purchased, paperwork to bring my kitty situated! But after seeing the news about the Muslim Ban actually being fucking signed and the subsequent issues some Muslims have had when arriving at JFK from Islamic countries, I'm terrified. I'm a revert and a born US citizen, is it still a real possibility that I'll be barred from entering? 

I hope I'm just being silly and paranoid, but any insight is appreciated.  </TEXT>
