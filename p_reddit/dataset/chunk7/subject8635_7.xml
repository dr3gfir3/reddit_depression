	<TEXT> Mary was now in the hospital  she was going to be fine.  Her stomach had been pumped and the doctors had managed to stabilise her.  But hours later the doctor shared with me that the sleeping pills were not the only drugs in her system.

They found a plethora of anti-depressants, anti-anxiety pills and pain killers in her system.

How do you think this happened? The doctor asked.  I shrugged my shoulders, because I honestly had no idea.  Mary wasnt on any anti-anxiety medicine, nor was she on anti-depressants.  The only medicine we had at our home was my diabetes medicine and high-blood pressure medicine, and Marys heart medicine.  A year or so ago shed had heart failure.

The doctor seemingly accepted this and advised me to go home.  I didnt want to go home  I was going insane, it seemed, my daughter arriving in front of me, speaking to me.  Was it my conscious?  

I had tortured her for years?  That was what Leahs voice had said, wasnt it?  But how was that possible?  How did that even work?  How How did I torture her?  I was a father for her when her own father wasnt.  I cared for her, I raised her as my own!  Who dried off her tears when that lowlife father of hers just left her for dead?  Who played with her when no one else would?

This was insane.  No one had asked me to give up my life to care for Leah. I just did it.  No questions asked.  I bought her first doll house, I brought her the first laptop she ever had  I even let them put that damn expensive software on it!

I allowed her to have a dog, I allowed her to continue living with us.  God knows shes an annoying little bitch at times, but shes my kid and I accept that.  I help her with her car, Im her fucking handyman!

Why did her voice say I tortured her?

Why?

I didnt understand.  I finally did go home.  Leah and Kira were gone, but so was Boy.  I didnt even worry about that  if the dog was dead, so fucking be it.  I didnt care anymore.  If I couldnt have Spot, then no one could have a pet.

I put on the TV and soon yelled for my daughter to fetch me a glass of water.  She always did it.  I called her from the flat to get me water  and other stuff  and she never complained.  Granted, it was much quicker for me to get up and do it myself, but I just always asked Leah.  That was what she was for.

I heaved my large body from the chair and made my way to the fridge.  There I found half a bottle of Coke, which I took just like that and carried it back to the living room.

Im not supposed to drink Coke, or alcohol, or anything that isnt water, or so the doctor said.  But I often gave in to a glass of icy Coke.  I took a swig  it was flat.  When was the last time we bought Coke?  It isnt something on our shopping list normally, but

I shook my head and took another swig.  I loved the feeling of my throat burning as the gas bubbles slid down my throat  the flat Coke was making the entire experience remarkably underwhelming.  I sighed when the bottle was empty and let it fall to the floor.

Suddenly I felt numb.  I couldnt move.  I figured I was tired and decided to take a nap right there.  Mary wasnt here to scold me, and Leah wasnt here to laugh at me.
. . .
Honey? A voice said, Honey, wake up.  I opened my eyes.  It was my mother.  She was pretty, but lonely.  My father worked long hours, and mommy missed him a lot.  

Mommy, what is it? I asked.  It was dark outside, and I could hear my brother snoring on the bed opposite me.   I tried to sit up, but she pushed me back into the pillow, a hand over my mouth.

Dont speak. She whispered, before she flipped the bed covers off me.  She pulled my boxers down, bowed her head and 

MOTHERFUCK! I screamed.  I looked around  relieved that I was an adult, I wasnt a scared fifteen-year-old, I was home.  But I couldnt move.  My body was frozen, I could only move my eyes.

I was alone.

My damn mothers so-called playtime.  I never knew it was wrong.  I never knew that parents werent supposed to do that to their children.  I didnt know that it was taboo, or that it was something called incest, or

My mother had taught me that it was playtime.  She did that until the day I left for the army.  It was a different time  no one spoke about things like that.  Sure, we discussed sex, but not sex with our mothers.  We would even sit in a ring and jerk off when we were bored.  We discussed the act of sex, but never who we did it with.  

We didnt talk about the nightly moans we found the guys making, where theyd cut holes in their mattresses and humped the hell out of it.  Or when they humped each other, as it were.  It was the army, and what happened there, stayed there.

I didnt know it was wrong.

Not until Mary told me that she had been raped by her own father as a child.  Not until she told me that if there wasnt a loud yes, then it wasnt consensual, then it was rape.  I didnt know

And I didnt know it was wrong when I did it to Leah.

Caught on, have you? Leah said, and I jumped  or if I would have had I not been paralysed.  I tried to speak, but she put a hand in the air.  Dont bother, you cant talk.

She stood up and walked to me.  She put a hand on my arm  and she felt real. Daddy dearest, She said, How does it feel to be at the receiving end?

I was at the fucking receiving end for fifteen fucking years!

I know all about what ol auntie Iris did to you, Iris was my mothers name, and she just refused to acknowledge her as her grandmother.  She didnt have a problem with my father, she gleefully called him granpa, but she had always seemed to hate my mother. Mum told me.  Just after I told you to stop.

I remember that day.  I had been offended that she didnt like our playtime.  I even posted on social media about it, but that opened a whole other can of worms.

But the thing is, dad, She sat across from me, You have been such an enormous asshole to me.  Youre such a motherfucking hypocrite, you know that?  Im not allowed to drink  but you drank as if there was no tomorrow.  Im forbidden from smoking, but you lived on two packets a day.  I am not allowed to have friends, but you had tons.  And you call me when Im busy fucking studying because you cannot get off your sexist, lazy ass to make yourself a cup of coffee.

She smiled.  That sick, twisted smile that made the hair on my neck stand up.

Im tired of being your slave.  So, this is where I leave you.

She stood, and left me in the dark.   "But it isn't over." </TEXT>
