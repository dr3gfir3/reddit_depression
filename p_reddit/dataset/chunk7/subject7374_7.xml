	<TEXT> A discrepancy between the books and the movies is the Golden Snitch.

In the book version of The Deathly Hallows, we're told that Snitches have flesh memories, meaning that they will respond to the first person who touches them with bare skin and flesh; this is how Dumbledore managed to keep the Resurrection Stone hidden for Harry.

However, in the movie version of The Philosopher's Stone, Harry is not the one to first touch the Snitch with bare skin and flesh; that distinction goes to none other than Oliver Wood, who showed off the Snitch to Harry prior to Seeker training.

See the problem? </TEXT>

* Mincinno, [ENG], OT: Mah, ID: 59826 (Wonder Trade)

* Ralts, [GER], OT: Jeffrey, ID: 12788 (Wonder Trade)

If the original trainers are reading this, I'd like to thank you. I'll be sure to make good use of the Master Balls in the future. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-26 07:03:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> DID YOU KNOW?

Excluding Legendary Pokmon, Pokmon that are part of an evolutionary line (including Mega Evolution) and Pokmon with other forms, there are only three singular Pokmon (as of pre-release Generation VII) that have unique type combinations. Those Pokmon are:

 
* Skarmory, with the unique typing of Steel/Flying, which it has retained since Generation II.

* Stunfisk, with the unique typing of Ground/Electric, which it has retained since Generation V.

* Hawlucha, with the unique typing of Fighting/Flying, which it has retained since Generation VI.


It is possible that more Pokmon may be added to this list upon the release of Generation VII. Likewise, it is also possible that any of the above three may be excluded from this list due to the same circumstances.

**Have a good day.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Following since inception?

I've followed FFXV's progress avidly up to 2014. I've been somewhat abstaining from most of the news about the features and content of FFXV so that I can be pleasantly surprised upon release and so that my expectations aren't shattered when I play it; I'm not expecting this game to not be amazing, but it's still a possibility.


 Keeping interest?

As I mentioned earlier, I haven't been following the progress all that much for the last 2 years. As such, I know there's plenty of content that's old news to some, but will be new to me.


 Coping?

I've been keeping busy with trying to get a job and completing an online Diploma in the interim, not to mention all of the other great games that have been and will be released between now and the 29th of November. </TEXT>
