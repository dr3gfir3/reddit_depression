	<TEXT> The point is to be functioning workers, they will have needs that need to be met outside of capitalism. The social fact that Capitalism can't meet such needs will make it look weak and defeatable. Pre-capitalist societies collapsed because under the weight of their contradictions they were unable to provide material benefits to the bourgeois. If I was to guess I'd say the way in which silicon valley are commodifiying the commons themselves will have something to do with it. We will have to reformulate the theory of labour value though to really articulate this point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zizek talks about exactly this point. We all know that corporations lie to us: nobody actually thinks bagelhut are "passionate about lunchtimes" and we know about the systemic horrors - child labour, environmental degradation and neocolonial exploitation - behind capitalism but we continue to participate in capitalism anyway. Companies like Starbucks and RED have even made our guilt about these issues a commodity by 'donating $1 to congolese women' or whatever for every x products sold. 

The good news is that capitalism HAS to collapse unless it destroys every living being on earth first. If alienation is a commodity in itself, we will eventually come to a point where people will just stop participating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He put her in a hard spot, but here's what she should have said:

Comedy is inter-subjective, it's a social reflex, it stops us from taking ourselves too serious, it's a collective sight of relief at the banality of every day life. Comedians have an important public role in this way, people look towards them to see what kind of behavior is normal and what isn't. To be able to laugh with someone is to recognize them as a person like you. Jerry Seinfield should have been more aware of the fact that his work is going to have social consequences. To sit back and say 'what's funny is funny' isn't enough, he doesn't fully own his material - it depends on some shared understanding with the audience and when you're filming a TV series you have to have be aware of who you are unconsciously projecting your audience as. Women and black people have different life experiences to white men and so by making some effort to include these people as your guests, you open yourself and your audience up to humor in different life experiences.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He also might be referring to Bataille's "notion of excess" - luxury, which he strongly alludes to in 'Looking Awry'. In any libidinal economy, there's always a redoubling--male peacocks have famously beautiful feathers so as to show a mate "I'm so healthy, I can 'spend' my energy on something so pointless". While this is a mating ritual for animals, the place of the symbolic realm in humans makes this notion of excess an end in itself rather than a means to something greater: take for instance our fixation with diamonds, which are completely pointless but still seen as a desirable end in themselves. The pursuit of this empty signifies is really the pursuit of the death drive in itself which links to what /u/Tsui_pen said </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. The fact it's been adopted by the culture industry is indicative of an under underlying ethic that, followed to its conclusions would not lead to any kind of real social critique. 

And yes that's my point exactly. Let me use an example from Walter Benjamin's [Thesis on the Philosophy of History](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/benjamin/1940/history.htm) to illustrate it:

 It is well-known that an automaton once existed, which was so constructed that it could counter any move of a chess-player with a counter-move, and thereby assure itself of victory in the match. A puppet in Turkish attire, water-pipe in mouth, sat before the chessboard, which rested on a broad table. Through a system of mirrors, the illusion was created that this table was transparent from all sides. In truth, a hunchbacked dwarf who was a master chess-player sat inside, controlling the hands of the puppet with strings. One can envision a corresponding object to this apparatus in philosophy. The puppet called historical materialism is always supposed to win. It can do this with no further ado against any opponent, so long as it employs the services of theology, which as everyone knows is small and ugly and must be kept out of sight.

Under secular post-modernity, we should swap "Historical materialism"  and "theology". [Dupuy explains](http://msupress.org/books/book/?id=50-1D0-3448#.WHEG8ly33IU) that late-capitalism effectively takes the role of an unchangeable Absolute (ie theology), it's hidden away yet fundamentally constitutive of our society - so much so that it's easier to imagine the end of the world than the end of Capitalism. Theology - the puppet could be conceived of as received social doctrine - ie patriarchy/kierarchy. Yes these things are bad but they're merely a symptom of a category of material life that needs to create *Others* in order to function. 

So what I'm saying is that so-called 'Liberal Feminism' is an attempt to dismantle the Master's house with the Master's tools. All we get is more atomisation and alienation as we reify the neo-liberal subject as default.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't think of any two figures more at odds than Zizek and Sam Harris. He's said before that he [hates Sam Harris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObnBHMzIQ_A). Even at his very best, his neurological understanding of the mind resists the idea that an unconsciousness exists which is the key insight of psychoanalysis. In terms of religion, Zizek identifies as a Christian-Atheist, whereas I'd say that Sam Harris is an Atheist-Christian in the sense that he's imbibed Christian doctrine and to an extent believes in the Absolute but refuses to label it god. 

The problem with Zizek is that he's always addressing two different sets of people as he speaks. To your average viewer, he seems to spit firing nonsense, dirty jokes etc paired with the occasional counter intuitive insight. To people who have read Marx/Hegel/Freud/Althusser/Lacan he's doing something much more sophisticated. 

If he were to comment on Joe Rogan, I think he'd make a point about how liberal permissiveness is really a form of internalised discipline. He claims to be a hedonist and have a sort of legalise pot/anti-dogmatic politics but he's also goes to obsessive lengths in his fitness/dietary routine. As for psychedelics, I think he'd say that they faciliate an encounter with the Real (that is reality unconstituted by language or the imagination) but the doctrine of 'look into yourself to find the truth' which its attached to is bogus neoliberal ideology - we should be trying to experiencing ourselves as truly passive beings, by looking to the way Others see the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 'real problem here' clearly has to do with how some people are clearly still confused about the status of homosexuality in our society. The shooter had visited Pulse at least a dozen times and had downloaded the Jack'd app on his phone. His father hated homosexuality but he was extremely confused as he was gay himself. It seems to me he displaced this confusion as hatred by targeting a gay night club  so as to show the world his inner conflict as dramatically as possible and then claimed to be acting on behalf of ISIS for maximum shock value.

How do we stop this from ever happening again? Accept LBTQ+ people as ordinary citizens, repudiate this discourse that holds terrorism to be the worst possible evil yet at the same time sacralising any form of attention grabbing and then ban assault rifles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so here's a bit of context: 

1) The Fabian society is a think tank in Labour. It publishes all kinds of literature applying a certain tradition of British socialism to contemporary issues. The point is to flout ideas that nobody reads anyway, not to lobby for any serious change.

2) Britain is a massive proponent of EU expansion. Our own PM, David Cameron lobbied for Turkish to enter the EU. In 2012 (when this was published), Turkey was a candidate country - a somewhat successful model of a primarily Muslim country modelled on liberal reformism with a promising economic future. 

3) Guido Fawkes and the rest of the London Tories are working extremely hard to try and implicate Sadiq Khan with extremism. They haven't been too successful so far, but they're still playing with that idea that Muslims are untrustworthy, unbritish backstabbers.

So basically what we have here is an out of date and out of context headline that doesn't mean anything for the mayoral race. if you want to see the subtext, look at the comments on that page - quite disguising indeed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree--but would add that there's nothing inherently wrong with Sanders/Star Wars/Tinder/Dan Carlin, the problem is the way that reddit pesters on about these kinds of things in a way that's uncritical, unproductive and therefore boring. 

I love the *idea* of reddit - organic, indepth, wide-ranging discussions from internet users. If I'm looking for lifehacks or guitar tips or product reviews or something practical, I'll come here because I know that it's entirely organic. The problem is that after browsing for about five minutes, I'll see something stupid or hateful that gets me angry and sends me here. 

Heck, I'm only on CB right now because I was on a thread on /r/unitedkingdom thread about the new Top Gear line up

In short, there is something here and I think reddit could work as a decent website if major changes were made in terms of strictly moderating the site and enforcing basic standards including being vigilant towards hate speech. Unfortunately, Reddit is made up of internet idealists who don't really understand what things like free speech mean in practice and it is run by silicon valley types that are slightly less nave about this but have a vested interest in maintaining the lowest common denominator to maximise profits. </TEXT>

You want examples of non-violence being a force for political change? Look at *everything achieved in the confines of liberal democracy* from women rights to European unification to decolonisation to social legislation. Outside the confines of democracy we also have the Carnation revolution, the shouting revolution, the Tunisian revolution and pretty much every other peaceful revolution in history?

Also I'd like to see some other historical examples of mass-violence being a force for good, because everything from the French Revolution to the Haitian Revolution, to the Russian Revolution to the Syrian Revolution failed because of people tend to y'know stop thinking rationally and fairly when their families lives are at risk and lose themselves in a needless and unstoppable bloodbath. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Armed resistance groups like the marquis or the free French weren't nearly as effective as De Gaulle made them out to be in reconstructing the French state. Once the Vichy authorities or the Nazis captured one member, they could infiltrate the entire organisational structures of these groups. Much more effective in halting the Nazi regime was small acts of defiance - using the black market, hiding 'undesirable' jews etc that was difficult to stop at the source. 

Non-violence as a means for political change is pretty much always more effective eye for an eye approaches. Compare Mandela to Mugabe, Martin Luther to Malcolm X, Ghandi to Che Guevara. Even George Washington knew he was fighting a limited conflict and sought to normalise relations with Britain after the revolution. I wish more Americans would realise this   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a slightly phallic thing though, isn't it? An emotional attachment towards an object is called a fetish - the object compensates for something that someone is missing in either their personal lives or their relationships. A gun is unique in that its clearly designed to kill or wound. If someone told me they're obsessed with guns, I would think that they feel unreasonably insecure about other people and their environment in needing this object that they're more likely to kill themselves with than anything else. I'd probably avoid that person because they're irrational, insecure and have a dangerous weapon for my own safety. Then again, america is a military democracy so I guess the self worth of many of its citizens is vested in their capacity to be violent.
