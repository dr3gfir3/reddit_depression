	<TITLE> How I feel about this game and all the controversy around it. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-07 17:02:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love this game. Pure role playing at its finest. It look me about 50 games to learn it and another 100 to respect it. In those first 150 games I would leave if I didn't like the role, not write wills properly, not participate in the chat etc... Now however I do everything to make this games fun for everyone. Most importantly I play my role. Every role. I love them all (even disguiser). I find people get caught up in their abilities when everyone's most powerful tool is the chat. I love medium because it forces you to use your brain to help the town. Even if everyone leaves after dying you still have a the tools you need to help win the game and it's the exact same with disguiser. Some of my most enjoyable game have been as Medium. Finding other townies early then organizing things between other townies as I get info (ex. If I get jailed letting the Jailor know who I know are confirmed town are, letting someone know they can trust me ASAP in the game so they can rely on somebody. It really makes a difference. 
I find too many just want to do "cool" stuff or want the role to do all the work. People who leave GF, framer, Medium night 1 don't want to think or play the game. They just want to do cool stuff. 
I love and respect the game and Blankmediagames. I also have patience for those who don't, it just takes time. </TEXT>
