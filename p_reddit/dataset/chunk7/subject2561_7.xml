	<TEXT> You will probably get more advice in the what card thread.

In general though, the way to maximize this would be to spread that amount over several new credit cards to obtain the sign up bonuses. However, if you feel uncomfortable opening several cards each quarter (which is completely understandable), then you could try to find one good card and maximize that. At that level of spend, something like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Amex Platinum would each net you a large amount of flexible points. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PSA: Amex now allows referrals from within their app (on Android at least) for some cards. If you go from the side menu to Membership, you might see a Refer a Friend link. 

The plus side of this is that it gives you an option to send a referral via message, which will automatically generate a referral link for you. No need to email yourself and wait for the email to come through! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should probably post this in the Daily Discussion thread to get more responses / fewer downvotes.

There have been issues with incognito mode since the beginning of the month. You could try and see if you can get an offer on the regular Amex Gold (not PRG) or, if you're willing to do a little spend, get the EDP via referral for 20K MR + do some MS to get the remaining. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ED incognito is 25K/$2k, whereas via referral its 15K/$1k. While you do lose out on 10K, it does come at $1k less spend and might be worth it if you can't find a high offer on another card. </TEXT>

You can also look into Mogl, which gives cash back on dining and stacks with the above programs. </TEXT>
