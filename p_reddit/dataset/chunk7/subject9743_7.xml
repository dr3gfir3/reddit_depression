	<TEXT> My friend and I are applying to study abroad in South Korea in a couple of months and we are concerned about how we will access our money. I've never been outside of the U.S so I'm a little fuzzy on how these things work. I have T.D Bank and my friend has Bank of America. Does my bank exist in South Korea, or have an affiliate through which I can access my money? Or would I have to take out my money and transfer it to a South Korean bank?

Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The real morbid reality is seen in the comments of these videos.

Someone should have called that bitch's bluff. She's such a failure that she failed at correctly killing herself.

Nothing to see here folks, just typical attention whore, move along!

I'm calling BS on this.
A. It's staged
or
B. It was a cry for attention from a skank that got kicked to the curb for being a drunk skank.

They should've let her jump 'cause she's obviously too weak to survive life.

Yayyy she got the attention she wanted all along.. Beautiful story!

if you are gonna kill yourself man up and do it, dont be a pussy and stand on the edge and then not jump.

Really? </TEXT>

ANB is totally worth checking out. I know quite a few HM fanatics who would call it their favorite game. 

Also, if you like RF3 you should keep in mind that RF4 is coming out soon! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, RF3. Rune Factory games have all the good parts of Harvest Moon games (like getting to know villagers, raising livestock, getting married, having kids) but also adds in fighting and dungeons. Also, it's really easy to raise friend points and love points because rather than giving somebody a gift every day you can do the requests they ask of you in the bulletin board in the center of town. Giving gifts just speeds up the process. 

It comes down to what you're looking for. If you want a laid back experience of running a farm and settling down, ANB is the way to go. If you want to battle/raise monsters, complete dungeons, and marry cute fantasy chicks, Rune Factory is where it's at.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a problem, I could talk about Harvest Moon all day! 

If ANB is easiest, you should totally go for it. Unlike the older HM games, there is somewhat of a reason behind the game. You are rebuilding a broken town, restoring the buildings and the citizens to their former glory. Although it starts off a little bit slow, you get the hang of it and it gets really fun. Just so you know, things you are handed in older HM games (such as chicken coops and storage sheds) are not given to you. Instead, you have to build them yourself. 

As for RF, the only 2 RF games that are related are RF1 and RF: Frontiers. Seeing and Frontiers is for the Wii, you don't really have to worry about that. RF1, RF2, and RF3 can all be played without having played any of the others beforehand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What consoles do you have available? 

For Harvest Moon, my 3 personal favorites are Harvest Moon DS, Harvest Moon Grand Bazaar, and Harvest Moon (M)FoMT. Of course, you really can't go wrong with any Harvest Moon game because they're all so damn good. 

Harvest Moon DS is basically AWL, except there are more bachelorettes such as a sleeping princess and a mermaid. As the name states, it is for the DS.

Grand Bazaar is another one of my favorites because it sort of switched up the monotony of the game. Instead of shipping items, you sell them at a weekly bazaar. It is competitive, not only with other villagers but also with yourself. It pushes you to get the best quality products to get the most G and the best stall at the bazaar!

Of course, I'm sure you know how amazing FoMT and MFoMT are if you're already considering bringing one. You really can't beat the classics. I sort of prefer MFoMT over FoMT just because you can be a girl and marry Kappa. I don't know why I love that green dude so much. 

I will say, though, ANB is definitely worth the purchase. The marriage prospects on both sides are very cute, you can also customize your town in a way you've never been able to in Harvest Moon games. 

As for Rune Factory, any of the handheld games are great. (That would be RF1, RF2, and RF3.) My personal favorite is RF3, just because the story line is closely tied to both your character and the town, and also because you are half monster. Of the 3, RF2 is my least favorite because you don't get into actual dungeons until you are married and have a child. 

Sorry if this was too long. In short, buy whatever! You really can't go wrong!

EDIT: If I *had* to choose *one* game for you to take, I'd say RF3! :D

Really? You think somebody will go to jail for life to help kill somebody they don't know for $190 and their SSN? Suicide is a selfish act in itself, but asking somebody to do it for you (when you are of able body) is even worse. 

This will not put this subreddit on the map. There are tons of recorded murders, suicides, or deaths in general out there already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 22 years isn't even that long in the grand scheme of things. Also, why are you so hell bent on ruining other people's lives? You drive like a maniac everywhere you go? You do realize that it's putting people - who may not want to die - at risk just because you're unhappy, right? And the whole thing about the gun, if you somehow manage to get it, it will likely be registered to somebody and traced back to them. I have no right to tell you to live because it's your life and your choice, but you have no right to involve other people. You'd be long gone and they'd be damaged. 

I hope you don't, but if you do you shouldn't take others with you. </TEXT>
