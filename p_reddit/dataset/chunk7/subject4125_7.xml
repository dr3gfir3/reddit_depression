	<TEXT> I'm regretting the title I chose too. :(

With hindsight your suggestion would have been a much better title. I've learnt my lesson and will try better next time.

Like I said in some previous comments (and this is not meant to be an excuse), it was taken from the [press release](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-10/e-dof100716.php). 

Nevertheless, because this one is now a 'popular' post, the mods would delete an attempt to repost with a new title (right?). Also, it'd be a shame to lose the resulting discussion. (I don't care about the karma) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title was based on a line in the [press release](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-10/e-dof100716.php) (I mentioned that in an earlier comment).

With hindsight, I should probably have emphasised the uptake through the gut, rather than mention the liver. (Sorry, if I could edit the title I would.)

	<TEXT> Thanks, that is probably a better description.

With hindsight, "fast-tracked" wasn't the best word (even though it was in the press release). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, that's also ['right'](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/10.1210/en.2004-1378).

This related [expert commentary](https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e21263) mentions this, and explains more about how the regulation of fructose uptake depends heavily on context, including presence of glucose, diabetic status and elevated TXNIP levels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the point being made is not that fructose goes to the liver first (yes, that was known). Instead, it is that fructose is "fast-tracked" to the liver from the gut in diabetics because they have elevated levels of a protein called thioredoxin-interacting protein/Txnip.

Txnip's role wasn't clear before, but the new study shows (at least in diabetic mice) that more Txnip means that the gut takes up more fructose, and so therefore more fructose is transported to the liver, more quickly.

	<TEXT> The new finding specifically relates to the mechanism involved.  

Fructose uptake is supposed to be regulated in the small intestine, but it was unclear how this occurred, and why it goes 'wrong' in diabetics.

The new study reveals that protein called thioredoxin-interacting protein (Txnip) interacts with the fructose transporters in the gut to promote fructose uptake. Diabetic mice (and people) produce more of this protein than so absorb more fructose from their diet. This worsens their metabolic problems. </TEXT>
