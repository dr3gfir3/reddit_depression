	<TEXT> Fair point, I don't hate them in that scenario at all, like you said, it's a fair stat trade. I think it's bc of the whole SM thing, SL150's fighting suped up players that are on the same SMemory but higher lvl, in those cases they've sacrificed no stats. But yes disciplined use of Agape would prevent that...but losing a ring slot is pretty big also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm newly returned from D3 and new to trading but economy seems functional to me (US West Ladder). I started later in season with zero gear. I can get a lot of items fairly cheap with the 2-3 valuable drops I can get myself while high value items like Enigma still will take me awhile to trade up for, but it's attainable. I would still enjoy playing equally if I self-found everything but if bots are driving trade pricing down doesn't seem like a bad thing to me.

One of the reasons I dropped D3 for D2 is that even when you have BiS gear in everything D2 is still fun for me, while for me D3 endgame has no more rewards.

Isn't Ladder climbing more of an issue? Seems like that's the only really competitive component of online play. </TEXT>

Drops are meaningful, the focus is on builds and gameplay over gear, yet gear is important for endgame (whereas in D3 gear is where you begin the real game, nothing happens till you have a 6p set and a handful of key legendaries)...no crafting materials, ya f u for that D3 devs. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Recently returned to D2 after giving up on D3. I mainly played single player before and would cut out 'the grind' as much as I could via hero editor and just focus on trying different builds.

Playing exclusively on Bnet now. Is there a really basic guide anyone can give me on farming up? Like suggested target/difficulty/MF for socketables, runes, and high quality legendaries respectively? I vaguely understand that high MF isn't always good and that I need a balance of kill speed vs. MF.

For example, I have nothing basically so need everything, but mainly socketables and runes - I can kill NM Meph with a little difficulty. Should I bump up to Hell and farm in A1 for elite socketables and runes or would I be better off staying in NM and running a variety of routes/MF levels?

And trading is completely new for me - is there a current simple guide anywhere on ladder trading?

Edit: I'm playing a lvl 65 Trapsin with scraps for gear, but up to about 120 MF. </TEXT>
