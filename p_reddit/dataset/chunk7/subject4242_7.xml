	<TEXT> beware beware beware you are in deep and dangerous waters with a strong undercurrent too.  People can get stalked and/or dead this way, any and all players.  A word to the wise:  never, ever jump in between them and threaten the guy/beat the guy down. The next time he does beat her, he will be that much closer to killing her.  [not that this has been done in aforementioned post]  Domestic violence is insidious, and while you may be able to offer help, a shelter/professionals are their best bet.  The boyfriend/husband/batterer can and will find her/those helping her.  It puts everyone in danger.  Call cops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was three, first experience in church after my father got home from Vietnam ('73); I must've done a convincing 'exorcist' impression, I never had to go back.  My father would off and on get behind a pulpit and preach Christianity and my head would always spin; he was out of my daily life early enough on, and I honestly didn't have anyone else that proselytized at me.  I imagined it everywhere when I was young.

I fielded a question, and the entire room goes silent; others on the panel slowly turn to look at me w/horror on their faces, and I laughed so hard I woke myself up laughing hysterically.

	<TEXT> What scares me now is my lack of fear in the moment, my lack of hesitation, lack of common sense; road rage got the better of me, and it turned out to my favor, luckily...
Driving on a detour, 10pm deserted highway between towns, my friend and I are two females alone and no cell phone between us.  A truck comes and rides my tail, a very large truck that was following so close his headlights were blinding me.  I upturned all three rearview mirrors and did everything I could to allow him to pass me, which he never did.  This went on for probably 5 minutes, its hard to tell, it felt like forever.  I was getting quite angry because his headlights were causing me problems and if this was a cop he needed to just pull me over, and he wasn't doing that.  
First thought/impulse was "That's it!!! I'm hitting the brakes *hard*!" but thought better of it, being in the middle of nowhere and no phone; the next best thing was I pulled over to the shoulder, abpruptly.  Violently, even.  
So did he.
I was so fucking angry, without thinking I throw open my driver's door and jump out, slamming it behind me.  Standing directly in the path of his headlights, I screamed at the truck "Motherfucker hopes he's a cop, real fucking fast!" and walked towards the truck. "Get the fuck outta that truck right now!"  I had no idea what I planned on doing from there.
He decides he wants none of that, and pulls away.  
I'm glad it wasn't Kurt Russell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have to say a great deal of famous white females have commited a great deal of moral criminal acts, hard to tally.  Because a lot of these criminal acts, in and of themselves are not illegal, just extremely distasteful.  Say the way they may treat servants or assistants; of course, I cannot site any one exact person nor headline.  And not all actresses/celebs will be guilty of this; and the stereotype is just that, a stereotype.  But those are born in truth, and I'll bet we don't know the half of it because frankly, the victims would never tell of it because of shame; the aggressors because they feel entitled. Their peers, because they feel guilt by association.  How am I doing so far? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this would land in r/unexpected, then!  People who followed the links offered were horrified afterwards; one guy was defending his sub because it was for people who like sticking objects up their bum; that at least he wasn't a rapist or pedophile.  Somehow, I assumed eyebleach was his, that I would need to bleach my eyeballs after seeing it.  Indeed, its definition is just that.  Thank goodness you don't have to look at the others beforehand.  I'm too squeamish (yet just fascinated enough to be curious, but its a fine line to have seen too much)

Well, dammit, I could swear it was in that comment thread the links I speak of.  I just scrolled through all, and ?  You'll all just have to take my word for that shit. :D  oops </TEXT>

	<TEXT> seriously?! (for real?) too chicken to have ever looked.  I will come back and edit in where the information presented itself to me from; that was an assumption on my part.  
edit:  https://redd.it/605kjb
that should be the tickle monster, and somewhere in the comments, are a series of links.  They start out sex related, then follow up with a link to eyebleach.  Someone who set up one of the subs was defending his position, which involved...anyway, I assumed it to be eyebleach that he was speaking of.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> sweet...inserting a space into therapist is fun, but only when doing so in jest. Not so much fun when you learn the hard way who your *therapist* really is.

	<TEXT> yeah, could be. I'd never tried to find an actor from a commercial. But!  I can offer an alternative!  Just for jokes.  http://static.lakana.com/nxsglobal/feedsite/photo/2016/09/02/Cop%20on%20the%20Rooftop%20-%20Sgt-%20Ludwig%20-%20Sgt-%20Parizek_10833948_ver1.0_640_360.jpg
I went to school with this guy.  My god, he makes watching the news all the better (he does public relations work for DMPD) Paul Parizek.  He's not the one you wanted.  And he's a real cop.  But I know this guys name!!! (lmao) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jail/prison.  Despite the fact that everyone incarcerated is where they are by some mistake like getting fucked by their lawyer or framed by the cops (lol),  they are people.  People whom society likes to forget about, people who suddenly aren't 'people' anymore, i.e.: 
Talking about someone who was convicted of murder, put away for life w/o parole: "They'll never be able to hurt anyone again."
Really?  What about the dumb kid in the cell down the way?  He's only doing a 6 month sentence for some minor thing. He's a person.  
A person who may not go home.  And the food! I only did four days once, in county lock up.  I literally didn't eat for four days, it was that fucking nasty. The Health Department doesn't get involved. If I'm wrong about that, please tell me.  
There are many more aspects of how terrifying the experience can be, and a lot of the time people who aren't criminally inclined (I don't know how/what else to call it) think along the lines of 'they are where they belong (the one incarcerated)'....until its your son or daughter, or you, even.  Don't think it couldn't happen.  Its a cowardly new world out there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of folks, when saying "There's nothing to eat here!" should walk back out of their kitchen, close their eyes and take a deep breath, adjust their standards and expectations, then go back in.  There'll almost always be something to eat, they just don't want a can of baked beans or whatever is in their cupboards for God knows how long.  They have food, they just aren't that hungry yet. </TEXT>
