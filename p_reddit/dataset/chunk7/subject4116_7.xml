Also, as I understand he wasn't selling prescriptions but rather trading them with one specific individual for sex, an individual who was never a patient but was at one point hired to be his office manager. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regular:

arranged in or constituting a constant or definite pattern, especially with the same space between individual instances.

So, let's say every week of the year a person with a mental illness shoots people. That would be regular.

And if once every day of the year someone without a mental illness shoots people that would also be regular. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "Those with mental issues shoot people." "A majority of shootings are committed by those with mental issues"

I am not saying either of those things.


I am saying "It is a regular occurrence that a person with a mental illness shoots people". 

I am not saying all mentally ill people shoot people, I am not saying that a majority of mentally ill people shoot people, I am not even saying that 0.00000000000000000000001% of mentally ill people shoot people, though considering the reality it is an implication that more than that have to shoot people for it to be a regular occurence. I am saying that it is a regular occurrence that someone, not everyone, who has a mental illness will shoot people.

It is also a regular occurrence that someone without a mental illness will shoot people. In fact it's much more regular. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm certain that you don't see what I'm saying. Because if you did the way you would go about disproving it would be showing that someone with a mental illness shooting people is not a regular occurence. Instead what you've done is show that the majority of gun-related killings were not perpetrated by someone with mental illness.

These are not contradictory statements.

If every day of the year someone with a mental illness shot people, it would be a regular occurrence. Even if that only accounted for 0.000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001% of shootings, it would still be a regular occurrence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not true. Kime-No-Kata, a series of movements taught in Judo which are known formely as "kata", involve both swords and daggers. 

But Judo is a competition sport for the most part, and weapons are only involved in katas. They are completely disallowed in bouts. </TEXT>

It's like if I said men regularly rape women, and you disagreed and provided a study that showed the majority of men don't rape. There's no contradiction. </TEXT>

Did you even read the article? Like never mind the actual legislature, did you even read the article written by a clearly biased source trying to shit on the bill?

You might as well say that restraining orders are begging to be abused, because all it takes is accusing you of harassment. 

There is an entire process here that you're ignoring because you don't like the idea. </TEXT>

8 with Assassin and 6 power charges, then 9.9 with inc crits gem aswell. Cospri's Malice only has .5% more base crit. 

and 1.35-1.4% attack speed

You mean 1.35-1.4 aps. At that rate of attacks it takes a tiny bit less than 45% attack speed to reach 2 attacks a second, which lets you cap out on cast speed with CoC. And since crit cap isn't particularly hard to reach with Assassin there's no problem here. </TEXT>
