	<TEXT> I've got a question that's been nagging me.  
A lot of popular leaders have an attack boost based on a combination of colors attacking, like set, Isis, or Ronove. Why are any of these leaders considered good when lots of leaders give an automatic attack boost to the whole team based on type or color?  
  
For example why run Nepthys over LuBu when she only boosts her own attack but he triples any devil on the team? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have a student who when he was younger had to be taken to the emergency room by his mother because he had been sitting outside putting small pieces of gravel up his nose. They got stuck in his nasal passage and the doctor had to go in and remove them. When his mother asked later on, "Why did you put rocks up your nose?" He simply replied "Because they fit." </TEXT>
