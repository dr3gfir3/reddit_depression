	<TEXT> Hello /u/Tinderium! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

You must set a realistic price or a specific item for which you would instantly trade for every item you buy, sell, or trade here. You must state a specific skin (e.g. Gut Vanilla) that you are looking for. You may still ask for offers. If you have set a buyout and your post is still being removed, please resubmit with a different title.
    
New items added to the game won't require such a price (therefore you can ask for offers in this case), but only until one week after the first set of those items become tradable (CST/CDT will be the time zone used to determine when this window ends). If you were trying to do this, and you feel this removal was an error, please contact us at the link given below after this message.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title - *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).


Thanks! :D

	<TEXT> Hello, Your post appears to be too vague and breaks Rule 6 (and possibly others) of /r/mildlyinteresting and has been removed. Your title must be a concise description of the content. No jokes, backstories or other fluff. "This was inside my car" or "The way this door opens" are unacceptable. It should act as a "spoiler" for the image. If it leaves the viewer surprised in some way after viewing, it will be removed. [Read about rule 6 in more detail here or in the sidebar](http://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/21p15y/rule_6_for_dummies/). Still unsure? Feel free to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fmildlyinteresting) with a link to this post for a detailed explanation.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abxfc/wired_place_for_getting_boner/).

Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

	<TEXT> Hello /u/I-am-not-very-smart! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.
        
---

##If the original source is a PDF:

*Leave your post as-is* and [message the mods](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Exception+for+PDF message=I+need+an+exception+for+this+post:%0A%0AOriginal+PDF:). We'll make an exception for you. In your modmail message, be sure to include the original PDF.

Your post will be manually approved by the mod team, and we'll sticky the original PDF to the top of the comment thread so our readers can get context.

	<TEXT> Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. For example: When submitting a question you can expand on what motivated you to ask the question, reasearch you already did and things you already know about the subject. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

**Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/history subject=I expanded my post message=I expanded my submission for your review: https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6abx9s/how_many_times_in_british_history_has_the/.) once you have expanded your post so we can approve it for you.**

Hey /u/harry26902, thank you for your submission in /r/Rainbow6!

Unfortunately, because your account is new (under 2 hours old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.

This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/Rainbow6 requires all accounts to be at least **2 hours old** AND have **positive comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have negative comment karma, it is easy to raise it  simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.

Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/DirtySnapchat because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. You can check out the guidelines [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/comments/1sacqa/must_read_how_to_format_your_post/).

This is the proper way to format a title - *AGE [R4R] - DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your header:

**1. Use only M, F, T, A, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

**5. If you are posting about /r/DirtySnapchat in general, please use a [meta] tag at the beginning of the subject.**

Please visit [the submission page](http://www.reddit.com/r/DirtySnapchat/submit?sidebar title=AGE [R4R] - TITLE) to resubmit your post. If you get an error message asking you to wait, you must wait until the timer expires before posting again.

If you're still having issues with your post, please feel free to [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDirtySnapChat).


Thanks! :D

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

I'm not sure if anyone else gets the sense that he is undertaking a systematic effort to change this country, but it seems to me that he knows exactly what he is doing. So let's, once and for all, dispel this myth that Barack Obama doesn't know what he is doing. He knows exactly what he is doing.

Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account doesn't yet meet our minimum requirements for submitting music.We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/reddiquette) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6abwhy/hiring_managers_of_reddit_do_you_care_if_people/).

[Here's a search run for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/search?q=TV+License restrict_sr=on)

[Link to TV License website](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/)

If your question is **not about:**

- Whether you should pay
- If what you watch attracts TV License (Watching live/on iPlayer)
- How you watch (online/TV/Freeview/Satelite)
- Enforcement (what happens if you don't/can't/won't pay)
- Refunds
- What channels to watch with TV License
- What's the point of paying
- What does TV License pay for
- Does my room at University need TV License (if you watch it in your room only, then yes it does)
- Does my rented room/flat need one (if you have an HMO contract, your room needs one, or a single one for a TV in a communal location)
- Anything else found on search or on the FAQ
- Not listed on the [TV License website](http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/)
then [click here to message a mod](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=AskUK subject=Please review my post about TV Licensing message=https://www.reddit.com/r/AskUK/comments/6abwga/temporary_tv_licence/), and we'll review your post.

	<TEXT> Why the actual fuck do you think that you deserve to treat me like a piece of shit? If you post something on reddit and someone asks for a citation on that there information that you posted then you should be able to fucking find that piece of information. I thought it was very fucking obvious that the piece of information in that there post that I was asking for citations was for Jimmy Fallon's first show, like would it have been that hard to link me to it rather than just call me dumb and be a complete and utter dick? What gives you he actual right to just slay your abuse on any individual who is simply asking for a citation on that there video? And you suggest that I am just "bitching on Reddit", but I feel in that there writing I have written above I have outlined the problems that I am having with you and that I am just not bitching or complaining but simply suggesting that any individual who posts un-cited information on this here website should be prepared to offer citations quickly rather than just try and add confusion and bullshit into the equation.

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

	<TEXT> PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE MESSAGE BEFORE MESSAGING THE MODTEAM.
Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

	<TEXT> It looks like you're trying to start a conversation, but you haven't included much for users to respond to. Please make a new post and include your thoughts in the text portion of your post. For example: What did you like or dislike about the book? What did you think of the actions of the main character? etc. Please don't add random stuff as it is just going to get your post removed again. 

 Also, please be aware that asking for book recommendations is against /r/books rules. Book recommendation requests should be posted in either /r/suggestmeabook or in our weekly recommendation thread (which can be found on our front page, just below the banner.)
