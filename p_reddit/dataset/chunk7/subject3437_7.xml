	<TEXT> Do it like Pathfinder Society traits. During chargen, they get to pick 2 backgrounds of different types.

They'd amount to being minor bonuses - +5 hp here, +7 magicka there, +3 block, etc that would serve more to provide flavor to the character without making it wildly powerful - there's not a massive difference between 25 and 30 for most skills in terms of long-term benefit ( and before legendary was introduced, actually would *lower your max level* ), but it lets you play as a Khajit who is slightly better at using his claws in combat, an Orc who is in great shape and has higher than normal health, an Argonian that is good at using a shield and conjuring weapons to fight with, a Nord comes from a line of Speakers and has stronger than usual Thu'um, or a particularly superstitious Breton who has slight magic resistance ( stacking a magic and religion trait to get it ).

In the grand scheme, a half-way decent enchanting score would make most if not all of these useless unless you do "flat-or-percentile-whichever-is-more" scripted stuff, so I don't feel any bonus would be too strong as long as it is kept at 10 or lower. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on the setting, mood, and tone the game shoots for, honestly.

I could really dig a [Southern Gothic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Gothic) [Black Marsh](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Marsh), where the Big Bad is a hoodoo ( Voodoo is a religion, Hoodoo is folk magic ) user trapped in a polygon of manipulation between a few of the Daedric princes ( Vaermina, Boethiah, Clavicus Vile, etc ), and some sort of lovecraftian elder horror, each side trying to play the main actors in the plot against each other for its own gain, similar to how [Alduin manipulated the Imperial and Stormcloaks into a war to gain souls](#spoiler "Skyrim").

The player would get press-ganged into clearing a ruin of some sort, but gets separated from the rest of the group by a cave in of some sort, where they witness the Big Bad arrive. After a spirited conversation with the rest of the people, where they refuse to give him what he is asking for, he unleashes a hoodoo curse that kills them all. He then notices the player, trapped in the small room they are in, and tells them to "walk free, go to city name and tell others what you saw - to not disobey me." Another curse is then used, and the floor collapses under the player, dropping them into a cellar or cave, and prompted to escape, in typical TES tutorial form, into a grotto in the bay, where they are cut loose to do what they want, with an objective to go to the city named, which would branch them out to the factions they can join.

tl;dr

Point Lookout with swords. </TEXT>
