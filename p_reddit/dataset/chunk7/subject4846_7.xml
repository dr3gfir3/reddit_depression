	<TEXT> years a go i had to make a 3d timeline for abu dhabi. which had a bit about how the entire economy was based on perals for a very long long time. then when humans found out they could build synthetic ones, the abu dhabi economy crashed because they were a one trick supplier. when the oil companies began making oodles of money, the leadership did not want their entire economy to be held up by only oil.   tl;dr abu dhabi money is not just oil money. </TEXT>
