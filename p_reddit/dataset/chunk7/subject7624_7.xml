	<TEXT> I recommend starting with walking. Getting out of the house is good, and it's easy. All you need is a pair of shoes. And pants. Pants are good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm very attracted to my man, so I'd be happy to have sex with him every day, multiple times if we could. There are times when we're both too tired to comply, and I release I have a slightly higher sex drive than he does. But for the most part I am pretty satisfied.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can tell by the other comments here that my opinion will be unpopular, but here's the other side.    
   
Infidelity has never been a major deal-breaker for me - I think that a lapse on occasion might be within the realm of forgiveness.     
But it's all within reason. Like, if I can tell he's in love with me (and you can always tell), he gives me his time and attention and I'm not lacking for anything that he ought to be providing, I'm not going to kick him out the door for having a one-night-stand somewhere.     
But on the other hand, if it's more than a one-night-stand, that is, if it's a ten-night-stand and she has his toothbrush on her sink, that means we have something to talk about.     
To me, infidelity of that level, and if it were really quite often (and that, too, is subjective) means that there's something wrong with our relationship. One of us isn't satisfied - be it physically or emotionally - and it would take two of us to put effort into rectifying that. If it's not something that can be fixed, then that spells the end for us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My man. It used to seem silly to me to focus so much time on one person, but I realise that the more effort I put into making him happy, the happier I become. I feel more confident at work and in daily life in general. I'm more health conscious, more focused and stronger all around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that people who smell badly don't really know they do. They're probably desensitised to the odour, might be in a bad situation where they don't have much of a voice in the matter, or haven't been taught what a person ought to smell like. I wish there were a nice way to tell them, but there really isn't.     
Just, when you do tell them, be sure it's in private and try not to allow a gaggle of classmates giggling around the corner. There are few things more shameful than being told you stink. </TEXT>

I like men with well-trimmed facial hair because it's manly and gives a nice angle to the chin.     
Cons are the potential for badly-trimmed / unkempt facial hair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually envious - I started a while back, but much of my work involves drinking. (Those after-work parties and drinking your rivals into the ground is a real thing here, and unavoidable for someone in my position.) But my SO is still on keto, and he thinks it's the best thing ever. And he sure does seem much healthier for it. </TEXT>

Easier said than done, sometimes.     
But that's another story altogether - how to gracefully end a relationship. Definitely the fodder for another Ask Reddit question. </TEXT>
