	<TITLE> Critique my A-team? Vestal/Jester/BH/Hellion </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-10 15:55:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My basic strategy is to spam stuns (Yawp, Flashbang, sometimes Dazzling Light) which allows me to not only take down enemies safely, but also stall long enough to get plenty of heals out to keep everyone near full health. 

High crit chance and Jester camp skills keep stress low. Most of my DPS comes from Slice Off and occasionally Finish Him (if I don't need an extra flashbang to keep enemy stunned). 

Currently, this team seems game-breaking even against high-stun-resist enemies in later game. But I'm sure I haven't fully optimized my skills/strategies. Any suggestions to adjust team composition or skills?

EDIT: As much as I like running Jester with this team, I'm going to try Vestal/BH/Crusader/Hellion and see how it compares for stress relief and DPS </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with the previous statement that he needs a powerful personality like Glover to balance him out.

Absolutely this. He's a great guy and clearly loves jiujitsu. But his love for jiujitsu sometimes leads him to monopolize conversations/commentary with his own thoughts. 

For example, there's a video comparing Rubber Guard and Williams Guard with Eddie and Shawn Williams.... the conversation is basically 20% Shawn and 80% Eddie:

Hey man, I'm not hating, I'm just saying it doesn't work as well as he thinks. 

For example, I think it's great that you're tactically renaming moves, but I don't think you would say "Ninja Turtle Pass" repeatedly in professional commentary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, the truck is itself not a rolling back take, but it's part of a system/hierarchy that most commonly sets up rolling back takes (the same way that "twister side control" is part of a system that sets up the twister)

Ryan Hall would call it "lower body back control" (which I agree might not be better than 'the truck')

I'm not sure I understand your second point. If Eddie is renaming moves so people dont know what it means, why is he making such a big point of awkwardly popularizing those names in commentary like this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "10th Planet is really becoming the dominant style for no-gi"

I think anyone who watched or competed in the 2014 no-gi Worlds would probably disagree with that statement. 

10thP is fantastic for no-gi (and is tailored for it, of course) but let's be real here guys

EDIT: This event had some Metamoris-level commentary: biased and generally awful. The commentators praised almost everything Denny did (mostly escaping subs) and minimized so much of what Eddie did. Eddie had a full body triangle from the back and their comment was "Denny might be in a little trouble here." And they called the sub a kneebar! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> when creating a taxonomy for a system there's a natural tension between specificity and generality. for naming conventions, you want to get to a sweet spot: not too specific, not too general. 

I know almost all of the 10thP naming conventions, and I have to say they are just way too specific. judo has the same issue - it's just far too specific to be optimally useful.

"samurai roll" and "the truck" - these are just variations of a rolling back take. Just call it a rolling back take. it works for ryan hall. 

"reverse kesa gatame" is a million times more descriptive than "twister side control." if you know kesa, you know reverse kesa. 

on the other hand, "lockdown" is a much better coinage - it's become way more common than "scorpion lock" so it's fair that it sticks. 

i say this as someone who knows and uses 10thP moves frequently: the commentary on this video was obnoxious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally understand, that would piss me off too. 

NOBODY deserves to get swung on over a basketball game and honestly he was within rights to do whatever it took to defend himself. He was 100% in the right, and people twisting his words to make it sound otherwise are the worst part of this for me. For my part, I don't think he put himself in this situation at all. 

Honestly the reason I'm so interested in this video is that it DOES show how BJJ can end a fight without anyone getting hurt. I should have mentioned that there is a lot of GOOD jiujitsu in this video as well (the back take, the fluid leg lock transition, etc.)

More importantly, despite the technical critiques, we can and should be proud of this guy as a representative for BJJ and grateful that he handled it without hurting anybody and tarnishing the reputation of our sport/practitioners. Especially since he came out unscathed, we can also be grateful that he gave us an opportunity to objectively learn from the good and bad of what went down.

Props to him and to Alliance.  </TEXT>

I still think there's a big difference between "perfect" and "good" though. Whether you're Rickson Gracie or random purple belt, pulling bottom position is bad jiujitsu when strikes are involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The threat of strikes should absolutely make your technique change, but not for the worse. The threat of strikes should encourage tighter elbows, better posture, more assertiveness/initiative, and should trigger the instinct to get on top (position before submission). If getting hit doesn't trigger that for someone, they're just not that good at jiujitsu yet.

The patella injury from your shot: that sucks! But it has definitely happened to elite fighters too (gracies) in street fights. I suggest learning to use a "plunge" step instead of the standard shot so the knee never hits the ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Super cool - I love to see tweaks like the knee on lapel that give an edge to control and pin someone in place.

That being said, this is a good example of the type of technique I wouldn't incorporate into my own personal game. It's just too situation-specific, I prefer to essentially play a nogi game in gi (getting a few small advantages from gi grips, friction, etc.) I have a knee jerk reaction against things that don't easily translate to nogi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, but I actually found his technical critiques even more interesting. I know he wasn't planning to fight that day but this stuff is very fundamental. 

* Hands down instead of anywhere remotely between them
* No base/pulling guard? Dude needs to work on his wrestling. 
* No posture control (bite) on the armbar
* Pulling a leglock position and threatening a break instead of just getting on top and controlling. This is a great way to get soccer kicked in the head by others if they think you're going to maim their buddy. It's incredibly easy to get on top from 50/50 if the other guy is untrained.

We have different tools for different situations and rulesets (or lack thereof). But at the end of the day, grappling is grappling - some fundamentals hold true across rulesets (e.g., the importance of base and balance). 

As somebody who started BJJ way back when the mentality really was different (for better or worse), I thought Keebler's breakdown here was excellent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how to crush the lockdown half guard against taller people, quoted from another post of mine:

Scenario: You have an underhook and a crossface, but your crossface lacks pressure because he's kicking away super hard. That's fine - instead of wedging your shoulder under his chin, use your forehead instead. **Essentially you're having distance management problems - you're trying to use a crossface when a better tool for that "range" might be the crown of your head.** If you still cant drive enough pressure through your head, use your outside forearm instead. You just need to create some kind of frame - use whatever frame is appropriate for the distance. When he gets tired of dealing with that pressure and/or gasses out his legs, if he lets go for even a second you'll slip right into a better crossface. Ryan Hall describes this super well in one of his DVDs... either Arm Triangles or Passing the Guard I think, or both. Also watch how Roger Gracie does HG pressure passing. 

The other principle here is that whenever someone is hanging on to you for dear life, they are tying themselves up too. When someone really extends their lockdown hard, it ties up their hips and makes it very easy for you to feel what they're trying to do and reverse-engineer it. For example, it becomes easier to just step your foot right out of the lockdown and do some of the silly stuff you can see from Erik Paulsen here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TpR6bG60cDM . Or sometimes I'll just gable-grip around their knees, sprawl and pass easily. I.e., if he insists on keeping you too low to get a crossface, I'll box his hips instead. 

Now the real answer to your question: **He really should not be able to defend the crossface, much less whip you up, if you have a good underhook and heavy hips. If that's happening to you, your hips are just not heavy enough.** You need to do a forceful pelvic thrust straight to the mat and at the same time curl your legs to the sky and pop your hips into extension. The underhook holds your upper body in place as you adjust your hips where you need them to be. You have such a mechanical advantage from here that no lift should be possible. 

For example, watch how Marcelo does a 100% standard pressure half guard pass against Epstein's lockdown here. He gets upper-body grips, drops hip pressure, walks Epstein's hips to the side, and finishes with a white-belt-standard half guard pressure pass. Nothing fancy at all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2mc9-DXhCLA#t=124 . The only trick you might miss here is that Marcelo is jacking Epstein's near arm away from his body as he walks his left leg out, allowing Marcelo to settle his weight in the space between Epstein's Right knee and elbow. That's the difference between being in a dangerous half guard, vs. being essentially in side control with your leg incidentally trapped in a shitty half guard. No lockdown can save you from there.  **To your original question: Once your weight is safely settled to the side, even if your leg is still trapped in lockdown you can drop a monster crossface without worrying about the whip-up. If he whips you up, it should actually align more weight above your crossface.**

Last note just to be sure: If you're giving up the underhook a lot, #1: don't do that, and #2: work on your whizzer/darce and reverse-kesa-style half guard passes  </TEXT>

I watched your videos. Yes you won. But you have white belt-level movement (high hips, jerky and tense movement, etc.) Thats what makes you a white belt. In my eyes it will take you another year at least, and that's only if you fix those problems.

The idea of purple in 3 years is ridiculous in the first place. But you are nowhere near purple belt level, stop kidding yourself, stop whining, shut up and train. And be grateful you don't train at a gym like mine. </TEXT>

OP was a D1 wrestler. naturally he's going to pick things up pretty quick. maybe a blue belt showed it to him and it really clicked for his body type. also, RDLR is a very natural transition from basic shell half guards - I got comfortable with RDLR and X-guard waaay before i formally saw them in class.

	<TEXT> totally see your point. this reminds me of a ryan hall monologue on one of his DVDs (i think it was guard passing actually). the gist of it was "if you had a million years to train, of course you'd try to learn everything equally well and be maximally well-rounded. but in the time you actually have to train, try to optimize what you learn." 

I think this is one of those situations. OP should consider their long-run goals and whether it makes more sense to start with what's natural now vs. training to be a lefty-passing ninja in the future. 

as for me, just coming back from a loooong injury layoff, it was almost equally natural to start "re-learning" my passing lefty. it was awesome. but i have been training forever and what's good for me might not be good for a beginner. 

OP - let us know how it goes! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this topic. This is rare for me, but I'm going to disagree slightly with /u/truthjusticeUSAway a bit this time. 

I think if you're this early in your BJJ career, it's a great idea to emphasize passing to the non-typical side, especially if it already feels pretty natural to you. 

I'd recommend repping new passes on the "lefty" side first until you're comfortable, then start repping the other side and going back and forth. 

You can always "come back" to working your typical side, but I feel like it would be harder to do it the other way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) taking two random samples is what makes it unpaired (independent). A paired (dependent) test would be e.g. testing the same individuals in a population at two different times. 

2) if you take two random samples from a normally distributed population, they will also be normally distributed (or at least follow t distribution, so roughly normal as n increases)

you trollin?

EDIT: Here's the answer from another subreddit. I just needed the equation, which this person provided: 

You'll have to first specify what you count as a "significant" difference, and also have some estimate of the two populations. Suppose you wish to detect a difference of d units with probability 1- (the most common choice for  is 0.05), and that you estimate the standard deviations of both populations as s (use a conservative estimate if you have no previous knowledge of the populations). Then the (estimated) standard error of the difference in sample means is s(2/n), assuming you use the same sample size for both groups. You want d/(s(2/n))z, where z is the quantile from the standard normal distribution that cuts off /2 in the upper tail; for =0.05, this is about 1.96. This inequality yields n2s2z2/d2. </TEXT>

http://mauinow.com/2011/02/06/atomic-aftermath-bombs/

The event was about to start when Guidas camp said they were pulling out of the fight. Apparently Guida had some issues with the promoter and asked to see the fight purse. Promoter **Jeremy Varney** then expressed that the prize money, $25,000 in cash, had been stolen from someones car and that he would provide checks to the fighters. Guida, as well as many of the other fighters, refused to accept a check.
