	<TEXT> I'm just saying what worked for me. Yes you'll get trashed in Dominion at first, but it's by far the fastest way to see the most variety of characters. If you duel and get trashed by a PK and they don't rematch you. It'll be who knows how long till you face another. At least in Dominion you can run into that PK a few times through at the match and even if you get ganked you atleast see what she likes to throw at you alongside who ever else was there to gank you.

Not saying I'm right or my method is best. Just simply stating how I see it and what personally worked for me.

I did Dominion exclusively before ever joining a duel and have done fairly well in duels given the fact I knew most if not all the characters by then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bots my friend. Play against them until you destroy them and then move to Dominion. 

Why Dominion? Because it's 4v4 and you get to see a lot more characters and their kits and strengths and weaknesses. Once you know what to expect from all of them duels becomes a lot more manageable. You shouldn't lose so much as warden since they are very top tier if not the toppiest of toppies in topville </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are more right than wrong since I cannot speak on behalf of others. But I will add that me and my 3 friends have really good internet and we play about 3 hours nightly and we maybe disconnect maybe 2 or 3 games, some nights not at all. Bad connection does play a big role in this. It's not as bad as people make it seem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why I don't duel unless it's for contracts. I understand environmental kills are a thing. But, when some characters are significantly better at environmental kills and you get set up on a map against them which heavily favors environment kills it's not really fair or fun. Especially when a shugoki charges you and there's cliffs on either side of you and you just die without even being able to do much. Again, I don't mine environmental kills, but in a duel it shouldn't place you on a damn bridge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm not going to stoop to your level since you are obviously a child that can not have a discussion or express their point of view without demeaning the opposition. You can enjoy 1v1 and I'll respect your right to, but just be aware that not everyone agrees with what you're saying lol. I don't find 1v1 a skillful display of breaking anyone down. I see 1v1 as a starefest of who attacks first and gets countered then owned. I find Dominion to contain the true skill and forces a player to consider many variables while utilizing every aspect of their character in order to succeed against 1, 2, 3, or 4 enemies all at once while still trying to achieve victory by using map control and strategy. 

Well agree to disagree, except for Dominion or Duels being 'retarded'. They each have their crowd. Enjoy the game because that's what we are all doing in the end of the day. </TEXT>

"Give a man a fish and he will eat for a day. Teach a man to fish and he might eat more or maybe he might never eat because he can't catch shit so yeah good job dick. Instead of feeding the poor guy you left him to fend for himself when you could just give him more fish if he needs it. Wow. Good job."

	<TEXT> Nah I win without revenge I just find them slow paced and boring. I enjoy the adrenaline that comes with the chaos of a 4v4 Dominion being attacked by multiple enemies and holding your ground till your teammates arrive etc. The end game mayhem that ensues when both teams are broken and engage in the center for a chaotic team fight is just too fun and epic to restrict myself to a slow boring duel. </TEXT>
