	<TEXT> I don't think this is where it ends. This is just their introductory piece, talking about the context of the leak (Donald Trump   historical abuses of FBI power)
and some snippets. For some reason, OP changed the article headline to one of those snippets.

Edit: my mistake, I thought OP posted this ["Secret Docs Reveal: President Trump Has Inherited an FBI With Vast Hidden Powers"](https://theintercept.com/2017/01/31/secret-docs-reveal-president-trump-has-inherited-an-fbi-with-vast-hidden-powers/)

This is actually just one of their publications of the FBI leak.

Now, thanks to our access to these documents  which include the FBIs governing rulebook, known as the DIOG, and classified policy guides for counterterrorism cases and handling confidential informants  The Intercept is able to share a vital glimpse of how the FBI understands and wields its enormous power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ongoing situation in Yemen continues to be profoundly tragic. This is just so terrible. In this one Seal raid, at least 7 kids between 3 and 13 years old died. The cluster bombing, drone strikes, and destruction to schools and hospitals.. the inhospitality towards humanitarian workers even moved Doctors Without Borders to abandon Yemen.

Anyone know if the Red Cross is still largely donating morgues at this point? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What mechanism is in place that actually ensures the a president will follow through on campaign promises? Shady connections, political donations, past actions are a huge indicator of future policy - particularly for a Presidential candidate. No one thinks that more Katrina coverage alone would've totally changed the election, but there are many other important stories that were buried. Does that make sense?

	<TEXT> [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has personally pushed agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example, but for some reason people put a lot of faith in what presidential campaigners *say* as opposed to what they *do* and this is an example of the trap we fall into.

We need **better journalism** so more voters are informed on who actually represents their interests, and a heck of a lot more **reform so we don't keep picking the lesser of evils for an office that we all pray doesn't abuse the tremendous power afforded to it.** </TEXT>

"The Human Freedom Index" seems sketch considering they consider the UK the free-est country (ignoring the whole censorship and domestic surveillance thing).

Edit: also what do you think about this:

comedian Mike Ward has been told to pay $42,000 for making an offensive joke about a singer named Jeremy Gabriel. Ward is planning to appeal, but the fact that he's been found guilty of a "human rights" violation seems ridiculous enough. To be clear, the joke was not a particularly nice joke, but still: 

https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160731/17384835121/canadian-comedian-plans-to-appeal-42k-joke-that-insulted-someone.shtml

There are numerous occasions where msm messes up on the truth (WMDs in Iraq, claiming reading WL's emails is illegal, claimed Snowden gave documents to China - then Russia, claimed US didn't accidentally bomb a hospital), and if regulatory capture occurred - it would only result in their rivals being put down.

Right now, we have a defeated majority. Many are scared, and many are motivated -- and few of those are applying their motivation constructively.

	<TEXT> Yeah I know people like that, but I think we also have people that are so uninformed about politics that their emotions aren't directed at things that will change the situation. E.g., supporting politicians that are culpable of the same behavior their perceived enemies commit; not differentiating from what politicians say from what they do, trusting sources that have a history for misrepresentation...

	<TEXT> [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has personally pushed agendas with both major party establishments.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

That's just one example, but for some reason people put a lot of faith in what presidential campaigners *say* as opposed to what they *do* and this is an example of the trap we fall into.

Neither major party candidate cared about us; one of them entirely expected everyone to vote for an extremely unpopular candidate (one who lost to Donald Trump of all people) after blocking an obviously popular candidate. We need **better journalism** so more voters are informed on who actually represents their interests, and a heck of a lot more **reform so we don't keep picking the lesser of evils for an office that we all pray doesn't abuse the tremendous power afforded to it.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They wrote a report giving their reasons. Here's one of their points:

Some oppose leniency for Snowden because he violated the law. But many in the national security establishment who committed serious crimes have received little or no punishment. President Obamas decision to look forward, not backward absolved from liability the officials who designed and implemented the torture and extraordinary rendition programs at the CIA and Defense Department during the George W. Bush Administration. It also meant that those who destroyed evidence of these crimes and misled Congress about illegal torture and surveillance would never face charges.

In addition, the government has also been lenient to high-level officials who made illegal disclosures or destroyed classified information. Examples are cases involving National Security Advisor Sandy Berger and CIA Directors David Petraeus and John Deutch.

There are, of course, differences between these cases and Snowdens. But the crucial point is that only in Snowdens case was the motivation behind his illegal activity to benefit America. The three others involved efforts to gain glory or avoid criticism, or simple convenience and simple disregard for the law that put our security at risk. Yet the perpetrators were treated leniently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But it feels good either way :)

This is the truth for *so much* activism/resistance

E.g., when I use the TOR browser (famous anonymity tool), I feel good because in a tiny way - I'm providing additional cover for people who need protection AND subverting drag-net surveillance; or donating money to charity I like.

It doesn't matter what 'everyone else' is doing, but feeling good about what you can do is an awesome feeling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're to blame for a lot of problems right now for their failure to inform the public on issues that affect democracy like money in politics, mass surveillance, and transparency. When they're not ignoring an important issue, they're pushing propaganda. 

Remember when one provided justification for invading Iraq (based on faulty intelligence)? When almost all of them accused Snowden of giving documents to China, being a Russian spy, being a narcissist (and ignored all the publications about mass surveillance after PRISM)? Pretty recently, one of them accused Snowden for disclosing programs not in the public interest - that they themselves published (and after Snowden obviously relied on them to publish only programs in the public interest).

Remember the Harvard study that revealed many US media outlets had referred to US brutal torture programs with euphemisms - but not foreign? Or when publishing Mark Klein's revelation of NSA - AT T eavesdropping was explicitly postponed until after a Presidential election? Refused to admit that the US bombed a hospital even after other outlets had, and days later begrudgingly wrote a long piece that admitted it but provided reasons why it was reasonable.

The list goes on   on   on. Heck, the NYT [still has an article](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/world/asia/china-said-to-have-made-call-to-let-leaker-depart.html) where they effectively accused Snowden as giving state secrets to China. I could cite all of these examples, but they do it so perpetually that I'd still be leaving out many more examples. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The TPP was aready protectionist trade policy, but part of Trump's rhetoric was opposing it.

And how can you be both pro military industrial complex and 'pro-Russia?' Does being 'pro-Russia' mean concern about escalating conflict and another cold war? Is that even a partisan issue? </TEXT>
