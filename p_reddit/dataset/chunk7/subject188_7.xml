	<TEXT> I resisted medication for 3+ years out of a stubborn belief that I didn't want to just sugarcoat the problem with meds instead of addressing it and didn't want to create a "false" me if that makes sense.

I eventually did my own research and picked out my own medication. I refused to take an SSRI like many common antidepressants are because of the "false" me belief. I decide to try Bupropion (Wellbutrin) as an alternative and have been on that for about a year now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a complete amateur in the art of bearding, I am envious of those who have the choice at almost any week to sport dashing facial hair. So from one who only rocks the goatee on occasion, beard on my friends.

Dealing with it can be rough, but when it gets to its worst points I tend to isolate myself in my room for a few hours and just let everything out. I try to rationalize what is causing this particular experience (although often times I cannot pinpoint the cause) and address it.

I have a wonderful, supporting girlfriend who also helps me deal with everything regularly. She can't empathize with many of the feelings, but she supports me and to most people including myself that is enough.  </TEXT>
