	<TEXT> Professor here, I'm not sure where this is from but there would be some serious repercussions if this happened at my university. This is at best harassment and at worst assault depending on where you are. Not to mention how incredibly unprofessional this entire thing is.

Also, it's pretty gross to put someone's hair in your mouth like that. It gives me the willies just thinking about it.

Does anyone have a back story? </TEXT>

**Summary:**

Subterranean biodiversity in Europe is spectacularly rich, with the Western Balkans being home to about 400 cave species, representing the highest number of species per area worldwide [1] . Nonetheless, cave fishes, which are the most commonly found vertebrates in underground habitats [2] , have not been described from Europe so far [3] . Here, we report the first European record of a cave fish population, a loach of the genus Barbatula ( Figure 1 ), found in the DanubeAach system, an underground karst water system in Southern Germany [4] . The fish exhibit traits typically observed in organisms adapted to subterranean life including reduced eyes and pale body coloration [5] . The newly discovered population also represents globally the northernmost cave fish found so far. The geological history of the region implies that the DanubeAach system was colonized post-glacially. A recent origin of the cave fish is supported by genetic analyses, because the subterranean population shares COI gene haplotypes with adjacent surface stone loach (Barbatula barbatula) populations ( Figure 1 D). Nonetheless, population genetic analyses based on microsatellites indicated that cave fish are genetically isolated from populations in surface habitats ( Figure 1 E) and exhibit reduced genetic variability. Hence, the newly discovered European cave loaches do not represent individuals displaced from surface populations, but they follow a unique evolutionary trajectory towards cave life. </TEXT>

Horses' teeth take up more space in there heads thn their brains, as an [adult horses brain weights 22 oz](http://www.theequinest.com/random-horse-facts/) - about half that of a human.  

According to the [American Museum of Natural History](http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/horse/the-evolution-of-horses/) the earliest known horses evolved 55 million years ago and for much of this time, multiple horse species lived at the same time, often side by side.

	<TEXT> Ecologist pawing in. Trash pandas are adorable! Those hands are pretty freaky though.

Those creepy digits are very dextrous and while their thumbs are not opposable they do look quite humanlike as they have five digits. They are great graspers, can open jars, turn handles and lift lids with little issue.

Raccoons ([*Procyon lotor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon)) are members of family [*Procyonidae*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procyonidae) which they share with coatis, ringtails and several other beautiful animals but with harder to spell names on mobile. ;) [According to PBS](http://www.pbs.org/wnet/nature/raccoon-nation-raccoon-fact-sheet/7553/)  the English word raccoon is an adaptation of a native Powhatan word meaning animal that scratches with its hands.

Raccoons are nocturnal and frequent visitors to our trash cans and bird feeders. In the wild they'd normally travel several miles in one evening, but we've made things easier on them in urban and suburban areas.     

Raccoons are not super long lived in the wild, living to about 2 or 3 years, but they can live up to [13 years in captivity](http://wdfw.wa.gov/living/raccoons.html) or up to 20 depending on a few others websites. They are primarily solitary, but will come together if there is an abundance of food. 

If you're a raccoon fan check out Planet Earth II. They were featured in the urban environment episode. A female was teaching her cubs how to get along in people's yards. It was adorable!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are around 6,000 species in family [Nymphalidae](http://bugguide.net/node/view/192) and while many do feed on rotting fruit, animal carcasses, dung, mud and sap, not all do. Some still feed on nectar from flowers or a combination of food sources. Their diet is about as varied as their habitats and species! Some are brightly colored like [*Morpho didius*](https://www.butterfliesandthings.com/images/company_assets/1c9376c1-3b43-4475-b17c-9384f32f7ec8/product_catalog/Mor210-Morpho-didius-didius-5.JPG), some are well camouflaged like [*Kallima inachus*](http://www.learnaboutbutterflies.com/Kallima%20inachus%200451-001a.jpg), some are mimics, etc. You can't really generalize an entire family that is broken up into so many species.

 They are a remarkable family though. [Interestingly, sub-family Heliconiinae collect pollen in their proboscises and absorb its proteins.](http://www.toledo-bend.us/index.asp?bfly4_info) There's a lot of weird, neat stuff going on out there!

	<TEXT> The full and free journal article [*A new tyrannosaur with evidence for anagenesis and crocodile-like facial sensory system*](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44942).

**Abstract:**

A new species of tyrannosaurid from the upper Two Medicine Formation of Montana supports the presence of a Laramidian anagenetic (ancestor-descendant) lineage of Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids. In concert with other anagenetic lineages of dinosaurs from the same time and place, this suggests that anagenesis could have been a widespread mechanism generating species diversity amongst dinosaurs, and perhaps beyond. We studied the excellent fossil record of the tyrannosaurid to test that hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis places this new taxon as the sister species to Daspletosaurus torosus. However, given their close phylogenetic relationship, geographic proximity, and temporal succession, where D. torosus (~76.775.2Ma) precedes the younger new species (~75.174.4Ma), we argue that the two forms most likely represent a single anagenetic lineage. Daspletosaurus was an important apex predator in the late Campanian dinosaur faunas of Laramidia; its absence from later units indicates it was extinct before Tyrannosaurus rex dispersed into Laramidia from Asia. In addition to its evolutionary implications, the texture of the facial bones of the new taxon, and other derived tyrannosauroids, indicates a scaly integument with high tactile sensitivity. Most significantly, the lower jaw shows evidence for neurovasculature that is also seen in birds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Science Journal Article [*The role of infrequent and extraordinary deep dives in leatherback turtles \(Dermochelys coriacea\)*](http://jeb.biologists.org/content/211/16/2566).

Article summary for the busy:

Infrequent and exceptional behaviours can provide insight into the ecology and physiology of a particular species. Here we examined extraordinarily deep (3001250 m) and protracted (1h) dives made by critically endangered leatherback turtles (Dermochelys coriacea) in the context of three previously suggested hypotheses: predator evasion, thermoregulation and exploration for gelatinous prey. Data were obtained via satellite relay data loggers attached to adult turtles at nesting beaches (N=11) and temperate foraging grounds (N=2), constituting a combined tracking period of 9.6 years (N=26,146 dives) and spanning the entire North Atlantic Ocean. Of the dives, 99.6% (N=26,051) were to depths 300 m with only 0.4% (N=95) extending to greater depths (subsequently termed `deep dives'). Analysis suggested that deep dives: (1) were normally distributed around midday; (2) may exceed the inferred aerobic dive limit for the species; (3) displayed slow vertical descent rates and protracted durations; (4) were much deeper than the thermocline; and (5) occurred predominantly during transit, yet ceased once seasonal residence on foraging grounds began. These findings support the hypothesis that deep dives are periodically employed to survey the water column for diurnally descending gelatinous prey. If a suitable patch is encountered then the turtle may cease transit and remain within that area, waiting for prey to approach the surface at night. If unsuccessful, then migration may continue until a more suitable site is encountered. Additional studies using a meta-analytical approach are nonetheless recommended to further resolve this matter. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

**Summary**
Background   aims
Legumes, a low-energy, nutrient-dense and low glycemic index food, have shown beneficial effects on glycemic control and adiposity. As such, legumes are widely recommended in diabetic diets, even though there is little evidence that their consumption protects against type 2 diabetes. Therefore the aim of the present study was to examine the associations between consumption of total legumes and specific subtypes, and type 2 diabetes risk. We also investigated the effect of theoretically substituting legumes for other protein- or carbohydrate-rich foods.

**Methods**
Prospective assessment of 3349 participants in the PREvencin con DIeta MEDiterrnea (PREDIMED) study without type 2 diabetes at baseline. Dietary information was assessed at baseline and yearly during follow-up. We used Cox regression models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for type-2 diabetes incidence according to quartiles of cumulative average consumption of total legumes, lentils, chickpeas, dry beans and fresh peas.

**Results**
During a median follow-up of 4.3 years, 266 new cases of type 2 diabetes occurred. Individuals in the highest quartile of total legume and lentil consumption had a lower risk of diabetes than those in the lowest quartile (HR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.96; P-trend = 0.04; and HR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.460.98; P-trend = 0.05, respectively). A borderline significant association was also observed for chickpeas consumption (HR 0.68; 95% CI: 0.46, 1.00; P-trend = 0.06). Substitutions of half a serving/day of legumes for similar servings of eggs, bread, rice or baked potato was associated with lower risk of diabetes incidence.

**Conclusions**
A frequent consumption of legumes, particularly lentils, in the context of a Mediterranean diet, may provide benefits on type 2 diabetes prevention in older adults at high cardiovascular risk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For anyone interested, here is the full and free journal article [*A new tyrannosaur with evidence for anagenesis and crocodile-like facial sensory system*](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44942).

**Abstract:**

A new species of tyrannosaurid from the upper Two Medicine Formation of Montana supports the presence of a Laramidian anagenetic (ancestor-descendant) lineage of Late Cretaceous tyrannosaurids. In concert with other anagenetic lineages of dinosaurs from the same time and place, this suggests that anagenesis could have been a widespread mechanism generating species diversity amongst dinosaurs, and perhaps beyond. We studied the excellent fossil record of the tyrannosaurid to test that hypothesis. Phylogenetic analysis places this new taxon as the sister species to Daspletosaurus torosus. However, given their close phylogenetic relationship, geographic proximity, and temporal succession, where D. torosus (~76.775.2Ma) precedes the younger new species (~75.174.4Ma), we argue that the two forms most likely represent a single anagenetic lineage. Daspletosaurus was an important apex predator in the late Campanian dinosaur faunas of Laramidia; its absence from later units indicates it was extinct before Tyrannosaurus rex dispersed into Laramidia from Asia. In addition to its evolutionary implications, the texture of the facial bones of the new taxon, and other derived tyrannosauroids, indicates a scaly integument with high tactile sensitivity. Most significantly, the lower jaw shows evidence for neurovasculature that is also seen in birds. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

We analyze a radius bone fragment of a raven (Corvus corax) from Zaskalnaya VI rock shelter, Crimea. The object bears seven notches and comes from an archaeological level attributed to a Micoquian industry dated to between 38 and 43 cal kyr BP. Our study aims to examine the degree of regularity and intentionality of this set of notches through their technological and morphometric analysis, complemented by comparative experimental work. Microscopic analysis of the notches indicate that they were produced by the to-and-fro movement of a lithic cutting edge and that two notches were added to fill in the gap left between previously cut notches, probably to increase the visual consistency of the pattern. Multivariate analysis of morphometric data recorded on the archaeological notches and sets of notches cut by nine modern experimenters on radii of domestic turkeys shows that the variations recorded on the Zaskalnaya set are comparable to experimental sets made with the aim of producing similar, parallel, equidistant notches. Identification of the Weber Fraction, the constant that accounts for error in human perception, for equidistant notches cut on bone rods and its application to the Zaskalnaya set of notches and thirty-six sets of notches incised on seventeen Upper Palaeolithic bone objects from seven sites indicate that the Zaskalnaya set falls within the range of variation of regularly spaced experimental and Upper Palaeolithic sets of notches. This suggests that even if the production of the notches may have had a utilitarian reason the notches were made with the goal of producing a visually consistent pattern. This object represents the first instance of a bird bone from a Neanderthal site bearing modifications that cannot be explained as the result of butchery activities and for which a symbolic argument can be built on direct rather than circumstantial evidence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After checking several news sites it looks real. Poor guy. It's also very plausible given the size of the largest python species in Indonesia which I believe is the reticulated python (*Python reticulatus*). The news articles claim the python who ate the man was around 25ft though, which seems to be a few feet longer than what Wikipedia says is the Guinness Book record. This is probably just due to exaggeration.  </TEXT>

The difference here is tens of thousands of years ago when the herpes virus was coming together as we know it now humans a. were very different than we are now culturally, b. very likely did not keep other primates as pets and c. were in competition with other apes for resources. I can't imagine trying to have sex (for many reasons) with a wild ape of any kind. Their strength is so much greater than ours it would be incredibly dangerous.  

Really the likelihood of this being sexually transmitted is immensely unlikely. </TEXT>

](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap170328.html)
This rock structure is not only surreal -- it's real. The reason it's not more famous is that it is, perhaps, smaller than one might guess: the capstone rock overhangs only a few meters. Even so, the King of Wings outcrop, located in New Mexico, USA, is a fascinating example of an unusual type of rock structure called a hoodoo. Hoodoos may form when a layer of hard rock overlays a layer of eroding softer rock. Figuring out the details of incorporating this hoodoo into a night-sky photoshoot took over a year. Besides waiting for a suitably picturesque night behind a sky with few clouds, the foreground had to be artificially lit just right relative to the natural glow of the background. After much planning and waiting, the final shot, featured here, was taken in May 2016. Mimicking the horizontal bar, the background sky features the band of our Milky Way Galaxy stretching overhead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist slithering in! Usually I'm more of an insect or bird commenter, but I have a lot of respect and love for our reptile friends as well. I owned quite a few snake species and enjoyed catching them when I was a young girl.

It's always cobras and they are always in the most inconvenient of places! Living in the Northeastern United States the worst I deal with are [Copperheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_contortrix), very rarely [Water Moccasins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus) depending on where I am or maybe if I'm lucky to see one, a Timber rattlesnake.

I can't imagine what it's like dealing with cobras all the time and because of the rat population in local towns how easy it is to find them in common places. Cobras are also [religiously worshiped or revered](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N%C4%81ga) in parts of India by Hindus, Buddhists and Jains, so that would also aid in their more robust urban population. Luckily for this overheated guy or gal they've got some friends here!

[King Cobras](http://indialookup.in/king-cobra/) (*Ophiophagus hannah*) can get up to a length of about 18 feet! They're beautiful, but I'm not sure I'd really want to handle one. King cobras are incredibly helpful animals as they mainly prey upon other cobras and are generally not super aggressive towards humans.

According to WalkthroughIndia.com [20,000 people in India die](http://www.walkthroughindia.com/wildlife/the-6-most-venomous-snakes-in-india/) due to venomous snake bites each year. It's a difficult number to digest, but remember as of 2016 India had a population of [well over 1 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India).

The Indian Subcontinent is so plagued by snake bite fatalities they have [*The Big Four*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(Indian_snakes\)) who cause the most snake bite cases each year. 

* [Indian cobra, *Naja naja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cobra)
* [Common krait, *Bungarus caeruleus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_krait)
* [Russell's viper, *Daboia russeliil*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_viper)
* [Saw-scaled viper, *Echis carinatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echis_carinatus)

If bites weren't enough, there are also [spitting cobras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitting_cobra)! So no worries if you're out of range of a strike you could always get venom sent directly to your eyes. These are some cobras of the genus [*Naja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naja) which have fangs that have a rifled opening which allows the venom to propel or spray from the fangs instead of the usual injection. Some species "spit" their venom as far as 6.6 ft (2 m).

I am making a note here because I see this confusion a lot: venomous animals inject venom and poisonous animals need to be ingested (or skin contact for some species) to do harm.

If venomous is not your thing they also have nearly 10 foot long [Indian Pythons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_molurus) (*Python molurus*). Again due to their rat problems this would not be too uncommon to find hiding under someone's home.

I love snakes, they get kind of a bad rep, but honestly they are just trying to live their lives like the rest of us. We just make it either a little harder or a little easier depending on the circumstances.       

If you love science you might enjoy /r/Sciencefacts which is sort of a TIL for science only. :) I'll have to add some snake facts after seeing all of this love!           

I also post nature photos on Instagram and Twitter from @fillsyourniche with facts relating to the organism if you're into that sort of thing. With Spring here should be a lot of new photos soon!              

Edit - A few users have mentioned King Cobras' signature growl! Awesome work, team. [Here is a video to listen to.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7uubQH-Hzc)   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist slithering in!

It's always cobras and they are always in the most inconvenient of places! Living in the Northeastern United States the worst I deal with are [Copperheads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_contortrix) or [Water Moccasins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agkistrodon_piscivorus) or maybe if I'm lucky to see one, an [Eastern Diamondback rattlesnake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_diamondback_rattlesnake).

This video looks like India or near India given the cobra and the amount of videos I've watched with cobras in India (it's a lot, guys they are very common). I can't imagine what it's like dealing with cobras all the time and because of the rat population in local towns how easy it is to find them in common places. Someone else mentioned cobras are also religiously worshipped in parts of India so that would also aid in their more robust urban population.

I want to say this guy handled the cobra (from what I can see in the video) in a very chill and humane way. I'm sure dealing with them on a somewhat regular basis is difficult. I am assuming he had a bag ready to drop it in. Snakes are fairly easy to handle once placed in a dark, quiet bag.

If we're looking at India here, they have several species of cobra, one an 18 foot [Giant King Cobras](http://indialookup.in/king-cobra/) (*Ophiophagus hannah*) that are very venomous! They're beautiful, but manage to find their way into every nook and cranny.

According to WalkthroughIndia.com [20,000 people in India die](http://www.walkthroughindia.com/wildlife/the-6-most-venomous-snakes-in-india/) due to venomous snake bites each year. It's a difficult number to digest, but remember as of 2016 India had a population of [well over 1 billion people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_India).

The Indian Subcontinent is so plagued by snake bite fatalities they have [*The Big Four*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(Indian_snakes\)) who cause the most snake bite cases each year. 

* [Indian cobra,*Naja naja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_cobra)
* [Common krait,*Bungarus caeruleus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_krait)
* [Russell's viper,*Daboia russeliil*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell%27s_viper)
* [Saw-scaled viper,*Echis carinatus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echis_carinatus)

If bites weren't enough, there are also spitting cobras! So no worries if you're out of range of a strike you could always get venom sent directly to your eyes. These are some cobras of the genus [*Naja*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naja) which have fangs that have a rifled opening which allows the venom to propel or spray from the fangs instead of the usual injection.

I am making a note here because I see this confusion a lot: venomous animals inject venom and poisonous animals need to be ingested to do harm.

If venomous is not your thing they also have nearly 10 foot long [Indian Pythons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_molurus) (*Python molurus*). Again due to their rat problems this would not be too uncommon to find hiding under someone's home.

I love snakes, they get kind of a bad rep, but honestly they are just trying to live their lives like the rest of us. We just make it either a little harder or a little easier depending on the circumstances.                              </TEXT>
