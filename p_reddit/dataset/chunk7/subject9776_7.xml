	<TEXT> Puntology is the study of punting, its many forms and their effect on different materials. You might think that punting stuff is very straightforward, but there's some serious fucking physics involved.

And no, as opposed to what some smartasses might say, puntology is NOT the study of a certain italian-produced compact car. (unless you punt it) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's talking about a real gun. Operating a striker mechanism to fire actual rounds using electric power doesn't sound impossible, but insanely impractical and very unreliable, given the complexity of the mechanism that would also have to handle the recoil forces. Even if someone were to make the mechanism reliable enough to function for any prolonged amount of time, one would still have to lug additional batteries around to power it.

Unless of course the only thing the electric motor does is [spinning one part and the rest of the process is purely mechanical.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minigun) Then the battery isn't an issue because your shit is too big to carry around anyway so you have access to vehicle power. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: You DON'T need to "Share to community" when uploading pictures to imgur. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-20 00:49:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This appears to be a common misconception that leads to people wondering why are they getting stupid comments from people not familiar with this somewhat niche game. 

The "Share to community" button (previosuly it was a checkbox saying "Share to imgur") makes the submission appear in the usersub section of imgur (user submitted images), visible to anyone currently browsing. This is where cancer happens.

You don't need to share to be able to link pictures to people. They simply won't pop up anywhere public. So do yourself a favor and don't do that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like /u/ProrokC2 said. It's not a direct translation, fortunately - because a direct word-to-word translation would sound incredibly stupid. Polish words are very flexible and by adding suffixes or prefixes of some sort their meanings can change entirely or sound more badass or soft. An example using images:

[Wieprz](https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/z/wieprz-samiec-16573976.jpg) - [Wieprzu](http://static5.depositphotos.com/1008785/506/i/950/depositphotos_5060408-stock-photo-big-vietnamese-pot-bellied-pig.jpg) - [Wiepsio](https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/a0867efb-9b7f-4796-92f0-11f3bf0eb904/98cfc6b9-adf5-4ae9-aab0-cac460deb3fd.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think everyone has a great bike-related story from when they were a kid. I remember that one time we were riding around with a bunch of friends and we were arriving at our destination. Guy pulls up, does a slide. Second guy pulls up, slide. Third guy, slide. I'm fourth. The slide was sick until the moment I decided to use the forward brake when I was still going. Some weird physics happened and I literally ended up with my head through the frame as if it was a damn cartoon. Everyone laughed, including me. </TEXT>
