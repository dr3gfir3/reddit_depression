	<TEXT> A direct swap of 18C's "offend, insult" for the ICCPR Article 20 wording would be pretty uncontroversial I'd think, it being

Any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence shall be prohibited by law. 

...except of course I can't see that flying with the Coalition far right, particularly with religious in there. </TEXT>

With this government though I'm still half expecting a gutting of the reasonable victim test and Brandis being given individual and personal discretion on cases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Possibly.  If the budget crashes as badly as it appears it will, Turnbull will likely be looking at another September spill.

Turnbull or not however, going to the next election with this unresolved could tun a bad loss into a rout, particularly in more moderate seats.

Doubly so if Turnbull does actually get replaced by someone like Dutton running a policy of opposition rather than delay. </TEXT>

There's much in the dossier which, if proven, would bring down the president.  Most of it however would operate on timelines of weeks to months as things were drawn out and discussed before a final impeachment.

Were that tape to drop into the media's lap on a Monday morning however, they'd be talking about Trump's resignation on Tuesday morning.  It would turn the man into a global laughing stock. </TEXT>

The societal benefit brings with it economic benefits as well.  At a base level it impacts the ageing curve of our population as whole but there's also impacts on health and fitness, child development and education outcomes directly linked to additional time on through to things like impacts on immigration policy and, at an elite level at least, emigration issues to more accomodating economies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of what they call 'inequality' is just making different choices. If i stopped going to work for a year, i wouldn't expect to have a similarly prestigious position.

The thing is we *want* people to feel free to make that choice, male and female, both in terms of short term earnings and long term career objectives.

The economic and social consequences of people choosing otherwise come at very significant costs.

At present we're a long way from that point for either gender and women are disproportionately impacted due to both social biases on a woman's role in childrearing and the raw biology of the whole process.

It needs addressing from a utilitarian standpoint, let alone any other. </TEXT>

Whilst this is absolutely true for certain industries, it doesn't come close to holding for society as a whole.

Until such time as work, education, social events etc. are all available on a flexible and *freely alignable* 5 of 7 day schedule working weekends will always come at a cost to the worker (financial and/or social) compared to someone performing the same job Monday through Friday.  It warrants penalties. </TEXT>

The expression coming directly in Article 31(1), covers the situation of a person who enters the country in which asylum is sought directly from the country of origin, or from another country where his protection, safety and security could not be assured. **It is understood that this term also covers a person who transits an intermediate country for a short period of time without having applied for, or received, asylum there.

	<TEXT> A small but significant snippet from estimates.

Triggs reveals that the AHRC gave Bill Leak two opportunities to assert that he had drawn the cartoon in good faith.

Had he responded by making that point, [the commission] would almost certainly have ended that matter precisely at that moment.

Edit:  The Guardian now have a more detailed article up [here](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2017/feb/28/bill-leak-could-have-ended-18c-complaint-earlier-says-gillian-triggs) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2.5.0 seems to have mostly solved the issues of the app popping up unrequested when browsing around reddit in Safari which is fantastic.

What's not so fantastic is that when hitting the back button from another site and ending up back at reddit it *always* opens the app regardless of your preferences elsewhere.

Can this please be addressed?  It's the last annoyance with that functionality but it's extremely frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What exactly does this entail? What protections are you referring to?

We have no legal structure for handling asylum seeker and refugee hosting and because of the state of the existing adversarial system they've become almost unthinkable to establish.

Temporary protections are used with regularity globally.  Here, TPVs are actively deployed as a *punitive* measure.  And accurately so described given the mental health issues and suicides to which they've led.

That should never be the case.

If the influx is so huge then soon it will be much more expensive than offshore and then we still don't have a humane answer to processing boats that come after our services simply can't handle anymore.

Were any influx to actually get unmanageable we have a global network of resources to fall back on in the UNHCR.  We've also got numerous options to mitigate and distribute movements through regional cooperation though we've damaged that ability of late through our own actions.

Rudd had in his PNG agreement a means to kickstart proper regional processing again and Howard was actively pursuing it through the Bali Process.  Regardless of recent damage, with the kind of money we're so obviously happy to outlay it would not be hard to bootstrap actual regional protections again in collaboration with the UNHCR and, eventually, our neighbours assuming a domestic leadership style more congenial than Abbott's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The alternative is a return to the kind of regional network that existed prior to the early 90s and our system stripped of its adversarial bullshit so as to allow actual protections for those not permanently resettled here.  Both part of the Greens platform as well as objectives of formal groups within Labor and informal ones within the Liberals.

Would we need to beef up services and fund overseas programs?  Absolutely.  But we've shown ourselves more than willing to throw huge sums of money at this issue and there's far more efficient ways of using it to assist than we have found in using it to abuse. </TEXT>

Both major parties had, and continue to have, groups within them fervently opposed to these policies *and* we have parties and independents who are absolutely opposed.

Neither the public as a group nor the voter as an individual gets to excuse their involvement here.  If you're keeping quiet, if you're voting for policy platforms that support this, if you're failing to involve yourself in shaping those platforms *you are responsible for what is done in your name.*

But there's nothing to stop public involvement, and nothing to stop public involvement ending these policies in quite short order.  That they continue is representative of the calibre of the electorate. </TEXT>
