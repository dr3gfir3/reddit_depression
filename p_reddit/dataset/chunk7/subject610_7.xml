	<TEXT> The old Reddit go-to when they have no argument. "Why are you mad" or "You seem upset". Just so you know, that will never work. 

 and are using straw man arguments.  

Demonstrate where. Funny, you just had the opportunity to do that and you did not. I quoted what you said and responded to it.  

We clearly disagree, and neither of us are going to change our minds.  

I am happy to. You have offered nothing. You initially didn't address my points. Then you suggested that I was upset for responding, and now you are telling me you wont change your mind while insisting I share the same opinion. Are these the actions of someone who is on the right side of the issue with the superior stance? Nope. 

I'm gonna break it off here since you don't seem like you can discuss without cursing and acting childish  

Now you don't offer any counter argument because I used a swear word. Was it "bullshit"? I really wish this was farther up so you could be exposed for your ...brace yourself, bullshit. You got nothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Sorry, but that's just wrong.

That? I didn't say one thing, I was actually addressing points from another person. What that? I said multiple things.

People can know the information but not remember it or not recall it in time due to stress.  

I didn't argue that. They really don't know it then. That is that. People wont forget their phone number under stress, you dont' forget your name, you don't forget your address. You don't forget things you invest time in. Sad to say, most of the people who spend sickening amounts of hours playing video games could ramble off specifics about it because they spend hours on it. They can do this under stress too. Stress causes people to forget things on the cusp of their memory. Game shows is a horrible analogy. If there were a game show on a topic where people can prepare and study before hand, it wouldn't be any fun. You can prepare enough to overcome the stress. 

Just because in your experience your grades are tied to your efforts, doesn't make that true for other people.  

I didn't make that claim, I just shared my experience. You have no argument so you have to suggest that. People don't invest the time in things they have to do. Because stress has some effect, people throw the baby out with the bathwater and say "well I am not a good test taker". Bullshit. If stress effects you in a test, you may have to study harder. There is a point you pass where stress will not compromise your memory or comprehension.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Test anxiety is a real thing.

I didn't' say it wasn't. 

Some people can know the information, but get caught up in the stress and formality of the test and can't get through it.  

They really didn't know the information. They barely knew the information. 

It isn't about effort for some people.   

Yes it is. Some may need more effort than others. Cry me a river.  

You don't rise to the level of your expectations, you fall to the level of your training.

	<TEXT> I have said that in the past about myself.  But the fact is, if I put the work in, and know the information, I not only know the answers, I fly through them. I think this argument is total bullshit. Source: I used it. 

Edit: I am not making the argument that stress does not effect memory. Most people get stressed because they are not prepared. I am saying it only effects the information on the cusp of memorization due to lack of effort. There is a point where stress wont be able to stop you from remembering. No test would stress you out to the point where you cannot remember your name, address, or phone number. For the lunatics that spend a sickening amount of hours on video games, there are things about that game you will absolutely never forget. Why? You spent hours on it. People use "I am a bad test taker" as an excuse for not putting in the effort. When you know your shit, and know it well, guess what you get less of? Stress.  </TEXT>

Your candidate sucked, nobody liked her. YOU DON'T COME TO THE POLLS. Let me say that one again, YOU DON'T COME TO THE POLLS YOU STUPID MOTHERFUCKERS. You either took on toxic ideologies of safe spaces, deplatforming, slander, hysterics, and calling people racists (who were clearly not) or you didn't denounce them enough. Nobody wants to be associated with you, including me. I am still left, but I am not with you. The rest of you were so compelled with the tantrum of not getting what you wanted, i.e. Bernie, you didn't vote. 

The popular vote is a non-issue. Look at Trump, seriously take a good look. If he didn't lose to a landslide, YOUR PARTY fucked up to astronomical levels. Do they admit it? Nope. They double down.

	<TEXT>  Hate crimes influence sentencing, not verdict

I am no expert but I am pretty sure you are wrong and I have to go soon. Hate crimes are smuggling thoughts into sentencing and charging. Sentencing should be judged on the charge. If you beat someone up because of their race, your sentencing is based on the severity of the beating, premeditation, and a judge of weather you meant it or not, intent. If you are guilty, and you meant it, the charge is assault. Being charged with an unprovoked beating is the crime. All reasons, given it is unprovoked are ALL wrong and the measurement of them is nonsense. 


we wouldn't distinguish between types of murder either.  

Types of murder are distinguished on intent. Look them up. 

I will let you have the last word.  I have to go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This refutes nothing. I thought I said it to you. Intent is only for proving guilt or innocence of the assault. That is why there are degrees of murder. 1st degree is premeditated. If it was premeditated because you hate brown skin, blue eyes, or people who live on streets that go east and west, it doesn't matter. You are proving intent, the intent is all that needs to be proven. Second is another classification of intent. 

Your post has nothing to do with what I said. You got the last word. I don't have time for this. Enjoy.  </TEXT>

Yes. He should be charged with assault, that is what he did. If he did it for his race, revenge, rage, sexual preference, debt, or whatever, it is assault. It is illegal. You just want to suggest I am not concerned about racism because you are left with your dick in your hands to defend something as nonsensical as a "hate crime".

What a bunch of condescending bullshit. It is illegal in 49 states for a reason. People don't do it at safe speeds. Even after checking my mirror, they can approach at speeds faster than a check can keep it safe. The angle is not always able to see many cars back. Changing lanes is not safe with motorcycles going between cars. They simply  don't go slowly. 

The traffic case he is making is absolutely unnoticeable in any significant traffic and is smoke and mirrors.  I am so done with motorcyclists suggesting "you just don't get it". It's not complicated . YOU JUST DON'T LIKE SITTING IN TRAFFIC. Neither do we, that is why we bought a fucking car. Suck it up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The racism problem in America. It's annoying to keep saying, no I am not saying that it doesn't exist, but I am saying we have made continuing progress and are in the least racially divisive times we ever lived in. Don't let SJW's fool you, come here, walk around, we are a melting pot that is on the right track.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember when America was? Jesus Christ SJW's view progress as something to be ignored and lied about. One would think the path to unity is to not, you know, divide. Acknowledge progress, celebrate it, encourage it, and move forward. But hey, demonizing harmless people who have no ill intent and calling people racists who are not is also a way to go.  </TEXT>

Are you confusing objecting to the name? Is that how it works? Recently I reported someone (not you) because I have been banned for nonsense. I broke no rule and I can happily debate any of them if there were any use in it. I fucked up, I reported them because I was not mad at them, but mad that I was banned and missed me mark on my principles. Lesson learned. 

Did say "SJW" or did I use the term. Were they being an SJW? Is that even a derogatory term lol. Not that I am against insults, because sometimes the honest adjectives to describe your actions are not flattering, for me included. 
 
A library full of shit and the best you got is that I called someone an SJW? I gotta say, I love the internet. You are insanely misguided. Alt-right? That is the new way to refute an argument? I am liberal, argue for liberal principles, always have, always will. The left is irredeemable, they are not liberal anymore.

	<TEXT>  Why does it seem like everyone under 21 has social anxiety?

Many people in their 20's too. Do you see that? I think many factors, but the main one is that the "Everybody gets a trophy" generation is all grown up. Our brains evolved to survive stress in an uncivilized society and in modern day life, it often misfires to things that are not threats. It would do this thousands of years ago but it can adjust for these things by a series of stresses and recoveries. You have to be introduced into some stress, respond with a stress response, and then see everything is OK. The next time your brain responds will less of an emergency response and that effect continues. 

Stress is only bad without the recovery. Children that are in unsafe environments that have no relief from the trauma because it is either constant or numerous are the ones who suffer from physical and psychological problems. 

The adults that raised the kids plagued with anxiety sheltered them. They robbed them of any opportunity to feel uncomfortable and acquire any of the skills they need to function in society. You have kids who are in their mid 20's having anxiety attacks opening up a bank account or having to make a phone call. 

We can blame the parents, that is fine, but once we recognize the problem, society doesn't change, they do.  It wont be easy because they are in an adult world with no adult skills and the solution is to not Nerf the world. If you do, you just keep them deprived of skills that were taken away from them and the rest of society suffers. We cannot enable. Make them do things, they will be fine.  </TEXT>

The bottom line is, the overwhelming majority of people support them, there is public outrage, it looks like the single individual was fired, and society is on their side. This is a story of triumph. 

SJW's will use this as a soundboard to propagate their ignorant false narrative instead of unifying with the reality of our society, we overwhelmingly support the gay community. This is poison to the SJW because their entire identities strive on outrage and a society plagued by bigotry and injustice. 

You are on the wrong side of history. We are better than you make us out to be. We are better than you need us to be to stay relevant. If you tried acting rationally and, oh I don't know, fucking voting, we wouldn't have Trump as a president.

Again, with the literally shit? You don't use it to clarify mistaken hyperbole nor do you use it as the now accepted figurative use, you just use it to seem more profound.

Then people will be up in arms that nothing was done. Do you know how many fucking civilians are killed when troops are sent in. It's war motherfuckers.  You have people trying to kill as few innocents as possible to a faction that advocates for killing the most innocent people as possible and they suggest that the US are the worst terrorists in the world. Put down Noam Chomsky and think for yourselves. To be rational and discuss a single issue does not make you a Trump supporter or a Republican.  

TLDR: Use drones? Murder. Troops? Murderer. Do nothing? You let the innocent die. People love outrage like it's crack.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Every single person who espouses some version of white nationalism necessarily has to endorse some form of ethnic cleansing.

That is a blind assertion to further demonize something that is already repugnant. You are creating sympathy by lying. 

This is because if you want a homogeneous ethno-state in a multi-ethnic society, it necessarily requires the cleansing of minority ethnicity in order to attain the ethnic homogeneity that you want.  

He argues otherwise. He is only significant because of people like you. You again, are blindly asserting this. Stop what you are doing and be fucking honest about what he does. You are only helping him by lying. How the fuck can people like you not see this. Was getting Trump elected not enough? You are all so self righteous there is no tragedy of outcome where you can honestly self examine your behavior.  </TEXT>

When hysteric reactionary children didn't google the word "nationalism" and apologetically calls people with nationalistic tendencies Nazi's, racists, bigots, and any other of their go-to list of babble.  

The other group of people, which are not identical but do overlap, are the Noam Chomsky readers who love to argue that America is some sort of evil empire who intentionally kill innocent people. These people don't think for themselves, they think what they are told.  

Lying about reality because you disagree with something causes your opposition to double down and match your irrationality with theirs. Now, if you just show support for your country, call out a mistruth about the "enemy", disagree on 1% of anything, you are called a Trump supporter or a Republican. That is how far the termites have spread.   </TEXT>

The dude is a white nationalist. Get real.  

Bingo! The only honest thing you said!! That is a fucking horrible thing to be! Congratulations. Go with that, take your new found honesty and run with it. 

Come on. Get real. Are you really trying to convince us that Richard Spencer is a boy scout?  

This is what everyone does when their dishonesty about bad people is exposed. Tell me I am doing something that I am not, or suggest I think something I don't. I am just telling you the importance of being honest about bad people.  That is where we are at? Gandhi? This is your counter argument for my advocacy of honesty for dangerous people. Fantastic.

That wasn't the arbitrariness I was referring to. I think you know that too. 

in a country and industry with a long history of racism.   

All history does. This industry is one of the most liberal and politically correct on the planet. 

That's like saying no one should have mentioned Obama was the first black president.  

No, no it is 100% nothing like that. The presidency is not an arbitrary classification. It is different in substance, accomplishment, power, institution, national (not industrial) acceptance, and a national conversation going on since the Civil Right Movement on when we will break free and allow the most powerful man in the world to be elected as a black men. Not a writer-directer to cross some made up glass ceiling. You are so full of shit, it is only forgivable if you are 12.

	<TEXT> Your lie aside, it is still ignorant babble. I don't believe you just from the way you said it alone. You are full of shit, but let's pretend. I didn't' deny the use of drones. You joined the armed forces most likely during a time of war of the most powerful country in the world.  Do you feel any more guilty than troops on the ground? Any more guilty than people in actual planes? He didn't indiscriminately kill innocent people just to see them die. If you are in fact who you say you are, you don't need this explained to you. God I hate the internet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The outrageous nonsense I have been banned for is unreal. You can get a temporary ban, but if you respectfully disagree, they ban you for good. If you don't say you are sorry, they ban you for good. They are children who think they can police people's opinions. It doesn't extend past this website and when they have to exist in the real world they are miserable and lonely with zero influence socially or intellectually. You can demolish them point by point but in the end they have the power and you are gone. A big up vote from me!  </TEXT>
