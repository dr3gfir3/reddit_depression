	<TEXT> PS, bring on the down votes.  I do not care.  Having gun pointed at you while simply driving home from work by a kid in the middle of the street and having your house broken into while you are present, even when all of the doors and windows were locked isn't 'typical city life'.  I should also mention another friend of mine lives near the eastern corner of the park and has hidden cams all over his house and the outside. One day he caught a group  of about 10-16 kids with his security cameras swarming upon a guy walking by himself not even drunk or on the phone or anything and they all beat the snot out of him for no reason at all.  Go walk by the school near Life of Reilly's during the spring and summer and see how much broken glass you see in the streets from all of the cars broken into in that area.  Definitely a high crime area and if you don't want to take my word for it go look at the crime heat map for that area. It IS bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're in investment........ Monoclonal antibodies are a major, major price of the pie for pharma, worth billions.  Do you know why CHO cells are used to ma ufacture some of the biggest selling drugs currently in the market?  Because they produce humanized forms of sugars I the antibodies!  If you change or remove even one sugar on a biologic like say a monoclonal therapy you can drastically alter the halflife of an a antibody therapy by many hours or even days.  Even its efficacy too.  Think about where all cancer therapies are headed - towards an immune based modality.  Sugars absolutely play a full ndamental role  in regualting the immune system, for instance a new target supposedly worth billions of dollars targets the PD1-PD-L1 interaction.  And guess where PD-L1 is?  In the surface of cells, meaning sugars absolutely regulate its physiology.  In fact, the amount of PDL1 found on cancer is regulated by how sugar coated it is (see my post history for a paper I posted related to this the other day).  Also, here's a blurb (fwiw)about the economic growth that's expected withing the glycomics field:
http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/glycobiology-global-markets-for-diagnostics-and-therapeutics-300336986.html

The more pharma moves towards bilogics the more they'll have to recognize that sugars are crictically important for their proteins to work correctly.  Additionally, now is also to the time to jump aboard any future technology for high throughput glycomics that will potentially be developed. Imagine owning the patent or investing in a company that invented DNA sequencing or PCR.  That kind of break through hasn't happened yet for glycomics, but maybe it will in the future, and such a technology could easily be worth billions.

	<TEXT> I don't think so, but I'm also not an evolutionary biologist.  One of the things that makes you absolutely and uniquely human are the types of sugars and sugar patterns that are found on all of your cells.  The sugar patterns and types of monosaccharides found in almost all types of bacteria are completely alien looking.  Humans do not use many of the types of sugars found in bacteria - and that's why the LPS structures on bacteria are what make you sick during an infection.  Bacteria predate multi-cellular organisms by many years and use many completely 'weird and strange' monosaccharides when compared to a human.  Same thing for archaea, fungi, etc.....each different type of organism has uniquely different patterns of sugars  

The types of sugars used and combinations have evolved over time.  For example, one sugar that makes you quite human versus the rest of the mammals is the fact that almost all other mammals besides humans utilize a type of sugar called Neu5Gc.  It is basically a hydroxylated form of a sugar called sialic acid (my user name).  An enzyme called CMAH adds a -OH group to sialic acid to produce Neu5Gc.  Millions of years ago our ancestors developed a mutation in CMAH that made it inactive, and theory goes this was a significant event for developing the human brain.  Long story short, sialic acids sugars are heavily found in the brain and are involved in tons of neurophysiology.  Polymers of sialic acids are found at the ends of neurons where they regulate how neurons remodel themselves -i.e. sialic acids are basically involved in memory, learning, and brain development.  The theory goes that the fact that we lost the ability to produce Neu5Gc meant that our brains started to incorporate only unhydroxylated sialic acids (which again is only a uniquely human trait, even among almost all types of mammals).  This altered the molecular composition of those sialic acid polymers at the ends of neurons, leading to the way our brains have developed to today.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carbohydrates are now being realized as the '3rd' language of life after proteins and DNA.  In fact, nature couldn't have chosen a better molecule than a carbohydrate to encode information.  The entire set of  sugar biology has been called one of the most complex entities that exist in all of nature.  Consider this:  

DNA only encodes for a sequence of amino acids.  2 amino acids by their very chemistry can only be linked together in 1 way--a peptide bond.  Take two carbohydrates, however, and how many ways can you connect them together?  You'll have 5 choices of -OH groups on one sugar in order to connect it to another sugar.  On top of that, sugars can have alpha vs beta configurations, meaning just two sugars can be connected in about an order of magnitude more complexity when compared to just two amino acids. Move up to 3 different amino acids that are encoded by DNA and you can only get 6 different combinations; 3 different monosaccharides and already you can produce 1,056 to 27,648 unique trisaccharides.  In fact, if you use just 6 sugars you already have over 1,000,000,000,000 different possibilities -  contrast that complexity to the genetic code and amino acids (which might only have about on the order of a few hundred thousand to a million different possible number of combinations).  Often times nature will use combinations of about 6-15  monosaccharides to attach to proteins AND attach these on *multiple* spots on a single protein--thus the number of truly distinct molecular forms of proteins potentially could be mind melting when you consider the number of possible combinations of sugars that can get added to them.  The way these linkages occur absolutely matter for life and I always give my students an easy example that they've already probably learned in high school -- for example, take a polymer of glucose molecules.  If you link them in one fashion you get cellulose--something you can't digest--or put them together another way and you get starch--glucose you CAN digest.  Nature absolutely recognizes and is very sensitive to the different and sometimes subtly different ways sugars are connected on proteins.  These differences can often have major consequences for biology, such as producing cancer that's very aggressive vs. cancers with better overall prognoses.  

The worst part about this fascinating field, however, is that there simply is NO known code that rules how sugars get added to proteins in order to fine tune how life processes function.  I mean we know nature isn't adding sugars to together randomly because we can detect very unique patterns, but to this day no one is able to predict when, where, what type, and why some sugars show up when they do.  Basically what we have here is another hidden layer of massive complexity on top of 'classical' biology (which is ruled by DNA and proteins) that was basically completely ignored by scientists until about the turn of the 20th century.  For the longest time back in the 20th century when people wanted to study a protein they'd chop off all of their sugars in order to make studying it easier. Oppps, turns out those sugars are quite important, and in some examples we have, the sugars are more important than the underlying proteins themselves!   Worse yet, there are other classes of molecules such as LIPIDS that are also coated with sugars that are extremely important in biology and both lipids and sugars are produced by processes which have no known codes like there are for protein.   Essentially what you have here is a revolution in biology that's akin to the quantum world that revolutionized physics.  DNA and protein would be like classical physics while sugar biology and understanding how it regulates like would be like quantum physics because of its non-template driven nature. Our tools for studying the 'sugar code' are still completely terrible and crude, we simply do not have the techniques available yet like we do for DNA where we can sequence the entire genetic code.  Doing sugar biology and trying to crack the sugar code is like doing deep space exploration in biology.

	<TEXT> Mixed feelings on this one.  One of the biggest reasons for transferring those programs is actually to get MORE white kids at those primarily black schools.  If they could guarantee that the quality and degree would be the same, then what's the big deal, espcially if those programs really were started at UMBC, UMD, .etc. under dubious circumstances.  Graduating with a degree in electrical engineering creates more wealthy graduates who go on to get better jobs who'll subsequently donate more money to what was previously an underfunded university that was primarily black.  

I highly doubt 100 programs will get transferred like what the lawyer wants.  They're probably just throwing a ridiculous number out there in order to get the most amount that they can to stick.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> South Dakota.  

Basically the 1978 ruling allowed banks to export the laws of where they were headquartered across state lines.  If you lived in CA and CA had usury laws putting a max on the amount of APR that could be charged for a credit card at 8% then all the banks had to do now was move to South Dakota, where thanks to Bill Janklow, were literally allowed to write usury laws themselves--then they could sell the credit cards to people in CA with APRs of 20% because SD's rules apply only according to the Supreme Court.  Ever wonder why credit cards are allowed to have insane APRs like 20-25%?  It's because Delaware and South Dakota got smart---they realized that after the ruling if they basically made the worst laws possible for consumers that they'd attract enormous interests in companies relocating to their states, bringing billions of tax dollars.  And that's the reason why many credit cards have high interest rates today--because of Delaware and South Dakota (and sometimes Nevada now).  The vast majority of credit card banks are located in Delaware and SD and everyone has credit cards with rules that their own states don't make, the rules for their credit cards come from DE and SD--states where the banks themselves wrote the rules.  Usury has been regulated literally since the dawn of Western Civilization, yet after the 1978 ruling we allowed the lenders themselves to write the rules of lending.  


Mortgage banks also wised up and followed suit.  They simply fled to the state with the worst consumer protection laws for writing mortgages and guess what happened?  The entire subprime mortgage crisis in 2008.  

And what does Congress want to do now?  They want to 'open up cross state competition' for the insurance industry and get rid of regulations after killing Obamacare.  And guess what'll happen? The same crap that happened with credit cards and subprime mortgages--states will definitely compete--they'll just have a race to the bottom of the barrel in order to make the worst laws possible for health insurance so that insurance companies will relocate to their states.  Then they'll be able to sell their crappy plans to everyone in the country because one or two ahole states decided to make terrible laws (probably due to kickbacks and bribes).  

And that's why National Bank v. First Omaha Corp was one of the most important rulings of the entire 20th century.   </TEXT>

But besides that, yes, it is extremely hazardous to ride bikes elsewhere in the city.  Baltimore drivers are some of the worst in the entire country, not just because they're bad at driving, but because they're extremely aggressive.  They have no problems at all running bikers off the road or tailgating them.  Also, you need to plan out a safe route for where ever you go.  I know way too many people who have been approached or have gotten jumped for their bikes by kids.

	<TEXT> Politics 101.  You ALWAYS, and I mean ALWAYS purposely underestimate the true cost of a project.  The biggest hurdle is just getting the things started.  Once you've started it and committed large portions of public money towards a project almost no politician wants to be left with an incomplete project that was never finished because that would 'waste tax payer dollars'.  At that point it is almost always easier then to get the additional money needed once a project has started even though you knew in reality that the original cost was much higher.  

It isn't always a bad strategy either--it is quite effective and actually gets things done.  Some great infrastructure projects that millions of Americans have benefited from for decades would have never gotten accomplished if the projects kept getting delayed for years and years due to bickering over costs.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And no one wants to be a BPD cop because of the outrageous level of violent crime and hardened criminals that they have to constantly deal with.  No one is putting all of the blame on the cops alone here.  All of the problems stem from poverty and economics.  There'd be far less violent crime, kids growing up in crime, and mass incarcerations if people didn't live in poverty.  

The government should be doing much more to combat poverty in Baltimore, but our city's leaders piss away millions of dollars on things like consultants, spending their money on parties for themselves and their friends, overpaying corrupt school administrators who constantly change their work hours so that we have to pay millions of dollars in OT pay for hours not even worked, losing 1400 computers for our city's kids....the list goes on. 

If you want more money to fight poverty which fights crime, start following the money.  It's almost always about the money.  Yet Baltimoreans have constantly elected the same official(s) over and over again who've done an atrocious job of being stewards over our city's finances.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a left center voting Democrat.  Voted Dem for years on the national scale: Kerry, Obama 2x, and Hillary (ugh).   Voting in different types of people (such as independents for example) might actually do this city some good.  Not sure why you are going off on this tirade.  Dem, Repub, or whatever....it doesn't matter.  By voting in the 'the same politicians over and over again'  I didn't in anyway exclusively blame Dems only.  By 'the same' politicians over and over again, what I mean are the same corrupt bureaucrats that have their hands in the money jar that are getting paid 6 figure salaries to not do their jobs or fail at doing it as well as getting six figure salaries for their friends.  

A ton of posters on this sub think Baltimore the the greatest city in the world.  That slogan is on our city's benches.  Well, OK, if that's true, then why do we consistently accept a completely inept city government, that for years, continues to do the same things over and over and over again with play to pay schemes, shafting residents with programs, overpaying for marginal police results...it never ends and yet all the city government ever does is continue to ask for and demand more money.  No. How about some accountability first.  Maybe residents should start demanding tangible results, such as say a reduction in murder rates to start.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has a lot to do with Baltimore's epic rate of violence.  When you elect officials that demand 0 accountability you get this.  We had a thread a while back where I outlined many examples of how Baltimore's corruption is out of control.  Baltimore spends something absurd like 20 %  of its entire budget on police (for many other US cities it is more like 5-10%).  You'd think that for that kind of money BPD homicide could clear more than 40% of cases.  1 out of 3 cops last year applied for comp due to 'injuries received on the job'-- which in fact may be possible, but it does raise eyebrows.  Police and fire also have the city on the hook for $765,000,000 in owed retirement money.  For allllllll of that money, where is the accountability?  Accountability starts with finances.  And Baltimore keeps electing the same officials over and over and over again that don't care about accountability.  

Cops not doing their job, millions in aid money being held back by the housing authority and not being spent to fight poverty, millions of dollars that could be used in other ways to fight poverty being wasted on spending nearly 20x more than is allowed by the city's own rules on consultant fees by the city government.....that is exactly how voting the same way over and over leads to a mess like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone who still goes to church is a hypocrite. Period.  How could one possibly still support such a corrupt and evil organization like the Catholic Church?  Even after the whole pedophile scandal?  You can bet your ass the Church and probably even the bishop of that diocese knew what was exactly going on at that location.  I mean who didn't see anything suspicious about sneaking in a gaggle of women for years in a church?  

I had an uncle involved in the whole child sex abuse thing and he got a huge payout along with a lot of other men who were abused by several priests during the 50s and 60s.  The stories and details that came out during the trial, and which are almost never covered by mainstream media, are absolutely shocking and disturbing beyond belief.  For example, most people know that the Church did indeed know about their pedo priest problem and some people even know that pedophile priests were shunted all across the country and world in order to cover up their crimes and keep things secret, but what many people don't know are the great and extraordinary lengths almost all of the local churches and dioceses went through before the trials began in order to hide their money so that they could appear to the courts as being less wealth than they appeared on paper in order to help reduce their payouts to victims.  The Church, being the world organization that it is, shifted and pulled out money and moved them to hundreds (if not thousands of accounts) all over the world in foreign countries in order to make it impossible to track the money down and evaluate network by prosecutors in order to help determine a number for payout.  If covering up pedo priests, doing nothing about it, AND trying to hide your money in order to avoid properly compensating victims isn't evil, well I don't know what else to tell you.  No one who is remotely faithful to Christ should even be stepping foot in a Catholic church.  

Other disturbing details emerged from the case such as one priest who routinely abused boys almost every week would also have over women to sleep with for years.  Another guy involved in the class action lawsuit suffered abuse so unspeakable I can't even type it here; he ended up getting a payout 10x what my uncle got, but which was probably 1 billion fold under what needed to pay for him for what happened to him as a child.  If the devil himself made an organization on Earth, it would be the Catholic Church.   </TEXT>

He served his time in the Marine corps  for 10 years and 2 tours in Iraq which allowed him and gave him the means  to pursue his master's degree. After retiring from the Marines he pulled in $130,000 last year as a UAV operator for a private firm and owns a 5 bedroom house, no student loan debt, and a BMW.   I truly believe the Marine corps saved his life and kept him out of jail. There was no way he was affording college. </TEXT>

In order to recoup the profit loss from one free hamburger given out by an employee the store had to sell 30+ burgers.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean I don't do anything special except read the news.  The facts above are all headlines you can read about in the news.  The folks over at Baltimore Brew do an excellent job at doing their best to fight for Baltimore city government transparency when it comes to spending.  They're one of the biggest reasons why SRB was prevented from overspending tax payer dollars by $100 million dollars to install water meters through a company that was connected politically to her administration.  Honesty, I don't know what else to do except be a pain in the ass to your representatives.  The voters of this city will always continue to vote for the same.  Your representatives are a cog in the corruption machine.  Nothing will get done.  The scariest part is that  the facts above are only what has been caught in the news, god knows what else *hasn't been found yet* in terms of cronyism, wasteful spending, and kickbacks.  I'm surprised the FBI doesn't have a permanent office in Baltimore in order to be a permanent hemorrhoid in the ass of Baltimore's City government.  They could probably catch a case of corruption which has led to tax payer dollar waste almost every week.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is 1000000x easier to park than Fells.  I mean if you come home late you might have to walk a few blocks but I almost am always able to find a spot. Things clear up even more dramatically around Remington and the border of CV for parking once all the college kids leave too.  I do, however, expect it to get worse over the next decade. Remington is building up fast because there's no more space in Hampden.  It is basically becoming Hampden 2.0.  On the flip side, now is the time you can probably make a lot of money buying up property in Remington before it gets more expensive in the coming years.  As for RPP, I don't even buy it because I leave for work early enough everyday that I don't need it and come home late enough that I don't need it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a lot of corruption in Baltimore.  No one really knows where all of the money is going because the city comptroller, who has been in office for decades, does a terrible job.  No one paid attention to that race this past election and we continued more of the same.  There's a huuuuuge portion of the city's finances that gets sucked down a big black abyss. I forget the statistic, but Baltimore spends something insane, like 20% of the city's entire budget on the police alone.  

This is a city where

--DPW employees took bribes for dumping, costing the city over $6 million in revenue 


--Injury claims by city workers cost over $39 million last year.  1 out of 3 cops filed claims for work related injuries.

--City schools used $15 million in federal funds for things like dinner cruises, PTA meals, and a mother/daughter makeover.

--The Baltimore City School's information chief authorized $250,000 worth of renovations for his department, including his executive suite. And all while the city keeps demanding hundreds of millions more for education.

--The Rawlings-Blake administration had the City Hall phone system fiasco that wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars due to conflicts of interest

--The entire Schaefer administration during the 70s and 80s was corrupt. Examples include spending $4 million in taxpayer dollars to fix up a hotel owned by a friend of the mayor, which ended up wasted since the hotel soon went bankrupt.  In another instance, the Schaefer administration spent $5.6 million fixing up an apartment complex owned by a Schaefer political supporter.  

-- We had yet another horribly corrupt mayor with Schmoke after Schaefer. Schmoke wasted nearly $100 million in federal funds trying to build an 'Empowerment Zone' which failed miserably to generate any job growth.  The Schmoke administration also blew $25 million in HUD funds on rampant cronyism, no-bid contracts, and massive cost overruns.  

--We spent $2.8 million in overtime pay for school employees in 2010, even though it is highly doubtful the employees worked those hours.  The school system failed to collect $1.5 million in debts and also had oversight so inadequate that the school system has paid millions in contract work that wasn't verified, lost 1400 computers, and allowed a shit ton of employees to adjust payroll hours even though those permissions were not required for their jobs.

--105 school system employees had home addresses that matched the addresses of vendors hired for instruction, special education and consulting services. A review of eight procurement payments showed that seven went to vendors who were also system employees.

--The school system continued to pay for special education until 2010, even though those contracts were up in 2008 and even though the contract was never renewed by the school board.  This cost $6.9 million.

--We paid school bus contractors after being invoiced for nearly $350,000 even though the vendors listed the same exact hours and mileage for nearly 50 buses every month.  

--Consultants were paid $27 million to help manage the city's sewer repair projects.  This happened even though the fees paid to consultants exceeded the city's limit for fees by 18x.  

-Pension liabilities for retired police and firefighters have ballooned up to $765,000,000 

-Former mayor Dixon's  campaign chairman, Dale G. Clark, failed to file state income tax returns after earning $500,000 as the City Council's computer consultant. He did that job for six years without a contract.



And these examples are only a tip of the iceberg of the corruption, cronyism, and pay-to-play schemes that have plagued Baltimore for decades.  Have you ever heard of death by a thousand cuts?  Because that would be Baltimore.  Every fucking person in the city government and friends of people who are in the city government has their hands in the honeypot.  No one is held accountable.  Fraud is rampant.  Kickbacks are rampant.  Corruption is out of control.  I mean I almost never, ever vote Republican, but goddamn, unfettered Democrat control of Baltimore for the last 60 years has produced the results you have today.  It might actually do some good for the city if other parties were elected to help run it.  Where do your taxes go?  Into the corrupt hellhole abyss known as the Baltimore City government.  I can't wait until 2020 when we get to hear about the stories of the rampant corruption, bribes, and contract over-payments totaling millions, if not hundreds of millions, for the massive Port Covington project.  Even as a left leaning and voting Democrat, I am almost always in the camp to say NO to demands for increased taxes whenever the Baltimore City government asks.

	<TEXT> Sugars go beyond the 'classical sense' and what most people think of as 'sugar'.  Everything, and I do mean everything, contains sugars and carbohydrates--meat, plants, etc--they all have sugars.   When most people think of 'sugar' they think about fructose, sucrose, or sugars used to sweeten things.  The basic thing to understand about glycobiology, however, would be to understand the major types of monosaccharides which run life, they are:

Glucose:  http://stopdiabetesmellitus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Glucose.png

Galactose: https://www.smartkitchen.com/assets/images/resources/large/1362523042galactose.jpg

Mannose:  http://oregonstate.edu/dept/biochem/hhmi/hhmiclasses/bb450/winter2002/MN/MANNOSE.GIF

Fucose: http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/content/dam/sigma-aldrich/structure0/083/mfcd00135603.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/mfcd00135603-medium.png

N-Acetyl Glucosamine: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/N-Acetylglucosamine.svg/620px-N-Acetylglucosamine.svg.png

N-Acetyl Galactosamine: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Acetylgalactosamine.svg/300px-Acetylgalactosamine.svg.png

Sialic Acid: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Sialic_acids_2.png/360px-Sialic_acids_2.png

These are the major  monosaccharides that make up virtually everything related to glycobiology in a mammalian cell.  There are a few other rarer types of monosaccharides and different forms of these sugars (e.g. 5 membered rings vs. 6 membered) which life uses, but there's no need to discuss them here.  


When I say 'chromatin is covered in sugar', what I really am giving is the extremely watered down idea that chromatin is covered in the sugar N-Acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc).  Long story short, glucose gets converted into GlcNAc through a pathway known as the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP).  Fructose-6-phosphate (a major intermediate of glycoslysis) gets shunted down the HBP to make GlcNAc.  GlcNAc then gets added to TONS and TONS and TONS of proteins inside of your cells to regulate their physiology.  This concept is known as 'O-GlcNAc'.  So when I say 'Chromatin are covered in sugar', what I'm referrring to are the O-GlcNAcs on all of the proteins that comprise your chromatin.  For example, nearly every transcription factor (proteins that assist in genes being decoded) are regulated by O-GlcNAc.  Histones, which are the protein balls that your DNA wraps around to be packaged, are covered in GlcNAc.  The ability of your DNA to unwind from histones in order for genes to be read is regulated in part by the GlcNAcs that are added to the histones.  But the major point is that nutrition is linked to how much 'stuff goes through the HBP' which regulates how many GlcNAcs are made which regulates how they're added to allllllllllll of the proteins inside of your cells which regulates how your cells function.  

This book chapter is free on the topic of O-GlcNAc:

	<TEXT> Glycobiologist here.  

Yes, there is a TON of stuff we don't know yet about the role of carbohydrates in biology and health.  Next to DNA and protein, the language of carbohydrates has been called 'the third language of life'.  At least on the cellular level, we absolutely know that adding 'more sugar' to cells alters their physiology--sugar patterns will change on the surface of cells and intracellulary more sugar gets added to proteins.  These effect descend from pathways other than glycolysis and OXPHOS.   

Your chromatin (basically the entire complex of your DNA) is absolutely covered in a TON of sugar.  Nutrition and sugars absolutely affect how genes are transcribed.  The main protein machine,  called RNA poly II, won't bind and read genes right unless it is covered in sugar.  Nearly every aspect that regulates your epigenetics is also heavily regulated by sugars that get added to all of the proteins that perform or reverse epigenetic mechanisms.  That would be entirely consistent too with the phenomena that was observed during the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1945 and the vicious cycle of type-2 diabetes perpetuated in the offspring of affected individuals </TEXT>

Why is it so hard to legalize marijuana in DE?  Well for one, the people aren't allowed to vote on it and it requires going through a government beaurocracy in the State House that can be corrupted by special interests with lobbying money. The only thing DE residents were able to vote on for the entire 80 years from 1908 to 1987 was whether or not charities are allowed to have gambling events in order to raise money.  Raise cain for a bigger issue than marijuana--and that's moving to get rid of the laws that make it impossible to vote on I and Rs.  Get that done and the other small dominoes, like wees legalization, fall. </TEXT>
