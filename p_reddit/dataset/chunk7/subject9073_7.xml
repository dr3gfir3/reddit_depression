The abbreviation IT was not synonymous with the term Information Technology in 1986the year Stephen King's IT was written.

But Millennialsthose who were born in the late 80's through the early 2000swould most likely see IT and think Information Technology.

Oh yeahand it's a joke.

	<TEXT> I have to agree with the majority of comments here... I am currently working at the best job I've ever had.

I have made slightly more money in the past in previous jobs.

I can say with 100% certainty that people truly underestimate the value of working at a place they actually love versus working strictly to earn a paycheck.

I've done both... Quality of life is hard to put a price tag on, but if you enjoy showing up to work every day and as long as you're making enough money to cover your bills and have some fun... It's not broken. Don't fix it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very interesting.

He's definitely an interesting and controversial figure. I wonder if anybody outside of WWE will ever make a comprehensive documentary about him. I know a couple of semi-well-reviewed books have been written.

I'd like to see an outside organization or production company tackle a no-holds-barred (pun completely fucking intended) documentary on old Vince. ESPN has been doing a pretty sweet job with their 30 for 30 docs and OJ: Made in America. I think if they did a VKM Biography it would turn out well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100% agree. Vince continued to expand on his Father's work and changed professional wrestling into the extravaganza we all know and love today. It would be nice to see him honored.

Having said that... Once they're done honoring him, I would be perfectly happy to never see his creepy, old steroid enhanced ass on television ever again.

As an in-show character/personality, he has ceased to become entertaining for me. Whenever I see him (or HHH for that matter) getting physical and throwing themselves into the "action", I almost always fast forward.

It's kind of like when Puff Daddy used to constantly say shit in the background go any Notorious B.I.G. songI'd literally scream at my stereo"GET OFF THE TRACK, PUFFY!"

Stay off the shows, Vince.

But seriously... Off the air the guy is a stallion. The steroid bod creeps me out, but fuck it. Old people can do what they want. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The 10 Worst and The 10 Best Things About The WWE Right Now - Summer 2016 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-09 22:39:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *WWE stands for World Wrestling Entertainment.*

*The definition of Entertainment is  an event, performance, or activity designed to provide amusement of enjoyment.*

*The opposite of Entertainment is Disappointment and Boredom.*

# SUMMER 2016

## The 10 Worst

**1. Make Darren Young Great Again**  What. The. Fuck? No, but seriously What the fuck? This is not funny. Its awkward like British Sitcoms. Old Bob Backlund is more painful to watch than Old Ric Flair. Darren Young is a stiff. And theyre clearly not recording at the same timebut trying very hard to act like they are. This blatant programming filler needs to be 86d.

**2. Byron Saxton**  I dont care about his history. I dont care how he got the job. He sucks. He contributes absolutely nothing to any given broadcast. When will the WWE fire this boring, goofy-grinning motherfucker?

**3. Baron Corbin**  Literally the least interesting wrestler to receive a push in the past 20 years. Dumb character, dumb outfit, dumb promos, and seriously uninspired wrestling. Besides We already have a non-specific dark guy in Bray Wyatt. Speaking of which

**4. Bray Wyatt**  The One Promo For Life era is over. Or at least it should be YESicons like Hulk Hogan and The Undertaker made decades-long careers by cutting the exact same promo every single fucking week But that was then and this is now. Brays mysterious, one-promo, Cult Leaderwho never gets too specific about his darknesshas just become stale.

**5. The Wyatt Familys Feud with The New Day**  I understand that many wrestling fans prefer the serious melodrama to the goofy antics of The New Daybut this shit is just stupid and lame. Seriouslywhat is the actual threat that the Wyatts represent to the New Day? Why wouldnt The New Day survive a confrontation with The Wyatts? Dumb ddumb dumb.

**6. 75% of the Wrestlers Theme songs sounding similar**  Whos coming out? Is that Sami Zayn or fucking Becky Lynch?? Thanks, CFO$. WWE, heres an idea Take a note from your old playbook and team up with some popular artists and get some better fucking music. Yes it might cost more, but it would be worth it.

**7. The Usos calling everybody Oos**   First of allthe Usos are one-dimensional and fairly boring to begin with But seriously, WWEstop trying to make Oos happen. Its not gonna happen.

**8. The Social Outcasts**  An obvious, yet feeble attempt to duplicate the group-dynamic/success of The New Daywhich is not working. Mostly because Heath Slater is a fucking twat and the three Outcasts just dont have that New Day chemistry.

**9. Splitting RAW and Smackdown (again) as a Brand Extension**  Just Fuck off, WWE.

**10. WWE Doesnt seem to give a shit about the Fans**  I think the recent push of Roman Reigns where they had to resort to actually muting the negative crowd responses is a great example. Keep kicking us and we will not be your Marks forever. So again Just fuck off, WWE.


## The 10 Best

**1. Ambrose is the Champ**  Well done for a change, WWE. Ambrose sure is fun. Like that time he and Chris Jericho faced each other in

**2. The Asylum Match at Extreme Rules**  Holy shit. I wasnt expecting all that. Just when I thought I would see some pussified, half-measure WWE showed they still have some balls.

**3. The Complete absence of HHH and Vince McMahon**  Fuckin douchebags. Keep them away.

**4. Sasha Banks and Paige**  The Female Division is a weird place right now. The stories are weak and the matches are kind of lame, but Regardless of how we all feel about the athleticism and talent amongst the females, can we all just agreethese two are hot.

**5. AJ Styles Heal Turn**  The man was juuuuust not cutting it as a Face. But the minute he started talking shit and beating up John Cena with The Clubwow He really bloomed.

**6. Enzo   Cass**  Two words Refreshing. Entertaining. 

**7. Canadians**  Jericho, Owens, Zayn, etc Theyre all great.

**8. ThRollins**  In an era of saggy promos and weak microphone skills, there are only a handful of Heals in the WWE still doing it right. And Seth Rollins is at the top of his heal game right now. Despite being side-lined by a serious injury, he made a great come-back, and hes as spoiled and rotton as ever.

**9. The Golden Truth**  I might be the only person who really thinks this shit is hilariousbut Im right. This shit is hilarious. Again I understand that many WWE fans prefer Soap Opera to Comedybut not me. The funnier the better And these two really make me laugh.

**10. Anytime Kevin Owens is a Guest Commentator at the Announcers Table**  Good lord is KO amusing. I already loved him for his Molson gut and chubby Poutine-derived cheeks, but the shit that comes out of his mouth on commentaryespecially when he disses Byron Fuck-Face Saxonis absolutely precious. </TEXT>

Still... All of the best "kids" entertainment keeps the writing solid and doesn't tend to dumb it down (think Harry Potter).

I think the WWE would benefit from some better goddamn stories! It's like when they kept trying to force Roman Reigns down everybody's throat when it was clear he just wasn't the fan favorite... There was a million different ways they could've pushed him other than how they did that would have sat better with the fans.

I don't know... Maybe I'm the only one who wasn't sick of New Day yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LookI think the feud is awesome. And I agree that The Wyatt Family is the perfect foil for New Day's positivity... It's the specific way they're executing the story I think sucks:

* The complete lack of motivation for Xavier to stray from his squad and the fact that this is suddenly coming out of nowhere.

* Xavier's terrible attempt at *subtle* acting. Jesus Christ... He is the perfect heel and he is laugh-out-loud funnybut his range is LIMITED.

* Kofi and Big E acting as goofy as alwaysseemingly oblivious to Xavier's misgivings.

* Bray Wyatt*who I love in the ring*still being Bray Wyatt.


You talk about needing to transcend... This guys hasn't changed his schtick at all. And it's really getting stale.


What exactly is Bray Wyatt's message? He never get's too specific about it.


Anyway... I love the idea of WWE's darkest feeding with WWE's Lightest. I just think the angle they are taking is so fucking weak.


They could have done much better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The New Day is one of the most popular acts in the WWE right now. They're hilarious. And t's obvious that WWE is aware, because they're trying to clone the success of The New Day with otherless talentedcliques like The Social Outcasts.

But now... Out of nowhere... The idea that Xavier Woods is suddenly not participating in the New Day antics because he's somehow being manipulated (or scared?) by Bray Wyatt is absolutely stupid.

Seriouslywho's coming up with this shit? What is the end game of this horrible storyline?

Is Xavier going to break up the New Day?

	<TEXT> My Dad's dead body.

I was 18 and was pressured by my Grandma to accompany my Mom inside the funeral parlor. I stood as far away as possible and just watched while my Mom did her thing. As far as I was concerned, it was no longer my Dad.

A few years earlier she also made me stand next to and touch my Grandpa's dead body. I'd take that one back also actually.

She's not weird or anything, she's a great Grandma... But I wish I had refused her on those two occasions.

Funny but still Serious Edit:
A couple years after my Dad died my Mom said she found a VHS tape of my 7th Grade Birthday Party. When she popped it in the VCR it turned out to be an old sex tape of her and my Dad. I would also 100% surgically excise that memory from my brain as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because nobody else has mentioned it (or anything by Mix) I want to mention--

SIR MIX-A-LOT - SWASS

It may not be in the same league as the others mentioned here... But it was a 'masterpiece' in my eyes for several reasons...

- It didn't fit conveniently into any rap sub-genre of the time.
- It was very funny.
- Almost every track is good.
- The production was different than other artists of the era.
- Sir Mix's lyrics are good!
- Buttermilk Biscuits

Mix-A-Lot is remembered mostly for the song Baby Got Back off of his third album Mack Daddy, but his first two albums (Swass and Seminar) are solid. </TEXT>

I'm sticking to my guns on the Support Channels issue. I think they are big enough at this point to open up email support for Plex Pass customers. I can wait on "live" channels like Chat and Phone. But I think they can afford email at this stage.

I love how I posted specifically calling out the fact that I was pissed about Plex NOT offering Tech Support, and--of course--the majority of the responses were not relevant. They were crap like "You're wasting your time" (which I wasn't) and "What's the tech problem?" (sigh--I want PLEX to answer my problem on principle).

I told the Co-Founder over the phone to cancel my subscription.

I'm glad I didn't listen to the other sheep who responded with the same, canned bullshit you see on the Plex forums. </TEXT>

Okay... I've made it the rest of this week's mission to get somebody on the phone at Plex.

Help me, Reddit.

EDIT: I got a phone number and spoke to the co-founder and CTO. He personally answered my tech support question and explained very directly why they do not--at this time--offer traditional Tech Support.

I guess what I meant to say was... If, by design and from inception, the story-teller utilizes pictures as an essential narrative element (as in... the words alone don't completely tell the story), then it's not a novel in my eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Noooo, nononono. You're welcome to your own opinion, obviously, but I ALSO have to interject... 

Watchmen is NOT A NOVEL. Watchmen is a Comic Book.

The term Graphic Novel was invented (I think way back back in the 60's) specifically to market comic books as a more legitimate form of storytelling. Surprise! This was immediately (and fucking forever) embraced by the comic industry, and also by comic readers... Because they both so desperately wanted their medium legitimized.

So if we're taking our cues from marketing people, I guess "Corinthian Leather" is better than normal leather... And I suppose name brand pharmaceuticals are WAY better than generic.

The bottom line is--if it has pictures--it isn't a novel. Novel writer's use nothing but their words to paint the picture of their story. This is NOT TRUE of Comic Book writers. A comic script is much closer to a screenplay, in that is is ultimately a blueprint for a TEAM OF ARTISTS to completely realize.

TL;DR - Comic Book fans need to quit trying to make comic books into something more than they are.

EDIT: Downvote me all you want, bitches. I keep it real. Check my comment and post history and you'll see how few fucks I give. Glad I was able to hit a nerve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not very fast, so it would be perfect for slow tracking.

I tried it over a 20 foot distance last night and it worked well. I'm thinking there will be a dip the longer the distance gets... But the nice thing about this rig, is that you can go low to high or vice versa... And it will "climb" a pretty steep angle.

NOTE: There is a rotating spindle that you wrap the string around which provides the forward movement... If you DON'T wrap the string around it, the unit will slide down a properly angled line at faster speeds.

NOTE 2: The engine connects to a couple of large wheels which transfer power to the spindle with the string wrapped around it... A smarter, craftier person could probably figure out a way to cut out one or both of the wheels out and transfer more power directly to the spindle to make the drive faster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly novelty... I typically use the GoPro for typical GoPro things. But I also make music videos and experimental film stuff, and I love how lightweight and tiny it is, so I have fun playing with mounting ideas to capture unique footage.

As for this rig... You are really only limited by 2 things:

A. The length of the string.

B. Wind conditions if recording outdoors.

And the shooting is smooth. In the absence of a Drone-Mount, or a "Steady-Cam" type rig, this gives a nice, straight line. I am thinking about using it for overhead shots with the cam pointed straight down. Like me lying on my bed or something. But I also had an idea to run a line through the open driver and passenger windows of like 8 cars parked next to each other and letting the camera track through the cars while the various people inside doing funny things on their lunch break.

I also manage an office and want to put together a virtual tour video... I have thought of a few shots where I can run the GoPro through our Ikea Cubicles or overhead looking down on our work-stations. Fun stuff.

And the set up time is actually pretty quick. If I had clamps or something on the ends of the strings, the whole thing can go up in less than 2 minutes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I purchased a Tin Can Cable Car toy from Terra Toys in Austin for $17.

I purchased the Hot Wheels "Gravity" Builders Set for $9.99 at Target.

Using the Red Clamp from the Hotwheels set, I drilled a hole big enough for the pin that holds the can in place from the Cable Car Toy. I was able to easily secure the Red Clamp, which will hold the GoPro in a variety of positions.

This is perfect for Side to Side tracking shots... But there is a shit-ton of possibilities.
