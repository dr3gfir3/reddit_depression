I want Temur to get more too OP. Best art in Tarkir came from the Temur. They needed something more, though. I like the idea of Blue to protect your beasties, although stuff like [[Show and Tell]] that only lets you drop creatures and forces your critters to fight with your opponent's critters also feels Temur. </TEXT>

**Efreet** - The victims of empires past deserve a last hurrah; this is a truer representation of balance than the cold, sterile one championed by the Djinn. The Naga and Dragonborn are elder-ass races that can take responsibility for themselves. </TEXT>

This is what I had in Standard - looking for advice on how to port it into Frontier:

2 [[Jace, Vryn's Prodigy]]

2 [[Soulfire Grand Master]]

4 [[Mantis Rider]]

4 [[Thunderbreak Regent]]

2 [[Dragonlord Ojutai]]

4 [[Wild Slash]]

2 [[Roast]]

1 [[Valorous Stance]]

4 [[Draconic Roar]]

4 [[Silumgar's Scorn]]

4 [[Jeskai Charm]]

3 [[Dig Through Time]]

4 [[Flooded Strand]]

4 [[Polluted Delta]]

2 [[Island]]

2 [[Mountain]]

1 [[Plains]]

1 [[Prairie Stream]]

4 [[Mystic Monastery]]

4 [[Spirebluff Canal]]

2 [[Wandering Fumarole]]

What should I do with my spell lineup?

I am assuming a Goodstuff.dec SB with [[Reflector Mage]] and [[Spell Queller]] alongside [[Radiant Flames]] and targeted counterspells would be worthwhile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine are all human:

**Navajko** - The Navajko were initially concentrated along the equatorial archipelago called Chain of Fire. They worshiped tusked, trunked, maned Regent Dragons, for these creatures were sources of ivory, leather, furs and food. When the ice age hit the Regents, recognizing the Navajko as their successors, laid a spell on the Navajko. It gave the Navajko the ability to shift into tusked, trunked, fanged, manned, furred man-beasts whose magic would allow them to survive the ice age.

**Sajin** - The Sajin splintered from the Navajko, heading south to establish their first major holding on Eberrai. They retained the characteristics of mankind's common ancestor, the scaled ape - thick brow ridges, and serpentine scaling patterns along their extremities and trunk. From these patterns the Sajin developed a philosophy emphasizing the use of body-mind to tap into the world's magic.

**Krolithzu** - The Krolithzu remained on the northernmost continent, Meteorfall, while the Navajko ancestors set out to explore the southern realms before settling the Chain of Fire. Krolithzu retained quilllike growths, lichen patches in the skin folds, of mankind's common ancestor. They have since split into three other tribes - Geddlithi, Krolothrai, Azu.

	<TEXT> My world is built around the concept of busting your ass to build something worthwhile, fulfilling. Dragonborn are the industrial extreme with strong sociopathic tendencies, while Naga are at the opposite end of that spectrum. Humans kind of shift along it. Djinn and Efreet are the extremes of human emotion - cold logic and deadly compassion - manifested; emotions that I feel would thrive in a setting based around self-actualization through self-sacrifice.

	<TEXT> Dragonborn have spadelike skulls affixed to thick necks with a lengthy tail that provides a counterbalance to their bodymass. Folds in their skin are home to fungal growths once used by their ancestors to endure an ice age.

Naga have flat, triangular skulls with slim, soft bodies ending in a thick tail. Vestigial wings, stunted, attest to a shared ancestry with the Dragonborn.

Vaku are cloven-hooved quadrupeds with scales, quill manes and boarlike skulls ending in a long, tusked snout ideal for burrowing and goring. Their forelimbs end into jointed, hooflike digits that allow them to grasp and use tools.

Djinn are an ethereal folk with flat faces, beady black eyes and horns that curl down around their heads.

Efreet are a slender folk of brimstone, given life by magical fire and lightning. They share the flat faces of the Djinn, except their horns sweep back from their head.

	<TEXT> I find a theme and application. Here's what I've got on the nonhumans for my world:

Dragonborn - Sociopathic ambition directed toward industry

Naga - Sociopathic ambition directed toward self-pity 

Vaku - Individual communities driven to competition against one another

Djinn - Communal desire to see balance brought amidst the chaos of the Naga, Dragonborn, and Efreet.

Efreet - Individualistic desire to help those victimized by the Dragonborn, Naga, Djinn and humans.

Stuff like catfolk and elephantfolk lurk in the background as demigod figures for various cultures. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep it on a person to person basis. You might think the Krolothrai peoples from Meteorfall are evil - they have no qualms about what companies they serve, practice cannibalism, tender to seek out seedy underworld bosses to oust in displays of dominance, and horde technology to themselves.

Its all a part of their belief system, though. They don't climb out of bed and leave the bivouac thinking about doing horrible things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it fits the theme, I wouldn't take it off the table. Case in point, Steven Erikson has crafted an extremely egalitarian setting in his Malazan novels. Yet there's something incredibly brutal in the ninth book that reflects on the book's themes of empires in decay, peoples falling, cosmic acts of horror and greater cosmic acts of compassion.

I'm not gonna spoil it, you can google "Dust of Dreams controversy" and find it if you like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Demon Wind** - Demon Wind is a tattooed mob boss that believes his past lives are etched upon his skin in his tattoos. According to Demon Wind, he was stranded on Flamedroi (my world) by one of his infernal peers. The past lives are the chains that keep him bound to Flamedroi.

To Demon Wind, the chains of mortality are a curse - so his best alchemists, pimps, smugglers and soldiers are gifted with supernatural forms and abilities. All of Demon Wind's schemes are directed at opening a portal to the infernal realm so that he might lure in, and murder, the demon that stranded him on Flamedroi.

Demon Wind's name reflects his nature - he is as unpredictable as the demon winds (hurricanes, in Eberraise speak). He might work to preserve the world upon which he is trapped, or carve swaths of pain and misery when triggered by his anger toward the demon that stranded him on Flamedroi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Started classes, saw a girl I was interested in. I decided to ask my friend about the girl...and later I found out that my friend and this girl are friends. Fast forward to the next semester and the girl I was interested in starts sitting with me in the lectures we have together, shooting me texts about stuff she could find with a quick Google or look at the syllabi, chiming in with "oh, I like/love ___" when I'd mention a random movie, vacation spot etc.

So, did I goof by accidentally telling her friend that I was interested in her? </TEXT>
