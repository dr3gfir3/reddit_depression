	<TEXT> Oh wow! I'm you ... like, ten years from now. Check out my submission history for the gory details, plus a dose of justice at the end. Maybe it'll help you cut the cord for good. My ex was way older than me and played the mind games too.

What I would have told myself back then: you're not crazy, he's an asshole. It hurts right now, but staying is like drinking poison and expecting it to make you feel better. The only way you'll feel better is to leave and get therapy. It's cliche, but time and distance really do work wonders.

I didn't have **ANY** friends when I left either. And I was battling an illness. And he cheated on me. But what I discovered is sometimes the nice thing about hitting rock bottom is you have nothing left to lose. </TEXT>
