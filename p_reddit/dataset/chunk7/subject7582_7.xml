	<TEXT> Daly also blames Barack Obama for creating a country where "blacks, Muslims, illegal aliens, and politically correct 'social justice warriors'" feel as if they can "attack" Trump supporters, police officers, businesses, and even children, **and suffer no consequences such as jail or deportation.**

But hey, at least we're not talking about...
Sessions perjury,  
Flynn conflicts/lies/leaked secrets,  
Ivanka conflicts of interest/nepotism,  
Kushner Russian connections/conflicts of interest/nepotism,  
False wiretapping claims,  
False claims of 3-5 million illegal voters,  
False crowd size claims,  
Climate denial/claim it was made up by Chinese to hurt American business,  
Failed healthcare bill,  
Merrick Garland,  
FCC/FTC   internet privacy being sold,  
Betsy Devos' brother   Blackwater founder's ties to Trump campaign,  
Trump's mental state (dementia/Alzheimer's)  
Sexual abuse lawsuit,  
Trump University lawsuit,  
Wall being paid for by American taxpayers (not Mexico),  
Manafort ties to Russia.  
  
You know, none of those things.

He did make a good point that the Trump team is probably not competent enough to pull off a false flag without getting caught. No one in the military/intelligence service would play along with them the way they might have with Nixon or any other previous potus. </TEXT>

I mean, in the modern news cycle where a new Trump administration scandal breaks every day, didn't we find out about this one weeks ago?  
  
Gotta miss simpler times. Obama didn't have 1 scandal as big as...  
  

-Sessions purgering himself under oath about meeting with Russians  
-Flynn working as an unregistered (paid) foreign agent for Ukraine (on behalf of Russia)  
-Kushner's conflicts of interest and contact with Russia during the campaign  
-Ivanka's conflicts of interest  
-Ivanka saying she would be  "daughter" not a Trump administration employee  
-Trump's not so blind trust with his 2 sons taking over the family business  
-Trump not releasing his tax returns (despite saying on many occasions he would)  
-Kellyanne Conways lying about microwaves, crowd sizes, etc. (whatever happened to this woman anyway?)  
-Manafort (where to begin)  
-Carter page's contact with Russia  
-Trump's ties/debts to Deutsche bank  
-Allegations, ongoing lawsuit against Trump for sexual assault  
-Trump University settlement, except for the one woman that's still suing  
-Trump promising healthcare for all, but presenting a horrible healthcare plan that failed  
-The 2 failed Muslim bans that the administration now says weren't Muslim bans  
-Russia hacking the DNC to help Trump win against Hillary  
  
We could go on for days, there are so many scandals.  
  
edit: added a couple more. </TEXT>
