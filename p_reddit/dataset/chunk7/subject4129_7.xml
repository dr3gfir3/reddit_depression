Different game, same shit. I hope Klopp gets a bollocking because yet again we play the same fucking useless formation that hasn't worked. the 3 in the middle does nothing against teams that sit back, no link up play, nothing. On a somewhat brighter note, our performance in the 2nd half was half decent, we changed formation and didn't look like utter shit. If we continue to play this formation for the rest of the season i'm seriously gonna be worried. top 4 is looking less and less likely with every game.
It's also good to know what we were doing in spain the past two weeks, fingering eachother on the pitch playing patty cake. great </TEXT>

	<TEXT> instead of having 3 women matches, two of which were normal single matches with no stipulation... why not have another Chamber match? A women's chamber match would have been awesome, made history aswell and would have been something to look forward too. Becky Lynch vs Alexa Bliss vs Mickie James vs Naomi vs Nikki Bella vs Natyla, would that have made too much sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it'll be tough to cover the entirety, probably best if you ignore it for now and focus on whats going on now, i started watching again when the brand split started and don't remember anything from 2012-2015 and tbh don't feel like i need to. Womens Division is actually good know, i usually look forward to their matches more than the men.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which i agree but i don't think lifting weights is the best way to go if you want to be active, im sure cardio would be much more beneficial? running, playing sports, walking a lot, im sure most people would prefer that aspect of healthy living over lifting and pumping iron in the gym. </TEXT>
