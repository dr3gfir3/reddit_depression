Matthew (27:52-53) "The graves were opened; and MANY bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto MANY." 

Hello historians! How'd you miss that? Zombies. Roaming around. Seen by MANY!!

Not a fucking peep about it anywhere but Matthew.

Seems legit.
