	<TEXT> I was just talking to my buddies about this the other night. We were in Vegas, I decided to wear these new jeans that I bought when we went out. I've been buying the exact same cut of jeans for over 10 years. Relaxed fit, boot cut. They're not too baggy, but give the right amount of room for the dangly bits. So I slid them on, and right around when they got to my thighs I said "Fuck". Pulled them the rest of the way up, the waist was fine but the crotch seam literally was squished between my nuts. Every time I took a step, the balls would go from one side to the other. So in a fit of rage, I took the jeans off, put cargo shorts on, and threw the jeans back in my bag to return them.

I go back into the store with said pants this morning, and told the girl "Yo, these jeans are riding high, wtf." All she could tell me is that they've been adjusting the seam height or some shit recently and a lot of people have been complaining about squished ball syndrome. I am very distraught now, as they were the only company left who's jeans felt like they were not squeezing the life force out of my dick/balls. I'm 6'3" and 200lbs. I work out. I cannot wear skinny jeans, I cannot wear slim fit jeans, I cannot wear straight leg jeans. I've tried Guess, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, True Religion, Abercrombie, Levis, Etc. At this point, all that's left is wickedly expensive jeans or trucker jeans from wal-mart.

	<TEXT> Ah yes, I did this once. Brought a girl home from the club in college, we did the deed and she was just hanging around. It was getting awkward so I told her "hey I've got to get to bed, I've got class in the morning." She replied with "Tomorrow is Sunday you asshole!" It got her to leave, but I should have thought it out a little longer before using that excuse haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did something pretty stupid with I was 22. I had just moved to a town in a Midwest, didn't know anyone. I always found that a good way to meet girls was in clothing stores (at least on my experience). Anyways I went to an old Navy to buy a couple shirts, asked a girl for my size and she recognized that my accent was not from there so we started talking.

She was not attractive. At least 40 pounds overweight, really short hair which I'm not into, but she was nice. Anyways, she asked for my phone number and offered to show me around town. I was hoping that she had hot friends (douchebag move, I know) so I gave it to her. A few hours later she started texting me.

At this point I was laying on my air mattress enjoying some battlefield so I was giving short dismissive answers to her questions. She asked if I wanted to hang out, I said no. Then she said she would suck my dick if I could get there in 10 minutes. I responded with "lol nah." So then she tells me she just really wants to suck my dick, and if I leave right after she won't be mad. By this point my dick was like "bro WTF, let's go." 

So I hopped in the car, drove to her place, literally opened the door and she undid my pants and led me to her bedroom. Sucked my dick, swallowed, did my pants back up and I dipped. Never talked to her again. That town was fire though... So many hot women in a small place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah pretty bizarre. I just looked at a bunch of pictures of her, I think I just prefer women who are more filled out in the ass/legs and boobs area. At the risk of offending people though that's just my opinion and I recognize that everyone is attracted to different types! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know why...I just don't find her the least bit attractive. She always looks so snarky. It's interesting that most of my friends find her attractive though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying to get my boss to let me work from home for 5 months. There's literally nothing I do that can't be done from home. But they say no, every time. The reason? "The office provides a better working environment." So I get to drive 45 minutes every day, sit on the couch in my office and play on my laptop while I brainstorm and get interrupted every 30 minutes by the new girl asking me how to do things. Sound logic. </TEXT>
