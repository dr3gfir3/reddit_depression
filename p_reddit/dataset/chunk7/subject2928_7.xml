	<TEXT> [Battle of Orgreave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Orgreave). Think Ken Loach has a good documentary on it. 

Police moved strikers to a field and then charged the horse mounted police at them and beat the shit out of them without any provocation. The police and the pro-government press reported the Miners attacked the police first which is why the police acted so violently. But this was not true, the police attacked first. The current government blocked an inquiry into it

It was the same police force that lied about the Liverpool fans causing Hillsborough disaster and covered up their mistakes.


Following the confrontation, 71 pickets were charged with riot and 24 with violent disorder.[22][23] At the time, riot was punishable by life imprisonment.[24] The trials collapsed when the evidence given by the police was deemed "unreliable".[25][26] Gareth Peirce, who acted as solicitor for some of the men, said that the charge of riot had been used "to make a public example of people, as a device to assist in breaking the strike", while Mansfield called it "the worst example of a mass frame-up in this country this century."[27][28] In June 1991, South Yorkshire Police paid 425,000 in compensation to 39 miners for assault, wrongful arrest, unlawful detention and malicious prosecution.[25][29][30][31] In 2015, the Independent Police Complaints Commission reported that there was "evidence of excessive violence by police officers, a false narrative from police exaggerating violence by miners, perjury by officers giving evidence to prosecute the arrested men, and an apparent coverup of that perjury by senior officers."[ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Johnson is seen making a crude gesture about his victim as he describes how she would wait for a picture with him after Sunderland games at the Stadium of Light, going on to imply that she wore provocative clothing.

Then after the game she was asking for pictures all the time. This went on for about six months and the next thing she says: Can you get us a signed shirt? and uh  then she added me [on social media]. I accepted her, got talking to her, I didnt, I didnt know, I just thought she was 17, 18.

Johnsons claim to prisoners that he thought the girl was 17 or 18 is false. In his first police interview and later in evidence at his trial, Johnson admitted kissing the girl and knowing that she was 15.

football fans waiting outside stadiums for a signed shirt isn't exactly rare and looks like there's the terrible classic 'it her fault for what she was wearing'.

	<TEXT> [just copy and paste and cutting down bits from the article. for more detail read the article]

:: CONSERVATIVES

Theresa May has made clear she sees this election dominated by Brexit.

She wants the mandate to take Britain out of the single market and customs union, end free movement and the rule of European judges, as well as replacing a host of other EU laws and regulations with British ones.

But after the Budget debacle in which Chancellor Philip Hammond tried to raise National Insurance despite a manifesto commitment in 2015 not to, and was forced into a U-turn, we expect other commitments from the last election to be dropped.

IN

The biggest priority of Brexit negotiations.

As home secretary for six years she failed to bring immigration down to "tens of thousands". 

Grammar schools. 

OUT

It has been suggested the triple lock on state pensions could go, in favour of a double lock. It's an expensive commitment which Tory MPs have suggested could be ditched. Although Labour will promise to keep it, 

The 0.7% foreign aid target. 

:: LABOUR

Jeremy Corbyn has suggested he will look to fight this campaign on domestic issues - railing against austerity, the crisis in the NHS and low wages.

His party is deeply divided on Brexit, but has announced policies on a host of bread and butter issues in the past couple of weeks.

IN

VAT on private schools fees to provide free school dinners 

A 50p top rate of tax and reversal of inheritance tax cuts - 

Triple lock until 2025 and pensioner perks like free TV licences and bus passes.

Mr Corbyn is also likely to pledge to renationalise the railways.

OUT

Spending cuts. 

It may be a huge issue for unions and regional jobs, but arch-critic Jeremy Corbyn is unlikely to make a promise to renew Trident, even though it is party policy.

:: LIBERAL DEMOCRATS

Tim Farron's party are back from the dead and see this election as a great opportunity to make the unashamedly pro-European case for a soft Brexit.

But they will need to keep the Eurosceptics in their South West heartlands on side, with policies for people feeling the pinch on their living standards.

IN

The Lib Dems will be the only major party calling for Britain to stay in the single market, linking it to millions of jobs, and for an open migration policy.

They will promise a second referendum on the final EU deal.

The party have suggested a 1p rise in income tax to provide a 4.6bn boost to the NHS.

OUT

Coalition? The Liberal Democrats have not indicated they will be calling for a deal with the Tories or Labour

:: UKIP

The party are in disarray having lost their only MP, plummeting in the polls and distracted by internal battles, but they hope be make Mrs May feel the heat on immigration.

IN

Dramatic cuts to immigration - as soon as we leave. W

OUT

Nigel Farage

	<TEXT> Happened number of times for different twisted reasons. One that sticks out is during the dictatorship in Argentina they executed rebels (like drugging them and dropping them into the ocean from a helicopter). If these rebels had children they took the children from the families and gave them to pro-government parents to raise as their own. If the rebel was pregnant she was kept in jail and was killed after given birth while her baby was taken away to be adopted. Grandparents of these children are still looking for lost children who are in their 20s-30s now and learning that they are adopted and their birth parents were murdered. Think the number is 500 children out of 30,000 disappeared parents and I think they've only reunited 120th people to their original families. 

Edit: [I've been sent much more informed post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/66nkym/serious_what_are_some_of_the_creepiest/dgk6l18/) about why it wasn't just people rebelling against government that got tortured. Also, they tortured and killed people in other ways. 

Also lot of native American and Aboriginal cultures have faced issues like their children being taken away by the state and churches which devastating effects.

Social media kinda made me a bit more pessimistic about it. However, we need to do something to get young into politics and maybe this might help

	<TEXT> Playground social politics. 

Tory party esp under Cameron took on the image of being nationalistic, for working people, cosy middle-class social status. People vote for them because that's what they want to be. 

Voting Labour admits to being poor and press media wise they are portrayed as being pessimistic, unpatriotic and awkward nerdy losers. People don't want to be in the 'club' which makes them look like a loser class. Working class pride in Labour has been lost and most people are not in trade unions anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> not husband/father but known people who've gone through this. Talking about it and finding support groups helps show they're not alone and how common it is. Two I know found focusing of raising money for support or related charities helped. As the fitness helped their body recover/positive body feelings and they felt like they were doing something to help others. For them they said it was taking a break from trying 100% all the time and focusing on their health which ended up giving them another pregnancy. As if keeping with the routine before was too stressful so close to the loss. Also talking about the loss like they would if they lost a child, think lot of people feel guilty about doing this and try to become invisible. Close friend opened up a lot after she had a few miscarriages and I think this helped them a lot. Though everyone has their own system of processing grief. For other sending vouchers for food take aways and relaxing products helped them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Too early into Brexit negotiations for people to realize it's the government cuts which are the source of their misery. They're running the election on the brexit high and that people (mostly middle class) haven't felt the pinch yet. But Tories might lose lot of the business or free trade voters if they have money in the EU and are angry. 

Labour one winning strategy might be taking on brexit promises of funding NHS or spending promises for lost EU money. If they can get the numbers right that is. So a 'better in brexit with labour' run. Labour wont win anything back in Scotland. 

Lib Dems might get all the Remain votes as a last ditch attempt to stop it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Elephant and Castle's Heygate Estate was eventually torn down in 2014, many tenants were forcibly evicted from their homes, given compensation at less than 40 percent of the market value. In its place, Londoners were promised a shiny new development that would provide affordable, accessible homes for key workers desperate to get on the property ladder. 

Eventually, Southwark Council decided it would tear the estate down and start again. In 2002, the council  which sold the land for just 50 million, yet spent almost as much on forcing through the development itself  announced that the new site of around 2,530 homes would host 500 social housing units. Yet by the time successful bidder, Lendlease, unveiled its final plans, just 82 were put aside for the people they'd turfed out.

As the remaining home owners clung on until 2013, Southwark Council cut off heating and switched off the lifts, leaving tenants  council tax payers  stranded. Those residents who owned their own properties were served compulsory purchase notices for insultingly low sums. At that time, a local one bed flat could be bought for 300,000, yet Southwark Council offered just 80,000 for Orho Okorodudu's Heygate flat. Another resident, Adrian Glasspool, a teacher, was offered 225,000 for his three-bed ground-floor maisonette. The equivalent on the new estate would set him back 1 million. He said, "Lendlease is estimated to make a 200 million profit from the expropriation of our homes. We have literally been sold out by our own council."

Terry Redpath, a former Southwark housing officer, lived on the estate for nearly 50 years. He told a BBC documentary at the time, "I have been forced to give up my home to accommodate the building of homes for overseas investors."

Four years on, Mr Redpath has been proven right.

....

These family homes were put on the market to UK buyers in November of 2016, with prices starting at 550,000. You can imagine the London-based families queuing up to buy affordable homes and create the kind of memories the original Heygate residents shared for many decades. Only, way ahead of them in the queue  two years ahead, in fact  was the international market.

Sales of these properties began in Singapore on the 11th April 2014, with flash brochures and slick marketing conferences. Not a single unit was for sale in London at this time. Lendlease don't even seek to hide the fact they are selling investment opportunities, not homes, as they list exactly how much rental income  around 25,000 a year for the cheapest  foreign investors can cream off without ever touching the front door.


According to Land Registry searches, many properties have been bought  three at a time  by international investors, exclusively using the same solicitor, Riseam Sharples, who appear to have been given exclusive use for all sales. From their own website, Riseam Sharples help offshore buyers purchase "off-plan properties in the course of construction including multi-unit acquisitions and the sale of contracts prior to completion with many of our clients based offshore".

Not only are all of the buyers of the new South Gardens foreign investors; from the 51 bought so far, many appear to be offshore  untraceable and untaxable. Every single one of the 51 purchases made is listed as "care of 2 Tower Street, WC2H 9NP". Helpfully, that's Riseam Sharples' office address.

Not only does this betray the idea of a "community feel"  an investor surely can't live in multiple properties at once  but also betrays those who were forcibly evicted, many of whom actually owned the bricks and mortar they lived in. </TEXT>

Lavande and Marron return to their hometown, Sedje Denou in Benin, for the first time since they were taken away and sold into slavery in Nigeria years ago. Lavande worked as a housemaid and Marron worked in a shop. Both were exploited and abused. Marron was beaten and almost died, forcing him to run away. After spending months at the Centro de la Alegra Infantil in Coton, where they received physical and psychological care, they are ready to go home

	<TEXT> Sam Adams, 41 had her Motability vehicle taken away from her in June last year after being reassessed for PIPs.

Ms Adams, who has multiple sclerosis, says the assessor did not see her walk.

"How she came to that conclusion, when she's not seen me walk, she's not seen me walk up and down stairs - all she did was tickle my hand with a feather.

"What conclusions she was coming to from tickling my hand with a feather, I'll never know." she said.

In previous assessments the 41-year-old, who originally qualified for a vehicle in 2014, said she had been asked to walk up stairs and physically show how mobile she was. </TEXT>
