	<TEXT> It's also stupid branding. If it was just generic "here's a dude with powers in a weird reality" it'd probably do fine. Why they felt the need to attach AC to the title is weird. How many more people are you getting by making it an AC movie, versus how many you'll lose because "oh it's another stupid video game movie."

Felt the same way about the WoW movie. Just make it a generic orc/humans/magic movie and it probably would have done okay. Instead, WoW is attached which just leads to a disappointed fanbase and a general public that dismisses the movie bc it's based on a video game. </TEXT>

1) a very boring game that becomes very tense in the final 5 minutes, or,  
2) Smashville makes the other team look like amateurs and more or less walks up and down the field.  

Edit- and it's neither of those so far.

	<TEXT> If you want a random guess about why the over is more popular - 

I would guess a subconcious effect, where betting the under is almost the only bet one makes where the worst outcome is the best? 

You bet to win.  You win when other teams win. But in the case of the under, you win when both teams fail? Maybe there's just something fundamentally uncomfortable about picking that outcome? 

Sure people will bet on the Browns going 0/16, but those are more joke/prop bets.  When it comes to typical day-to-day betting, the under is the only real bet where you're hoping for the worst outcome. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Scents of the Months] Update 1 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-17 07:30:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey y'all! Here's the first update. Hoping some of you are still interested!

[Original post with the idea behind Scents of the Months](https://redd.it/5c4x4v) - personal reviews below.

People who joined after the initial post - what did you get?  What are your thoughts so far? 

Next theme -  Open to suggestions! But don't just name a scent or two, have a concept around why those scents should be chosen. We're in Winter in the North, so I might suggest something like woodsy/berry?  But it's also Summer in the South, so maybe coconut/citrus would be better? 

If you feel like participating, throw out an idea!

Also, doing it every 2 months, waiting on things to ship etc...maybe every 2 months is too fast of a turnaround for this sort of thing? Would 3 months+ be better, with interim checkups like this?

**Actual Reviews**

*Wild Man of the Woods Deodorant* - 10/10  

This has been a great alternative to normal pitsticks. The woodsy scent seems to be mostly derived from cloves; not necessarily a bad thing, but if you don't care for cloves this isn't for you most likely.  I used it regularly to start my day and always seemed to do fine.  Recently there was a huge snowfall here, which involved lots of shoveling of snow. The shoveling was a hasty idea, after already showering.  So I thought I'd give it a true test and just apply this deodorant after doing a physical activity.  Even a few hours after that, I do feel very fresh smelling, and yes even a nice back-of-the-nose woodsy/clovey scent.  It was from an Etsy dealer, and they included a bonus sample product which is what brought this from a 9 to a 10.  

*3x samples of colognes - Cheeky Teaky 7/10, Smoke 'n Oak 9/10, Mood for Oud* 8/10.

Smoke 'n' Oak is exactly what I was looking for, and I will be ordering it.  But Mood for Oud also got my attention.  Basically, of the three samples - Cheeky Teaky is on the sweet end of the spectrum.  The smell was enjoyable, but not what I was looking for.  Mood for Oud was a much darker scent, almost but not quite musk.  Smoke 'n' Oak was seemingly a blend of the two? Regardless of how they arrived at the blend of scents, smoke 'n' oak pretty much brought to mind exactly that when I put it on.  Mood for Oud I could see as possibly a more situational cologne.   If I had to classify them - Cheeky Teaky is the "hey it's a fun Friday night" kind of smell; Mood for Oud is a more intimate one-on-one kind of smell; and Smoke 'n' Oak is a day to day (but still unique) kind of smell. 

*Sandalwood and Manuka Facial Scrub* - 10/10

This shit is amazing.  I had no idea "Manuka Honey" was a thing before and a friend enlightened me.  Call it bovine entrails, whatever it is, I love it. I've always had very large pores between my cheekbones/brow.  Strangely, this is showing a really positive effect on one side but less so on the other side.  Regardless, my skin feels fantastic after using it.

*Crabtree   Evelyn Sandalwood Bodywash* - 9/10 

Probably the priciest per/use item I got. I have one small complaint, which is that it is *ridiculously* thick.  Get out your tennisball grippers, you'll need a good amount of effort to get a halfway decent amount out.  Aside from that - the scent lasts a good long time; a small amount goes a long way (thankfully); and the scent in general is pretty awesome. 

*Pipe Smoke Organic Body Lotion* - 8.5/10  

Warning - very strong.  I received this item at the same time as my cologne samples.  Day 1 I used both; told that I had way too much scent on.  Day 2 tried very minimal amounts of both; same result.  Day 3 tried just the body lotion; same result.

It is a very great smell, very much along the lines of the smokey/woodsy scents I was looking for.  And, another bonus, the etsy dealer included a free sample of a body oil.  

I would give this a 9, maybe a 10 because of the extra sample; but it's apparently so strong it has limited application.  Post-shower, going to bed alone?  Sure! Post-shower, and a few hours until work? Sure!  Definitely not something to use if going out in the near future.

*Candle* - was shit. There was a reason it was a discount sale.  I hope no one bought one of them thanks to the OP.

	<TEXT> (First time viewer here, no spoilers please.) 

I just reached the point 1/2 way through where Philip learns his other son (Misha) could be pulled off the front line if Philip wished.  

I almost expected this to become a 15 minute long mostly-monologue diatribe about how anguished he is over what the correct choice is to make.  

I am paused right now, maybe this episode will become that...

But instead, Philip said no and walked away and that was the end of all of that (so far).  

This was so awesome on so many levels for me. The several-commercial-break-long-speech I imagined would have involved Philip lamenting "what right do I have to determine his future when I didn't even know he existed until 2 months ago etc etc".  

Instead Philip realized he had no right to interfere in the life of a son he had no part in raising? And he just...left it at that, show moved on.

That's kind of a breath of fresh air in terms of modern TV...purposely foregoing an extra 15 minutes of time wasting internal debate to arrive at the Subway Fresh Take Episode Conclusion (looking at you, Walking Dead).

There are so many other parts of this show I'm dying to get into, but I still need to catch up to all of you first. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [OC] Bend Trump versus Bend Bernie - who would you vote for? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-08 05:47:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Preface** - friend and I were joking around about running for city council next year, one of us as Bend Trump, other as Bend Bernie. We made some jokes, I decided to fully write out the first ever debate between Bend Trump and Bend Bernie.  I hope you enjoy.  (Also this isn't meant to be serious in any way, please note the mention of joking/jokes. I was hoping I was making fun of both equally. If I appear to have a bias, I apologize and it wasn't intended.)

_______________

**Moderator** : Welcome ladies and gentlemen to the first ever debate between Bend Trump and Bend Bernie. Candidates, first question - the Central Oregon economy seems to be rebounding, but there are still questions about long term middle class jobs.  Bend Trump, well start with you.


**Bend Trump** : First I would like to say it is an honor, and a privilege, to be here tonight.  You should all feel very honored and privileged that I am here.  


My job plan is simple - Bend jobs for Bend residents.  We have these sneaky, criminal elements, robbers, thugs, rapists, and theyre coming down to Bend from Redmond, and theyre stealing. Bend. Jobs. They come take our money, our Bend money, then they take off and use Bend money in Redmond.  This isnt right, and I will put a stop to this immediately by tearing up every square inch of Highway 97 between Bend and Redmond. And I will make Redmond pay for it.


**Moderator** :  Um.  An interesting take... Bend Bernie, your response?


**Bend Bernie** :  Yes, the economy is growing...for some people. Your real estate brokers, owners of dealerships, your uh, your local brewery owner who has just released his 100th different variation of an IPA. For those people the economy is growing, but try telling people working two jobs the economy is growing. 


That is why I want to level the playing field.  My administration would pursue the implementation of a policy whereby everyone, not just the rich and not just the poor, but everyone, would have to work two jobs. I believe this is fair, and I believe this is right. 


**Moderator** : How does that help anything? At all?


**Bernie** : It will Re! Distribute! The wealth!


**Moderator** : No, it really wouldnt.


**Bernie** : Well it Re! Distributes! Where the wealth is located. Some! Times!


**Moderator** : [pause] Mmmkaaaay.  Moving on.  The next question should be a simple one.  If elected, what would your first City Councilial action be?  Bend Ber-


**Trump** : Trees. [Stares]


**Moderator** : -nie well...start with...nevermind.  Bend Trump, um.  Trees?


**Trump** : Trees. [Stares]


**Moderator** : What about the...  The trees?


**Trump** : The trees. Have got.  To go.  [Stares]


**Moderator** : The trees have go-


**Trump** : Gotta go! Bye bye!  Look, Chris, or whatever your name is.  Youre...too little for me to remember.  And I dont mean little metaphorically. I mean physically little, youre a very small man.  Although it fits metaphorically too.


Look. Laszlo.  I know that my predecessor and the candidate to my left want to continue the policies of tree coverage throughout Central Oregon.  And I think we should let the tree market decide.  If someone wants a tree, they can plant their own tree.  Why should my tax dollars be going to pay for someone else getting tree coverage?  I think we can all agree that the trees have been a disaster, at times literally.  Can you show me one dollar, one actual American dollar, that Bend has gotten from the trees? You cant.  Tree coverage is bad for the economy.  If someone wants trees, they can get trees, on their own, as an American.  But we need to end. The subsidizing. Of trees.


**Moderator** : Just... go.


**Bernie** : Pope Francis, I apologize for the remarks from the other candidate towards you. While I myself am a practicing member of the Mklushufu, I respect the Catholics, now that theyre at least trying, not to diddle minors. 


I believe Bend needs more reasonable real estate prices.  Vacation rentals are becoming a plague that is marginalizing those already struggling to get by, just renting! That isnt even talking about the difficulties, of the lower class, and even much of the middle class, in their dream. Of owning. A home.


To that end, my first action would be aimed at making real estate more affordable, for buying and renting. And it will take the help of this wonderful groundswell of supporters.  Myself, and more importantly, all of you, can come together, march to Northwest Crossing, and burn it to the ground!


**Moderator** : First, my name is Michael Thomas and I am not the leader of the Catholic faith.  Second, did you just propose burning Northwest Crossing to the ground?


**Bernie** : Yes your highness, Northwest Crossing.  And, maybe Broken Top.  Shevlin Heights....well, lets just say all of Awbrey Butte at that point...to be safe, we should burn all of northwest bend, and perhaps some parts of southwest bend, down to the very bedrock itself. That way, prices throughout the rest of  Bend would become more reasonable for those working class families that cant afford a 97703 zip code..


**Trump** : If it gets rid of trees I can support that.


**Moderator** : Well we have some agreement amongst the candidates.  Some unusual agreement, but agreement nonetheless.  Thats good.  I think.  Im going to uh, skip ahead a few questions at this point and.  Gentlemen.  Your closing statements?  Bend Trump, youre going to interru-


**Trump** : Yolanda honey, my campaign can be summed up in one word.  ARTBLIBTWTS.


**Moderator** : That isnt my name or a word.

**Trump** : Its a way for me to make a lot of words into one word, okay? So Im telling the truth when I say its one word, do you think you can handle that?  Look, A Return To Bend Logging Is Better Than Whatever They Say. Logging is what made Bend great before, and logging is what will make Bend great again.  All of our logging jobs were shipped. Over rivers!  To places like Klamath Falls and, I dont know, places.  I will bring. Those logging jobs. Back.  Its what this city was founded on, and A Return To Bend Logging Is Bend Better Than Whatever They Say.  ARTBLTWBYS.


**Moderator** : I believe you got your own acronym wrong. And werent you arguing against trees earlier?


**Trump** : We make the trees, but we chop the trees. We sell the trees.  Our economy will be the best its ever been.


**Moderator** : Do you understand what metaphors, allegories, or puns are?


**Trump** : Your words mean nothing to me.
 
**Moderator** : Bernie, lets hear it. 


**Bernie** : I believe my stances have been quite clear since day one that I am for the little guy, and I am against income inequality.  To that end, I believe that through research and development, engineering, computers, the internet, all of these things can be better used to develop the technology that will shrink everyone to precisely three inches tall. 


That way, we would all. Be. The little guy!


Houses could then be much, much smaller, creating a tremendous availability in real estate.  We would not need to eat as much, and food would become more affordable. The ventricles, in our lungs, would at that point be too small for us to catch the common cold or flu, providing a great relief to our healthcare system. And most importantly of all, public transportation would be free, since youd only need to find a big leaf, and float on the wind. Roughly. The direction. You hope.   To go! 


We must shrink down to 1%.

	<TEXT> Jon Gruden - 

Sean what I'm gonna do here is break down the failures in that last Toyota ad.

The problems start at the top, and by that I mean the play selection by Junior Vice President of Marketing Norv Turner. Keep in mind Sean that the strength of an ad is to sell something.  And they're playing a song all about not owning! I don't know what they were thinking.

And while we're speaking about the Song, boy, I haven't seen line play this bad in years!

It starts with one line from the verse and jumps immediately to one line from the chorus  And if that's not bad enough, there's some terrible and frankly amateur line play in the middle there. And really, Toyota should take a knee here.  But trying to gain that extra yard, they force one more verse, and that's what's bringing out the boobirds.

Frankly Sean, that ad wasn't just poorly planned, but also poorly executed.

Sean McDonough - 

(Stifly and awkwardly) Thank you, Jon. </TEXT>

One tweak I would suggest, and it sounded like Zom suggested something similar -  more endurance for slower speeds, and possibly a way to stop leveling speed?  As in, maybe I would prefer a horse that's 14 speed but can travel 3k blocks before water?  Where an 18 speed horse would need water every 1.5k blocks?   Or something along those lines?  

I don't necessarily need/want the fastest possible horse.  I would gladly sacrifice some speed if I could travel further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So um.  Any chance there will be some new policy along the lines of - 

"No server events during the first month of a new rev"

Starts of revs seem to see a pickup in new users.  Shouldn't we be displaying what the server is typically like, to those people?  Not "hey here's a stupid turkey you can't attack that shoots fireballs"?  

Maybe admins can come up with some stats that show new player retention is X% higher than past revs, and I should shut up. 

But even for people who have been here for awhile, well, having these turkeys around this early into a rev, when people are trying to build towns/infrastructure?  It's pretty shitty. 

Please let the starts of revs be the typical nerd.nu Vanilla Substitute.  Add events when it's time to keep people around/draw people back.  Not at the very start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hear gambling pundits come on sports radio fairly often, so my takeaway from that line is -

2 is a weird number.  Usually you'd expect 2.5 or 3.5? So why 2? As an away?  And, as you'd put it, -8 if SD was at home.

IMO, Vegas wanted that -2 to be closer to -5.5/-6.5.  (I'm not dissing your team, just saying what I'm seeing from the weird line.)  But they knew if they actually put the line at that, 1) few people would actually put any money on it, and 2) those few who did would probably get fairly large payouts. 

So they put it at -2 in order to get the most people possible taking the Texans, while hinting that they expected the Chargers to win big. </TEXT>

If someone wants the portal, I'm looking to "trade" - yeah yeah it's early rev no one has anything.  So for trade I'm looking for things like if you find a unique spawner (ghast or slime or whatever), you'll let Rose build the grinder for it. Or other things along those lines. 

I didn't explore too much around that area so can't say for sure what other biomes/neat stuff is nearby.  But I can say one map-thing featured in Zomise's preview video isn't *too* far off.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-12 01:34:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **PRE-LAUNCH INFO**

**Portals** - We don't really care, but if you see one, go ahead and claim it, and maybe we can trade it later.  And if you want to keep it for yourself, whatever. 

**Terrain** - Really want desert.  Mesa was discussed, but that's mostly as a backup plan in case there just isn't any desert on the map, or it's too small, or already claimed, etc.  **Note:** we aren't just going to grab the first desert and start building.  We want to find the right terrain. If you find a really weird/lovely/interesting area, take some screenshots and send them to mayors.

**Town Style** - We aren't requiring specific materials.  But we want builds to be mostly light (whites/beiges), with some orange, and sprinkles of reds and darker colors. [Here are some quick and dirty examples](http://imgur.com/a/UwLgU) and [here is the town hall mostly finished kinda](http://imgur.com/a/btUCV)

**Rails** - If 40/pez/other wants to make a complex rail system station, that's fine. But it sounded like others are going to be abandoning the carbon/lite/"smart rails". I was picturing just an old fashioned carts station to the neighbor towns/nearest end+nether portals. 

___________
**POST-LAUNCH INFO**

**Location** - 2100, -1000 - It's a large hilly desert, and we found one of the few iron golem spawners (part of why we built here.)

**Priorities** 

~~**Claim fence** - We're going to do a 200 block radius around the center, square. The later town will have circular walls around the perimeter of the town, inside the claim fence, but just making a square to start.~~ 

**As Usual, NO PERSONAL BUILDS TO START** - All chests/furnaces should be placed by mayors.  Mayors can create personal chests for your personal storage. We will set up early rev storage, please wait until roads/plots are made for houses.

~~**Basic Farm** - need early rev animals/crops.  These will eventually be moved to a better location, but we're a hungryhungry town.  **Update** Tic has finished most of this.~~ Pretty much good to go. 

**Planning** - planning isn't a requirement this rev, but is of course encouraged, especially when it comes to town builds like farms/arenas/etc. Pez has created a rev19 planning space. The server again is oc.blankstare.net - you might need to do /server planning and then /mvtp plan19

**Other Stuff** - TBD

Somewhere in the map we have found and claimed an end portal.

**Rails at y12** </TEXT>

That's a human element that I would say applies equally to any/all of the sports leagues. Goff is terrible, sure (most likely). If I was more familiar with baseball/hockey, I could probably point to similar/recent reaches by teams that failed in those sports.   

Nothing about baseball/moneyball strategy says every pick is going to be a 100% great fit and works perfectly, or the A's would be more than a footnote of a Jonah Hill movie.  

Furthermore, getting the first pick in the NFL draft, as opposed to the third, or fifth, or twelfth, honestly doesn't mean as much as having more picks in general.

It's not about the first pick necessarily.  They can trade that pick. Plenty of dumb teams will trade from #9 to #1 for someone like Goff.  The tanking isn't about #1.  It's about the accumulation.

Tanking will not happen in the NFL without a significant change in that culture, and I don't think it'll happen anytime soon.

I'm suggesting that's happening.  You have not provided evidence to the contrary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) It's pretty near-universally agreed that the run of the Seahawks Super Bowls/near-runs was because they had a shitload of awesome talent on defense for super cheap because of draft picks they got because they were terrible for so long?

2) The Patriots, oh hey, they always have terrible picks because they're awesome, and always trade away lots of their high picks to accumulate more cheap picks. 

3) "in the NFL every player has a role etc" - yeah coaching.  See : Patriots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Manziel pick was before the baseball GM was hired.

RG3 was after.  And RG3 was hired for the league **minimum.**  He paid the lowest possible amount for a player he assumed would be just okay and probably hurt eventually, which is what happened. 

Their brilliant plan for QB was to pay the **minimum amount** to an injury prone quarterback who sat on the bench for the entire last season, and that's not tanking? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But you're applying arguments that should theoretically equally apply to other sports, but saying the NFL is excluded from this.  

There are direct quotes, from some of these MLB GM's, saying they purposely will be horrible to start in order to accumulate young talent.

Single games don't matter.  It's been made clear they are, again, **purposely** tanking to get talent. You say "seem to pick off wins here and there" like they're trying.  If they are, it's the bare minimum. 

Again, the arguments against NFL teams tanking don't really hold water. MLB managers have taken positions in clubs knowing full well that the plan was to tank for 2 years.  Same with NBA head coaches.  And even ignoring other sports, look at the incredibly high rate of turnover in terms of coach/coordinator/staff positions even when those teams are *trying* to win.  "They won't tank for job security" doesn't really work out as a proper argument. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Serious] With a baseball/analytics at GM, are the Browns breaking an NFL taboo and tanking on purpose, following the MLB model? And is that necessarily a bad thing if true? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Note:**  I understand this is a very sensitive topic, hence why I tagged it as serious. I'm just asking for people to keep an open mind to generate discussion. I am not trying to troll.

Tanking in the NFL is a **very** ~~taboo~~ ~~uneasy~~ ~~awkward~~ ~~shit!~~ idea. There's no proper way to emphasize how much all of us hate the idea of it. 

The Browns have hired a GM with a background in baseball/analytics.  Tanking, in baseball, is pretty much considered super duper okay nowadays. The Cubs, A's, Indians, Royals, maybe the Mets...they've all recently taken to the idea of purposely tanking in order to accumulate young talent, with a few key free agents, to make a run of a few years.

There's even a semi-popular quote by one of those GM's (which I'm guessing people more familiar with baseball can quote better), but when he was interviewed he said his plan was "We'll be terrible for the first two years, competitive in year three, a late playoff run in year four, and a world series in year five."

MLB has openly embraced tanking in order to accumulate talent and make a run. The Browns GM is from a baseball/moneyball background.  

Browns fans.  We've just witnessed the Cubs break a 108 year drought.  And they did that by purposely tanking for a few years.  

**TL;DR**  

1) Is it possible that they're tanking on purpose, following an MLB/Cubs/A's/Indians/Royals model?  
2) If so, is it such a big deal? Can you "live with" purposely losing 2-3 seasons if it meant a Super Bowl run?  
3) Why was Kessler taken out tonight?  
4) I didn't even start on how obvious NBA tanking is...   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Scents of the Months : Nov/Dec] Inaugural Thread - Winter Woods </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-10 01:46:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey y'all.  Doing this myself, thought others might be interested. I got tired of all of the generic male scents ("Bold Breeze" or "Fresh and Crisp" etc) so I thought I'd start buying specific scents for various products, focusing on a narrow range/complimentary scents every few months. 

If you felt like joining in, posts of what you bought/where and reviews would be great!

November/December. Fall is coming to a close, Winter is coming. A time to chop wood, sit by the fireplace, stoke a pipe.  So I'm doing woodsy/smokey smells.   

**Note: Links below are not an advertisement or endorsement. I'm not connected in any way to anyone making these products. Found them all just by googling "male (product) (smell)".** 

These are the various things I decided to go with - 

[Wild Man of the Woods Deodorant from an Etsy Dealer](https://www.etsy.com/listing/231354589/wild-man-of-the-woods-deodorant-aluminum?ga_order=most_relevant ga_search_type=all ga_view_type=gallery ga_search_query=Wild%20Man%20of%20the%20Woods%20Deodorant ref=sr_gallery_1) - "The scent is woodsy and spice with clove bud, cedarwood and sandalwood blend."

[3x samples of colognes from mefragrance.com](http://www.mefragrance.com/details.cfm?premixproductid=413 collectionid=6) - Smoke n' Oak, Cheeky Teaky, and Mood for Oud samples to see what (if any) I want to go with.

[Sandalwood and Manuka Gentle Facial Scrub from Koru Naturals](http://www.korunaturals.com/proddetail.php?prod=DCSCR)

[Crabtree   Evelyn Indian Sandalwood Hair and Body Wash from lookfantastic.com](http://www.lookfantastic.com/crabtree-evelyn-indian-sandalwood-hair-and-body-wash-300ml/10970974.html)

[Pipe Smoke Organic Body Lotion](https://www.etsy.com/listing/206938942/pipe-smoke-organic-body-lotion-aloe-shea?ga_order=most_relevant ga_search_type=all ga_view_type=gallery ga_search_query=Pipe%20Smoke%20Organic%20Body%20Lotion ref=sr_gallery_2)

[Manly Indulgence Woodland Escape scented candle](https://www.amazon.com/MANLY-INDULGENCE-Woodland-Escape-Candle/dp/B01LXD4NCL) (actually found this at a TJ Maxx for $8, was also looking for a cheap handsoap there but struckout.)

No reviews yet, since the candle is the only one I have so far (smells nice). 

Edit : ~2 weeks before Jan/Feb I'll make a new post.  Hopefully there people will post reviews of things they bought, as well as possible nominations for the next theme? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the Y and Z motors/sensors are working beautifully, but the X is not. 

If my initial setup has the Extruder carriage pressed up against the X sensor and I do Home All, it sounds like it tries to go left for 1/2 a second (slight grinding noise against the belt), then stops and chills.

But if I, say, have the Z 1/2 way up and in the middle of the X/Y, and I run Home All, the Extruder carriage/X motor sends it all the way to the right (away from the sensor) then starts making grinding noises for a few seconds, then the Y and Z finish aligning perfectly. 

Any ideas why the Extruder assembly always wants to go **away** from the sensor instead of towards it? Is there some reverse switch I accidentally hit on the motor? 

Edit some streamables -

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To start - I don't actually doubt Musk's desire to get to Mars himself. Just a thought that popped into my head.

Colonization. It was a joke in The Martian. But there is reason for governments to worry about this. Can one entity really own all of Mars? Are territories going to be a certain radius around the colony/colonies? 

Governments are going to have to start working out policies regarding this. Otherwise, a situation could develop where a corporation owns Mars. 

And if governments start working out how territories work...they're going to start wanting those territories. Maybe the Russians/Chinese send out 100 really shitty/high failure colonies as a land grab. 

While Musk's Mars Mission hasn't really been much in the mainstream or as a funny side story by some crazy billionaire. But I bet behind the scenes a lot of governments are shitting their pants. 

Even *if* Musk is bluffing, if it prompts governments to take Mars seriously, it's a great thing. </TEXT>

It came out to something like - IF you include the AFL, then San Diego is the worst sports city, with 106 years of combined sports franchises and only one championship. If you don't include the AFL, Buffalo has one hockey championship in 104 combined years of sports I think?

Edit : trying to find it now </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to be *recognized* as the losingest city.  People talk about loser Cleveland, but the Cavs just won.  People talk about loser Chicago, but the Bears have a SB and the White Sox have a WS. 

San Diego has one AFL championship, before joining the NFL, and in the second year of the AFL, before the Broncos decided to own the AFL West until the merger. 

I want recognition that San Diego fans have suffered more than others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, as a San Diego native, I want the Cubs to win just so they can stop whining about being the losingest city in the big 4 sports, despite other teams in that city winning some. (Buffalo has slightly more success than San Diego, and the Cavs just won...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It didn't seem like it was a whole program thing, more like late 3rd/4th quarter. Like they had the levels adjusted, came back from a break and didn't get the mic the right distance, so it started clipping or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At some point during tonight's game I thought I noticed that Gruden's mic seemed better equalized/etc, and McDonough seemed to regularly cause sound issues. After that, Gruden being wacky and all causes a fairly wide range of frequencies, which is theoretically harder to compensate for. But McDonough seemed to have the worse quality.

TL;DR - the audio quality from McDonough seemed terrible compared to Gruden.

Late edit : it seemed like McDonough's mic experienced clipping errors more often, to be more specific. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks to both of you! Yeah desert is really our primary goal.  Mesa is more a backup plan than a secondary plan. And then just plain weird terrain we may or may not be interested in.

	<TEXT> **Portal** - We aren't going for a portal this time.  If we find one, claim it, as it may be worth trading.  But thanks to elytra/good boats/etc, it's not a primary goal.

**Terrain** - We are going for a certain type of terrain.  **Desert first, Mesa as backup.** However, we are also open to other interesting terrains.  Can't really guess what they'll generate for the next map, there may be a neat weird place that we all like. (Edit: green terrain only as a last resort really...)

**Theme** - This rev, we're going to try out a town palette.  We want builds to emphasize a very light color (tans, whites, sandstones, clays wools birch bone etc), with reds/pinks secondary (clays, wools, mushrooms?), and occasional/sparse dark bits (coal blocks, obsidian, wool, etc).

To help clarify, [here are some variations of the overall theme, including possible road designs.](http://imgur.com/a/UwLgU)  First few desert, second few mesa variants.  

**But most important of all** - there is one month until the new rev begins. So if you have any ideas/inspiration for working on road designs, or town hall designs, or farm designs, we'd love your input.  

The images above are just some rough ideas for what might look nice in desert/mesa. Input on designs/colors/etc is always welcome!

**Backup Plan** - Aw crap did we not find any desert/mesa to settle in?  Oh well, I guess we'll just have to settle for making the prettiest goddamn city on the map somewhere else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't get too far into it, so don't take my comment too seriously in terms of the phrase "rip off". There are lots of RPGs/etc that share common elements. So my superficial take was a similarity to that game. 

"Not that that's a bad thing" = I'm glad someone has made a game like this for the phone. 

Please disregard my negative tone :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Neat story bro.  Except it doesn't really address anything at all about the premise of my post, i.e., why does Firaxis/Civ not feel the wrath of anti-DLC? 

I didn't say I was anti-DLC at all, at any point. 

Keep fighting your glorious fight tho.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've purchased hundreds of dollars in dlc in other games, like dota2 and rocket league. Those are finished games with fun extras, which I frequently buy. At launch, I believe civilization has been an unfinished game with the intent of making it complete through dlc/expansions. 

Get off your high horse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last two Civilization games haven't been broken at launch.  But they've both definitely felt incomplete and lacking at launch. And it's obvious that their strategy is to release a base (imo, incomplete) game then release as many DLC's as possible after.

But Civ never seems to get the flak that any other game with DLC does.  </TEXT>
