	<TEXT> Later Thursday, the freshman lawmaker walked across the Capitol plaza and apologized in person. Lesko accepted it, and said she asked him, in the future, to debate her on the merits of legislation.

Well, we try to debate the merits of legislation, but republicans don't hear reason, only money. The legislation is without merit. It takes money away from public schools to give to the 0.1% of parents who would use a voucher to enroll their kids in a privately run, for-profit school. The solution to bad schools is certainly not to defund them. The same as for-profit education only breeds worse schools popping up all over the place in search of free easy money from the government. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife taught in a title 1 school in a lower middle class black neighborhood. Kids came to school with brand new nikes, but no pencils with which to write, and no lunch. There's a cultural disconnect in these communities which has them thinking they'll just be a rapper or basketball star. Their home life is so unstructured that when they grow up, they expect more for less. It's a lack of fathers and positive role models in the communities. All kids need to be taught a work ethic. </TEXT>
