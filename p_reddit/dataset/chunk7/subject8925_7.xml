	<TEXT> That's just untrue and slightly offensive. The only things you know about me are from this AMA. Even if I *come off* as more psychotic than depressed, playing armchair psychiatrist on Reddit is a bit ignorant. Years of therapy have told me that I'm more depressed than attention seeking, more accurately than you can in this post. </TEXT>
