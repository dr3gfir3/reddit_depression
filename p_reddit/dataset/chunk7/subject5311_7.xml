	<TEXT> Some people don't have a brain and think they can fix broken things themselves, for example, "oh man I lost my car keys, now I have to replace the whole steering column, bummer"

We get that call at least once a month, you'd be surprised

	<TEXT> I'm finally back, it's been a while but I've got some new stories for you guys.

So we go out and do work for alot of salvage yards and wreckers. And usually when one of their customers asks about getting keys made, they refer them back to us.

Yesterday, I'm hanging out at the lock shop, as per my usual routine, and a couple guys come in with an entire steering column for a Ford pickup, and ask me to make a key for it. 


Customer: "-town name- auto salvage sent me here, they said you could get me a key for $35 in 10 minutes"

Me: "Well I'll have to look the car up to make sure, but that's normally what we charge. It'll take a little longer than 10 minutes though"

C: "like how much longer are we talking?"

Me: "It's hard to say for that year and model, most likely closer to an hour or more though, but let me look it up real quick"


I look it up and the key had a chip in it, which makes it even more expensive. And since they only have the steering column and not the whole car, I can't make a key using the door locks, which is the 5 minute way. So that means it'll probably take an hour or more, and it'll be the $35 plus the $60 for the key itself. 

Time to break the news.


Me: "Well, the bad news is that since that key needs a chip to work, the key will be another $60 on top of the original $35 to make it"

C: "hang on, -salvage guy- told me that you could make it for 35 and in a few minutes, not a hundred in a couple hours"

Me: "Well I'm sorry, but as that's true in general, I still have to charge the cost of the key if it's chipped. I can make you a regular key for the 35, but it won't start the car."

C: "this is bull$#! , I paid that guy $140 for a useless steering column, now you're gonna charge me another hundred. You just lost a customer."

(P.S. I've never seen him before in my life)


Then he left and slammed the door nice and hard when he did

Such fun, people are </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly it's not hard if you've got the stuff and time. I had my local tech school print the canvas since they're cheaper than any actual store, and building the frame and stretching the canvas are pretty simple. Only thing that took time was painting over the original brush strokes with mod podge to give it texture, but that's optional </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought the ebook and formatted it in Microsoft word to both change the font, and to format it for binding.
Then I used a program to put the pages together into signatures, printed them out on cream colored 11x17 paper, then cord bound it with some 1/2 inch rope. [Picture of the binding](http://i.imgur.com/puMlvzb.jpg)

The cover is made from 3/8 inch pine, and covered with dark brown and chocolate brown leather. Accent pieces are brass with copper rivets going all the way through the wood, I designed them in illustrator and then printed them out and traced them onto brass pieces, then cut them out.

Took about 2 days of on and off work, not counting the time going through and formatting the book  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Steel from thermite </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-11 22:37:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I had an idea recently about taking the process of making bloom steel or wootz steel, and shrinking it from hours down to seconds using thermite.


I ran a few small test batches that went well, then the first real batch was just iron oxide and aluminum powder, 30 grams/10 grams, respectively, and I got a somewhat pure chunk of iron, although there was a crust of aluminum oxide around it.


The next batch I tried was 30 grams iron, then I mixed that well with .4 grams of graphite powder, then added 10 grams of aluminum. The result looked like I've seen bloom steel, with a very porous chunk of metal, almost like a sponge.

 It'd need to be heated and consolidated a few times to be useable, but it's about 26 grams and there seems to be no aluminum in it, so I only lost 4 grams of iron, and it's probably just because a portion of the thermite didn't ignite. I took it to my bench grinder and it sparked like a medium carbon steel would, and if it absorbed all the carbon, which I doubt, it would be about 1.3% carbon, which is ultra high carbon content. The way it sparked, I'd say maybe half that, so about .6% carbon.

My next try was to make it bigger, and add more carbon. 200 grams of iron oxide, mixed with 8 grams of carbon, which is 4%, so if it works out the same as before, I should end up with almost 2% carbon steel. After that was thoroughly mixed, I added 90 grams of aluminum, mixed that, then lit it. I ended up with a nice sized chunk, but it looks like the steel and aluminium didn't completely separate.

The bottom, solid part, seems to be mostly ferrous(i moved around the whole thing with a magnet), while the top fluffy looking part is not at all, so I'm guessing all the steel melted to the bottom whole the aluminum mostly sat on top. I'm away from my grinder so I haven't spark tested it yet.

Has anyone here messed with thermite at all, and dies anyone have any tips on a way to keep the steel/iron and aluminum separate? Or to separate it afterward? </TEXT>
