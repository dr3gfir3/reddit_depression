	<TEXT> Meanwhile, according to South Korean media, residents of the DPRK say goodbye to each other, to their homes, to their places of work, to forests and fields, to the sky, rivers, etc as if the nation prepares for a large-scale war. At the same time, it is forbidden to say goodbye to officers of law enforcement agencies. It is also strictly forbidden to mention the names of national leaders in words of farewell. 

This is strange.  

Edit:

Sorry guys, when I was looking for alternative sources I found the quote above. Didn't realize something similar wasn't in the article linked. [Here's the article I got the quote from](http://www.pravdareport.com/hotspots/conflicts/12-04-2017/137480-pyongyang_evacuation-0/). I don't know anything about this source, but it's the only other place I found writing about this.    

Second edit:

I thought I would use this to update anyone wondering wtf is going on. I don't know and a lot of media don't exactly know. The reports of people being moved from the capital may be false. **Here's what is known**:

BNO Desk - ["What did happen: Foreign journalists were told to leave the hotel before dawn for a "big event." They were not allowed take devices w/them."](https://mobile.twitter.com/BNODesk/status/852302318305517568)

[Additional source from Reuters on this](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN17E2CT)

It's noted that it does not mean it will actually be a large event (though that's not very reassuring).

United should have never allowed the situation to come to that in the first place. It wasn't pre-flight boarding where he was being booted, he already had his seat. United should have offered more compensation for volunteers or found alternative plans for their employees. A car from Chicago to their destination would have been less time and money compared to this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My whole company was talking about this today. Majority of us are frequent flyers for work and agreed we will never fly with them again. Fuck them.  

Edit: I'm not saying this as an empty threat out of anger. We used to have a company Uber account that we cancelled and switched to another ride share app after the recent events with Uber. The alternatives are a bit more expensive, but it's worth it. I'm very thankful to have a down-to-earth CEO that genuinely cares about people.  </TEXT>

Edit: I am aware of r/video's subreddit rules. I do not know why, if it violated the rules, they waited until it was the top post on r/all to take it down. The post had been up for 6-7 hours before being removed. That is one of the main reasons this is being called out.  </TEXT>
