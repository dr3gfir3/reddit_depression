	<TEXT> She/we don't trust her mother to effectively watch him. She drinks and gets distracted. FIL isn't much better. She could leave him with her MIL (husband's mom). But that would still leave her vehicle across the country, unless they tow it. She's also afraid to fly (she never has) and she's worried she won't be able to handle that with her son. I've considered taking some time off work to fly out there and help. I think when I moved across the country, a 10ft truck with a tow was about $1600, so that might be the best option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, my husband and I did NM to FL, and then FL to CA, so we're well versed with that. I think where we are having issues is that my nephew is involved and needs to be in a carseat, so just a Uhaul isn't plausible. I check out U-Haul boxes and its saying about $1500 for the smallest one they have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's definitely an option, but I think that would cost a lot more. We would have to pay to have the car shipped, and a Uhual (that would have to be driven by her parents, since she will have to fly or get a rental car because of her son) and then a rental car/plane ticket. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I'll try and keep this short and sweet. My sister in law is going to be leaving her husband. Their current home is in Fort Campbell, KY. She will be moving into my home with her 1 1/2 year old son. We live in Palmdale,CA. 

We are trying to figure out how to get her stuff from point A to point B. I've looked at a few companies and it looks as though its going to be extremely expensive. This is for pack and ship companies.

The next option is for her to drive with her son and mom, while her dad drives a Uhaul. This might be the most cost effective option, but her current vehicle isn't in the best shape, so we aren't sure it could make the trek out here. Towing isn't really an option because of her son.

Do you guys have any advice as to what our options are? She's going through a rough time and we are trying to make it as painless as possible. Please and thank you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, my husband and I have been rat parents for exactly a week. I noticed that one of our two female rats was gaining weight faster than our other one. I made a comment along the lines of "I bet she's pregnant. I hope not!" Husband responds" Nah, she's just fat!"

Sure as shit,  I come home from work today and my husband informs me that she was infact pregnant and had babies today! We were slightly unprepared for this lol.

Is there anything we should look out for? We have the two females in the same cage. ...Do I have to worry about her eating her babies? Are there any things we should get to make them all more comfortable?
Thanks in advance :) </TEXT>

I find that it does dull the flavor a tad bit, but I just use it for flavoring water, so it's not that big of a deal to me. If I actually need juice for a recipe, I'll just juice a fresh one :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That its fucking retarded to have a $35k wedding. Starting your marriage with a slice of debt like that is not smart. Buy a car. Down payment on a house. Even if a side of the family will be paying, don't do it. They'll always have something to hold over your head. 

Wait a few years before you have kids. A lot of people don't seem to understand that when you get married, things do change. It takes a few years to fully notice these things. 

Divorce is not the worst thing in the world. If you don't Iove each other anymore, don't stay together. Be civil and go your separate ways. Move on. </TEXT>

okay, so, as it's been said before, trump has been friends with th clintons for a loooong time. Word in the street is that he had a very long phone call with Bill Clinton about a month before he announced he was running. My theory is that try came up with "make the GOP look as crazy as possible. Shake the system. Make them vote for you. Tell them what they want to hear. When it comes to the general and you're up against hillary, drop out. Secure the White House for her." This also plays into trump identifying as a democrat most of his life. 

It might be a stretch, but it seems plausible at the same time. I don't think they thought people would get behind him in the way that they are. I don't think they counted in Bernie either lol </TEXT>

As much as we disagree with Trump supporters, is it really our place to say a rally should be shut down?

	<TEXT> I swear, if anyone from this subreddit was apart of this Trump protest, I'm going to be pissed. This is making us look incredibly stupid

EDIT: Yes, you all have a right to protest. There's a difference between standing across the street with signs and actually being inside. Even if you don't support Trump, his supporters have every right to be there to here them speak.

I fully understand what Black Lives Matter is portraying. I'm also getting tired of hearing about them interrupting rallies, charging stages, and getting violent. That, to me, is feeding into the problem.  Go ahead, downvote me for having a different opinion.
