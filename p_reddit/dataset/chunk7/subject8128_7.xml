	<TEXT> I agree that the situation has a lot more factors but those grunts stuck in a HMMWV have little control over their part in the mission and many times they won't even be given the bigger picture. All they know is "sit at this intersection and stop all traffic." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I actually had a tripod but there were a lot of other people up in the tower with me and I didn't want to be rude and hold them up for too long. Rushed the pictures and didn't get the composition I was looking for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love the pictures. I feel like the last one might look good in black and white if you tinker with it to get some pleasing contrast, the tones will need a lot of seperation I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a hobbyist for a little over a year now, approaching two years I think. I don't get out to take pictures as often as I'd like but I should be able to keep up with this class.

This is my current favorite picture, took it when I was fooling around with a super cheap lens. I like how the gazebo looks distinct from everything else in the picture. I would like to go back and adjust the lens flare in the bottom left corner though - https://imgur.com/gallery/aJWIZ

I wish this one had turned out better but I was rushed and freezing - https://imgur.com/gallery/IFm09

I'm not really sure what I love but I do enjoy walking around, relaxing and taking photos around cities when it's not busy (at night).

	<TEXT> We tried to get an angled picture of the bridge from one side because there was so many people on it and we knew we would be way too hung over to wake up early. When we got to the spot we discovered that people were feeding birds and my buddy was getting agitated about not being able to get a shot, he tried for about 10 minutes. I didn't really try but I did [snap a picture of the bird feeders.](https://flic.kr/p/QmdrjL) </TEXT>
