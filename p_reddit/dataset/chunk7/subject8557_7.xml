	<TEXT> The Athenians sophists thought that a constitutional monarchy was best. They believed that a democracy would allow for demagogues to manipulate public opinion. That Tyranny would lead to oppression. The Spartans led a life of idealistic socialism, and could afford to do so by subjecting the neighboring city state to slavery to produce their food and goods. The Romans had a system where the wealthy enjoyed a voting system which gave them a greater percentage of the vote than the middle and lower classes(rich got 3/5 voting power and others got less). I don't know what's best though.  </TEXT>

Wages have experienced inflation, however the rates of inflation for wages are lower than other markets. Healthcare, food, housing and other sectors of the market have had their prices go up significantly more than wages have. I remember seeing a graph  from one of my economics courses but a failed google search for the statistics for 15 minutes just helped me realize that an education actually does have some value.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You realize that you have made an ad hominem attack on a person questioning your credibility, don't you? But you asked for this so lets do it.


There is no mention of Jesus before he was thirty and he lived "the hero motif". That is, he was born under a prophecy, nobody knows what happened until he was 30, he performed all sorts of unearthly miracles, died at the hands of injustice under a great empire and was resurrected among others, which escape my memory as I write this on mobile without my sources. Many other mythological figures lived this motif, Gilgamesh comes to mind, but there are 5 to 6 others in various religions throughout the world as well who lived the motif.


It is notable that a person who lived such a life performing miracles and whatnot was not mentioned by any Roman author during his lifetime in a time kmown for abundant roman authorship. In fact, none mention him until about 4 decades after his death. Ok, nbd, right? 


Well, you'd think so, but scholars know that jews in the region where Jesus came from worshipped as a sect the 'messiah Joshua'. What does Jesus's name translate into from Ancient Greek? It translates to the messiah Joshua. These Jews believed that the messiah Joshua symbolized peace and love for all mankind and that this messiah was the spiritual embodiment thereof. Somehow it seems a leap was fabricated between the metaphysical Messiah Joshua and the flesh and bone Jesus Christ son of god.

So, the one writer who did live and write during Jesus's time was Peter. However, the more one reads peter, the more it becomes obvious that he, in the vast majority of cases, could be speaking of Jesus in a spiritual or metaphysical sense and demonstrably not in the physical sense.

So, now I have the asserted that the messiah joshua was the spiritual embodiment of peace and love for humanity before Jesus and that jews were worshipping the messiah Joshua before the transformation to Jesus Christ as we know him, well, postulated, as I do not have my sources at hand. But I would be more than happy to return  to this when I do if in return you profess your ignorance on the matter of Socrates, which you have so well avoided until now. I will return to this with sources to not only counter your claim that Socrates didn'texist but also to bring to light the significant shortcomings of the Jesus ideology. Frankly, I don't expect you to respond.
