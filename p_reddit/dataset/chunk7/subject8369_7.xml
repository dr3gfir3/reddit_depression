	<TEXT> The science of zyklon b wasn't complex or ground breaking than the experiments mengele conducted had scientific merit - which is to say non or little. The industrial infrastructure was unique only in its application to murdering humans. 

Eugenics was a fashionable topic among educated westerners but it wasn't based in anymore sound science than other Nazi beliefs like Nazi understandings of race or even history. The lesson of the dangers of nazism was not the dangers of science, but rather the dangers of pseudoscience and propoganda. I don't see nazism as the out growth of the heady early days of modern science...

It was an exercise in modern propoganda,  nationalism, pseudo scientific race theory.... it was the use of false pseudoscience to sell racial biases and dehumanizes fellow humans. 

There is a difference between Nazi undertakings and homophobia or racism in the US. There is difference between action t4 and US sterilization programs. And there is a difference between the work of mengele and the Tuskegee experiments. 

The difference is intent, scale and ferocity... don't get me wrong, America and the west have their own sins. Belgium maimed and slaughtered the Congo. The Americans slaughtered and robbed the native Americans, enslaved and subjugated Africans. The English have more than a few sins of colonilaism under their belt. 

But never did they succumb to a drive to exterminate races and countries and classes of people or see them as not human...

It is important to remember that science and economics are but tools of a society to answer questions but themselves do not impart values or reason... they are, in a functional republic, best used in service to the elightenment principles of modern society. 

It is important to recognize the Nazi regime as not one of mad science but of pseudo science mated with propoganda in the service of a cult... Nazi understanding of race was outdated even by 1940s standards and their understanding of history was also based in myth... we must be suspicious whenever science is used to push or define ethics, or values the same way we must be suspicious when economics becomes a means onto itself.

It is the institutions of rule of law, codes defining civil rights, the free press, functional education system, separation of church and state, checks and balances, free elections, etc are so important. They are what help define the needs and questions science and economics can answer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If your read about the people involved, many of them were executed, some rapidly, some six months later, but you also start to realize when reading about their experiences that they were in the minority - not just in their willingness for active resistance, but in their refusal to accept the legitimacy of the nazi state and policies... only after the reversals of Stalingrad did some doubt enter the populace. Nazi Germany is an instructive cautionary tale of the horrors a modern society can commit if it is not careful in minding and protecting its democratic and media institutions, or countering blind nationalism or racism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And it was wrong. It is important to recognize and understand that social mores and ethics evolve over time, often to reflect social needs as well as our evolving understanding of science and humanity. 

But what the germans did was unique and special in the annals of atrocities. Salin murdered millions and so did Mao. There were contemporaries of Hitler who were as cruel and oppressive. But the difference is they murdered for political ideology, or out of mismanagement of resources etc. Stalin went after Jews. Mao annexed Tibet and persecuted monks. Even the Japanese, who raped and pillaged across Asia, who conducted biochemical weapons tests on Chinese cities, who also exhibited wanton cruelty and violence towards those they occupied, never quite reached Nazi level plans for extermination, murder and torture. 

Hitler industrially murdered his own and neighboring peoples because he felt them to be subhuman. He intentionally drew up plans to murder 100s of millions. To wipe out countries, cultures, and people. His regime medically experimented on its victims on a wide scale with wanton cruelty. They created factories to murder people. It was cold, calculated, and planned atrocity powered by early computers and the industrial revolution.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lebensraum
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalplan_Ost
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Order_(Nazism)

That is what unique, pol pot murdered millions, Rwanda also its genocide... all terrible occurrences perpetrated by terrible men, but unique to the annals of modern history is Hitler's plan for systematic eradication of millions and planned eradication of 100s of millions using purpose made industrial infrastructure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am aware of the white rose movement. There was resistance to Nazism on multiple levels, from students to generals. Some did it to protest atrocities, some did it because they disagreed with military and economic policy. But what is important to remember is that they were in the minority and that there was at the least acquiescence and likely broad support for the general plans and policies of the nazi regime if not for the practical details of what went on in concentration camps and battlefields.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure antisemtism was not unique to Germany, and murdering Jews was not unique either. But German plans for extermination of the Jews and also for colonization of Eastern Europe, displacement of entire countries and atrocities was unique to Germany and Japan in the modern era. 

Stalin for all the horrors and murder he did was not seeking to exterminate and replace entire popoulations. 

Nazi germany divided the races and saw much of humanity as sub human and therefore ok to exterminate or enslave. And Nazi propoganda and tenants were pretty clear on that count. 

To suggest th German people had no knowledge of what we happening or weren't at least passively complicit is a rewriting of history.

The German soldiers spearheading tank divisions across western Europe and slaughtering everything along Eastern Europe were not fighting a defensive war. They were conquering territory and people to be remade along the Nazi model and that meant the slaughter of Jews and later the slavs... followed by the subjugation of the French and English... the concentration camps were developed when it became clear that having frontline German divisions shoot Jews was costly and taking its toll on german soldiers. Extermination camps for Jews were to trial the technology to wipe out the majority of Eastern Europeans. The holocaust was the warm up act...

There were 3000 concentration camps in Germany. Jews vanished from the popoulation. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers participated in either burning village in Eastern Europe and shooting Jews to runninga concentration camps... box cars of people vanished into the east... the German knew on some level what was happening if not exact details. 

I do not say this to suggest that Germans are somehow fundamentally morally deficient as a people, but as a case study of what humanity can do when it acquiesces to authoritarianism, nationalism and racial division... 

When you define the other as subhuman, when you get caught up in the perceived collective greatness of your own, when you let propoganda dictate your reality, when you let fear drive policy and when you allow dissent to be suppressed you can put entire societies at risk for collective madness... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess, recordings and transcripts of german soldiers from POW camps suggest more than a passing level of anti-Semitism and commitment to the Nazi mission. Remember, many of these 18-24-year-olds had spent the formative years of their life, really their entire teens, under nazi propaganda... this hearkens of the clean wehrmacht myth and really, in my opinion, misses the most chilling lesson of WWII regarding the banality of evil. 

And while this phrase, coined about eichman, missed eichman's chillingly unrepentant sociopathy, it is a useful way of understanding that a relatively modern western nation, through the exploitation of existing racial biasis and divisions, nationalism, propaganda, with some facilitating socio-economic factors, can become a machine which conducts the slaughter of their own and neighboring peoples on an industrial scale.

These soldiers aren't defending the river rhine, they are defending the beaches of normandy and conquered french territory, in the same way that they burned and murdered entire russian villages and shot and rounded up entire cities of Jews.

Nazi propaganda was about granting Germans living space... the Germans knew this, it was outlined in mein kampf and called for at the least displacement of 100s of millions and in practice the murder of those people. The holocaust was the warm up act. 

To pretend that the german soldiers were some average joes protecting their homes misses the point... a point that should be a sobering reminder about the dangers of unchecked propaganda, flaming sectarian and racial divides, and dismantling the institutions of government/democracy/free press etc...

These are mainly articles about leadership being bugged, don't remember where its was about rank and file POWs...

	<TEXT> Multiple pronged approach:

1) Pathway to citizenship for those here who have been lawfully abiding, non-violent citizens, particularly dreamers.. including probationary period etc. and some fee/ back tax.

2) National employment verification system, if you cannot earn money, you won't come here. Punishment for employers clearly violating system, including jail time and penalties. Companies employing illegal immigrants can risk losing eligibility for government contracts.

3) A system for tracking those who overstay visas, new rules going forward regarding overstaying visas and ban for future eligibility for citzenship x 10 years (or something like that).

4) Reassessment of the quotas/ how our immigration system works. H1, J1, guest worker programs etc. 

5) Engagement of latin america in further bilateral trade agreemens and support of democratically elected governments and forces in Latin America (better conditions in Latin America = less incentive for immigration while better US trading partner and market for US goods). 

6) End war on drugs, sensible drug policy, Marijuana legalization to starve latin american gangs of money... less gang violence in hondrus and mexico = less drive for immigration. Investment in drug programs in use to treat addicts/ social interventions to decrease drug demand. Better controls on money and guns flowing south.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's complicated... 

1) the parents... they are looking for a better life for their kids, sometimes this is the only chance of that. They broke law, true, but they have been here for a decade. If they are law abiding social economiclly contributing people while they be sent back? Maybe... there are a lot of considerations, like will they be murdered or jailed in their home country or will they simply be poor. But also, what about their children?

2) The children... well this has parts a and b.
a) Brought as children, also illegals but did they have the capacity or agency to decide their own fate? They grew up here, they can't function in their home country, should they be punished for their parents sins?
b) kids born here, American citizens, in sending their parents back you hurt them and they are American citizens and I guess the government should work to protect their interests too... they are here to stay so don't we want them have stable secure upbringings so later they are functional members of society.

At the end of the day, this issue requires some pragmatism.... and black and white, this is wrong and his is right is not helpful in untangling a complex mess. Deporting any large fraction of these people will be enormousness costly and destabilizing to entire cities and communities and the economy... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess, maybe if we had sensible immigration policies and a different reality on the ground... but what you have is 11 million undocumented migrants, around 50% of whom who landed in airports and overstayed their visas. 

Deporting them would be grossly destabilizing to businesses. 

They have children who are US citizens and stranding those kids would also hurt the economy. 

Some of them came as children with no knowledge of what they were doing and grew up in America so have not experience or ability to survive in their "home countries". 

This situation is clearly complex. Meanwhile, they live here, are victims of crimes, drive, function in society, etc... and aggressively going after them pushes them further into shadows leading to abuses, crimes, and further depresses wages. 

Maybe I was flippant about the fruit, but the black and white, they broke a law, woe to them, lets shit on them as humans and deport them to countries with socio-economic instability whose language they don't speak is not a solution either. 

Or what is your solution, round up 11 million, send em back, build a wall and hope for the best? Does anyone think that will actually end well? </TEXT>

Bannon and company are fascist... with an ideology beyond government size or function but goes after the heart of what government is and can do. For them the ends justify the means. The only truth is their own, and they really don't see many Americans as Americans...

	<TEXT> Most decisions are based on experience or what seems right. It's a rapid easy decision, it does not require systematic empirical analysis and logic based objective decision making. That process is unpleasant and diffult for people and most people never learn to do it. Similiary, certain language and mathematical concepts are required like complex language skills and understanding of probability and null hypothesis to frame the decision. These are diffult and unpleasant ways of approaching a problem and need teaching. Similiary reading is hard for a developing brain and so is math etc. Moreover, all these jobs require learning impulse control and sitting through parsing through long tracts of boring info looking for relevant pieces of information. That is a skill of its own too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An exam forces people to structure an argument and to recall information obtained from previously defermened lecture and materials... even in an open book test you can't look up everything and doing a real internet search is to slow... and won't give answers to more challenging problems. You just can't get around know Ling fundamentals... knowing trigonometric identities for example means when solving problems you can recall that took and substitute as necessary... if you don't know it, you can't even realize to look it up. The ability to look up info rapidly does not substitute fundamentals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Logical thought is unpleasant while intuiting solutions gives most people a small high. Similiary reading and structured writing ar initially unpleasant because they require a high cognitive load and are not natural processes for the human brain. Watch a kid learn to read... it's hard, their attention wanes, they get antsy. Compare that to iPad games, intuitive, easy, colorfuls.... they can do it for hours... why? One is hard and confusing with delayed reward, one is immediate reward, easy, intuitive... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree, education needs to teach 4 fundamental skills, reading comprehension, writing (vocabulary, grammar, attention structure), empirical thought (scientific method, probability, supporting your argument), mathematics. 

These are unpleasant to learn simply because they require a type of thought that is not intuitive. It's a reprogramming of the brain that allows for more complex thought and allows functioning in modern complex jobs. It will require painful, rote learning... memorizing vocabulary, memorizing grammar, practicing writing, memorizing foundational math principles, reading boring passages and extracting info, doing repetitive physics and science problems. It sucks but it lays the foundation for future awesome endeavors like programming, science research, medicine etc..

Then schools need to teach additional things that benefit society by creating a common value system: civics, history, economics,  etc...

The problem in American schools is not breadth but that it graduates utterly lack concrete skills... suffer from lack of reading, writing and mathematics ability... no clue or skills to undertake self directed learning and no understanding of the rigour and approach to learning complex skills.

Problem is those  are the jobs that need workers and pay well. We have a plethora of grads with broad educations and no concrete skills...

Moreover, who would she invade? Drone strikes she would likely continue as well as special forces ops, but there was never any suggestion of Hilary invading Iran and the idea that she was out to start war with Russia was fantastical.

Meanwhile trump has no clue what he is doing, is alienating allies, and picking fights and likely looking for a reason to further ban immigration. He is as likely to start war of on accident as he is to start war because of ego or incompetence. 

Hilary was a stateswoman regsrdless of her other draw backs. Trump has no concept of statesmanship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Democratic Party wants to offer things that will help people who don't have wealthy to catch up... 

1) Bernie wanted free college education - I don't agree but it was an idea. In any case democrats want to improve public education. Republicans have a reasonable point in that teachers unions can be obstacles to change. Dems are also less into teacher accountability (not good). In any case the ideal would be every child gets some baseline standard meaningful education... we can debate how. Betsy Davos and her commitment to faith based learning and anti public education is not going to be helpful. Basically the vast majority of Americans cannot write, cannot do math or program at the levels necessary for competitiveness in the modern workforce.

2) minimum wage. Dems want people at the bottom some guaranteed minimum living wage that profitable corporations can afford. Simply while people are retraining or looking to expand their career or just trying to survive this will make a big difference to working class people.

3) health care. If you are not healthy you can't retrain or work or function and with the risk of healthcare costs over people heads it's a problem. Furthermore it stifles entrepreneurship because people need to stay employed by a large corporation to maintain h with insurance for themselves and families. Shitty and no insurance gets in the way of people getting the care they need so they can function. We need to join every other developed nation with some kind of universal health care, or at least keep improving obama care. The republicans are out to screw poor people on health care... the republican debate audience recently applauded that if people can't pay they should die in the streets.

4) income inequality. The wealthy stay wealthy because per the recent book by Thomas Pikketty RG, or capital grows faster than wages. US wages are stagnant, wage laborers have been shafted. Increasing income inequality kills social mobility, poor kids can't compete. Add in the erosion of public supports like insurance, education etc and the poor are screwed.

5) globalization is irreversible, things are too interconnected, it's too profitable and too effective. Any country not partaking will fall behind. Out capitalist economy and modern consumptive life style can't handle isolation. But their will be winners and losers. In the 90s and 00s no body wanted to help the losers, and they are now angry. They were also promised their jobs and prominence back by successive republican campaigns... it hasn't and won't happen. They need retraining programs but also to accept reality.

 6) infrastructure spending. We  need need to all the belief that we are ever on war footing. We need a smaller and leaner military and the industrial complex is out of control. Instead we need investment in civilian infrastructure... high speed internet, alternative energy, modern smart grid, high speed rail, better roads, etc... the foundations of a modern economy. No one expects roads or airports or sports stadiums to pay for themselves, why are other projects helps to the standard... like public transport. The poor and elederlt are tied to their cars which cost a huge part of their income, if they lose their license that are screed, and if there is an accident the liability is huge. We need better infrastructure that helps the poor, creates blue collar jobs, stimulates the economy... 

7) global warming warming... should be #1, but it's the republicans maybe can start by acknowledging it's a thing.

Etc, etc.... the dems have strong plans for all these issues, some republicans do too, there is room on these issues for a balance of progressive and conservative approaches...

Trump meanwhile is busy repealing laws banning oil companies from bribing foreign powers, coal comlanies from polluting streams, pointless orders against refugees, repealing obama care and appointing a cabinet of billionaires, oil and finance tycoons and military folks late of the military industrial complex to his cabinet. He is degrading the institutions of truth, the media, rule of Law etc...

Meanwhile, rust belt and southern voters think their coal and factory jobs are going to magically come back... in the meanwhile all solar manufacture has gone to china and Taiwan, we don't even know how to make high speed trains, and so but not investing in infrastructure smartly we are behind in global manufacturing and imaging that 50s era employment models are coming back... they are not any more than Boston, Camden or Brooklyn will be shipyards ever again... or large numbers of blacksmiths will make horse shoes or peope will make horse carriages etc, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The republicans have been professionally playing victim for years.

I agree though, we do need to reach out to southern and rust belt voters and say, yes, automation and globalization has left you behind and this is why the policy proposal of the Democratic Party will help you and your families.

But the other side of trump, the lies, the propoganda, the corruption and the attack on institutions needs to be pushed back against. 

And we cannot let those southern and rust belt Americans hold the rest of the country hostage. 

Coal is over. Manufacturing jobs are not going to employ or support the middle class. Even blue collar jobs will require increasingly complex math, reading comprehension and empirical thinking skills. Modern cars and machinery will be complex and digital. 

Our economy will need to adapt... it means protections for low wage workers, healthcare for people and an affordable cost, it means create ways for small and local businesses to survive and flourish, it means energy efficiency etc...

But that requires telling people the truth. That means restoring respect for science and expertise. So honestly, until those "hardened" blue collar white folks in these communites stop being special snowflakes and recognize that their industries are gone and they need to move on and vote for a party that actually cares about their lives and existence but less about their right to shoot things... well in the meanwhile we need to push back against trump. 

Attack his ego. Hold him accountable. Smother him with his own need for validation. Wreck his businesses through boycotts. Because trump does not care what the rust belt and southern folks think of him. He cares what the manhattan elite and the Hollywood stars and the tech czars think of him...  and they see him as dirt... an intellectual light weight, an uncultured con man, a C level celebrity and every day they let him know that will hoepfully push him to impeachable offense territory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, liver breaks down (metabolizes) alcohol, gets better at breaking it down with time by increasing the machinery available to process the alcohol. The problem is, this machinery can process more alcohol into toxic breakdown processes that can damage your liver. The metabolic process itself can also hurt the liver. 

 With time, your alcohol activates a certain pathway in your brain (GABA), with chronic heavy use your brain adjusts to decreasing your response to alcohol by making fewer receptors available. The problem is that for alcoholics who stop drinking abruptly, the system is clamped down, so without alcohol, it is under-activated. The problem is this system down-regulates brain activity,  so that is why in alcohol withdrawal you get quickened heart rate, high blood pressure, tremor, sweatiness, delusions, and seizures... until your brain adjusts or is weaned from the alcohol your brain is basically overexcited unless some agent is stimulating your gaba system... be it alcohol, benzos, barbs, or propofol... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, you failed to see the point. Yes, murder is murder, state sanctioned or not. But it is more of a problem if the organs of state security are murdering the journalists and opposition of their own country because it means that the mechanisms to establish oversight and control of said organs are degraded. It's a break down of rule of law and oversight and it means a break down of democracy. The fsb continues to kill with impunity their own and also people abroad with direct orders from putin and no democratic oversight. American agencies do bad things but they are not comparable to the fsb. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> American conduct in Latin America was shameful. It hurt people, weakened what should have been a close relationship with potentially strong economic and political ties. It cost our economy money by hurting trading partners, opened them up to Chinese invetment, created political instability, supported murder and torture, and created some of the instability that drives today's illegal immigration.

But, it's worse when they do it to your own opposition and journalist and citizens.  Or because Americans matter more but because it means the mechanisms to curtail these actions and drive change are lost. It's a sign of the compete loss of rule of law. Sure FBI had files on MLK and other civil rights and liberal acting activists. It was not good. But US residents or citizens were not jailed, murdered or tortured at home or abroad... yes obama drone striked that guy and his child and it created an uproar. To compare the CIA and FSB as somehow equivalent is a stretch and intellectually dishonest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out law? No need, use republicans approach, which is economic incentive. Heavier trucks damage roadways more, use more fuel. So raise the gas tax, scale road tax by weight, tax cars at time of sale based on efficiency numbers. To avoid screwing farmer or business they you have a deduction or exemption for commercial vehicles or demonstrated need. A) small trucks might make a comeback b) people will but vehicles that make sense because the negative externalities from truck ownership will be represented in the cost shifting the cost vs utility curve and the supply and demand curves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The restrictions are stringent because breathing in he particulate smog from diesel emissions is terrible and harder to clean up than gas. Look at  European city centers... we don't want to go back to that... I was all for diesel and going to by a diesel golf until then VW thing. 

Biodiesel is kind of a dead end. The energy and carbon foot print of growing corn for fuel is huge and we don't have enough arable land in the world to replaceme oil. Now fan stalks from can sugar production can work in places like Brazil  but import tariffs into US are too steep for it to be economically viable, still not going to replace oil, still has a carbon foot print. </TEXT>
