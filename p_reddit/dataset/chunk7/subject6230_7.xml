	<TEXT> In some situations, yes, but that argument doesn't really apply when you're talking about tsunamis, earthquakes or unavoidable poverty, where immediate death is the problem and there's literally no solution. I'm talking about needless tragedy. Cancer could be another example. Happens completely randomly, if God was all-powerful he could just get rid of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We were talking about this in my Philosophy class today; all monotheistic religions (iirc) regard God as three things, omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing) and omnibenevolent (all-loving). However, only two of these three qualities can be true, for if God is all-knowing, all-powerful and all-loving, why does evil exist in the form of natural disasters, poverty, droughts, famine etc. God would either have to not be omniscient so that he is unaware of these evils going on, or not omnipotent so he doesn't have the ability to intervene, or not omnibenevolent so that he simply doesn't care. It is logically impossible for all three things to be true, and God intervening in evils such as these doesn't contradict Free Will as the evils listed aren't caused by humans. </TEXT>
