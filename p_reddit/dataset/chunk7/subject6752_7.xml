	<TEXT> FALSE NEWS! 

In all seriousness, I've been jailbreaking since the iOS 4 days and I do know what I am speaking about. 

You are vulnerable by jailbreaking. Example is SSH. If you install SSH without changing root password (believe it or not, many people don't change that) gg. 


The attacks you previously used to gain root access are still open. If your phone falls into the wrong hands then 
\\\_()\_/ 

About performance, it is hindered. Anemone was the culprit of being a CPU hog in the past weeks (although that was fixed).

	<TEXT> Yeah, that obvious step has some *obvious* flaws to it. Such as being vulnerable to attacks that granted me root in the first place, performance being hindered, and among other things. As a fellow jailbreak user, jailbreak is not an obvious step like you say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I saw an ad on Facebook and most of the comments were overwhelmingly negative claiming that these headphones are trash and only last a few months before they stop working.

If you were to follow the comments in Reddit, Facebook and pretty much the internet, you wouldn't have an Apple product and Apple wouldn't be a thing by now. I wouldn't even have the iPhone 7 and the Macbook Touchbar if I followed what people say here \\\_()\_/ 

The headphones aren't trash, people have different uses. If you take care of your things then the Beats will last a long time.

As an user of both, here is a few reasons:

1-) For developers, MacOS is similar to Linux (shell). MS doesn't offer that natively. Python runs out of the box on Mac but you might need extra tools on MS.

2-) [Best Support for their machines.](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/03/10/apple-tech-support-showdown/)

3-) One of the best trackpads (if not the best) in the game

4-) Hardware working with the Software. Not just basic things like keyboard backlit. You can get that on a Surface, but not on other things. 

5-) Arguably, good design and durable hardware. A Mac can easily last 6+ years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Such as?

Something that pops in my head is that you buy something and you get a tracking number. Let's imagine you just bought a $10k computer. Of course you don't want anybody to steal it from you and stuff. 

Anyways, now imagine I bought your history. USPS, for example, has the tracking number in the URL, so since you visited that to track your package, I know when is it coming, via who, and I can do a plan to steal it from you. All I had to do is buy your history. 

 What would happen to me if that happens?

If what happens? The negative impact? Look at an example above. 

 but does it really matter if it doesnt affect you?

Well, it does affect me, because is either, we all get our net history sold to somebody, or we all don't. AFAIK this isn't an opt out thing. I definitely don't want people to buy my, or my family's history. We don't do anything bad, but I don't want people to snoop in on whatever the fuck we do.  </TEXT>

Yes, which brings me to the next point, how bad is a W in a transcript? Will it get overwritten if I take the same class again? This can be an option for me. 

 to mention will your professor even let you retake it later?

That's what I don't know. We will discuss it tomorrow. 

 Maybe you can ask if you can take it early

I actually wanted to propose that to him. Maybe I can take it next Friday and learn whatever he is going to give us on April 1st, during the week. 

 you could change just your flight and meet your family later.

Seems like this is the route we will go if nothing comes out of this.

Maybe this was a bad strategy, but this is why I did it. To tell my profs that this was a surprise trip, and that my birthday is on Spring Break as well. 

I will try convincing him to let me take it on the Friday before I leave, or after I come.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Greetings /r/college!

On April 1st, I am leaving the country for two weeks. I will miss one week of class (the other is Spring Break). 

All of my professors of my weekday classes are okay with it, as I won't be missing out much (only 2 hours of lecture, which I can catch up with a book or with friends). However, with my Saturday classes, I will be missing 4 hours, not 2. My Saturday class is a "double period" class so one class counts as two. Since I will be gone for 2 weeks, I will be missing 8 hours, as opposed to 2 of other classes. 

On April 8th, I have exam 2 of this class, and I failed the first one (my professor drops 1 out of 3 tests), so if I want to have a chance of passing, I should take exam 2 and try to pass it. Since I will be out of the country, I can't take it. 

Tomorrow I will have a chance to speak with the professor. What should I do to have a chance to pass?

I can't change my flight due to several reasons (changing flight fees, fees to change hotel reservation, fees to change car reservation and among of other things). We (family and me) reserved everything well before the semester started. We reserved in November, semester started on January.  </TEXT>
