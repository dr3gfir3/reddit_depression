	<TEXT> Nope. I prepare the peanut butter as the saltines and toffee are baking, then spread the pb on top, sprinkle the chocolate on, and then back in the oven for a minute or two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you like chocolate and pb together, definitely try it! I microwave a few tbsp of peanut butter and spread it on before I put the chocolate on top. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they probably were touchscreen compatible gloves, but they could have had anything else on the screen. A cat, a recipe, or they could have gone meta and had them scrolling the Aldi website. A map plus gloves just screams burglar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pour about 3 drops onto a cotton pad and hold it to my lashes for a few seconds (10, maybe?) so that the mascara softens a bit. And then I just wipe from root to end a few times until it's all gone. And I use the other side of the cotton pad with more jojoba oil for the other eye. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is silicone based. I am currently not using a primer because the one that I had was making me super shiny/oily and also causing the CC cream to separate. I have ordered the high-adherence one from The Ordinary but haven't tried it yet. </TEXT>
