	<TEXT> 16 years old here on my 13th day. 

As soon as you get the urge immediately start doing something else. Whether it's video games or working out, do something to distract yourself. I've notice that my urge to masturbate is peaked when I'm not doing anything. Try to keep yourself busy. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey man, on my 13th day here myself . The easiest way is to immediately do something else as soon as you get the urge. A lot of people recommend working out as soon as you feel the urge coming on, but I personally like to blast music while playing video games. Do whatever will distract you from being tempted to masturbate. </TEXT>

FINAL PART

I remember what everything was like before that one dreadful morning that I awoke to my wife and kids no longer being in my home. I never told you guys about that did I? Well, I suppose I should. I started off the morning by thanking God for my day off. I saved my wife some time by packing the kids lunches, before sending them off to their bus stops with a kiss on the cheek. Christina and I spent half an hour on the couch cuddled under a blanket. The times alone with each other were the best. It reminded us of when we were first dating. If there really is a Heaven, thatll be it. I guess Ill find out. Ill be there soon.

After taking the shot, and taking a quick picture, I sped off down the alleyway. I tried to scream but no sound came out of my mouth. I tried to cry, but no tears would come. I heard my laptop emit the sound of a received email. The last email I hope to get for a long time.

It gave me a name and the address. The name was ZACHARY and after putting the address into Google, I saw that it led to an old junk yard on the outskirts of town. Zachary must be 000000000, and he was the last person Id have to kill before this sick shit was over. Id be able to see my family again.

I stopped at the gun store one more time. I purchased a revolver, I wasnt going to get in a gunfight with a bolt-action .22. I remember the man asking me what I planned to do with it, and I remember walking out the door not saying a word. 

I was dead tired by the time I finished everything. I went back to the seedy hotel I had taken residence, and fell asleep upon hitting the bed. 

I had nothing but nightmares, seeing my kids being shot in the head by an unstoppable figure. Watching my wife asphyxiate and die from seemingly nothing. My family suffering while a distant voice whispered I hope you find them over and over again.

Despite the terrors that plagued me at night, I awoke at noon. I got up and stepped into the shower. The mirror was fogged by the time I got out. I was relieved. I cant look at what it reflects, all I see is someone who killed an innocent family. Someone who ruined peoples lives for his own personal gain. I couldnt look at that person right now, and honestly I dont think Ill ever be able to.

The drive to the junkyard was only a 30 minute drive, but to me it felt like hours. I shouldve been eager. One pull of the trigger and Id be able to hold my wife in my arms, Id be able to wake my kids up for school. I wasnt though. I felt like I was going to vomit the whole time. 



I made sure to drive past the junkyard to a rest stop half a mile away. If Zachary was still there, I didnt want him to know I was coming. 

It was a short 10 minute walk. The fenced-in junkyard was littered with cars, any one of them could be hiding the grieving man who was more eager to kill me than I was to kill him. I scanned the area and noticed a light being emitted from the broken window of a car.

I crouched down, pistol in hand, and began inching my way to the car. I was about 20 feet away when I noticed that a man was sitting in the drivers seat of the car and the light was coming from his lap.

He wasnt moving. Then the realization hit me. 

As I moved closer, I noticed that the broken window had blood splattered all over it. I got up and walked over to the drivers side door. Upon opening it, Zacharys arm slumped over towards where the door once was. His expressionless face was covered in flies and all sorts of insects. I glanced down and noticed that his phone was on, all it showed was the picture of his dead wife. 

The picture I sent to him.

I realized that after receiving the picture of his dead wife, Zachary had shot himself. 

An uncontrollable rush of tears flooded to my eyes. Im sorry I muttered, Im so sorry

I mustve sat with my back against the car for a good hour. I couldnt help but cry. I couldnt get over the fact that I had killed this man and his family for me. For what I wanted. 

I pulled my digital camera from my pocket and took a picture of the dead man slumped over in his car seat, and sent it to 000000001. 

After a few mintues, my laptop dinged. It was email from 000000001. All it said was Theyll be waiting for you at home.

I didnt head straight home. I stopped at the hotel first. I couldnt go home just yet. I couldnt face my family after what I had done.

This is the 2nd day Ive been in this hotel room. 

The nightmares persistently invade my sleep. They consist of nothing but screams emanating from every direction, and re-runs of me killing Zacharys family, Zachary pleading for me to stop all the while. The nightmares persist even into my awake life. Ill be watching TV or otherwise trying to take my mind off things when a flashback of me ending someones life occurs.

I see my revolver out of the corner of my eye, resting on the table as I type this update. I keep thinking back to Zachary, and how much I envy him. He got to escape all the misery and discomfort with one pull of a trigger. I wonder if hes happy now.

I think Ill ask [him](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tp1XgPqongyYIkPFGJ_tSbuuamNK4NxTKu4NSOMViGg/edit?usp=sharing). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently on my longest streak of 10 days. Sure it has been hard, but the effects have already began taking place. Breaking my masturbation addiction (an addiction formed over 6 years) has motivated me in other parts of my life. I've finally gotten my workout routine back on schedule, and have recently taken up writing, something I've always wanted to do.

My message to new Fapstronauts: The benefits of NoFap outweigh the benefits of fapping. I will admit, masturbation served as an instant stress reliever and a way to manage my emotions, however I can say that these 10 days have been some of the most productive 10 days of my life. I have taken control over parts of my life I have been struggling with for years, and have even noticed my confidence increase as well. There is no reason not to give NoFap at least a try. I sincerely hope you do. :) </TEXT>

I guess I should change the name of my story, figuring its not true anymore. I dont have the strength to think of some intro to summarize my thoughts. I honestly dont have the strength to type this update, but Ill try.

My ears were ringing after the bullet left the chamber. Tears were streaming down my face, I just curled up in the dirt and began to sob. What am I doing? I just killed an innocent mother. Someone who would drive her kids to school, just like my wife. Someone who would pack lunches for her husband before work, just like my wife. Someone who would kiss her kids on the forehead before they went to sleep, just like my wife. 

I heard my laptop ding, it was an email. It instructed me to take a picture of the now dead Michelle, and send it to 000000000. If I didnt, then my wife and children would suffer the consequences. This was sick. This was terrible. I had no choice.

It was a lovely day. The sun was shining brightly in a sky sparsely dotted with a puff of fluffy white clouds. Michelle's hair waved in a light breeze, most of it sticking together caked in blood. Thats what the picture on my digital camera showed anyways.

I sent the image to 000000000, along with a message saying how sorry I was. He read it, but didnt respond. I couldnt imagine what he was going through right now. I didnt want to do this. 

I heard sirens in the distance, and figured that it was time to go. I got in my car and sped off away from the scene. I rented a low-rate hotel. I wasnt planning on staying there long. I mostly just wanted a place to sleep without having to worry about getting ticketed. 

It was early, only 8:00PM, but today was long enough. I fell asleep within minutes of lying on the bed, only to find myself within the worst nightmare of my life. 

It was during our honeymoon. I awoke to the sound of the showering running at the opposite end of our hotel suite. Ill slip out of bed in my boxers and step into the doorway to see Christina standing there brushing her teeth in, while wearing one of my t-shirts. I walk up behind her and kiss her neck. She straightens up and turns around, only to reveal her bloodied face caved in from a bullet. 

I woke up dripping with sweat. Red numbers glowed from the clock on the bedside table, indicating that it was 1:30AM. So much for sleeping.

I had received another email in my slumber. It was another address with the name JASMINE typed over it. 

I stayed awake surfing the web and reading news stories reporting on the murder of a woman who was sitting on a hotel balcony. Lucky for me, there was no information on the killer, or even evidence regarding him. I continued to waste time until it was 5:00AM, when I decided to begin my disgusting errand. 

During the drive to the address provided, I kept looking over at the picture of 000000000's family. I glanced from daughter to daughter, wondering which one was Jasmine. I felt like I was going to vomit the entire drive. I just kept telling myself that I had no choice. My family or his. My family or his.

My family or his.

I couldnt bring a giant hunting rifle into the hospital, so I walked in unarmed. I was sweating profusely, my vision blurred with the tears flooding my eyes. I pulled my hood over my head to conceal my expression. I walked up to front desk and asked for a map of the place. I told her I was looking for the hospice ward (I couldnt let her know that I was actually looking for the childs ward).

She gave me a print out map, I thanked her and made my way to the childs ward. The email came with a room number CW14. I passed by numerous rooms, each yielding their sad environment of sick children next to sobbing parents, until I got to room 14. I peered through the rectangular window into the room. I couldnt see much of the child except for her feet. No one else was in the room.

I walked in and was met with a tragic sight. The child was hooked up to a ventilator, amongst a variety of other beeping and whirring machines; all of which were linked directly to her body through a variety of cords. I collapsed into a chair just opposite of the bed. My cheeks were puffy and red with tears, my breath was nothing but short, abrupt gasps. 

The flowers on her bedside table were beautiful. A mixture of violets and tulips and babys breath. They lay there, staring neutrally up towards the fake luminescent bulbs. They gave a slight jostle when all the cords underneath them were pulled out from the wall. They lit up from the flash emitted by my digital camera.

I screamed the entire car ride back to my hotel. I screamed and cried until my voice when hoarse. 

What am I doing? 

I didnt sleep at all that night. I dont think I will for many more nights to come. The next morning was spent vomiting any food I tried to swallow. One more. I just have to get one more.

The only thing I took solace in was the fact that I hadnt received any pictures of possibly dead members of my family from 000000000. In fact, I havent received any messages from him period. He was reading my messages instantly upon receiving them, but never responding.

I received an email from 000000001, the last email I hope to ever get from her. It was an address with the final name above it: ISABELLE

I checked my local news website, and saw that a nurse had come across Jasmine dead in her bed. I made sure to plug all the wires back in, so it wouldnt look like they were tampered with. They chalked it up to machinery failure. There were pictures of the cords, stock images of hospital beds, and of the crying nurse; someone elses life Ive now ruined. 

The drive to Isabelles location was a somber one. Whatever emotions I wouldve felt before are now gone. I dont know if sociopathy can be acquired, but I know that my emotions are dead, which is close enough. I arrived at the destination.

It was a park, and I saw a little girl rocking gently on the swing. The same smiling little girl from the picture on my laptop. 

I pulled into an alleyway opposite of the park. The trunk popped open. The rifle came out. 

The shadow provided by the building provided a cool temperature, shielding me from the sun. I saw a little boy sitting on his mothers lap, both of them smiling taking turns spooning ice cream from a bowl. Another child was building up courage to go down the big slide, his father cheering him on from below. A young couple was playing fetch with what looked like a German Shepard puppy. I wondered which one of them would hear the shot first. Which one would notice the spurt of blood through the air.

My finger tensed around the trigger.

Im sorry.

Sometimes Ill go back and read my first post, and wish I was back there. When my situation was still simple, and I could wrap my head around the idea that I was just some crazy guy who imagined his whole family. I know thats not the case now. I know what I need to do.

I didnt do much after posting my last update. I just drove to a nearby McDonald's and ordered some food, then sat there until they kicked me out. I was there for a few hours, doing nothing but trying to lose myself in some video games I had on my computer. 

It was about noon when I was finally kicked out. I decided I had to go to the police. There was a murder involved now. I didnt care if they locked me up in some asylum, feeding me pills until my eventual death. I just wanted this to be over with, and the awful person behind this to be caught.

I pulled into the parking lot just outside of the police station when my computer gave the same notification ding from earlier. Screw it. I thought Why not entertain this one last message? I wish I hadnt. I opened up my computer and my heart sank. The picture was from an alleyway, most of the shot was blocked by a rifle equipped with a scope. The rifle was pointing at my car.

A second message appeared.

DO NOT GO IN THERE UNLESS YOU WANT A JANITOR PICKING YOUR SKULL OUT OF THE CARPET.

I froze. I started to look around and noticed an alley across the street. A shadow was casted along the alleyway, so I couldnt see whoever 000000000 was. I clicked my seatbelt back in and then sped off down the street. 

What does this guy want with me? What role does he play in this?

I was just driving around trying to compose my thoughts, when I started getting a stream of notifications on my laptop. I pulled into a Starbucks parking lot, and decided to respond to the messages in there.

I asked him what he wanted. I didnt want to piss him off, so I wanted to make sure that our conversation would be brief and strictly informative. 

He responded with a You know why.

I started thinking back to everyone I had wronged in life. There were a few people I could imagine wanting to give me a solid punch in the gut, but nothing that would cause any reasonable human to go to this extent.

I told him that I really didnt know what was going on. All he told me was that Id be receiving a call over Facebook Messenger explaining everything. I threw what was left of my coffee away, and walked out to my car and awaited the call. It was a call I wont ever forget.

I received an audio call from 000000001 and answered. It was a womans voice who began talking. She didnt say hello, or any pleasantries for that matter. She went immediately into explanation. She told me that I would be emailed a photo of a man and his family, and then proceeded to outline something that made my heart sank.

I was going to have to kill this mans family if I ever wanted to see mine again. He was given a similar task and must kill mine. It was a murderous race.

I asked what would happen if I told her to fuck off, and she said that my family would be dead. She ended the call with the ominous You better find them before hanging up. A sense of dread washed over me. 

I saw a notification bubble form over my email app. I opened it and saw a bald man with his face blurred out, a man who I assume was 00000000. He had a muscular arm around a beautiful asian woman, boasting her toned body in a two-piece bikini. In front of the couple, were two adorable, smiling little girls who looked to be the same age as my own children. Above the image were the words: First his family, then him. Kill him first, and your family dies.

I felt vomit gushing up towards my mouth. I stared at the family. Happy, smiling. I cant kill these people, but what choice do I have?

My state has loose gun laws, so purchasing a .22 hunting rifle was not hard. I couldnt believe I was doing this. I had no choice. It was this mans family, or mine. 

By the time I had finished all my errands it was 11:30PM. I pulled into a rest stop nearby, and fell asleep. 

By the time I awoke, I had received 3 new emails. They were addresses. Above them were the names (Im assuming) of the innocent family that I was about to break apart. Michelle, Isabelle, and Jasmine. I stared at those names for a while. They were such pretty names.

I turned my car on, and started making my way to Michelle. I tried not to think about what I was doing. I couldnt shake the image of that family out of my head. They looked so happy together. Their intertwined shadows were extended across the beach by the setting sun behind them. 

After a torturous 5 minute drive, I arrived at what looked like a 5-star hotel. The rooms on the top floor had balconies for those who wanted to soak in the city scape. Just then, I noticed a sliding door open, and a woman stepped out onto one. It was her. The mother I was about to kill. She sat down onto a fabric-draped chair and began taking selfies with her phone.

I pulled my car into a construction site just across her balcony. It was dark and empty, the construction workers must have the day off. I pulled the hunting rifle out of the trunk of my car and placed her in the crosshairs.

I noticed every feature about her in that scope. Her well-kept eyebrows, her cute smile and perfectly white teeth. I noticed how one corner of her mouth pulls back just a little bit farther from the other when she smiles. 

I noticed how she raises her eyebrows at the sound of a distant gunshot.
