	<TEXT> The 4k thing is something you want to do BEFORE you setup the zpool, you can't properly change it later. What you're doing is configuring it to match the drive spec.

Drives currently come in three options:
* 512byte
* 4k/512byte emulated
* 4k

If the drive can do 4k, 4k is what you want.

Hit %/ARC size is something you can't find out till you're actually using it though, but it's some sweet stats you get from other storage systems. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're making a vdev for a zpool with a single device, that's fine, as long as you know there is no redundancy protection against drive failure. Which it sure seems like you're aware of.

I would say this is a good idea for the time being, as ZFS will let you do all kinds of super duper neato shit like snapshots, and as you clearly need, protection against corruption/bit rot. This functionality is expected to work just fine with one disk in your zpool.

A few things to consider:

1. Make sure you set the 4k alignment to match the spec of your drive. This is a small thing, but when it comes to rtorrent it'll probably help your performance.
2. 16GB of RAM will be enough, and if it isn't you can add more later ;) But the way you can be sure is as you use it comparing your hit % to your ARC size. 80% hit rate or higher is just fine, and near that percentage is fine too. If your ARC size is say... 12-13GB+ and your hit is say 60% or lower, you need more RAM.
3. You're probably going to be just fine. </TEXT>

Normal Chromecasts don't have any form of mic, but I am not 100% on the built-in ones. AFAIK there's no functionality with Chromecasts for mic/cam shit though, so I _doubt_ they have mics, but I have not had the chance to check just yet.

Also, this is why I prefer to have physical switched mics ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ZFS is actually a storage system in addition to filesystem. Not only that, there are ways to implement it without "rolling your own". If you want an appliance, you can go iX Systems or Oracle/Sun.

But that doesn't matter, because I'm just trying to bring up the topic of an alternative option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well for starters, I've actually won tournaments. But I also run gaming events and tournaments too (for almost 10 years now), and competitive viability is a very important element when we decide what games are going to be ran. OW has no LAN servers, hit detection problems, and plenty more where they came from. Alternatively there are games like CS:GO, DotA 2, Rocket League and plenty others that are far better suited to competitive play than OW. Hell, I'd run TF2 before OW.

Think about it another way too, OW is repeating the mistakes TF2 did like 7 years ago. There's plenty of map choke points that lead to boring play or stalemates, just for a quick example. Blizzard is just trying to copycat TF2 without actually taking any of the lessons that community has learned and applying them.

Just not even worth it, OW is unfit.

Not only that, it doesn't matter if your opinion or mine is better than the next, I can objectively reason why OW is bottom of the list when it comes to picking what games to run events/tournaments for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, depending on the area, there are people that get power from solar/renewable-only from the grid. So, there is that to consider.

Well, power usage doesn't necessarily consume fossil fuels neither. There are plenty served from hydro for example alone.

Well, I try to curb waste as much as I can too. It's also worth pointing out that acceptable waste varies from country to country. Consider the USA vs Japan, or South Korea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay if we're coming at this from a wasteful perspective, I would argue that depends how you get energy. If it's from solar, or your own other form of renewable, is it really wasteful at that point?

Also, I would say it depends on how often you interact with your rasp pi. If it's regularly, then there's a "time waste" in having to deal with manually turning it on, before you can even start using it, which I would say is more wasteful than just leaving it generally on.

Furthermore, what about leaving your phone plugged in while the battery is full? That's a similar amount of waste, but I'm confident that's not generally considered wasteful. </TEXT>

Depending on what your price is per kwh, you're probably going to be charged in the realm of $0.05-$0.13 per month if it runs literally 24/7 and is the 1.2W model (there are plenty of models that use less power).

Leaving a rasp pi running is not wasteful whatsoever. </TEXT>

Secondly, ZFS has awesome data integrity functions to it.

Thirdly, you can get some awesome performance out of it (but this isn't so much relevant to pfSense).

Fourthly, you can do snapshotting, and lots of other awesome advanced functions that really aren't available with other storage tech.

Compared to UFS or HW RAID, ZFS is the cat's meow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Proxmox VE. All the features, and you only pay for support (but there's community members too!). Way more features than free version of ESXi and Hyper-V, and it's very lean!

Check it out ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Journalism is more than just saying words, it's using credible sources too. There are parts of what MS said, and parts from _literally_ "anonymous" sources. This isn't even close to credible. It's not about wanting to believe it or not, it's about being able to actually back up the claims beyond _speculation_. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While this may become reality, I'm going to need far more substantive proof than this. This is hearsay and speculation.

But, reader, put down your pitchfork, I am not advocating FOR windows. I am advocating FOR reasonable discourse. Information like this impacts me because I provide IT support to Windows and hybrid environments, so I need to keep abreast of such things. That being said, this is not even close to reliable information and I wouldn't even consider presenting this to a client, partner or industry peer. It is speculation without any credible sources of the actual outcome.

I use Linux for my workstation, and all over the place. But I also have a Win10 tablet that I use to test compatibility things. Should this "cloud" version become a reality, it would be a pretty big issue for me. However, I again I call into light the integrity of the sources here.

* **tl;dr:** This could happen, but I need real proof, and this is not real proof. If it happens, it's a big deal. </TEXT>

1. isn't going to fly with nVidia unless you have workstation/higher class GPUs. The drivers will (and already do) lock you out of such stuff if you're using GeForce. There are some ways to get around this, but they aren't exactly compatible with what is being said here.
2. well this is vendor specific, what about AMD or other procs? Considering Linux is written for MANY other processors, this seems pretty meh.

	<TEXT>  In Esports the frequency of roster swaps and player turnover is much higher than in traditional sports

While this is correct, perhaps VP winning the latest CSGO tourney is likely to turn that methodology for some teams around. They haven't changed roster in... over 4 years? And the story goes "we're not changing roster until a funeral". As macabre as that is, it demonstrates that there is still so much more uncertainty as to what is and what isn't successful in so many different aspects of eSports. There are plenty of examples supporting your position, and I think there will be more examples going forward supporting mine. All because we still are figuring out.. "what the fuck IS eSports, and how does it work?".

It's so wildwest, and that's part of the thrill I get out of it. I run events and such, and I'm excited for the future. But one thing I know, I need to make shit happen or I'm going to become irrelevant.

Neat points though. I generally agree with almost all of what you have to say :)

 Owners and players however need to be careful to the deals they are making.

That one I especially agree with! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Proxmox you get all the features out the gate. You pay for support.
2. Proxmox in a cluster every node can manage every other node in the cluster.
3. Proxmox you don't need a VM to manage the cluster, it's built-in and the webgui is awesome.
4. Proxmox is very efficient and fast.

Frankly I'm going to recommend Proxmox 10/10 times unless there's a feature you need in ESXi that isn't in proxmox (but this doesn't happen often). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> USB 3.0 is 5gbit which is generally the same speed SSDs can max out at, ~600MB/s

Compare that to most USB 3.0 flash sticks that do about 110MB/s maybe upwards of 200MB/s and it's a very big difference.

When it comes to installing an OS, this can speed things up massively, and when dealing with such tasks at scale, that translates directly into money saved. </TEXT>
