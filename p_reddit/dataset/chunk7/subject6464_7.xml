	<TITLE> Visiting Staten Island </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Staten Island is split off from the other borough. It's more conservative than liberal, can be accessed via ferry or bridge, and has more busy buses.

The St. George terminal have several ramps for their respective bus routes. I have to take the S46 to go to the Flaming Hibachi and Supreme Buffet at Richmond. Turns out the neighborhoods neighboring New Jersey are liberal while the other neighborhoods are conservative. The bus is very crowded as one of it's terminal is the St. George terminal. The ride took 56 minutes as the express buses are available during the PM rush and the buses do not stop at the restaurant.

During the bus ride, the driver turned on red at the corner of Liberty and Forrest. While on Forrest Ave, I saw a cone at an intersection. I saw a diversity of business on the road. There are several strip malls on the road; the restaurant I want to go to is in one of them. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dismissal of Milo Yiannopoulos=Eventual Fall of The Alt-Right </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-25 03:15:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We saw the rise of the alt-right in late 2015 after Trump announced his presidential run. They originated from the Silicon Valley. They have far-right ideologies.

One prominent person who represent the alt-right is Milo Yiannopoulus, who used to work at Breitbart. He is known for his trolling activities on Twitter. A few days ago, he was fired for his pedophilia comments.

After Trump won the 2016 election, there is an article from Wired called "The Alt-Right Will Fail. Even under President Trump." Trump even said he will have an America First policy. However, we see how America First became Trump First. We saw his conflicts of interest and his special interests. I see he might end up quitting or not able to get a second term

With the Trump presidency falling apart and the dismissal of Milo Yiannopoulous, we will see a silver lining. Maybe people are owing up to themselves. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Had Cable and Phone Service between 2001 and 2009 </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I came to the US in 2000, we used to have TV service from Time Warner Cable and phone service from Verizon. I missed a lot since dropping the services.

My dad, aunt, and uncle started paying the joint TV service. Eventually, my aunt and uncle quit the plan. Leaving my did having to pay the plan. He started downgrade his subscription from premium, where I used to watch from Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network, to basic. Until 2009, we see the number of available channels for our basic service dropping.

After dropping Spike TV and seeing our crappy service, we decided to cancel our subscription. That's when we later got TV service via a digital antenna.

The phone service consists of us connecting our phone to a land line. We see our bill raising. We eventually have to cancel add-ons to our phone service. When we realize adding a line to our T-Mobile Service is cheaper that having the phone service, a crew member helped us cancel our Verizon membership and transfer our home phone to T-Mobile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been using Yelp for 1 yr 8 mths. I have posting my reviews of the different places I have been or recently went. Doing this let others be informed of the places they want to go to have a meal.

As of today, I have made 302 reviews. The majority of them are restaurants and in Queens. The first review is a five-star rating to Ootoya at Flatiron.

The most recent review is a five-star rating to Five Guys at Midtown East. The fast-food establishment opened recently.

In addition, I have received 69 useful votes, 29 funny votes and 28 cool votes. The types of reviews I make were short with a few sentences. Later, my reviews are longer with several paragraphs about each section I cover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I immigrated tot the US in 2000, I usually go to a barbershop at Madison Street in Chinatown, NY. That was when I go to Sunday church services. As time passed, I stopped going to the Sunday church services.

The next place I went is at the Mott Street between Grand and Broome Street. My mom know the owner. The place is wide with a sofa and I saw a mahjong parlor in the back while going to the restroom. That was when my did take my grandma to Chinatown to do grocery shopping.

Nowadays, we don't go to Chinatown much anymore. During the 6th grade, I went to a barbershop on Broadway between Whitney and Elmhurst Ave in Elmhurst, NY. That was when the intermediate school ordered my mom to send me to Elmhurst Hospital for evaluation.

One time when my mom need to go to a drugstore at Brooklyn, we went to a nearby salon. I forgot the name as it was a long time ago. 

Currently, we go to a a salon at 64th St between Roosevelt and 39th Ave in Woodside, Queens. This barbershop was recommended by my dad's coworker. The owner also go to the Aquatic Center in Flushing. My dad have a talk with the owner every time we come. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Trump's Crumbling Administration Is a Good Thing to Democrats </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-16 04:26:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lately, Michael Flynn got fired for leaking secrets to Russia. This offense violates the espionage acts. If found guilty, he is liable to life imprisonment.

Trump started his presidency with a low approval rating. It took him 8 days to surpass the 50% mark. This shows that he is very unfavorable. His travel ban was unconstitutional and had to be rescinded. He didn't make America great but made SNL great. SNL had portrayed the administration as "incompetent buffoons."

With Trump's imploding approval rations due to the event, the GOP can able to try to impeach Trump, but likely fail, which will hurt them in 2018. By 2018, we may possible see the Democrats taking over the congress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before modern times, houses have chimneys. Chimneys help the house to keep warm in the winter. During the winter, people place logs to burn in the winter. Nowadays, they are rare.

I have seen some houses have chimneys, but they are rare or disused. We use gas to heat our homes. Smoke doesn't need chimneys to be expelled from the homes with cooking. We use fume hoods that drive to the ground.

In addition, some people live in projects, condos, or co-ops. These doesn't have chimneys. Smoke gets expelled with fume hoods and expelled with pipes that goes to the roof. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trump's Hubris </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-12 05:02:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lately, I heve heard of news that the insiders in the White House said that Trump apparently hates his job. There are several good reason for this.

As Cenk Uygar said in a video Why Trump Won't Win 2020, he represents the four horsemen: personal corruption, systemic corruption, incompetence, and hubris. When his approval rating reaches 25% or lower, we will be in danger zone, where Trump does not accept his mistakes and scapegoats others.

Trump is a egoistical narcissist, who is full of himself. He doesn't care about the people who voted for him, but cares about himself. He doesn't divest his businesses, leading to the conflict of interests. His cabinet members are top donors who are billionaires.

Trump signed an executive order to ban Muslims from entering. However, it backfired as it was rescinded by the court. I am seeing that Trump's policies will backfire and Trump would have to blame his opponents.

The local governments feel that the Congress is out-of-touch, so they will have to do their job. Recently, another The Young Turks video surfaced that San Francisco is offering free community colleges to its residents. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dragon Tales Skits in Robot Chicken </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-09 18:22:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dragon Tales is a kid show that was aired between 1999 and 2005 on PBS Kids. The show is about Max, Emmy and Enrique's adventures in Dragonland, where they meet up with Ord, Cassie, Zac and Whezzie. 

Robot Chicken is a adult-themed show that is airing since 2005 on Adult Swim. The show consists of skits of other shows, but would need licensing.

One Dragon Tales skits I want to see on Robot Chicken is where the kids arrive at Dragonland. When they arrived, they see Ord anal-tailing Cassie, where Ord inserts his tail into Cassie's anus, while Cassie is using painkillers to enjoy the experience painlessly. The kids were in shock.

Another skit I want to see is where Dr. Booboogone have a side job as a madam. Quetzel goes to the underground brothel and have sexual services from a hooker.

A third skit I want to see is where Cassie's siblings in a gang bang. In the gang bang, they are seen using lube, condoms and dildos. However, all they are doing is just pelvic thrusting without anal contract. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Birds On My Backyard Decking </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-07 22:49:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From time to time, I see birds on the backyard decking. The decking also have a roof deck, which is ideal for birds to avoid the rain.

My parents sometimes hear birds cooing inside the bedroom. They usually wait for the neighbors to bring food for the birds. Sometimes, the birds even cry to call the neighbor.

Birds like doves, sparrows and ravens use the decking as a place to rest. My dad saw bird poop near my window. Whenever it rains, they will rest at my windowsill. I like to see them grooming.

The only type of birds that do not use the decking are pigeons, robins, and cardinals. Pigeons are large and prefer buildings. Robins and cardinals are seasonal birds that come during the warmer seasons. During Spring, these birds prefer public parks to claim territory. By Summer, they will fight over a mate. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Becoming an Anti-Establishment Entertainer </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I become interested in Japanese culture when I immigrated to the US. Recently, my fanarts are anti-establishment as I included crossovers of non-anime characters.

Enka is a Japanese song genre that resembles ballads. I am not a fan of pop songs. Some anime theme songs do fit the genre of J-pop. I'm more of a fan of contemporary tastes. There are some anime theme songs that fit the genre of enka, but are rare. I myself wrote numerous enka-themed anime songs. The songs can be politically incorrect and contains katakana, which is not common in enka.

I have typed up ideas for taking a short-lived children's anime and turn it to a liberal rip-off of South Park. Children's anime are traditionally moralistic, teaching children how to behave as good and considerate people and helping them to stay on the right path in life. However, the anime Crayon Shin-chan is considered vulgar that has been criticized for having non-age appropriate content. The revival would be considered an adult anime even though the characters are mostly minors. </TEXT>
