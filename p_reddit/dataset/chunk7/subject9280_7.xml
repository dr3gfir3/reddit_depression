	<TEXT> They administered the standard dose for one infusion, and a slightly raised dose for the last five infusions.

It was completely and utterly life-changing, the most profound experiences I've ever had.  I had been doing a ton of meditation, spiritual book reading, and mind work for months and months before and so the ketamine just propelled me to a new level.

However, for me it didn't solve my depression, as I'm sure the cause is something unrelated to the ketamine's method of action.  Still, although I don't like the price, it was the most insightful experiences of my entire life that have since further sparked powerful changes in my conscious experience of life. </TEXT>

Joe is the farthest thing from any stereotype, he doesn't fit in any one category and you understand from watching him that he is a genuinely good dude.

But I understand how a judgmental, shallow person can come to their own conclusions before gathering enough evidence. </TEXT>

I also tried ketamine infusions and they cost me $2300 for two weeks.

Most clinics will likely be more expensive then mine but its better than going to a specialist who forces you to come in for injections and will only let you do them every two weeks or every month.  Clinics offer more freedom in TRT but can be a bit pricer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try to find an anti-aging clinic in the area that isnt too expensive. You're T is low and no matter how much sleep you get, healthy you eat, and workout, you won't feel great I can guarantee it.

Don't waste another few months waiting, keep trying every clinic until one is priced well and will treat you.  My total T came back 288, and 417, and my free T came back 7.9 in the labcorp ranges.  My endo said I was fine, even though I'm only almost 24 and have EVERY symptom of low T.  So I went to an anti-aging clinic that's not too expensive and I've been on injections for several weeks now and already have more energy, less anxiety, and less fatigue, and slightly improved mood.  So far it's the best and most confident I've felt in years and its still only been 3 weeks! 

You're happiness is the only thing that matters.  You need to feel healthy and good to get there. Please don't wait and don't give up

But definitely you need more labs before going on TRT </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Primary or Secondary/Tertiary Hypogonadism? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-29 06:03:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Currently 23, been on weekly TRT cypionate injections for just two weeks, just had third injection Monday.  Here's the two sets of bloodwork I did at LabCorp before starting TRT:

**First blood tests (3 months ago):**

* Total Testosterone: 288 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: not measured in this one
* TSH 1.960 uIU/mL  (0.450 - 4.500 uIU/mL)
* Prolactin	8.2 ng/mL	(4.0 - 15.2 ng/mL)

**Second blood tests (1 month ago):**

* Total Testosterone: 417 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: 7.9 (I forget the unit type..)
* LH	7.9 mIU/mL (1.7 - 8.6 mIU/mL)
* FSH 1.9 mIU/mL (1.5 - 12.4 mIU/mL)

Are my LH and FSH normal and therefore indicate primary hypogonadism? Or is my LH too high and my FSH too low and therefore indicate something else? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My depression is like a never-ending flu. Going 13 years strong now, at almost 24 I'm truly close to almost giving up after having failed 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, years of talk therapy, ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, CBT, meditation, exercise and diet, supplements, and nootropics. 

I have a good outlook on what can change, and my perspective on life is rock solidly peaceful, but every day I feel like hell on the inside, like utter shit physically and emotionally. 

I just found out two months ago my testosterone is really low and I started weekly TRT injections last week and I'm hoping on my life's sake it will work. 

I don't know what I'll do if it doesn't help. It's not possible to live life in any functional sense with severe flu symptoms every day. The only thing that could get a person through is knowing the flu would soon go away. What happens when I've tried everything and my flu won't go away? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most dudes loves slutty, stupid chicks, they're easier to fuck and they dress showing their tits and ass in a way that makes you want to fuck them more then if they were covered up. 

Thing is though, no one who respects themselves wants to date these types of girls because who wants to be friends with a fake person with no self-respect or let alone have them be the mother of their kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tbh, this might be an unpopular opinion, but I find a lot of women around my age, 20-24, have a fakeness so deeply ingrained in them that around 80% or more of them speak with that fake valley-girl inflection.

Humans, like dogs, can sense disingenuineness, deceit, and a lack of authenticity in a subconscious way and so its so easy to see how fake and carbon-copy these types of girls are.  They're the worst kind to be around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO I'd like to see RG3 leave the NFL. I was a big fan of his pretty stellar execution of trick plays and liked seeing another QB who could scramble and use the read-option and not just be a straight up pocket passer, but after that first season every year he's just been a huge disappointment and a waste of money to whatever team he signed with. 

Not sure if his downfall seems even worse because of how rich and hyped he became even before taking his first ever NFL snap, but he's not worth the money and I think he'll never top his rookie season.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Will stopping fapping and watching porn increase my sex drive? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-16 05:59:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The only reason I fap in the first place anymore is because I'm currently going through shit and am not in the state to meet people, let alone girls at the moment, and while I'm in the process of rebuilding myself and my life completely, I can't stand the feeling of shittyness that overwhelms me when I feel horny, it makes me super fucking depressed because it reminds me of the time when I had one of my exes to fuck or other girls of the past.  So I fap and the feelings go away and I once again feel clear and at peace, for long after each fap.  These faps dont give me any bad feelings ever either.  

But im curious, if I stop fapping do you think these sexual urges will slow down and stop attacking me? That's all I really want, and like I said the only reason I fap to begin with, to return to a non-anxious non-depressed state that lasts for hours after each time I do it.

I'm not addicted in any way, and can stop anytime and have before. The only reason I do it again is because that shitty depressed feeling of missing a girl or my exes or missing sex goes away each time and I once again feel light and like a feather, and so clear. </TEXT>
