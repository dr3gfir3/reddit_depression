	<TITLE> Initially my Arduino executes a series of PWM signals simultaneously, but after some iterations it adds around a second between PWM executions </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am using 2 adafruit PWM servo shield in order to generate 25 PWM signals. In particular I am using this shield: https://www.adafruit.com/products/1411

A python script sends the commands to the Arduino (Mega 2560) through pyserial. The commands are like "A0 P1 S500\n". Each argument separated by a space. The first chooses the shield, the second one the pin, and the third one the speed.

The code running in the Arduino is as follows:

    #include Adafruit_PWMServoDriver.h
    
    #define BUFFER_SIZE 200
    
    // Init both adafruit boards
    Adafruit_PWMServoDriver pwm0 = Adafruit_PWMServoDriver(0x40);
    Adafruit_PWMServoDriver pwm1 = Adafruit_PWMServoDriver(0x41);
    
    
    int read_command(char *buffer)
    {
    
    	static int pos = 0;
    	int rpos;
    
    	if (Serial.available()  0) {
    		Serial.println(Serial.available());
    		char readch = Serial.read();
    
    		switch (readch) {
    
    			case '\n':
    				rpos = pos;
    				pos = 0; // Reset position index ready for next time
    				Serial.println(buffer);
    				return rpos;
    
    			default:
    
    				if (pos  BUFFER_SIZE -1) {
    					buffer[pos++] = readch;
    					buffer[pos] = '\0';
    				} else {
    					Serial.println("666"); //buffer overflow
    				}
    		}
    	}
    	// no end line or char found, return -1
    	return -1;
    
    }
    
    
    void parse_command(char* command) 
    {
    
    	char* parameter;
    	parameter = strtok(command, " ");
    	long shield, pin, speed;
    
    	while (parameter != NULL) {
    
    		switch(parameter[0]) {
    
    			case 'A':
    				shield = strtol(parameter+1, NULL, 10);
    				break;
    
    			case 'P':
    				pin = strtol(parameter+1, NULL, 10);
    				break;
    
    			case 'S':
    				speed = strtol(parameter+1, NULL, 10);
    				break;
    
    		}
    		parameter = strtok(NULL, " ");
    	}
    	
    	for (int x=0; x  BUFFER_SIZE; x++)
    		command[x] = '\0';
    	
      if (shield == 0)
        pwm0.setPWM(pin, 0, speed);
    
      if (shield == 1)
        pwm1.setPWM(pin, 0, speed);
    
    }
    
    
    void setup() 
    {
      
      Serial.begin(9600);
      Serial.flush();
    
      pwm0.begin();
      pwm0.setPWMFreq(100);  //Max is 1600, Kevin was using 1000
      pwm1.begin();
      pwm1.setPWMFreq(100);
    
    }
    
    
    void loop() 
    {
      
      static char buffer[BUFFER_SIZE];
    
      if (read_command(buffer)  0)
        parse_command(buffer);
        
    }


As said, I am sending the commands from a Python script, where for example I have a function called "activate all", that will send 25 commands like "A0 P1 S500\n" (obviously with different values after the A and the P) to the serial port. I also have a function called "disable all", which is very similar to the previous command, but setting the S to 0 so like "A0 P1 S0\n".

So, as I start the serial communication, if I execute from Python "activate_all", I can how all the PWM signals are generated at the same time. I know it is actually 1 by 1, but it is fast enough to seem simultaneously to the human eye. If I then send a disable_all, I can see how all the PWM signals are set to 0 at the same time.

This works as expected for a while, but after some point, when I send an activate_all, it will indeed activate all of them, but it activates each PWM signal one by one, with a delay of around 1 second between activations (so you can clearly see them going one by one), and a very similar effect when disabling them all. From this point on, which seems slightly different each time, every time I want to activate more than one pwm signal at the same time, it will add this 1s delay between activations.

The only way I have to fix this is to send from the python a "flush()". which seems to be fix it. Doing flushes from the Arduino code, like when for example serial.available is 0, doesnt seem to fix it.

I don't know what exactly I am doing wrong. I guess the way I am handling the communication buffer is wrong, but I haven't seen where my mistake is.

A very similar code to the one pasted here was used in another project, in that case it was interfaced with Labview, and in that case everything seem fine.

In case you wonder about the code running in the Python script, it is like this:

    
    import serial, time, json
    
    
    class BZBoard:
    
    
        def __init__(self, port):
    
            self.ser = serial.Serial(port, 9600, timeout=120)
            time.sleep(2) # serial docs recommend a wait just after connection
            self.ser.flush(); self.ser.flushInput(); self.ser.flushOutput();
    
            self.motors = {
                just naming the pins
                }
        
    
        def __del__(self):
    
            self.disable_all()
            self.ser.close()
            del self.ser
    
    
        def close(self):
    
            self.disable_all()
            self.ser.close()
            del self.ser
    
        def activate_motor(self, motor_code, speed=300):
            ''' code as in A1 or C2 as marked in the actual board. See the dict motors'''
    
            shield, pin = self.motors[motor_code]
            command = "A%d P%d S%d\n" % ( shield, pin, speed )
            self.ser.write(command.encode())
    
    
        def activate_all(self, speed=300):
    
            for key in self.motors.keys():
                self.activate_motor(key, speed)
    
    
        def disable_motor(self, motor_code):
    
            shield, pin = self.motors[motor_code]
            command = "A%d P%d S0\n" % ( shield, pin )
            self.ser.write(command.encode())
    
        
        def disable_all(self):
    
            for key in self.motors.keys():
                self.disable_motor(key)
    
    
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    
        board = BZBoard("/dev/ttyACM0")

So the user will do for example a lopp that repeats itself 20 times, where it will activate_all, wait 1 second, disable_all, wait 1 second. The first 10 iterations or so, everything will be fine and the PWM are generated all of them at the same time (with respect to the human eye), but after that, the PWM signals are generated 1 by 1, with a delay of 1s or so between them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I strongly disagree with your "once the novelty of playing on the go wears of". It never wears of. I suspect you never had a handheld console before, but I have had each of them since the game boy, and it never wears of. And games like oot or mm (Zelda's) are similar in immersion to the new one, and they are perfect in the go. You also have super deep games in the 3ds like xenoblades or dragon quest and they are perfect, and you also have dark games like resident evil DS or smt.

I think your criticism is based on someone who is not used to handheld gaming. Maybe it's just not for you  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is actually strange, because while Spain is a more religious country by every metric, I have met more religious people in Scotland.

The problem with religion numbers in Spain is that the first baptism is a very common celebration that families do for new babies. Most people don't see it as a religious thing, but as a celebration thing. And the moment you do it, you are a catholic person for the rest of your life, unless you remove yourself from the registry, which is a very difficult thing to do. I am baptised, but I don't consider myself a religious person anymore (if I ever was). But statistically I am a catholic person.

This can be extended to most religious celebrations. The Holy Week is huge in Spain, but when I was a kid and I walked around with my palm tree, I didn't give a fuck about Jesus or whatever, I just did it because all the other kids did it, and it was funny.

That doesn't mean that there is not a high % of catholics, but Wikipedia says it is a 77%, and I doubt it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Why is Ryzen performing so well in many-core workstation benchmarks but so badly in many-core games?

I have no idea, but I would say the main difference is how cores are used in workstation and in games.

In workstations, like for example when using VM, 3D rendering, compiling,... the cores are used in a constant way, long bursts. Like when you render your Blender project, the OS and the CPUs already know exactly what they will do for the next 10 minutes (or whatever). That doesn't mean there is no information back and forth betweek cores, but the OS/compiler can easily predict that. Let's say that a given core can work for a longer time on their own. VM is the extreme case, where a core is only used for 1 thing, and there is minimal communication with other cores. This also means that cores are used in a more equal way.

Games are the opposite. What a game does changes constantly, because a random person is playing it. It really depends on the game, but in a open world game, for example, the player is constantly moving in / out building, making the character to walk or to take a car, going through a shooting or battle action. There's is a constant communication witht he input, but also the shaders, rendering, models, even the sounds and music, and the on-line features. The OS / CPU cannot predict what's going to happen, because the user is kind of random. In games, cores are required to do shorter bursts of processing. Also, cores are used unequally. You might have 2 of them focusing on the rendering and going almost 100%, but maybe the other one handles sound and input ot whatever, and its needs is more dynamic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No directly blackmailed by social media giants, but politicians in some countries are already sued for something they tweeted more than 5 years ago, even if it was clearly a "joke".

In any case, I think most social networks nowadays won't exist in 30 years. Facebook, for example, is still huge, but it is losing traction: it seems young people (new users) don't use it anymore.  That makes sense when you consider that Facebook nowadays is a network for old people, because every mum, dad and every grandmum is there. Something very similar happens to Twitter. It is transforming from a social network which was used by everyone, to a social network which is mostly only used by famous people.

Back in the day I used windows MSN to chat with friends, and as far as I know that is totally dead now, and I doubt microsoft is saving any kind of chat log. I also used LiveJournal to write a blog, which now it is kind of dead, similar to blogspot. I also used to use a lot IRC, and now I only use it for dev support, and the network I used for casual chat is dead. There was also something called "fotolog", which was instagram way before instagram, which is dead now. I also use to frequent some of the old school forums (I mean, stuff in the late 90s, early 00s, not super old stuff like usenet, I mean a lot of those php forums), which now have disappeared completely. There's a rock forum I used a lot, and I had something like 10k messages, and it is completely gone.

I have no idea what young people use now, maybe that's what they like. I know an older friend has now a kid who is like 10, and he tells me he can spend hours in Twitch tv watching people play game and spamming the chat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When I talk to Eastern Europeans about why they're pro-EU they say the same thing: Their own Government are incompetent and corrupt and they think a European one won't be.

As a eurozone member myself, I actually love the idea of the central european bank and all that, disconnected from our local government. The same way laws should be disconnected from the government (at least it is that way in my country), I think the central bank should also be disconnected.

Obviously the local government decides how to raise or lower taxes, what to do with the money and all that, but I don't think they should be able to do things that a central bank can do. The fact that it is a central european bank, it means it is really disconnected. When the central bank and the government are in the same country (like in the USA), it is just a huge joke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as the american and british press like to throw shit about the Euro, and talk about crisis, members leaving and all that, the reality is that it is a very strong currency, which represents the second economy in the world, under USA, above china.

If you were in mainland Europe and reading our press, things are way less dramatic and moderated. That doesn't mean that there is no criticism.

One very thing about the Euro (which will never be acknowledged by americans or british people) is that it is the most stable currency, because it is barely linked to daily politics. It doesn't really depend on Donald Trumps, or Theresa Mays, or Brexits, or Indyref. Yes, those kind of things can happen, but the currency is governed by a layer above that, which gives some degree of protection.

I really suggest reading good economy journals from any eurozone country. If your only source of information about the Euro is the british or american press, then you got it wrong. Remember 10 years ago in the USA there were even Nobel prizes winners saying that the eurozone will collapse, and now it is as strong as ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do agree with that, because I think people should vote wherever they live, as simple as that.

People think that their vote is something they own. They think a tiny portion of a country belongs to them, and that's why they vote. This is used by politicians and "big powers" as a good way of crowd control. It was not always like that. Not long ago it was very clear that X belongs to the crown, Y belongs to whatever rich family, and so. 

I think people in a country should be able to vote, because your vote doesn't represent YOU, but it does represent whatever you represent in that country.

For example, as a phd student, I am not voting for myself, but I am voting for your average "eu phd student". Once I am gone, there will be another one, and another one, and another one. Because the UK is spending on us on average around 300k, I think we should have a say about how to improve the situation, so that said money is better spent, resources better allocated,... academia is a HUGE business in the UK, and phd students are the cogs powering that. It is not only the money the UK spends on us, but also the money we can bring in terms of investment if our projects are succesful.

That said, I do understand the reasoning of "only citizens can vote". It is the same everywhere. They want you think that being a citizen is something precious. When in reality it is meaningless. </TEXT>

I was able to vote during the scottish elections too, but not during the UK national elections. That's OK for me, I don't expect to vote in their national elections. I prefer to vote in my home country. </TEXT>

It doesn't really matter if you are married or not. The UK is shit with that. If you are married you can get a "married visa" which costs a ton and lasts for like 2 years.

About your partner, it depends on how long has s/he been working. if it was 5 years, then s/he is fine. Otherwise your partner will be in the same situation as me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The rules across the EU are that if you are a guest in another country, then you need private health insurance if you are not paying tax. 

This is false. A public one is enough.

There are around a million brits living in Spain. None of them have a private health insurance, because they are covered by the NHS. A lot of them get permanent residence after 5 years just because it makes everything easier.

	<TEXT> I didn't have one, because I didn't know I needed one. In my country health is public, thus no one has a private insurance. I know plenty of EU students in the UK, and none with a private health insurance.

In the UK I have used the NHS a few times and never they told me I needed one. If they had said this to me, I would have paid for one. As far as I remember, also, the university never advised me to get one.

In any case, if after funding my phd (as said, EPRSC money. afaik the average cost of a life science phd student is around 80k a year, so I used around 320k tax payers money during this 4 years), the UK wants to kick me out without getting anything in return, well I will go to some other country where I can apply the expertise I learned paid by the UK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am one of the people who is going to be very fucked. I arrived to the UK (Scotland) in October 2012 in order to do a PhD, in which I spent 4 years. Now I am working as a researcher in the same university. My girlfriend is from the UK, so in the near future I would like to stay here (no idea what will happen in the far future, I am not the kind of person who plans his life).

Anyway, when brexit happens, 2019, I would have been in the UK 7 years. But because I spent 4 as a PhD student (I was paid by the eprsc as far as I know, but it was an stipend), I won't arrive to the "treaty 5". This means that either I will need to leave, or that I will have to get a visa to stay, needing a total of 9 years (that being optimistic and considering that I will never be unemployed).

I really hope Scotland gets the independence. I already voted yes during the first one.

EDIT: BTW if my girlfriend was not from here, I would leave ASAP. As much as I love Scotland, and I would love to stay here forever, I kind of hate the UK (not the people, but the "instituion" itself). I have a good career, and I could probably find a job anywhere. But I am one of those people who prioritise family over career. </TEXT>

But then, somehow, the employer decided to hire the other one. A employer who in 99% of cases is british. A employer whose priority is money and service, and will hire the best candidate regardless of everything else.

	<DATE> 2017-02-23 12:41:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> All my live since I can remember I have been using Dean Markley strings. Usually the cheapest ones they have 9-42 (searching on the Internet, they look like this: http://c1.zzounds.com/media/fit,2018by3200/quality,85/NickelSteelElSig-5ebc88ecd75967a2fc4a43a2f1eb0e95.jpg)

No idea why I always bought them. I use to break them quite a lot, and they got rusty easily.

Something like a year ago I bought a second hand american stratocaster. I haven't played it much, although I have played it a fair bit. I would say maybe around 50 hours? And yesterday I went to play it again and I realised that the strings are still perfect and clean. I would like to ask the seller for info about the strings, but I lost his information.

So I wonder, which strings do you use and recommend? I don't mind much about the budget. When I use Dean Markley, they are cheap, but I need to change them every month. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [question] cannot get a good clean sound from a Danelectro u56 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-21 23:52:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, my set up is very simple. Focusrite 2i2 direct to Guitar Rig, and from here to the speakers. I also have an american stratocaster, from which I get very decent clean sounds, but I am failing to do so with a Danelectro u56 I recently bought second hand. This guitar has lip stick pick ups.

The guitar in particular is a Danelectro 56-u2 pro (based on this website: http://www.danguitars.com/56-U2.html). It is a budget guitar, I didn't expect something amazing, but new goes for around 400, so it is not like super cheap. It has a decent sound with moderate or low distortion, but when trying to play it clean, it is just not nice. This surprised me because in my experience it is usually easier to get cleaner sounds.

This first audio I am going to paste is from my fender stratocaster, guitar rig, and "twang jazz". Pick ups are first the middle then, and then the neck position: https://clyp.it/dwcvoeel The sound is decent, I think it sounds good.

Now the same but with the danelectro: https://clyp.it/e4qtbxua In this case the first part is with the bridge pickup, and the second part with the neck pickup (I ignored the middle position where it uses both pickups). The volume knob is turned to the near minimum. Something that already surprises me is that there is a bit of distortion, when the sound should be clean. As far as I know the pickups it has have a very low resistance. In any case, as you can see the sound from the neck pickup is just horrible. For a clean sound, it sounds very muddy, too bassy, and it misses the treble completely.

I don't know what I am doing wrong. The only think I can really do is to adjust the height of the pickups, but I dont know if that will fix anything. I have never done it. I don't know if it will have an impact on the sound. </TEXT>

I am spanish, so I don't know about british cases, but for example the top cancer guy in USA is an spanish guy:

Jos Baselga, MD, PhD., (born 1959)[1] is a Spanish medical oncologist and researcher focused on the development of novel molecular targeted agents, with a special emphasis in breast cancer. Baselga serves as Physician-in-Chief at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

From 1996 to 2010, Baselga was the Chairman of the Medical Oncology Service and Founding Director of the recently established Vall dHebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO) at the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital in Barcelona. From 2010 to 2012, he was the chief of the Division of Hematology/Oncology and associate director of the MGH Cancer Center in Massachusetts.

check how much a cancer treatment costs. your chances of having cancer are around a 50%. Check how much the private health insurance covering everything would cost. Check how much it will cost after you go through the cancer and you have your second relapse.

I am saying this because unless you are making millions and can pay a half a million cancer treatment in a private hospital, you are better off having the NHS. </TEXT>

I disagree with this. That is what "tiki taka" wants, to pull you. Worse thing for tiki taka is to park the bus and counters (basically what Madrid or Chelsea did).

FCBarcelona havent played tiki taka since Pep left, so we dont really know how it would perform nowadays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  E.g. Salad crops driven up from Almeria, Spain to Dover consumes 260 grams of CO2 per kg.
 
 
 
 Salad crops shipped from Miami over to Southampton would only consume 241 grams of CO2 per kg and if shipped from Haifa would only consume 197 grams of CO2 per kg.

Your comparison doesnt make any sense. By road you get the veg from Spain to the UK in 2 days, when it is still fresh. You don't need to freeze it. From USA it would take weeks, and you'd need to freeze it. Being frozen or not makes a huge difference when talking about fresh veg. And even then...

You can also ship salad crops from Spain. Distance between San Sebastian to Dover is something like 700 miles. Salad crops can be moved from Almeria to San Sebastian using train, which is the most efficient way of transport. Even better, the train connections between France and Spain are very good, and cheap, so you could move all the product to Calais, and then ferry it to the UK.

No matter how you plan it, there's no way shipping anything from USA is cheaper than Spain. Spain is like 700 miles away, while USA is 3470 miles away. </TEXT>

IMO subsidies are always better than importing, even if the cost is much higher, at least it is money that stays in the country. Every pound you import is a pound lost. That is just my opinion and I don't have any data to back it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the "allergy" to suits is kind of bullshit. Suits are good in a business environment because they are "uniform". Everyone looks the same. It is like school uniforms. It is not about "wowing" without the value. It is just a standard way or dressing. You remove the competition and the "how cool I am" factor from the equation. You can get decent suits for 80.

The allergy of suits started as a way of "being different". "I am so cool and I get so much money I don't even need to use a suit". 

I think in Europe suits are more common (except in start-ups trying to be more american). You avoid fuckups like the NASA guy with the sexist t-shirt.

That said, the only time I have used a suit in the last 5 years or so was during my phd viva. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They want to fish without quotas. 

Who are they going to sell the fish to?

Most of the leftovers from british quotas will be filled by other UE members. Even non EU like Norway or Iceland members will dance in happines because if there's left to fill they can do it, and they already have running agreements with the EU, and the EU won't shaft them just because the UK left the EU. And even then, if you cannot fill the quotas, then the market is open for the UK, yeah, but also for USA, Canada, China and everyone else.

So if they think they will continue to sell the same fish as they do, but not being part of the EU... I think they are in for a big surprise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fish moves. check the PDF I sent. It tells you where every country can fish in each area. 

For example, about cod, which as said the uk can fish up to 25k tonnes, it can fish around 5k in "I and IIb", 10k in norwegian waters, and the rest in "IIa and IIIa". The only part here in british waters is a bit of IIa. Everything else is in russian or norwegian waters.

If you check the PDF you will that almost every fish (I say almost because I havent checked every case, otherwise I will say just every), can be fished in different waters, and not all of them belong to the UK.

UK fish will basically be replaced by denmark, norway, ireland, netherlands, france, iceland. You might say "but oh some of these countries are not part of the UE", yeah, but they have a running agreement which I guess the UE will prioritize. I wouldnt be fair for them to be shafted just because the UK decided to leave.

Moreover, in need of even more fish, the UE can then buy from China, Canada and USA.

Whoever thinks the UE needs british fish is a bit crazy. And this by the way can be applied to almost every product within the EU. We have created an artificial market where we consume our own stuff instead of importing from outside. Olive oil, for example, is mostly from Italy and Spain, just because they are part of the UE. Same as tomatoes and plenty of veg. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never understood the position of the fishermen. The UK has BY FAR the best quotas within the EU. Every fish which can be fished in british waters has the biggest quota given to the UK. You can see it here:

https://ec.europa.eu/fisheries/sites/fisheries/files/docs/body/poster_tac2015_en.pdf

For example, cod, UK can fish almost 30k tones. The dangerous dutch people who steal from british waters can fish up to 2.5k tones. Haddock, UK more than 25k tonnes, next country is left with 8k (france), Mackerel the UK can fish up to 250k tonnes, next one is Ireland with around 100k.

Just check that PDF and you will see that the lie of "the dutch stealing british fish" doesnt sustain itself after reading that for 10 seconds.

I wonder what is the business plan of the UK fishermen. Like, OK, you are out the EU, and EU countries cannot fish in your waters. Do you realize now that other countries will take over your quotas when possible? Who do you plan to sell your fish to? Do they really think that they will just get all the benefits? That Denmark will stop fishing cod so that they can sell it in the UK? </TEXT>

The government should not deny those in same-sex relationships the right to marry and enjoy the same benefits, rights, and responsibilities as opposite-sex married couples, Gabbard says on her campaign website. "

Maybe she opposed it before and she changed her mind. She is still very young, opinions evolve.

	<TEXT> I don't know if that would be possible. In a computer we are used to just get a new screen and adjust the resolution easily through the OS, but I don't think it would be that easy with a 3DS, especially because it needs to be retro compatible with everything else and I don't think game makers will ship games with higher res textures.

This is something that they had to improve from the start. the fact that it was released with 240p was a big mistake IMO.

What I would add for a new iteration is better cpu (more framerate, and less battery), bigger battery, and more ram. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  if Spain didn't still have Ceuta and Melilla in North Africa.

As happens with Gibraltar, a big portion of the people living in Ceuta and Melilla would rather be part of Spain, than part of Morocco. Although this seems to be changing because the population is going to a turning point where it will have a majority of arab / islam people, and those people are more likely to prefer Morocco, being it a Islam country, than Spain.

It is interesting how people can prioritize religion over free education / universal health system. </TEXT>

I would be extremelly annoyed if they don't let me vote. I could vote int the first one, and I voted yes. Every other EU citizen I know voted for no. If after Brexit they don't let us vote again, it would be a total sham. I really hope the SNP forces the same conditions as before, because there are between 100k and 200k eu citizens that could potentially vote, and it will be very narrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get what you are worth. Business won't pay more beause there's a "shortage", except when it is completely unavoidable. In which case, they will rise the prices, meaning that technically you won't get a higher purchasing power, which is the important thing. If you compare salaries in the UK with salaries across Europe in similar PPP countries (like Germany, France, Netherlands,...) you will see that salaries are very similar. Some jobs get more here, some jobs get more in Germany, but the average is similar.

If you consider the "Big Mac index" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Mac_Index) you will see that in countries with a high salary the "Big Mac" is more expensive. In Denmark, for example, a McDonalds worker get a minimum of 16, but they pay 4 for a Big Mac, as opposed to 2.29 in the UK (plus the fact that someone in a british McDonalds will barely pay taxes, while in Denmark they will pay around 50 or 60% depending on the total number of hours).

By the way, I am not against the danish system, I am actually all in, and I will swap it right now. But while it works in a small country with like 5m people, something similar it will probably impossible to implement in a country with 65m people. (convince them to pay 60% in taxes). The way to rise wages is to increase productivity and cut down the extreme bonuses of the higher ups. Artificially creating a shortage of work force won't increase it, when this shortage is not happening also 20 miles away from UK in France. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Germany would have attacked the UK regardless. They had already designed the nukes to drop in London way before the UK declare the war to them. They needed the British sea. They were also killing British people just because they happened to be there and were from some minority.

Plus, imagine a situation where no one stopped the Nazis. Do you really want to live in that world ? 

I suggest you seriously read again about the WW2 if you think it the UK role on it was just charity. WW2 is a consequence of WW1 where the UK were balls deep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> so far, nothing.

I cannot enter EDL mode (I remember I could enter EDL mode to install global rom over my vendor rom). As soon as I try to enter EDL mode the phone just boots.

I tried to install dev or stable china using the software updater, but it won't do it.

So I guess I need one of those USB cables to install dev china, and maybe I will be able to unlock. But I don't want to spend the extra money just for that. I know there's a DIY method, but I don't really want to try it. </TEXT>
