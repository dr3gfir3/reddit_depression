I am not sure if I misunderstood it, but when was the last time female CS teams filled a big arena? And why aren't they just participating in male tournaments in the first place. Corruption and ignorance from the hosts or something would come in mind but I don't know enough about the view of female and male CSeperation in eSports.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So here is the small problem I made. I wanted to fresh install Windows 10 on the SSD and I forgot to unplug my HDD with Windows already installed on it, so now every time I boot up my PC it asks me weather I want to boot with Windows 10 or Windows 7. I will probably fix that soon though. If you want to fresh install Windows on your SSD. Plug it in, unplug the HDD with your OS, install Windows. Aaaand you're done.

If you are looking into taking the data from your current drive that has your OS on it make sure you pick a SSD with enough space for it all, or delete some data from your old Drive. There are programs that clone your old drive and put the data on your SSD. In that case, if I understood correctly. You plug in your SSD, open up the program, Pick your old drive and SSD and then clone. But I have no experience with that so you might want to look into some tutorials. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heads up he is not wasting his time! He is doing something that he loves and enjoys doing and I am sure he will find awesome friends who do the same. I don't know if he is missing school or something to play XBox which is a bad thing to do, but from my experience he'll grow up just fine. My parent's gave me a PS1 for my 7th brithday (I think :S) and since then I've not stopped playing games and I am currently doing my A level and regularly meeting with friends and I've even made friends with people from other countries that I met in real life at a gaming event :D You could try to see what he is doing and maybe you'll have some interest in what he is doing and you two could spend some time together playing games. (There are games for everyone no matter of age of gender)  </TEXT>

We are willing to give shelter to those feeling from war and terrorism. And the people in Berlin did not die because we accept refugees. They died in an act of terror which is a tragedy.   </TEXT>
