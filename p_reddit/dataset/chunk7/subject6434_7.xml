	<TEXT> Perhaps your boyfriend may have abused as a child, neglected or brought up in an emotionally unstable environment where lying was easier and led to less suffering (in the short term) than telling the truth? As this develops from childhood into adulthood, it can become a means to separate reality and the world portrayed in the mind. In any case, it's really cool you have patience with him, he's lucky to have someone willing to keep him honest. </TEXT>
