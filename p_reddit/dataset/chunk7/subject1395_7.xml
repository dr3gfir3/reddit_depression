	<TEXT> So I feel like you would like this - I have an app called Corsair Effects Engine that let you turn your keyboard/mouse into an audio spectrum analyzer. So it flashes alone with music/sound. It's ridiculously cool, and it's more fun than the effects you can normally find.

	<TEXT> I'm a bit late, but:

Corsair K70 RGB Cherry MX Browns - I have the LEDs set up with a rainbow spectrum analyzer, so it dances around in different colors to the music. 

Logitech Proteus Core G502 - love this mouse. 

Sennheiser HD598Cs - amazing headphones, [I recommend this cable](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B00KAKBHKM/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8 psc=1).

Antlion ModMic Unidirectional - clips onto the side of your existing headphones. This is great because I can switch headphones really easily while still using my mic. 

Bose Companion 2 II speakers - better than the series III. Got for free when I worked for Bose. 

Dell u2515h monitor on a dual vesa mount with a u2415h. Made the mistake and bought a 24" and a 25". Shame. Will upgrade some day. 

Next up I'm saving for a Schiit Modi 2 and Magni 2 DAC/amp combo.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> IP Video Server - Trying to rip DVDs to the right format... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 13:47:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So let me know if there is a better place to post about this!

I work at a hospital and I have been given control of the video server running movies on the TV channels here. We use an older Leightronix Nexus server. I was trained on how to queue movies for our weekly schedule, but I am trying to dig a bit deeper and try to add more movies to the server. My coworkers don't really know any more about this system than I do.

Leightronix has their own import tool for DVDs, but it runs into what I can only assume are copyright issues every time I try to rip a DVD. The problem is, the server disc management software only recognizes very specific files:

Acceptable stream types: MPEG-1 System Stream or MPEG-2 Program Stream (consisting of a single elementary video stream with an optional single elementary audio stream)
NOTE:  Transport stream is not possible.
Elementary video stream

Three video resolutions (pixels) are allowed.  Other resolutions are not supported. 352 x 240 (Horizontal x Vertical)
352 x 480 
720 x 480

Picture rate must be 29.97 pictures per second.
A maximum bit rate of 10 Mb/s is allowed.  Higher rates are not supported.
National TV Standards Committee (NTSC) with 4:3 aspect ratio required.
4:2:0 sampling format required.  (Main profile at Main or Low level, 10 Mb/s max)
IBBP group of pictures (GOP) structure recommended for best quality (30 frame maximum GOP size).
Encode header information in stream every few seconds to aid in error recovery.
Audio, if present, must be encoded into the MPEG file using Audio layer II.
Audio may be encoded at a 32, 44.1, or 48KHz sampling frequency.  LEIGHTRONIX recommends an audio sampling rate of 44.1 KHz for optimal performance.
MPEG filenames may contain up to 27 characters (no spaces) in addition to the required ".mpg" extension.


I know that's ridiculously restrictive, but I really want to be able to broadcast newer movies (instead of forcing children to watch The Sandlot twice a month...) I have ripped a few DVDs with different settings in VLC, but I really don't know enough about video format/bitrate/containers/etc here - trial and error will just take forever. 

If I'm asking the wrong thing (re: copyright), can you recommend a more modern video serving option? 

Thanks a lot for any assistance you can give me!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have thought about doing one of these, though I don't think I'd want all the weight of a 3.5mm male and female jack in the middle of the line - I was thinking of terminating it with a 2.5 or something and using a 2.5-3.5 extension. 

I ended up swapping the coiled cable on my Senn HD280s with just a female 3.5 up top, and I love that so far. Definitely get the grief with the locked 2.5 on the 598s though - I wish I could swap cables with the 280s.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just one more question!

Old 3DS 11.2

I'm on the "Section IV - Restoring the System" part of the guide. SysNAND Restore tells me there are no usable files found. I definitely see NANDmin in /files9/, and I tried using a backup copy that I had on my computer, but it's not seeing it. Do I have any options here?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Old 3DS 11.2

So I've completed most of the guide up until 2xrsa - I carefully put all the files I needed on the SD card, launched web browser on the 3ds, put in the URL, hit enter, got a message that it was loading a .bin, then nothing. Screen froze. 

Gave it a few minutes, got nothing, restarted, tried wiping browser data as the guide suggests, same thing. 

Popped out the SD. Checked the arm9.bin and arm11.bin files, put SD back into 3ds, now it won't boot with the SD card in. I guess this would be easier if I knew more about what this exploit was doing...

Any advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Soundhax question:
11.2.0 35U - put all the files on the root of the SD, running the file through sound app just crashes the app. Occasionally it gives me a red/green/blue flash first. Is this what the guide means by "This may take several tries"? </TEXT>
