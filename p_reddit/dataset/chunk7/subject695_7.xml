	<TITLE> I need help finding a horror movie from my childhood. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-29 08:34:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been looking for a horror movie I saw on HBO with my dad most likely when I was 4 or 5 years old back in 1984/85 (shit, it even might have been in 1983). From the little that I remember, it took place in a big, old house and there was a small group of young adults there. I don't remember what they were doing there. Maybe they were trying to rescue someone? A couple of scenes have stuck with me. One was where some of the people decided to peer into a hole in a wall and they saw a deformed looking (incest?) woman about to give birth and some doctors were helping her try deliver the baby. Her belly was getting bigger and bigger. I think at some point she notices the people peeking through the hole in the wall. The second thing I remember is one of the young people sees someone they know outside of the building and they get his attention. He yells something and opens his shirt or jacket and he was covered with something black. From what I can remember, they were insects (beetles or scarabs?) crawling all over him. 

My dad died a long time ago (in 1999) and I have not been able to find anyone who has any idea as to what the hell it was that I saw. I would be so happy if someone on Reddit can tell me the name of the movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, yeah. My family was fucked up about letting me watch violent and disturbing movies when I was young. My sister took me to see Silence of the Lambs when I was 10 I wanted to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 but the theater was sold out. So we went to see SotL instead. The scene where the insane guy splashed his semen on Clarice went above my head. I had no idea what that was. The part where Buffalo Bill had his dick tucked away and pranced around to Q Lazzarus's "Goodbye Horses" had me thinking for days. I did leave the theater saying I thought the movie was  awesome.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may just be a stranger on Reddit, but really I am glad to hear that you are doing well now. Video gaming and listening to metal pretty much were my releases to help me cope with teenaged bullshit.

P.S. I think the picture is cute.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many on here are claiming that everyone knew the WMDs were not being claimed as being nuclear are either liars or forgetful. The Bush administration was going on TV constantly insisting on, "Not wanting the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud."

Cheney on March 16, 2003 edition of Meet the Press said, "[W]e believe he has, in fact, reconstituted nuclear weapons."

My municipality made a clerical error in not processing the check they received in the mail and they drove up to my house and turned the water off immediately. Had to call them to get everything straightened out. They turned it off while I was in the bathroom shaving.  </TEXT>
