	<TEXT>  From a combined total of 43 different sea turtles, we encountered 20 different epibiont taxa. Many of these epibionts have only rarely been observed by scientists before  probably because theyve only been found attached to sea turtles. In addition, many of these epibionts have bizarre adaptations that let them live life as hitchhikers.

 We discovered hermaphroditic barnacles that use their heads to cement themselves to the sea turtles shell....  a sea turtle resting on the sea floor with a shell covered in barnacles could very easily be mistaken for a rock. </TEXT>
