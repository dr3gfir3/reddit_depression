	<TEXT> Yes. Hyder had a good season but his sack numbers declined once teams got film on him. He was not useful vs the run either. If I recall his sacks primarily came from dropping inside to the 3 tech in obvious passing situations. 

Washington has potential but he is still a reserve player who needs to prove himself.

	<TEXT> Historically a lot of these farming towns had 90 to 99 percent of people in the community work in agriculture. However due to heavy automation I think it's down to 1 to 15 percent currently. But a lot of the people are just there still. The ones who have been able to get out when they're younger usually take the chance.

	<TEXT> The Lions spent so much time talking about Jean-Gilles that, when they decided not to draft him, they didn't have another option ready to go. As they wondered what to do, a voice in the back of the room (the identity of which I haven't confirmed yet) said "Take Brian Calhoun.'' So they did.

Actually it was a running back.
