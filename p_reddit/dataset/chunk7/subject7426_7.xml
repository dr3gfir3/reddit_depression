	<TEXT> Hahahah yeah I know not to beat myself up over what the scale says. I'm using it more as a long-term progression metric rather than a week-by-week indicator. As for feeling comfortable at the gym, I think I just need to suck it up and dive in. I go to one of the nicer gyms in town and I'd like to believe memberships cost is enough to weed out the weight room jackasses.

Slightly off topic, but what headphones do you use? I'm always looking for a good recommendation to replace my $6 Amazon earbuds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 27 yo, 6'2" and fluctuate beteween 240-250 lb. depending on how much of a lug I am. Right now my primary goal is weight loss which I know will be made so much easier by weight lifting. I just need to do it. I'm think my biggest hurdle will be feeling comfortable in that space at the gym.

I'm using My Fitness Pal to track food and have been logging weight once a week with images. I've also started to make changes to my diet. The biggest challenge here is trying to get my husband on board with the diet changes as well because there's no way I'm shopping/cooking two unique meals a night. We are going to start bulk cooking meals because we both hate cooking on weeknights and I think this will help a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Morning y'all!

I've been settling into a regular gym schedule and am pretty comfortable with the environment. However, I haven't worked up the nerve to migrate from the cardio equipment to the weights and this is something I would like to do. What are some basic routines, suggestions, tips, or other bits of encouragement/advice you have for a fellow gaybro that wants to break through the cardio bubble and start putting on muscle?

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice guys! I didn't check Reddit last night and came back to a full inbox! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree that getting the hell out of there would be your best course of action, make sure you have plan before you walk out that door. It's the simple things like how you will earn money, where you will stay (even temporarily), and how you plan on dealing with the fallout. This would be a bold move to make and it might very well be the right move. Just make sure you've crossed your t's and dotted your i's! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where are you located? If you are able, I would reach out to an LGBT hotline near you. Most major cities have social service programs for at-risk lgbt youth and I think you'd fall into this category. I lived with a woman who worked for one of these programs in Milwaukee and they are very skilled at providing aid to people in your situation. I'm no expert in this area, but this would be my recommendation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely agree with you on this. My depression (previous to last week) mostly manifested in me being a little b**** to everyone around me for a hot moment. Since I had always had these mood swings, I didn't think anything of them until I had that "ah ha!" moment and put the pieces together.

Admission to yourself is also a huge step. Admitting that I could have depression helped alleviate the stress that was mounting around the uncertainty of it all. By the time I was actually diagnosed I didn't even think I needed to be seeking help anymore. I think the biggest take-away for me was recognizing that I need to view this as an ongoing thing rather than isolated incidents. </TEXT>

Q1: What's your favorite holiday tradition? Pre-married life, it was white elephant gifts with my dad's family. Christmas has been kinda up in the air as my husband and I settle into married life so I'm sure we'll pick up some new holiday traditions on the way!

Q2: What are you hoping is under the Christmas tree? Something leather from Sexy Gay Santa, something random and fun from my GayBro's Secret Santa, and some new vinyl from Boring Regular Santa.

Q3: What's a odd and/or interesting question that's fun to discuss? Here's an oldie but a goody and has been a good ice-breaker at weddings where I didn't know anyone. If you had no wrists, how would you masturbate? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was going to make a similar comment but you beat me to it. I think dialogue clarifiers great training wheels while for both beginners trying their hand at conversations (they can be intimidating!) as well as long-time writers who want to experiment with how they write dialogue. Or if a room full of people are talking all at once. But for intimate conversations or a steady back-and-forth between two people, adding clarifiers can bog the dialogue down and cause it to lose its punch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And follow-up part three - I added an indicator of scale, you'll just need to click into the imgur album. I also do not have a pre-war map. I'm figuring out how to clone the Inkarnate map so I can have multiple versions to play around with. </TEXT>
