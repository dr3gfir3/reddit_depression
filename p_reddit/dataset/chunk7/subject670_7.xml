If we've learned anything this election, it's that what it takes to win a party primary in this country is *drastically different* than what it **should** take to win an election. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't know what would have happened had an *established* Democrat entered, because none did. My assertion is had Biden run, for example, it would have been much *much* different.

The Democratic party wanted a Democrat. The Democratic party didn't want a non-Democrat.   The non-Democrat didn't get the Democratic nomination; the Democrat did.

Hillary was better suited to win the Democratic primary; one of the main reasons being she was a Democrat. Again, I don't really see your point. What's wrong with 'the party' not wanting an outsider to win?  

My point is that Bernie (or whoever) would have been better suited to win the general, like Kasich (or whoever) would have been better suited to win the general. But, they lost their respective primaries because they were not better suited to win those. Had they been, they would have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one has what it takes "on their own." You can't just vote for yourself and call it a day.

But, why would the Democratic party rally behind someone who just joined their party less than a year ago to run for president? Bernie wasn't a Democrat. He was a proud independent his whole life, until 2015 when he switched to run for president.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders) Many of his supports weren't even registered to vote in the Democratic primary, since they were independents too.

It's not really that shocking someone who isn't a Democrat didn't win the Democratic primary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that if things where different, things would have been different. But, things aren't different. So, the tautology is a meaningless one.

Hillary and Trump had what it took to win their respective primaries, aka more people voted for them in them than anyone else. We are seeing here that the majority of people that vote in primaries don't have the same metric for candidates as the majority of people that vote in the elections.

Also, we have seen in the last 8 years that the majority of Republican primary votes are WILDLY different from the majority of votes. Trump is just the latest and most extreme example of this fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She didn't win before people voted for her or Bernie. I should know, I voted for Bernie. The bottom line is more people voted for Hillary [(~3M more)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Party_presidential_primaries,_2016).

If the leaks had happened earlier, she might have lost. And, if she ran before 1913, she would have lost. "What ifs" aren't really useful here. More people voted for Hillary and Trump in the primaries than for the other candidates, thus they won.

Any claim otherwise is ontologically incorrect. </TEXT>

Whatever else you want to say about shady dealings, Hillary got more human beings to vote for her in the primary than Bernie did. That is what it takes to win an election, people voting for you.

If we've learned anything this election, it's that what it takes to win a party primary in this country is drastically different than what it should take to win an election. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I didn't suggest we "give it a try *just because."* I suggested giving it a try *because* there seems to be a demand for it. So, my logic would not lead to "giving everything a try."

Additionally, looking at some of the source code for the webpage, it seems it would be a trivial change to make. So, I reject the idea that it would be costly, as your "karma for money" idea would be.

Right now, it is a fact that multiple people have asked for this feature. And, there is only conjecture supporting the stance that it is a 'bad' (or 'good') idea. I would suggest finding out if the idea is good or bad empirically.

Regardless, I'm not sure I understand the purpose of this subreddit, if it's not to determine if there is a demand for new, inexpensive reddit features.  </TEXT>

Right now, to see the worst you have to click "show show show" and scroll down and down and down. It's a real hassle for those of us that do, on occasion, want to read the worst comments. It seems needless tedious to hide these undeleted comments when some people do want to read them.

It would also make it easier for people to check what had been said, but rejected. You -youself- might like that, as it would mitigate "bad" suggestions from being made over and over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason Bernie didn't win was because people are apathetic about voting. More 'boring' people went out to vote for the "safe" candidate, because many radicals are disillusioned with the whole process so many didn't bother.

Politicians pay "a fuck ton of money" to perpetuate the myth that "votes don't matter." That way they only need to pander to old people that **do** vote. Young people's voices don't get heard simply because they're conditioned not to use them. Politicians don't have to answer to likes on facebook; they have to answer to people that go vote. And, they spend money to make people think it's the other way around.

	<TEXT> Yeah, the problem with FPtP is any 3rd party candidate will draw votes *away* from the person who is *most* ideologically similar to them. Meaning the candidate *least* like them will now have a *better* chance of winning (and should give money to the 3rd party candidate LEAST like themselves). Which is why Bernie didn't run 3rd party, doing so would drastically increase *Trump's* chances of winning.

So, a [strategic voter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tactical_voting) in a FPtP should always vote for whichever they **hate the least** in the top two, not whoever they like the most out of everyone. Thus, we *always* end up with "the lesser of two evils." </TEXT>

Anyway, [have you seen this video about why our democracy leads to two parties yet.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7tWHJfhiyo)  At this point in a FPtP democracy, people are strategically voting AGAINST a person, not **for** a person.  And, that will happen regardless. If we all voted for only a person that 100% agrees with us, we'd all vote for ourselves.

Social contracts, like all contracts, can only work if people compromise. We'll never all agree on solutions to social problems, for example, but we still need to make laws that apply to all. </TEXT>

The 'exact same' isn't "continuity?" Or are you saying we don't have a "real" democracy?  What would be an example of a "real" one, in that case?

 Do you really think we have the two best candidates being presented as a choice? 

If you vote for someone other than yourself, you've already compromised. Since no one else but yourself agrees with you 100% of the time. Clinton is the "best choice" for exactly one person, as is Trump.

Anyway, some day people will stop accepting this "least worst" arrangement and write in their best choice.

If we all write 'ourselves' no one will win. You need compromise in a representative democracy. 

I just want to promote the fact that as bad as trump has the potential to be, Clinton has the track record that shows what a shitshow her regime will be.

	<TEXT>  Why do you think she would show restraint in Syria?

The "restraint" we are talking about is that she would evaluate the situation based on known intel and modulate her choice of action based on what others, like Russia, are doing and saying.

When it comes to that level of "restraint," as in, who looks at data outside of themselves (as you seem to be doing now), which candidate -Trump or Clinton- does it better? Well, before you answer, let me back up a bit and look at this interaction between me and your.

See, the issue I have with the discussion we are currently having is you are focused on one issue. You see what Clinton has done in the past, and are assuming she will make choices you don't agree with in the future. And, since you have little to no data on Trump, you are assuming his (null_return) will be better than something you know already you don't like.

And, I think that's fine. Seems reasonable based on the assumptions you are making.

However, I -speaking for myself- am worried about a broader spectrum than just Assad. I am more worried about the overall ideology of the candidates. I see one candidate that makes decisions based on what those around them are doing. Who changes tactics and responds to new information. And, I see one candidate that looks to himself and surrounds himself with sycophants. 

That -to me- is the important issue. Not which candidate will make the best decision on ONE issue, but which candidate has the best OVERALL IDEOLOGY when it comes to HOW one makes decisions.  Which candidate relies on new information.

So, if you want me to say that Trump is better than Clinton **when it comes to Assad,** I do not mind conceding **that** point. I will say I don't have enough information to claim otherwise.

I am more concerned with **WHY** Trump made his choice, what reasoning went into it?
And, WHY did Clinton make hers, what reasoning went into it?

You seem to know why Clinton made her statements about it. Do you know why Trump made his? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You just described to a T her effort to insure the destruction of Libya.

You don't think 'heedless and headstrong' is a better descriptor of Trump?

That's why it is so annoying that trump gets called out for bullshit while Clinton gets a free pass for actual insanity.

She hasn't done anything about Assad yet. She's only had 'bullshit words.' So, there is no 'actual insanity.' You've just painted a pretty picture based on speculation.

Yet, we can't even speculate about what Trump might do because he's never even worked for the government. While Clinton (and her husband) HAVE worked for the government, and hasn't caused Russia to Nuke us.  Or, am I wrong about that? Clinton has been at the highest level of power already, and we seem to still all be here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So Hillary is very likely to put us in direct conflict with Russia. Russia has nuclear weapons. Russia already showed in Crimea, and is showing in Syria, that they won't surrender an area of influence without a fight.

So, it is your assertion that Clinton will attempt to remove Assad by force, even if Russia threatens us with nuclear retaliation if we do? They she will not be respectful of diplomacy *in anyway,* and would be heedless and headstrong in all of her attempts?

Well, I guess we will have to agree to disagree. </TEXT>

I have no idea what you are talking about. I said "you shouldn't vote for Trump" and suddenly you started talking to me about Assad and how Clinton would be both too nice and too mean to Jihadists.

I mean, I guess I kinda care about removing a murderous dictator. But, I wouldn't put "who may or may not attempt to stop an ongoing genocide in an unspecified way" on the top ten issues I care about. Yet, it seems as if you feel this whole Assad thing is the end all and be all of not voting for Trump. 

People seem unsure whether or not Trump will start the **nuclear holocaust.** That's more of a concern to me than whether or not Clinton will use ground troops to attempt to remove some dictator half a world away. </TEXT>

The point is to try and get people EXCITED for Hillary. Otherwise its just "vote for someone you don't like because she'd not Hitler, or don't vote."

Look, I've been a Democrat my whole life AND I think Trump is Loonytoons. But, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to muster the will to leave my computer and go vote come November. I've voted for a Democrat in every presidential election I've been eligible to vote in, but why should I bother this time if Hilary is inevitable?

	<TEXT>  How did the rebellion morph into a jihadist movement teeming with mercenaries? How did Isis run convoys of hundreds and thousands of tankers across open terrain under the watchful eyes of our drones and bombers? Why did Isis fight the government coalition tooth and nail to keep supply lines open from turkey, a US ally and NATO member? Why do 80% of Syrians think Isis is a US creation? Why does Hillary want a no fly zone?

I have no idea. I thought you were the one informing me about stuff. YU asking all these questions?

If you look at Libya you can see what will happen if they remove Assad: jihadist takeover. 

I thought the US was good at installing puppet governments? It seems like that's happened more often than Jihads. Am I wrong about that? How many Middle Easter governments have been created over how many Jihadist groups, do you know?

But, who is talking about removing Assad again? How'd we even get on him? Do you have a citation?  </TEXT>

Here is the problem: Trump **only** uses simple language and implications in his speech patterns. This method allows the audience to draw mainly their own conclusions on "what he *really* means." It is also why he contradicts himself so often. The way he speaks is *purposefully* unclear, because it allows the listener to project whatever meaning they want onto the words.  This is great for some things, and many politicians do this for issues they don't want to be direct about.

However, the nuclear option is *NOT* one of those issues.

Any *real* politician knows some issues you have to be VERY VERY clear about. 'Nukes' being at the top of that list. But, Trump only has one mode of speaking. He only has one speed. So, when he *tries* to talk about nukes, he uses his simple language. This allows the audience to draw their own conclusions. 

Those conclusions range between: *"He'll only use it if he absolutely has no other choice"* to *"He'll blow everyone up if they look at him funny."*

When we remember 'the audience' in this case means 'every other country, from Japan to Russia to England' this is very very *BAD.* We don't want these countries 'drawing their own conclusions.' We absolutely **need** our leader to be *direct* on some complex ideas. </TEXT>

Yet, Trump seemed to think Obama needed to release his birth certificate. 

Maybe someone should ask the Russians to get his tax returns.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem with all of the evil games I've run (except one) was that the party would implode and kill each other. Experienced RP players seem even more prone to this outcome. They feel like an evil character *SHOULD* kill other people for profit or pride. That's the downside of being evil: lack of cohesion. Evil people don't have congruent morals to keep them all on the same page.

The only evil game I ever ran that didn't have this problem, I made all of the characters worship the same god: Myrkul. They all lived in a temple to the god of death, and had for most of their lives. I had them write up a back story about why they lived there, and then I made it one of my goals as the DM to really give them reasons to be loyal to Myrkul. I wove into the intro to the story that Myrkul had shown *favoritism* to them in one way or another (dependent on their personal backstory). And, I never gave them reason to doubt Myrkul's confidence in them. Later, as I am want to do, I did have a particularly powerful [Asura](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/asura) (*Onamahli the Twice Pure*) try to turn them on each other. But, I made sure they had a strong base before I tried to tear them apart.

I know quite a bit about the 40k storyline. And, I think it would probably be a good idea if you made sure all of them work for the same god. Having the same god gives them commonality in philosophy they'll not have otherwise. Nurgle, for example, is very fatherly to his followers and could inspire loyalty. But, Nurgle can't inspire loyalty in an Slaanesh follower. Sounds like you're in Fantasy, but in 40K a Khorne Berzerker would much rather kill a Sorcerer of the Thousand Sons then help him.

But, if they (and you) really want to have them worship different gods (which I don't recommend). I think it would be super important you give them a very very strong reason to work together. Some overarching goal or enemy were they *need* each other (the Star Child?). Their gods can even tell them they **have** to work together or face their ire. 

The problem I had with this method was that the party fell apart during side quests. If you remove the pressure of why they are working together for a few nights (because side quests happen) they forget why they're not stabbing one another for XP and loot.

**tl;dr:** Make sure they have really good, sustainable, and strong reasons for them to all work together, else you'll have a TPK and/or a bunch of characters that can't play together anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And you don't feel like they should be indignant if you insulted them?

Like, if I walked up to your grandpa (when he was alive) and started disrespecting him, you think he should just sit there and take it? Or forget about it quickly?

You seem to be shocked this grandmother took these insults to heart. I guess you think grandparents shouldn't. </TEXT>
