	<TEXT> YES! This is a big thing that I hate. Today I had the happiest lunch ever. I'm doing this program at a university that is similar to summer school but for students who are only just getting into uni. The program only just started so nobody knows anybody at the moment. During lunch people started playing music on the speakers on the classroom and everybody was listening and later on other people wanted to play their own music. Everybody had their own genres and artist that they listened to and what really surprised me was that nobody judged their taste. Instead they talked about hows its really different and how they like it. we had stuff ranging from Japanese heavy metal to Alt-j to rap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really a "he's right behind me" moment but I was riding the bus to school one day and I had my mate sitting next to me and it was a pretty awkward and quiet ride. We went past a dairy and I thought that shitty dairy was a good convo starter. So I turn to my mate and start going off at about how shitty the dairy is because they are super rip off and how the guy behind the counter is a dick and started talking about his monobrow. Turns out that dairy was owned by his family and the guy with the monobrow was his dad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything that happens can always be proven by science. This could be because we have someone watching over our simulation that looks for glitches. But the one monitoring us can't patch glitches to get rid of them or it would be too obvious. So instead he adds more to the glitch to give it a scientific explanation. An example for this could be the way massive tanks crush themselves by pressure change. Someone witnessed this glitch happen and decided to investigate. While they were investigating a patch is released that had a scientific explanation for the scientists to find instead of them finding out the sim glitched. </TEXT>
