	<TEXT> I know this post isn't about MEMES and making SJW jokes.

But it's critical to the success of America.

Our industries, like US Steel (Carnegie) founded this country.  They are the backbone of our infrastructure.

And I've the past 8 years, cheap crappy steel from you-know-where, mined with slave-wage labor and environment irrelevance.

Unlike American Steel, which is up to par environmentally and funded with long term Union Factory jobs and benefits.

This is what Making America Great Again is fighting for.  This is why we wanted to win the election.  Help American workers and American Industry. 

Show your support!!!!!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a fan when a game company bans like 1,000 players all at once and PUBLICLY bans them.

I'm not a fan of playing against or even with them before they are banned.

I'm even less a fan when, like Dice and EA where nothing is done to anyone ever regardless of how much they cheat </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then : weapons and armor! 

One thing I was SUPER excited about playing with was the weapon / item cruncher in BL-PreSeq.

I was Soooooo disappointed to find out that none of the red-texts or specials would be transferred to the new item

Imagine adding a Bee Shield and a Vlad Shield only to get a corrosive spike splash damage added onto amped shots!  How fun!  I'd farm bees and Vlads like crazy just for the small chance they blend.

Or a life drain grenade + a magic missile + fire storm

Ok that'd be OP but my point is IT'D BE FUN!!!!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, a lot of Christian and Jewish ceremonies were based off a whole pantheon of Pagan, Roman, Greek, Old Testimwnt, etc practices

Around 325, the Council of Nicaea, organized and somewhat negotiated by Constantine kinda came to a meet-halfway for those ceremonies.  

But Christianity's core strength is to allow varying viewpoints and practices within it religion, and most people follow the simple Judaea-Christian ethics of 'love thy neighbor'.  Makes the world a better place!

Hope you're having a great day as well!  


Cary on 'pedes!

I'm fine w his emotions, the Solo death scene, although predictable, was well done.

It's his fight scene vs Fin and Rey that was totally implausible given his training.

But that doesn't mean there aren't consequences for proclaiming said speech.

As a Univ Professor tweeting publicly in a non-joking manner to 'hang the president'   'the sooner and the higher the better' is grounds for treatment as a direct threat to The POTUS.

I hope he spends time on a small cage reflecting on his words
