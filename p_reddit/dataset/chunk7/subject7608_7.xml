	<TEXT> I love doing things to make my friend happy. He was there for me in a really dark time and so I'm repaying him for that by doing everything I can to make sure he's happy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. Not really much they can do. Drinking in college was our thing. And going downtown on Fridays or Saturdays is a big thing with young people here. I don't mind it as much when I can be DD. But a lot of places here don't let it in under 21.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rope. Ball gags. Whips. Canes. Blindfolds. 
Not me. Him. 
When he's tied up and gagged and whipped and blindfolded I feel really powerful and he feels so submissive and we both love it. He gets so hard and horny and by the time I untie him, he's in me in seconds. BDSM is such a great thing to be into holy shit </TEXT>
