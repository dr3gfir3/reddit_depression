	<TEXT> They're getting plenty done.  Just because your knowledge of what's going on in government only extends to the latest media blast doesn't mean they're not doing incredible harm to the nation and the world.  Or maybe you didn't hear that they've put a right wing nutjob onto the Supreme Court with more likely to come.  That in itself should set us back about 50 years or so.

But I guess leaving 'your' party is the top priority.  Your need to throw tantrums and have it entirely your way is going to cost the Democrats many elections and give the alt-right control for a long, long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always laugh when I read garbage like you posted because people like yourself never ask how we can afford to bomb the shit out of other countries or spend more on our military buildup than nearly every other country on Earth combined, but you need to know how every last penny will be raised for basic healthcare and education.

Nice to see you have your priorities set right. /s </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously what you posted is pure bullshit, but you want to believe it, so help yourself.

Democrats were expected to win the presidency, take control of the senate and pick up enough seats in the house to make the republicans worry about a wipe-out.  How did that turn out for you "mainstream" Dems?  

As Harry Truman said so many years ago, if you give the people a choice between a republican and a Democrat who acts like a republican, they'll go for the real thing every time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ignored it because it's not much of a point.  You believe something will happen.  Great.  If the next general election candidate is as remarkably flawed as the one in 2016, you may be right.

More likely, it will be the sense of entitlement like that your comments exude that turns people off of voting for Democrats, but you go on going on with your bad self and see where you end up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh huh.  You keep on blaming others for Clinton's faults and see how another 4 years of Trump and a republican congress does for you.  People like yourself are why Democrats aren't competitive in so many regions.  You let your infatuation with the idea of something, in this case a woman president, overtake any loyalty to actual Democratic ideals.  

Warren would be a great candidate, but who's going to listen to her when people like yourself are sucking up all the bandwidth calling everyone who didn't bow to Clinton a sexist?

So serious question:  Does supporting Warren in the next primary when I didn't support Clinton in the last one only make me a part-time sexist? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Blah, blah, blah, Bernie's fault, blah, blah, blah.

Perhaps one day the more rabid Clinton supporters will realize that Clinton is to blame for her loss, not Bernie, or Sanders supporters, or anyone else.  She ran a horrible campaign, got caught lying and cheating to win a primary she was supposed to walk through, and allowed the worst possible human being to take over the presidency because of she put herself before the needs of the country.

That's not misogyny, that's fact.  It's also a fact that the dregs still crying "sexism" whenever anything negative is said about Clinton are making it far more difficult for female candidates like Warren to win in future.

But that's the Clinton way - Never take responsibility! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, they did.  Especially in frontier areas where banks weren't available.  A direct correlation could be made to impoverished areas in rural communities and areas of urban blight.  

There is no reason or excuse for legalized loan sharking that stands up to the briefest of logical thinking.  They are parasites that have rapidly grown up to take advantage of reduced governmental oversight and a lack interest by either major political party to work towards real solutions.

This is why we need to support real populism that addresses these extremely important issues, not the fake populism that plays to ignorance and racism.

	<TEXT> This article points out a valid problem - banks don't want to provide services in poverty stricken areas and can't provide checking for undocumented workers - then resolves this problem by arguing for a "solution" that steals vast sums from those who can least afford it.

What Reason doesn't want to acknowledge is that Bernie Sanders provided a real solution to this problem by proposing that Post Offices offer check cashing and basic checking services.  He also proposed expanding Medicare to everyone, which would eliminate nearly all the need to use these legalized loan sharks.

Nah!  Let's continue to bleed the poor of what little they have. /s

	<TEXT> I won't put the responsibility of this entirely on Trump's shoulders since the article stated that the plan to use this bomb had been planned for months, but I do have one question for those who made the call to drop it in Afghanistan.

Was there a specific military requirement for using such a large scale bomb in a country with a mostly scattered population and no large scale military installations?  It seems to me that using a bomb of this nature, in this particular theater, was likely a waste of money, materials, and innocent lives for no better purpose than to show off our military might.  I'd love to be proved wrong on that, but I can't see how a MOAB would be more efficient than smaller, more targeted explosives in this scenario.

If the US used this bomb for PR purposes, every single decision maker, including Trump and Obama if it went that far, should be tried for murder.

	<TEXT> You are again ignoring the very basic fact that you are advocating that the poor pay far more in taxes as a percentage of income than the wealthy, then calling that fair and equitable.  There is no measurement realistically possible in which a human being with an ounce of integrity and an elementary education could call it either.

I'm always amazed at how some people can take the ravings of a mentally deranged sociopath like Ayn Rand and actually support her delusions despite the fact that she ended up sucking off the teat of the "socialist" programs she denounced in her self-serving screeds.  Your mouth is now just shitting out the words you've been taught like that of some regressive parrot. 

I'm done here because your point of view isn't that of a mature adult.  It is the belief of a child who doesn't want to give up any of his candy after Hallowe'en, even though he could never eat it all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks like someone should have taught you the meaning of "irony" as well.

I agree that it is unfair to tax people at different rates based on the services they receive from the government.  However, you are arguing that the poor should pay a far greater percentage of their income on fewer services, essentially supporting the upper classes at a rate ever greater than they currently do.

Do you not see how insanely regressive and unfair that is?  No?  Really?

And you can stop with the bullshit "they don't pay federal income tax" trope as though that was the only tax that counts for some reason.  The poor already pay exorbitant taxes compared with the wealthy and get very few services for them.  You want to make it even worse, a position that is short-sighted, greedy, morally bankrupt, and ignorant.

If you were actually concerned with equality, which you're obviously not, you would support abolishing all taxes other than income tax or wealth tax, which could be applied to everyone at the same rate.  Instead you want a VAT that will disproportionately hit those least able to pay.  That's a rather disgusting position.

If you had been taught the basic facts of mathematics, you would know that it is not fair or equal to require the poor to pay a significantly higher percentage of their earnings than the wealthy. </TEXT>
