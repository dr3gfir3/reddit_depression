	<TITLE> A Course Called Ireland by Tom Coyne </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-04 04:05:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I didn't see any posts on here about Tom Coyne's book: A Course Called Ireland: A Long Walk in Search of a Country, a Pint, and the Next Tee.

Amazon link here: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001QREWNW

My wife bought the book for me as a Christmas present, and I've been unable to put it down. Tom walked the coast of Ireland, playing in loads of links courses all around the country.

I'm from Ireland myself so I was really interested in hearing his thoughts on the courses, and the craic he had along the way. 

It's a really easy read, and Tom captures the Irish spirit and mentality quite well. I would have loved to have played a round with him while he was traveling around.

Has anyone else read this? What did you think of it?

	<TEXT> Hitchens, in one of his debates, said that people in the area could not read/write at that time in Palestine. He used it as an argument against it ever happening - why didn't god send down his son to an area where they could read/write in China. Surely if he had have wanted to spread the message in the most effective way he would have sent his son (or is it himself, I can never work that out) there.  

In fact, given that we have the Internet today, it would be pretty damn effective to send his son down now wouldn't it? 

Now that I mention it, there are a lot of people in that area today who think they are Jesus. Could it be the whole thing was just mass hysteria, and that Abraham was really just a guy with epilepsy/schizophrenia? Bingo!   </TEXT>

It would be wonderful if some of the gods described in human mythology and theology existed. It would be appalling if some others existed (e.g. the Old Testament god, or the Muslim god).  

Now, I'm an atheist myself, but the Christian God and the Muslim god are the same fucking god. This lad is clearly a pseudointellectual that has watched too many Dawkins videos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I brought my wife to the ER at 8am on Christmas Eve. We didn't get home until 4am Christmas morning. Slept for 5 hours, went to the chemist to get her medication (they're open on Christmas Day which is awful but thank fuck they were). Got home and opened gifts with her in bed. 

She's confined to bed for the next few days so I brought up some Christmas lights and put them around the room to give it a bit of a Christmas vibe. Made the dinner and then had dinner in bed. I cleaned up down stairs and was coming up to watch a movie with her but she had passed out so I let her sleep for a few hours and I broke open a bottle of Midleton Dair Gaeltacht I had been saving.  

Watched the sun go down and just chilled for a while. I woke my wife up then to take the last of her medication and we watched a show in bed. 

It was very peaceful. No hangover today either which is magic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ten Men Dead is a fantastic read from "The Troubles" period.  

If you want to go back a bit further in time then have a read of Tom Barry's book Guerrilla Days in Ireland. It's spectacular.   
  
Ernie O'Malley wrote some fantastic books as well, the best being On Another Man's Wound. He wrote a few others so check them out as well (The Singing Flame, The Men Will Talk to Me, etc)  

Richard English wrote the definitive book called Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA. I believe it's the best unbiased book on the history of the conflict.  

He also wrote Ernie O'Malley: IRA Intellectual and that's worth checking out as well, but only after you've read Ernie's other books above.  

Don't forget Ruairi O' Bradaigh: The Life and Politics of an Irish Revolutionary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it wasn't just family, it was "friends". I remember removing someone I went to school with - and hadn't seen in person in over 15 years - because they just seemed to post game invites. Their account looked like a bloody spam account.  

I ran into them a couple of years later and I barely recognised them, but they stopped me in the street and were extremely upset that I deleted them from Facebook a few years prior.  

It was an odd experience because we never even talked on Facebook, not even once.  

I annoyed a lot of people on Facebook as well, because my sense of humour is different than some people I guess. I was joking about something and I can't even remember what it was now - and laughing with my wife about it - and they'd be messaging my wife wondering why I'm so upset over something... and there I was laughing about it with her clearly not upset at all. 

I also didn't like the culture behind it - only taking photos of things just so you can post them on your Facebook page is a definitive form of narcissism, and it's clearly driving behaviour changes as well. 

I deleted Facebook for around 14 or 16 months, but I created a new account to connect with my Uncle and I haven't removed it yet. I see the value of being able to see family photos at Christmas time, and stuff like that. I live on another continent than they do, and I try not to get involved in anything political on there anymore.  

In the year or so without Facebook, I learned to value friendships a lot more, and I would call people and actually talk to them over the phone instead of texting/chatting on social media. It was a lot more personal for me. I also wasn't wasting time scrolling through a mixture of adverts   posts from friends/family. The "news feed" is clearly advert driven these days, with lots of "Sponsored" items appearing.  </TEXT>

This is one of the most complex, nicest whiskies I've had. It's not as nice as the 50 year old from last year's advent calendar, but it's not far off. 

Given all the effort that went into making this - the story behind it - I'm in love. This should have been whiskey of the year. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Christopher Hitchens on the burka (x-post from /r/atheism) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-23 16:09:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted this on the atheism sub but I'll post it here as well:

During a Q A session from his Hitch-22 tour at The Free Library of Philadelphia, Hitchens had the following to say about the burka:

I dislike the way that the discussion around the Burka and other forms of veiling and enveloping of females is always referred to as a ban especially as its been applied or proposed in France. Its not a ban, its the lifting of a ban on the right of women to choose what they can wear. The existing state of affairs is a ban by the male members of a religious cult organisation known as Islam. They believe they have the right to dictate the atire of their women. I think that ban should be lifted. They cant do it in France. Thats just to say about the rights of the women concerned. If you counterpose to that  well why cant a woman wear anything she wants, youd have to give me some evidence that there was ever a woman that wanted to go out in the street only with her husbands permission and only wearing the curtains. Theres no evidence of that at all, theres a great deal of evidence the other way. 

Suppose she did make that choice however, lets allow it. She would come directly into conflict with my right to see her face. Im not going to allow people to wear masks in the street. Ill give you an example, The Klu Klux Klan is a Christian identity organisation. Its better known as a racist one. Theres not much of a difference between racism and Christian identity in this case, but thats what it always is and has been. It has in my opinion the perfect right to wear the hood at a rally under the first ammendment that is protected by the police and with various regulations. But no Klan members are to be allowed to wear that to work. If a Klan member is a nurse or a teacher or a bus driver well Im sorry  no. Why cant you go to the bank with that, either? What could be plainer than this? 

We have excellent cultural reasons for expression such as what have you got to hide? He doesnt dare show his face. These are things that have evolved over a long long time and now these people want to shut down the public square and imprison women into the bargain, and empower a group that has much bigger ambitions than this for changing our identiy and modifying our society and it would as well to stop it now while we can.  

I've seen plenty of regressive leftists say that the "ban on the burka" is a way of dictating that women can and cannot wear, and I think this is an excellent counter point to that. 

Any thoughts on this?

	<TITLE> Christmas saved by the Irish lads that own my local in North Carolina </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I moved from Ireland to the states in 2011, and I haven't been back home in 4 years or so. Since I moved here, every Christmas has been.... different. The meals just aren't the same. Don't get me wrong, they are still lovely but they're just different. The meat here isn't as good as back home, not by a long shot.  

Anyway, I was talking about this in my local last night - owned by two lads from back in Ireland. One is from Roscommon and I think the other lad is from Offaly. One of the owners walks out with a head of cabbage for me and says he'll have an 8 pound Irish ham for me on Wednesday as well. He could get me a 16 pound one if I wanted but that's a bit much haha.  

What an absolute legend. It might not seem like a lot if you're used to having it every year, but try going without it for a few years and it'll one of the things you'll pine for around this time of year. 

I'm fucking delighted. Merry Everyone!

	<TEXT> Have you read Lethal Allies: British Collusion in Ireland by Anne Cadwallader? It's a very tough read because of how upsetting it is. It documents the case of a young boy of 10 years of age or so, that was shot by the Paras, and they dragged him into a van and stuck the tips of their guns into his wounds and pissed on him, then dumped him out of the van. Some seriously sick and fucked up shit went on in an attempt to drag the IRA into a sectarian conflict.  

I might give this a read, cheers.

	<TEXT> I have chronic arthritis in my back. It got so bad I couldn't get out of bed anymore. I was in a very bad car crash in 2003 and I was the sole survivor. It stems from that. I was an idiot at the time and never put a claim in, but I don't give a fuck about that. A few grand isn't going to make me feel better, but it might have helped me get better treatment.

Anyway, I was put on Tramadol in 2014. It has changed my life. I can function as a person again. If I have a couple of pints I feel sleepy, so I don't drink that much. I haven't been properly drunk in a long long time actually. So I knew there was a bit of a session going to be happening one weekend so I decided to cut back on Tramadol so I could drink a bit. I didn't want to be dumb and try to drink loads while taking the drug. I ended up in the A E not because of drinking, but because of withdrawal from tramadol. I was dizzy, kept falling over, it was like vertigo. I'd move my eyes and my ears pulsed like crazy. They pumped me full of every drug they had in the hospital and nothing worked. I told them I had stopped taking tramadol a couple of days ago and they were convinced it's not addictive and that's not the problem. I was discharged, and within 30 minutes of taking tramadol at home all of my symptoms disappeared.  

The fucked up thing is that I was never told this would happen to me when being prescribed the drug. I asked if it was addictive and I was told no. Addiction isn't some mental weakness as it is sometimes portrayed, my doctors pumped me full of this shit and now my body needs it to function. I've asked to be put on something else but I've been told every drug they give me will have similar results. 

I need to function as a person, to be able to get out of bed and work, but for all I know I could drop dead in 10 or 20 years from using pain killers on a daily basis. My heart could easily give in.

	<TEXT> I have that post Lost depression. It's also Sunday night and the thoughts of going back to work tomorrow... ugh. 

What a show, what a journey. I still love every bit of it. I just creeped on Jin   Sawyer's Instagram accounts and it seems like they're doing pretty good with their post Lost lives. Josh Holloway is in a new show called Colony that I guess I should check out. Looks like Daniel Dae Kim is still in Hawaii Five-0 so he gets to live on the island for quite a while - lucky him! 

Lost had it all - pure escapism at its finest. The chance of just dropping it all and changing you are and living on a gorgeous island, but they could never sit still and were always on the go and never really got to enjoy it. I tried to take it all in this time I watched it but before I knew it the show was over again. The music is outstanding too. I'll be listening to the soundtrack in work tomorrow for sure. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Planning a trip home with a few lads. Quick Question about The Blasket Islands. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-07 17:24:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> How's the form lads/ladies.

I haven't been home in over three years and I'm planning a month in Ireland next summer. I'm bringing a group of friends with me as they've never been to Ireland so we're going on the lash for a few days. They'll be with me for 10 days or so. 

I have most of the trip planned - but had one question about The Blasket Islands. I know the boats only run when the weather permits, and the sea is often too rough for it. Do any of you know if you're allowed to camp on the islands over night? I was hoping to stay there over night if possible, but I wasn't sure if it's considered protected land now or not.  

According to the following it looks [possible](https://www.tripadvisor.com/ShowUserReviews-g211861-d216389-r218040667-Great_Blasket_Island-Dingle_Dingle_Peninsula_County_Kerry.html) , but just wondering if any of you lads have done it, and if so is there any advice you can give? Cheers!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure why you were down voted - probably because you like expensive whiskey.  

I'm from Ireland, moved to the states in 2011. I have a huge Irish selection at home - stocked up last year. Writers Tears is very good, probably one of my favourite Irish whiskies at this point. It's hard to have a favourite though, some days I love Green Spot, some days I'll go for Barry Crockett, some days I'll go for Powers John Lane, some days I'll go for Redbreast 21 year old....but one I keep coming back to is Writers Tears. I have 3 bottles of it - all purchased last year. I started drinking whiskey again recently as the cold weather is back now, and it's just so fucking nice. My god.

Sorry for the rant.  </TEXT>

**EDIT** they are seeing if they can give me a refund/credit. The girl that handled the call said it looks like it is their fault. I went through a toll after I had ordered my transponder but it wasn't delivered yet -- but I had asked them if I could do that before doing it and they said yes -- but they created a separate account when I did it and I didn't know about it.

It was closer to 6 bucks too, not the $1.97 I was initially told about. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> NC QuickPass Shenanigans. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-29 19:01:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I went to pay my tax   registration today but was told I had to pay my tolls first, with NC quick pass.  

My account balance appeared to be 104 bucks, so I paid that. I noticed I also paid 100 bucks on the 16th. After paying 104 bucks my account was actually in credit for 205 dollars. I didn't owe anything. 

But I still couldn't pay because of tolls. I called NC QuickPass, and apparently my responder didn't work for one toll back in September 2015. The toll was for $1.97. Instead of adding this to the account I have with NC QuickPass, they opened another account for me and put the charge there. I had no idea about this, and as a result I owed $200 on this account because it wasn't paid.

I got a letter or two from NC QuickPass but I thought the charges were just from my responder account and thought nothing of it - they would be paid on auto pay.

Well yeah, that didn't work out well. This seems like it's designed to make people not realise a new account has been opened (without their permission), and that it will incur charges.

I ended up paying it, but I'm extremely fucking annoyed at this bullshit. Has this happened to anyone else? </TEXT>
