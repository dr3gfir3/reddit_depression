	<TITLE> [Misc] Book Insights from "High Output Management" by Andrew S. Grove </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-10 07:00:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Master the Basics of Production**

In order to have an effective production system, Grove says that all execs and managers must consider the following three components:

* Time
* Quality
* Cost

The way in which you handle these components will determine how effective your production processes are. Production takes place in three stages:

* Process
* Assembly
* Test

You may also have whats known as a limiting step; or, the process that requires the most amount of time to complete, and therefore deserves the most attention.

While these are basics with which many managers and execs are already very familiar, Groves crash-course on production is especially beneficial for new entrepreneurs.

**Identify Your Indicators**

Grove says that in order to achieve sustainable scalability, youll need to establish some indicators. The best types of indicators measure the actual output  not just the activity itself. They should be measurable, and ideally, they should be accompanied by a metric indicating a timeframe and a quantity. These concepts go hand-in-hand with OKRs, which is the most effective way to integrate indicators in your company.

Grove identifies two main types of indicators:

* Leading Indicators: These should measure and/or evaluate input and predict output
* Trend Indicators: These should measure output within a given period of time, such as a quarter or month

**Implement Managerial Leverage**

Grove defines a managers output as the output of his or her organization combined with the output of neighboring organizations, or other organizations under his or her influence. The managerial leverage, then, is defined as the measure of output created by any of the managers activity. Effective managers have a greater influence on neighboring organizations.

According to Grove, these are the primary responsibilities of a manager:

* Information Gathering
* Information Giving
* Decision Making
* Nudging

Managers can also delegate, but that requires both managers and their direct reports to have access to the same information.

Grove recommends that supervisory managers have 6-8 subordinates. Having fewer subordinates could lead to meddling, while having more creates chaos and confusion.

In addition to the points listed above, Grove believes that managers should do their best to achieve regularity, and avoid interruptions whenever possible. Batch processing is an effective way to complete tasks, and managers must also designate specific me time to complete their duties.

**Get the Most out of your Meetings**

Grove considers meetings to be a high-leverage medium, but only when they are used effectively. He identifies two main types of meetings:

* Process-Oriented Meetings These meetings should consist of an exchange of information, and they should always be scheduled. Grove advocates holding weekly one-on-one meetings between managers and direct reports. Staff meetings should only be held to discuss any matters involving more than two people, all of whom should be present. Operational meetings should open with presentations, and they should be used to review achievements and ongoing processes.
* Mission-Oriented Meetings These meetings can be ad-hoc, but they must be driven by an output, and they require a chairman.

**Become a Strategic Decision-Maker**

When managers and execs make decisions, they typically happen in three stages:

* Free Discussion All parties involved in the decision making process should be able to partake in the discussion as equals. Grove says that one of the greatest challenges that prevents good decision making is the fact that many people are hesitant to speak freely, thereby shielding some of the critical information that could be used to inform important decisions.
* Clear Decision A decision is made based on the free discussion.
* Full Support

While support wont always entail complete agreement by all parties, it should always involve commitment by everyone involved. Grove believes that when making decisions, you should always consult others first.

**Plan Wisely**

In High Output Management, planning is considered to be a three-step process that involves:

* Studying Your Environment
* Predicting the Future
* Reconciling

Grove recommends using MBO to assess your performance, but to take it a step further and optimize efficiency, his OKRs are a suitable practice to aid in planning.

Effective planning is critical to performance. Grove believes that failure to execute is a result of failed planning of the past. Also, he advises that managers and execs bear in mind that their resources are finite. When you approve one project, you are ultimately saying no to something else.

**Determine Your Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM)**

Grove believes that there is no single, optimal style of management. Instead, he argues that your output is a result of a few different variables. These variables make up your Task-Relevant Maturity. It incorporates the following:

* Your Degree of Achievement-Orientation
* Your Readiness to Responsibility
* Training
* Experience

When managers have a high TRM, they are more likely to delegate. As a result, this increases their managerial leverage. They generally have minimal involvement in their direct reports operations, but they establish regular monitoring practices. Individuals with medium TRM tend to have individual-oriented session, and establish consistent, closed-loop communication. Low TRM managers usually rely on task-specific session, and are very specific in their expectations of what, when, and how.

**Tackle Performance Management with this Two-Pronged Approach**

Reviewing performance is the single most important form of task-relevant feedback, according to Grove. Your objective in assessing an employees performance should be to improve his or performance by advancing skills and boosting motivation. This can be achieved in two ways: assessment and delivery.

* Assessment: You can only assess an individuals performance if you provide clarity in your expectations ahead of time. You must specifically define output measures, including productions, reports, designs, and so forth; and you must also establish internal measures, such as hiring, planning, etc. Bear in mind that you must never evaluate people against what you perceive as their potential; rather, you must evaluate them based on their output. Again, Groves OKRs are advantageous in achieving clarity and defining expectations in advance.
* Delivery: When it comes to ensuring delivery, you should aim to achieve commitment from your people. Level with them by focusing on the individual  always listen first, and then try to establish a solution.

**Train Effectively and Compensate Fairly**

Grove believes that motivating and training employees should be the sole responsibility of the boss. Training should always fit with your company culture and processes, and more importantly, training should be approached as an ongoing, evolving process  not simply a one-time event.

Employee compensation can be based on two factors: merit and experience. Many organizations use a blend of the two to determine salary. When an employee receives a promotion, it should always be tied to his or her performance.

	<TEXT> **The Past Doesnt Equal the Future**

Thiel believes that the future will be shaped by individuals who take a different stance on things  they possess self-created knowledge that isnt taught in universities, but is commonly held by a few individuals. He asks: **What important truth do very few people agree with you on?**

Moreover, Thiel explores the concept of innovation. Most people believe that it entails globalization, or horizontal extensive progress, he says. Thiel illustrates this concept with a horizontal line graph and the equation 1 to n. He argues that true innovation actually lies in vertical intensive progress, represented by 0 to 1. Startups, he says, are the key to unlocking vertical intensive progress, because **a startup is the largest group of people you can convince of a plan to build a different future.**

In other words, and most importantly, Thiel strongly believes that the past doesnt equal the future.

**Learn the NEW Startup Dogmas**

In the 1990s, tech startups lived by the following four principles:

* Advance in increments
* Dont have a precise plan; be flexible and lean instead
* Improve on the competition
* Focus on your product, not your sales

Following the dotcom crash, however, entrepreneurs applied a new set of doctrines, which were entire opposites of the former ones:

* It is better to be bold and risky than to choose triviality
* Any plan  even a bad one  is better than none at all
* Competitive markets hinder profits
* Sales are every bit as important as products

**Be Creative, not Competitive**

Thiel believes competition should not be your focal point. In fact, he advocates avoiding competition, saying, **If you want to create and capture lasting value, dont build an undifferentiated business.** Instead of overcoming your competition, youre better off focusing your efforts on leading in a smaller market.

**Construct a Monopoly**

Building on the concept of dominating a niche market, Thiel suggests starting small, and then scaling accordingly. To become a monopoly, companies must have the following characteristics:

* Proprietary Technology
* Network Effects
* Scalability
* Branding

Beyond these four main characteristics, Thiel recommends two approaches for building a monopoly:
* Lead in a Specific Niche, then Expand (Amazon)
* Avoid Disruption (Napster)

Forget Luck; Make Success Your Intention

Most CEOs and entrepreneurs already know that success requires hard work and is rarely, if ever, accredited to luck. Thiel backs this claim. To make success your intention, Thiel says you must:

* Determine what you want AND why you want it.
* Come up with a long-term, actionable plan.
* Take strategic action using that plan.

**Build Your Startup using these Fundamentals**

* Drive Focus on One Big Thing
* Define Ownership, Possession, and Control
* Learn How to Sell It

**Ask Yourself these 7 Questions**

* Can you create breakthrough technology instead of incremental improvements?
* Is now the right time to start your particular business?
* Are you starting with a big share of a small market?
* Do you have the right team?
* Do you have a way to not just create, but deliver, your product?
* Will your market position be defensible 10 and 20 years into the future?
* Have you identified a unique opportunity that others dont see?

	<TITLE> Book Insights from "Built to Last - Successful Habits of Visionary Companies" by James Collins and Jerry Porras </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-09 09:26:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What are the behaviors that make companies last decades  even past the century mark  and achieve continued success? James Collins and Jerry Porras peer behind the scenes of such organizations, which theyve dubbed visionary companies, in their compilation Built to Last. These companies are visionary, indeed: they have an average founding date of 1897 and experienced stock-return performance 15 times greater than the general market since 1926. Here are the things that have made them so successful, and what you can do to build your organization to last:

**Take an Architectural Approach**

Developing an organization built upon strong systems and values is the first step of building a company made to last. Identify your values and the systems youll use to reflect them, prior to even developing your product.

*Hewlett-Packard and Sony: Great Companies First, Innovative Products Later*

HP and Sony developed some products that, by todays standards, seem lackluster: urinal flushers and heating pads, respectively, were among the companies earliest products. Yet, these companies continue to thrive today not because of their earliest products, but because they took an architectural approach, focusing on values and systems first.

*The Myth of Charismatic Leaders*

Some built-to-last companies had visionary leaders, but not all. What is crucial, however, is having leaders that facilitate the development of their people and processes. Some of the most successful leaders, such Motorola founder Paul Galvin, encourage dissent, discussion, and disagreement to prompt their people to make meaningful contributions. This allowed Motorola to outperform Zenith, a company that had a visionary leader but lost a great deal of its success after he passed.

**Ideals Drive Visionary Organizations**

*Mercks Giveaway*

At its core, your organization must have ideologies in place that go beyond the purpose of being lucrative. Merck, for one, embodied their core ideology of being genuinely inspired by the ideals of advancement of medical science, and of service to humanity when they gave a drug, Mectizan, away for free to millions of people who needed it after no one bought it. Pfizer leaders, on the other hand, have explicitly stated that the companys goal is to get profit out of everything they do.

*Core Ideologies*

To establish your own core ideology, ask yourself this: who are we, what do we stand for, and what are we all about? These are your shaping forces upon which your company can be built. Even when your organization is more ideologically-driven than profit-driven, it actually pays off more in terms of profitability. J. Willard Marriott, Sr., for example, said that he didnt set out to build an empire; rather, his goal was to provide friendly service and good food at a fair price, and work hard to make a profit  in that very order.

*Values vs. Purposes*

Your organizations core values are its guiding principles; they cannot be compromised for financial gains. Usually, they can be summed up in a simple statement. Purposes, on the other hand, identify your reason for existing. They should be broad and enduring, such as Johnson   Johnsons purpose to alleviate pain and suffering, or Disneys: to use our imaginations to bring happiness to millions. To identify your purpose, simply ask of your organization: what is our reason for being?

*Preserve the Core; Stimulate Progress*

You can change your strategy, tactics, operations, products, and culture over time, but core ideology should never waver. Do not wait for a sign that its time to change; instead, practice self-criticism regularly. Wal-Mart, for example, continually seeks to exceed customer expectations.

**Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals**

*Boeings Challenge*

To outlast your competitors, your organization must pursue big, hairy, audacious goals (BHAGs), such as Boeings commitment to build a jet for commercial use, which resulted in the 707. It met a similar challenge in developing the 727 by meeting stringent specifications outlined by Eastern Airlines. Through each feat, Boeing managed to conquer the BHAGs while maintaining their core values: to be on the leading edge of aviation.

*Set BHAGs that are Clear   Compelling*

BHAGS should require little or no explanation, should go beyond an organizations comfort zone, should provoke excitement, and align with core ideology. They can even be somewhat risky, and go beyond the life of the current leader.

**Great Places to Work  For Some**

If your organization is built to last using a very specific architectural approach, then its impossible that not every potential hire will fit in there  and thats okay.

*Cult-like Cultures*

Having a culture thats almost cult-like allows a company to promote values while still letting employees feel a sense of belonging. Nordsrom, for example, has a longstanding history of Nordies who deliver superb service and belong to the company, which even has chants of affirmation. To build a balanced and healthy culture of cultism, you should promote from within, offer workplace socializing opportunities, have training programs geared towards your ideologies, and continue to emphasize heritage and organizational values.

*Home-Grown Management*

Of all the 18 visionary companies, there are only four instances in which they went outside the organization for a CEO. By planning for succession, you can promote from within and still stimulate growth and change. GE, for example, makes a habit of promoting and developing carefully selected talent from within.

**Pounce on Opportunities**

*Lucrative Accidents*

Visionary companies dont just learn from their mistakes  they can actually capitalize on them. Johnson   Johnson developed antiseptic gauze that caused irritation. In response, they developed a can of talc to soothe skin, which eventually became one of its best-selling products: baby powder.

*Evolution*

Accidental progress leads to evolution. Innovative steps taken  no matter how small  can turn into lucrative opportunities. Be sure to experiment and allow room for the strongest results to thrive.

*Variation*

Most visionary companies practice some form of this motto: try something, and if it works, keep it. If it doesnt, change something. Wal-Mart greeters, for example, were actually designed to prevent shoplifting. The experiment worked successfully, which is why youll find greeters in locations nationwide.

*Success of 3M*

Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing (3M) originally set out to be a mining company. It soon failed, but eventually wound up developing Scotch tape, thanks, in part, to the fact that each day they use 15% and 30% rules: 15% of the time, technical people can spend time on their own projects, and 30% of each divisions revenue is expected to come from products and services introduced within the past four years.

**Never Rest**

Visionary organizations dont simply assess how theyre doing now; they plan to do better for the future.

*Continuous Improvement*

To stay ahead of the game, companies such as Merck, HP, and Motorola simulate discontent. For example, Boeing uses an eyes of the enemy approach to prompt managers to develop strategies as if they were competitors. Both Nordstrom and HP rank sellers performances based on peers sales.

**Beyond Vision Statements: Ford**

The essence of an organization is the translation of ideology and drive for progress into its fabric. This essence can come to life through goals, pay systems, and cultural practices.

*Alignment*

Ford needed to revamp itself in the 1980s, so it came out with its Mission, Values, and Guiding Principles (MVGP), which emphasized people before products and profits. This aligned the organization to emphasize the fact that people are a companys best asset by developing employee involvement and customer satisfaction.

*Ideology and Aims into Reality*

Dont just create a document such as Fords MVGP  you must also act upon these findings. Ford created employee-involvement programs and participative-management programs to embody their MVGP.

*World-Class BHAGs*

Ford used Big, Hairy, Audacious Goals to develop an entirely new, world-class car. It resulted in the top-selling car in the nation, the Taurus. To follow through with your own BHAGs, make sure that all company practices, programs, communications can be harmonized and mesh with your core ideologies and goals.

**Six Steps to Visionary Alignment**

To achieve alignment on a visionary level, you must:

1. Outline the whole picture by making sure that all of your elements work together.

2. Sweat the small stuff  worry about little details if you consider them important and they make a lasting impression.

3. Cluster, dont shotgun by using processes that reinforce one another.

4. Swim in your own current by asking whether your processes and practices work for your organization  dont concern yourself with what others are doing.

5. Obliterate misalignment. If something is out of synch with your core ideology, then change it.

6. Abide by the universal requirements  your core ideology and drive for progress are fundamental, and as long as you have an organization that preserves your core and stimulates progress, then its built to last.
