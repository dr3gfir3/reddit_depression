	<TEXT> I e-mailed the authors of the paper and simply asked them to clear it up. They also sent me a copy of their paper - PM me if you would like me to pass it along. Here is their reply:

Hello, I came across your abstract but am unable to access the full text of your paper so I was hoping that you could answer a quick question for me. In your abstract (http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/12/23/1512120113.short?rss=1), you mention 'nonbelievers' - I am just wondering who 'nonbelievers' refer to in this context. I am interpreting it as: To Muslim Palestinians, Jewish Israelis are 'nonbelievers' (as they do not believe in Allah). 

Thanks in advance, very interesting work.

Hello,

Please find attached our paper. You are interpreting the results correctly: Palestinians showed less bias against Israelis when asked to ponder moral dilemmas from Allah's perspective.

Thank you for your interest.

A happy new year to you.

	<TEXT> That is a quote from the Significance section - not the Abstract. Note the language that the authors used:

 "Beliefs about God **may** promote more equal valuation of human life regardless of religious identity, encouraging application of universal moral rules to believers and nonbelievers alike. "

This is a point that the authors likely brought up in the Discussion/Future Directions section(s) of the paper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How can you say that it assumes anything if you have not actually read the paper? You brought up an interesting point, but based on the sample, I would wager that nonbelievers refer to outgroups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it is unique to [Internet gaming](http://www.psychiatry.org/File%20Library/Psychiatrists/Practice/DSM/APA_DSM-5-Internet-Gaming-Disorder.pdf):

 The Internet is now an integral, even inescapable part of many peoples daily lives; they turn to it to send messages, read news, conduct business and much more. But recent scientific reports have begun to focus on the preoccupation some people develop with certain aspects of the Internet, particularly online games. The gamers play compulsively, to the exclusion of other interests, and their persistent and recurrent online activity results in clinically significant impairment or distress. People with this condition endanger their academic or job functioning because of the amount of time they spend playing. They experience symptoms of withdrawal when kept from gaming. ... At this time, the criteria for this condition are limited to Internet gaming and do not include general use of the Internet, online gambling or social media. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A very fair point, however in this case, the inclusion of only males in an initial study is justified by the prevalence of IGD:

 The [DSM-5](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201407/internet-gaming-disorder-in-dsm-5) states that Internet Gaming Disorder is most common in male adolescents 12 to 20 years of age.

Future research will likely examine both genders.

	<TEXT> Interesting question. Right now, gambling is the only behavioural (i.e., non-substance) addiction in the DSM-5, and is [excluded](http://dlj.law.duke.edu/article/challenging-the-exclusion-of-gambling-disorder-as-a-disability-under-the-americans-with-disabilities-act-wade-vol64-iss5/) from the Americans with Disabilities Act. 

Another important thing to note is that with any behavioural addiction, there is often a significant degree of [comorbidity](http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.ajp.2007.07101556) with other diagnosable mental health disorders, which may themselves be covered in various Acts.
