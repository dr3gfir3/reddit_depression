	<TEXT> I think it's purely a money raising scheme. The price is already sky high, if you're not deterred by paying 10 euros for a pack, you won't be by paying 10.50. It's easy money for the government, without the backlash that would come from raising a different tax.  Essentially it's preying on addicts because it's easy, which is a pretty unpleasant thing for anyone to do. </TEXT>

That means the vulture funds buying property for nothing a couple of years ago and flipping it back to Irish people in a few years time will pay no tax on the massive profits they make for doing virtually nothing.  Income tax is only a small area of tax revenue, the really rich make money on assets, that was part of his thesis, I believe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After yesterday, I have a horrible anxiety that Harry Redknapp may have been right in calling us 'bang average.'  I think Benteke did get some service but no support.  There's no point knocking the ball up to him if there's no-one around for him to lay it off to. Very disappointed with Robert Firmino's contribution so far, he's made no impression whatsoever. Without Coutinho and, I hate to say it, Sterling to provide a bit of creative magic we were toothless. Also Milner and Can made little impression in attempting to control midfield while Lucas just fouled a few people, which was better than nothing, I suppose. Add to that a defence that seemed to have a collective anxiety when in possession of the ball and you've a pretty wretched performance.  Good is news Norwich is next and Coutinho will be back.  Firmino may in time adapt to the league and prove his worth and Benteke looks good, plus Sturridge is fit again, they could make a fearsome partnership. I know everyone is saying off with his head, but I'd argue to give Rodgers a little more time to get things right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, you're not going to become what you fear, let me assure you of that.  OCD is taking the worst possible case scenario and trying to convince you it's real, it's not. I've been through years of this stuff and I can honestly say I'm a better human being now than when I began.  Personally, I have found meditation the best antidote to the illness, I recommend you look into it. No-one here can tell you you what to do with your medication, we are not doctors, I just recommend you tell your doctor everything.  He may decide to change it based on what you tell or not, I don't know, he's the one that qualified to decide.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I have ocd. I saw a ted talk or something that advised using loving/kindness meditation towards unwanted thoughts.  I've tried it out and it's helped a lot.  Basically, every time you hear a voice, say the mantra 'may you be happy, may you be well' to it. The more loving you are towards these fragmented parts of yourself, the less hostile they become towards you.  I've gotten deep into meditation and eastern philosophy since then and it's helped me a lot (I know we have very different illnesses, but I thought that tip may help you).

edit: spelling and shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know we all hate Merkel, but she's not the issue here. Ireland has agreed to take 600 of these refugees this year. 600. It's a pathetic amount.  We could easily take in 10,000, when you consider the hundreds of thousands of people who have immigrated in the last few years.  In WW2 we wouldn't take in Jews, this is a similar situation. All of Europe needs to get on board and take in migrants, Ireland shouldn't be paddy last. </TEXT>

I can assure you there are a lot of people alive today who once felt the way you do now. It's never too late to turn back. It's never too late to start again.  Life won't give up on you, all your wounds can heal.  You can resurrect your relationships, you just need to tell people what's going on with you.  It's amazing, but you'll find when you reach out, there's always someone there.  Don't give up, my friend, your life is precious and valuable in ways you can't see now, but will someday.  I suggest you could make a post in /r/SuicideWatch, there's good experienced people there you can talk to who understand what you're going through. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd be amazed at how many people feel like you, I often have.  Maybe it's not just you that's at fault but the world?  Nobody should be bullied and terrorized at school, it has obviously left lasting scars that you still have to deal with.

Also, I don't think anyone would feel fulfilled doing the shitty jobs you, me and millions of others have to do sometimes to make money.  That's not a reflection of your inadequacy but the crap capitalism throws at us.

This life has a lot more to offer than you have yet experienced. I believe you have talents and abilities you have not discovered yet.  One day they will come out.  But right now, I think you should concentrate on healing your depression and anxiety.  Whether that means counselling, medication, meditation, exercise or whatever else you can find that helps is up to you.  Don't give up on life, believe that a better day will come and keep putting one foot in front of the other.

Much love! </TEXT>

Strangely, total non resistance made it disappear rather than get worse. Also, I try to let go of the idea of the future. Like I want to control to future to be sure everything going to be okay, but I can't control it so I say something like 'the future will be whatever it will be.' And it helps me let go of trying to control something that only exists as a fantasy in my mind at the moment.  Hope that helps a little. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is real life and it's difficult. I don't know if you have ocd or not, you need a medical professional to diagnose you.  One thing I've found to help break obsessional thinking is conscious breathing. When you have a obsession sparking thoughts, you acknowledge it as a triggering thought, you decide to give that thought no attention and you put your awareness on your breath.  I've found personally counting my breaths for 30 or so seconds helps me from getting distracted by thoughts again. Hope this helps some. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean people earning over 100,000 a year.  We have politicians on pensions higher than that.  I can't see how anyone really *needs* any more money over that point, the people who have more than enough can pay higher rate of tax to support the people who don't have enough.  Isn't that the Nordic model?  Part of what I like about UBI is it ensures everyone should have enough to meet their basic needs.  In my view nobody has enough unless everybody has enough.  Willie O'Dea of Fianna Fail, of all people, gave a [speech](http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/ireland/News/article1577140.ece) recently saying UBI would be part of their manifesto.  If it any other party it would be enough to make me vote for them.  But if they can propose, then surely the Social Democrats can too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to see a universal basic income to reduce poverty, provide a safety blanket for all and reduce the tyranny money has over everybody's lives.  

I would like to see drug policy reform along the lines of Portugal with safer drugs like marijuana and perhaps ecstasy legalized and taxed but advertising for them banned.

I would like to see public banks launch along the lines the Greens have proposed.  Banking needs to be reformed, we seem to have learned nothing from the crash.

Repeal the 8th (I see you already propose that).

Have a compassionate social policy i.e. the needs of those suffering most are prioritized.

I would like to see the richest pay a higher rate of tax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I have this whole madness about whatever I imagine is going to happen will not happen, because (I rationalize) it's always something you don't expect.  So if I'm anticipating something nice and I imagine and believe it will happen, I suddenly catch myself and think 'now it's not going to happen, you've killed it.'  Also, I have a related terrible fear of tempting fate. Once when I was in a brief period of wellness, I was desperate for certainty so I thought 'nothing can go wrong with this.' That night I allowed myself think an ocd spike and it came back worse than ever.  Since then I have a fear of believing anything definite about the future, but of course my mind craves reassurance and certainty about it.  It's the rock and the hard place. </TEXT>

It was only the third time she went in they recheck the scan and 'found' she had pneumonia. She could have died. This was a few months ago when they was all this negative publicity about waiting lists and patients on trollies.

	<TEXT> I agree with you. I have ocd for the last 16 years and it's not as easy as 'observe and accept' as some people say, when disturbing thoughts are firing at you 24/7.  I use tonglen meditation to help ease the fear I feel and conscious breathing to try and starve the disturbing thoughts of attention.  Managing an anxiety disorder is a difficult business and not as simple as some well intentioned people here are making out.

Edit: spelling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have pure-O ocd, which is a type without the cleaning, check rituals familiar to most people when they think of ocd.  Those are symptoms, the illness is repetitive, obsessive fearful thoughts that you know are irrational but you can't switch off. I have a mixture of harm ocd and religious ocd, which means I obsess over violent and blasphemous thoughts.  I don't desire these thoughts, they repulse me, but the more you fight the more persistent they become.  I've learned a lot of techniques for managing the anxiety from Buddhism and have been on some meditation retreats which were very healing.  I have an addictive personality, driven by a desire to escape the suffering in my mind, so have had problems with drugs and alcohol in the past. I'm now very clean living, eat right, exercise, pray, meditate, write, take meds all to try and get better.  And I have gotten a lot better, thank God, but it's still hard sometimes.  I've just got to keep doing the right things and have faith it's all going to work out for the best.  Keep on keeping on, man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Klopp is taking six months out, so if it's still shit by December we can make the switch (assuming he doesn't take another job).  One terrible result doesn't mean Rodger's a bad manager. We basically had no strike force this season, any manager would have struggled under such circumstances. People seem to have forgotten we almost (should have) won the title last year. I say give him one more year, let him fix the gaps in the squad in the summer and judge then. Next year is make or break. </TEXT>
