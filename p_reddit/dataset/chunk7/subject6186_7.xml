	<TEXT> I feel like this might be a bit too much...  Too on the nose.  The great Black Mirror episodes are the ones that deal with either realistic scenarios, like the pig episode, or stuff so existentially horrific, that there would be no way it could possibly happen (Yet it's still very compelling), like White Christmas.

When I see this I go, "Ok, you have the technology to stream netflix through your eyes...  Why not just make Netflix contacts then?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually very apprehensive about this trailer.

I'm sick of reapers and big bads.  If I want another super human villain looking to destroy all life in the galaxy, I'll watch a Marvel movie or play the original Mass Effect Trilogy.  I've seen this before!  This is just a new Saren.  Is it going to be another retread of the old games?

The themes of this game should be more frontiersy, more about exploration, politics, interacting with races above or below your comprehension.  I think a little bit of existentialism is good, but not for the main quest...  The quest should be more personal.  About finding a home.  

Granted, this is just another vague trailer that the team has been releasing over and over, but I am kind of tuning out if this is what tone they want to go for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like right on the edge of where nice Buckhead becomes strip club Buckhead, and I keep seeing these apartment homes pop up around my place.  I really love my spot because it is 15 minutes from my job, and there's plenty to do around...  There's also a Kroger being built a block from my apartments.  But I can see my place becoming prime real estate for people willing to pay for it.

I am worried that my rent will eventually go up next lease, or the one after that...   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in Japan last month, and while I didn't run into Yakuza, I got to see how they affected a city like Osaka.

The most memorable experience was my friend driving through a district called Tobita Shinchi.  The area is a legal grey area where prostitution is practiced out in the open.  Prostitution is illegal in Japan, but here it was very in your face.  The way it was presented was disturbingly surreal.  We drove slowly through the small, sidewalk-street the Japanese have that work as alleys.  Every building had an open garage type door, with a girl sitting on a pillow and blasted with strong lights.  They had really strong makeup on, and were dressed from everything to a Cowgirl to a School Girl.  The moment you see them, they see you...  And their eyes are locked on yours as they smile and try to urge you to pay for their services.  Each girl is also flanked by an old woman, called a Mama-San who acts as the pimp.  I also noticed young guys posted up on each corner leading out of the area...  It was a weird and unsettling experience.

I also saw a large number of police suiting up for a raid.  Dozens upon Dozens of unarmed men were lining up on a crosswalk to start moving out to some unknown area.  My friend said that two organizations in Osaka were currently at war, but who knows how true that is.  It seems like in Osaka, the Yakuza influence is a lot more prevalent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I very much disagree.  Good writing isn't lambasting the audience with your 'satire' (Which honestly hasn't been that funny since GTA 3) and then having your protagonist tell the audience what's wrong with what's going on in a matter reminiscent of a Shakespearean soliloquy.  

For example...  The torture scene in GTA V was really well done.  The brutality of Trevor's sadism contrasted with the sort of guess work the FIB use to spot the terrorist was fantastic commentary on the war on terror.  That is until Trevor decides to drive the victim to the airport, and spout off Houser's- I mean Trevor's rhetoric about how torture doesn't gain any real information.  I put my face in my hands during that...  They ruined a perfectly good scene that had a lot to say by continuing to beat the audience's head with the 'message'.  I'm not saying that what they're writing and setting up is bad...  It's just that they write to much, and it ruins what they have.  They turn good work into shit work.  The story between Michael, Trevor and Franklin was very compelling, emotional and believable, but there ALWAYS has to be Houser commentary in the background, and they sully any impact the original scribe has.

It's as if during a Godzilla movie, every character was going, "Hm, this whole situation with this monster is bad.  It reminds me of a sort of analogy for the dangers of Nuclear weapons."

As all writers will say...  SHOW DON'T TELL.  Dan Houser doesn't get that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying they have to force progressiveness into a time where progressiveness wasn't a priority, but to say 'There were no female outlaws/gunslingers' is just naive.  Plus, the majority of men were at home raising cattle.  Outlaws are the fringes of society, which means that all groups of people who feel like outsiders can flock to that group...  There are plenty of stories of female outlaws, black gangs, Mexican gangs, multi-cultural gangs, etc.  Plus this game is set in a fictional place, where countless people are gunned down in a matter of hours.  The most famous shoot out in all of Western History was the shootout at OK Coral.  Only like a few people died in that, but it's definitely not the hundreds Marston lays to waste in RDR.  It's not like Red Dead is a prime example of Historical Accuracy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe that it'd be historically accurate for the time if this is indeed a gang in the wild west.  Wild West gangs were very diverse, and if the game really is one where you're switching between all 7 characters, then I think it would make sense that one or two of those wouldn't be white.  Didn't Dutch ally himself with a Native American gang in the mountains anyway?  Plus, I just feel as if that Rockstar needs to put a female playable character in their game...  It's been decades, and we have had one dude after another.  I'm not saying the lead HAS to be a woman, but if you're going to do a game with 7 characters, then why can't one be a lady?  

Granted, these 7 men may have nothing to do with the plot.  Then I'll look silly, but ATM I'm fine with bringing this up as a discussion. </TEXT>

I am convinced they have no idea how to write in a subtle fashion, and let their political commentary get in the way of telling good stories.  GTA V was really bad about this.  I was invested in the weird dynamic between Trevor, Michael and Franklin, and how Michael's past betrayal influenced that, but a good portion of the game was dedicated to this GOD AWFUL Agency vs Agency plot that just pulled me right out of the story...  Shit, even Red Dead 1 had Marston break off from good story telling to rant about the federal government.

Rockstar is amazing at crafting deep, immersive worlds, atmosphere, and reliable gameplay...  But they can't write a game worth a damn.  Hire some new writers...  Please...

	<TEXT> I find it interesting that the manifestation of God/Grim Reaper is dressed in a modern, dapper suit as well.  They really try to enforce the idea that John is a man of a bygone era, and that all forces...  Even supernatural, seem to be ahead of him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, this seems like a definite answer.  Would you recommend changing the value to 4096 like /u/dimedius says?  Or just running the game vanilla without ENBoost? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, for the last few weeks, I've been having an issue when I go into downtown Boston. Before when I had this issue, I had about 120 mods installed. The game worked alright, until I got towards Diamond City. Then it seemed the game was collapsing piece by piece. Long, crash-worthy freezes, CTD, mipmaps never going back to high res, corrupt saves.

I also had this installed: http://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/332/?

It was originally set to 10,000 Ram Usage, seeing as how I have 4 GB VRAM and 16 GB of RAM I didn't think of it as an issue. But once I get into Boston, I have this problem where mipmaps go low res and stay that way. They never rise back to high res, even when reloading the game.

I have tried numerous options to try and get this game working with mods, but I still have this issue with a fresh install and very few mods installed. And in just starting a new game, I have LOOONG freezes and mipmaps glitching out right as I leave Sanctuary. This is making the game unplayable, and I have no idea how to fix this issue. Can someone please help me?

I'd appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am pretty left on my opinions, and I think Trump is terrible, but GOD I hate Bill Maher.  He talks down to people in the most condescending, uncomfortable way with this air of fucking superiority that just makes right wing people angrier and more reinforced in their ideals...  You don't get anywhere by calling uninformed/undecided people idiots, and this guy is the biggest fucking moron of them all if he thinks that's how you do it.  Bill Maher is a plague to the left, and he gives all Liberals and progressives a bad name.  He is one of the worst human beings representing the left wing, and Liberals would have a better time of convincing on the fence voters if they didn't have this cunt as one of their voices.  When right wingers look to who represents the 'Liberal Media' with their sneering and eye-rolling, Bill Maher is the epitome of that.

Fuck Bill Maher to every extent he can be fucked.  We don't want his cunt mouth as the voice of progression. </TEXT>
