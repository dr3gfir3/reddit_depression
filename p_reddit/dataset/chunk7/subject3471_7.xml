	<TEXT> You cant unlove someone.

No matter how bad theyve been, it is impossible to break a bond that strong. You can test it, twist it, put it on trial for all the world to see. But that cannot break love. It will only serve to drag the person tethered to it through the most amazing trials of pain.

My son has been my world since we lost his father. He was an only child. I have just one sister, Myra, who has been a best friend to me as well. But theres nothing that can compare to what a mother shares with her son. 

So when I realized that I was going to lose him, it wasnt just changing part of my life. It meant erasing who I am, and re-writing an entirely new narrative that simply had no hope of comparing to the first. 

So I might as well have fun with it, right?

No, thats not a good way to explain what I knew I had to do. Theres no real sense of fun when going through the most agonizing part of life.

This pain will define who I am. So throughout it, as I undertake the task of synthesizing a new identity from the agonized ashes of my former self, I will take loving care to sculpt a meaningful identity. One that will bring me meaning and purpose. Perhaps one day even joy. 

I will not be crushed by defeat. I will turn loss into opportunity.

Dont judge me as one who fails to properly grieve. My son was going to die; that much was inevitable. He was starting a new life anyway, and had already cut ties with his previous one. Its fitting really, but also unspeakably tragic; he had just finished college, and a lifetime of hard work was about to start paying dividends.

But life can pivot on the slightest of happenstance. 

What future awaited him when he found out the truth about me? It would crush him and leave him alone. His life would bear the unending stain of shame. He would never be whole again. 

Im doing this because I loved him. I love him still. 

When he showed me the tapes that I thought were long buried, I knew it was over in an instant. I had thought of this day, but convinced myself that it would never be real. Yet here it was.

I hit him over the head with a cast iron skillet because I had to. I bound and shackled him because I had to. I sentenced him to die because I had to.

So why waste the opportunity? Dont act so high and mighty, readers. He was going to die anyway.

I have a unique mind. There are certain insatiable desires that are not far off of what most normal people feel, but which society judges in an unfairly harsh regard. Our collective morals are fluid and opportunistic. My mind is sharper, more adaptable, and, quite bluntly, more intelligent than that of the typical *homo sapiens*. There is justification ascribed suffering caused by humans throughout history. We revere slaveholders and torture animals with aplomb. We justify the mass killings of civilians during times of war. 

And I justify a little torture in time of peace.

Its not really that different, you see. Its a matter of perspective. 

And by allowing my release on a subject that was going to die anyway, Ive narrowed the effects of my practice.

It saddened me to lock my son up. My sister was there for me. She helped secure other subjects to place in the cage. 

Myra provided the little girl, obviously. I suppose trapping men has gotten blas. But hiding the knife in her shirt was all my idea. I think it worked itself out rather nicely. 

My son has already begun to undergo at transformation. Hes still writing, and it has enhanced my own experience to read it. Borrowing his username to add my own insight has brought me to near orgasmic levels. 

But nothing could surpass the experience of watching him eat that mans liver.

Oh, how I love watching. Its a high that nothing else can provide. Id love to measure my dopamine levels. I imagine doctors would be incredulous to find that I could achieve such a percentage without chemical assistance. 

The high lasted for a year after I watched the humanity drain from my husband. It helped me be a father and a mother to our lonely boy. 

It made the loss worthwhile.

Im hoping that it will work this time as well.

Because I know I will miss my son when hes gone.

Even after everything, I still did not expect this. I knew it would be extreme. But not this.

The other man woke up. His name is Gordon. Ive never seen him before, and have no way of knowing if Ive ever crossed paths with him in my previous life. The closest connection that I can seem to find is that he used to be neighbors with my moms sister Myra.

Is that important? I have no idea at this point.

He asked me directly if I had any idea why we might be here. I think I lied pretty convincingly. Other than establishing the fact that he lived near my aunt, I did nothing to implicate my mother in whats happening. 

Its not to protect her at this point. He may be lying, but I dont think he is. 

I just need to keep as many cards up my sleeve as I can right now. 

*(On the first day of kindergarten, I was too afraid to go into the classroom. I grabbed my mothers leg and did not let go. The teacher laughed, saying that many children are afraid at first. But she got progressively less understanding as I refused to let go. My mother finally had to take me home for the day, and I swore that I would never go back. But we had a talk, and she promised that she would always be there to rescue me if things got bad. That was the only thing that made me brave enough. I went to the second day of kindergarten, and every day after. I was never afraid to stay after that, because I always knew I could leave.)*

Gordon did not seem to grasp the full reality of our situation. It was for the best by my standards. We cannot get any other websites on this computer despite multiple attempts, and he seems to have no other advantageous skills. Lockpicking, engineering, logic  nothing.

Unless hes playing an elaborate psychological game with me. But if hes been doing a good job, Ill never know, right?
And I think the waters drugged.

We pass out shortly after drinking it, and when we wake up, its difficult to tell how much time has passed. 

But theres always more water.

Drink it or die.

Have you ever been unable to stop thinking about something? Imagine that the thought you cant expunge is that fact that you might have to kill an innocent person.

And eat them. 

Am I more justified in waiting until Im pushed to the edge? Or is it the same crime either way, meaning I should act now?

I dont think that Gordon has been processing the same thoughts. I may be a bad person for it, but the only thing that I can consider is that fact that this helps me. 

Im the strongest player in this game.

Things changed when we passed out the last time.

We woke up, and there were three of us. 

The new addition was a little girl. She had to have been about ten. She was thankfully dressed in a t-shirt and shorts, but looked far more haggard than either Gordon or I was at the time. I did not want to know what she had gone through. I did not ask. 

Had my mother done something horrible to her as well? I wracked my brain for justification that she hadnt, but I found none.

We spoke little after the immediate arrival. It was impossible to get much out of her, and after a few attempts at communication, we all fell into an uneasy silence. 

There is no way to measure the passage of time outside the computers clock, but Im beginning to doubt the accuracy of it. All I know is that time passed. 

The little girl was quick.

Of course neither Gordon nor I thought to pat her down for weapons. Who would? She whipped the knife out faster that I would have thought possible. 

I think she knew that Gordon was the weakest of us two. 

She worked at his neck in quick, shallow jabs. He was able to push her away, and she rolled into a corner. But it was too late.

Gordon grabbed at his neck as he convulsed to death. You know how movies always show a slick spy making quick work of an enemy agent?

Its all bullshit. The human body does not want to die, and fights all the way to the end.

There was gurgling, and sputtering, and a lot of convulsing. After the end, Gordon did a LOT of twitching. 

But he sure as shit was dead.

It did not even dawn on me to intervene until long after it was over. The girl still had the knife, and she was not finished yet. 

When it was clear that Gordon was dead, she descended upon him.

Like a hunter over its prey, she made quick work of his torso. She was pulling out his organs. 

I had to think.

She was probably starved. Food would help her get ahead. She was capable of killing. Soon Id be pushed to starvation. Wed likely go a long time without food. The more she had, the more danger I was in. 

Put it all together, people.

When she pulled the liver out, I did what I had to do. Im a lot stronger than a ten-year-old girl. I whipped it from her, and took it for myself. I figure that the sooner I adapt to the unthinkable, the more likely I am to make it out of here.

So I ate Gordons liver.  It was chewy, cold, and gamey. But I hadnt eaten in a day, and I was hungry. 

I continued eating unabated, because I had to. And the blood poured freely down my chin. 

I did not take the knife. I let it go because I convinced myself that I could snatch it away, just like the liver, at any point I wish. That justification is easier than confronting the reality that when she loses the knife, she will know that she will die from it. 

I just cant handle that reality right now.

Ive decided to deal with the mental implications later. The rest gets pushed to the back of my mind for the moment. 

The girl got to eat less. For now, shes sitting at the back of the cage, not moving.

I know she has the knife. She knows that I know it. 

And we both know this game has been taken to the next level.
