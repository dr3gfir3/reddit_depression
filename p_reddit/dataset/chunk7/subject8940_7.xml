	<TEXT> There's the Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross - there's a lot of court politicking, different branches of families trying to gain power (sci-fi/fantasy)

There's Team of Rivals by Doris Goodwin about Abraham Lincoln which is about how he got elected and then how he was able to unite people enough that were so seriously at odds to be able to actually run the country and win a war.

Hissing Cousins by Marc Peyser is about the rivalry between Eleanor Roosevelt (wife of FDR) and Alice Roosevelt Longworth (daughter of Teddy Roosevelt)

There is a fantasy series, The Keltiad by Patricia Kennealy(-Morrison) that has some of all of that...  There are 3 galactic empires basically that have been at odds with each other for generations.  If you start with The Silver Branch you can get the bonus of the friends eventually hating each other too.

	<TEXT> His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman has a lot to talk about (The Golden Compass).  

Serephina by Rachel Hartman 

Uglies (followed by Pretties and Specials) by Scott Westerfeld can certainly generate a lot of conversation too... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything I've read by Krakauer has been riveting, I enjoyed Into Thin Air immensely.  

I have wondered, after reading the foreword or afterward in the version I read, if others have read this as well as the accounts written by others from this expedition and how well the accounts match up.  He spends so much time going into detail about the oxygen deprivation, the sleep deprivation and how altered he feels his state of mind was, so I just wonder if the other perspectives are close or completely different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the two series you listed are classified for younger readers, along the same lines there is...  

Septimus Heap by Angie Sage

Rick Riordan - he has several series

The Inheritence Cycle - Christopher Paolini

Fablehaven - Brandon Mull

If you want something targeted slightly older I'd suggest trying 
His Dark Materials - Phillip Pullman

The Enchanted Forest Chronicles - Patricia Wrede

The Old Kingdom series by Garth Nix (Sabriel)

If you'd like older than that, check out Mercedes Lackey, Jasper Fforde, or Rob Thurman. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cassandra Clare's books are along that line - The Infernal Devices and the Mortal Instruments books, though as a disclaimer, those are YA.

Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse series (the one True Blood is based on) is in that concept - vampires came out to the world once a company figured out how to manufacture synthetic blood so the vampires don't Have to feed on humans.  Also contains were-everything, fairies etc.

You also might like the Cal Leandros books by Rob Thurman (Nightlife is the first one) or The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher.  </TEXT>
