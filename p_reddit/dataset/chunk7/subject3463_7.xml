	<TITLE> How do I figure out what genre The Friday Night Knitting Club by Kate Jacobs is? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was organizing my wish list (62 word pages, oh my!) but I have doubts as The Friday Night Knitting Club by Kate Jacobs in which genre or genres should I put it?  I saw The Friday nigt knitting club was classified by GR as chick-lit, but I have a problem with this because for me, chick-lit, hen/matron-lit and YA are only an age labels, a marketing strategy not a true genre, the first thing I thought was a slice of life, although in manga (Japanese comics) slice of life is considered a genre, in literature is a narrative technique, so Im unsure of which is the right one. Do you have any advice? Thank you. 
English isn't my first language, so please excuse any mistakes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everybody, Im using cozy-mystery.com, uchronia.net, historicalnovels.info and cozy-mysteries-unlimited.com to have the latest updates (new books/series/dates) but after days of searching I currently can't find any sites such as those mentioned for fantasy (+ subgenres), horror, science fiction (+ subgenres), adventure, scientific-divulgation, foodies, gastronomic novels, western and/or history, so Im wondering if can you recommend sites for those genres? Thank you! </TEXT>
