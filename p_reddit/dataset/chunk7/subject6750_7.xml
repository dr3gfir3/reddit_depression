	<TEXT> When I was in high school I was pretty ugly. There was a girl that would do anything to make my life miserable. I ended up graduating early and going on with my life. (Not ugly anymore hey) I stay off social media and only talk to one or two people from back then. Long story short she never graduated and has two baby daddies and no car. I ran into her at the grocery store a few months back. She looked a mess. I wasn't too happy with this karma since kids born to poor moms are a sad statistic.  </TEXT>
