	<TEXT> My dog is trained to comfort me when I have anxiety, be a physical barrier between me and people when I get panicky, and provide an excuse to leave a situation i.e. he needs to go potty/eat/drink. 
He is my dog that I trained (14 years in the animal care industry) but when my doctor saw what a huge help he provided to me she provided the documents to define him as a service animal.

I have no illusions of getting rich from my work, but it would be nice to make enough to have to claim it on my taxes. That is just somehow a validation of it being my official career to me if I made enough to make it taxable income. It's exciting and terrifying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My kids are 9 and about to turn 5. The 6 months were at an RV park with other kids and a nice clubhouse for them to hang out in. Even now they are pretty much outside unless they are sleeping or getting their "screen time". We moved into it out of necessity when my husband got a job in another town and we had to move quickly to take advantage of it. We moved into a house, and honestly missed the Vardo (which is what we call the RV) The girls tell me they miss living in the Vardo pretty often and are there with us every step of the renovation. 

When we moved back we decided to live with my Mom and Stepdad while we renovate and find some land, although the communal living with my parents situation is working well for us and we might just boondock here for the foreseeable future when we get it done.

	<TEXT> I lived in a 29ft RV for 6 months with 3 adults, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. We are currently renovating it to a more "tiny house" format and then will be moving back in (minus one adult) on family land. After living in it for 6 months we learned a lot about what worked and what didn't for us. My best advice is pick a priority as far as living space and put the most thought and time into designing and building it. 

For us, the kitchen was the biggest problem area, and so we are making basically the back 1/4th the kitchen with a much larger counter area and more thoughtful storage. The back wall from where the counter will be up to the ceiling is pegboard to hang the most used pots, pans, utensils and whatnot. We are also upgrading to an apartment size fridge. 
 
Second priority was beds. My husband and I are big people, and restless sleepers so we opted to each have our our twin size bed that doubles as a couch during the day, the kids will have lofts until we get the kids their own rv/tiny house when they are a little older.

As far as storage, put a lot of thought into it. Big cabinets are useless, they just become black holes where things get put and are never seen again. Use totes, bins, boxes, baskets, etc to organize and put things in a place where you can see the area to retrieve what you need. We curtained off the "cockpit" and have it packed with stuff, but all hanging or in stacking bins so nothing is buried under other crap.

I hope this is helpful </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am to about the re-write stage of things as described above. The whole thing started as an idea I had and was using as "warm-up pages" for a fiction project. Then, when I had it fleshed out fairly well I asked the writer/director of our current production to take a look at it. He is going to help he, but he is a busy guy and I want to do as much of the work on it as possible without expecting him to hold my hand. That is great advice on how to move forward! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually have a very rough 1st draft. It's around 22ish pages and includes a short "Oh, Susanna" parody song. The company does short, fast-paced melodrama, usually based in Tombstone in the 1880's, heavy on the laughs.  My story is an old west take on Snow White based around a saloon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the town where I grew up there was a restaurant with a taxidermy fawn that had been killed in this same type of situation in the owners office. The entire place was filled with very well done taxidermy from the extended family's hunting efforts over the years. I remember even as a kid thinking that tiny fawn he kept in his office was eerily beautiful. </TEXT>
