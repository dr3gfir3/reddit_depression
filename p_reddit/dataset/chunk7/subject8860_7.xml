	<TEXT> Right. I know that. No one watching cares about a neutral arbiter of intent, they decide intent. So by their definition, if they see me on camera and its my first time there, I'm a filthy scumbag cheater and so subject to whatever witch hunt they want to cook up.

That's why this is so dangerous, it disincentivises  going to the pro tour for fun, or at least makes it harder to relax during a game.

Which makes mistakes and angle shooting more likely.

	<TEXT> Idk, how consistent is LED dredge and what is its matchup against miracles?

It looks extremely favorable for the dredge player against most of this, honestly. this obviously only applies assuming normal sideboards and all 20 decks in the meta.

I mean how many grave hate spells do you play if the known meta only has 3-4 decks that actually use the graveyard? Also, one is ANT and another is turbo depths, and some builds of depths don't even have recursion.

	<TEXT> So you do not acknowledge that nongames exist?

I'm  trying to form a baseline for conversation here. losing sucks, but as I said in the OP, is not my main concern. My main concern is the ability to play the game of magic that I sat down to play.

If my opponent shuts that down, they did their job. If my deck fails to put up token resistance or a token offence, that's a problem.

There is no fun game in which you have no meaningful input. Thats not just magic, that's games in general. The games where that happens and you win are only mitigated by the fact that there is some sort of prize on the line, and then not much. the games where that happens and you lose have no redeeming value most of the time, with the exception being the opponents being pretty nice about it.

The line of thought I have, emotionally, for these games is " I did not sit down for a bad interactive movie, I sat down for magic."

Intellectually, I know that these games happen so infrequently as to be statistically insignificant, maybe %5 -6 percent of games, but i have a hard time separating the emotion from the variance without 
just moving on to the next game of magic.

This thread is really just a purge of the remaining 5-6 percent of salt games.        </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay let me be even more clear:

losing to wasteland: fine, I should have played more basics.
losing to blood moon on turn one: also fine, same reason.
losing to counterbalance lock, or lucky topdecks, or my own mistakes, or a deck reg error, or drawing an extra card by accident at comp rel? 
All totally fine.

The subset of games that I play where neither player has any meaningful impact on the outcome? Yeah this is where the salt comes from.

It also doesn't last longer than it takes for the next "good game of magic," and the more magic I get to play, the less likely this is to happen. For example, a gp? Never salty. A monthly event? Only if there isn't  a draft i can get into.  Draft till you drop round one loss to screw? Not happening. Prerelease? kick my arse and give me another please.

The commanality is the ability to say "Whatever, I'll just go play magic over there.

	<TEXT> again sorry I wasn't more clear in the op. 

My salt comes from the specific subsection of games in which neither player has any meaningful influence on the outcome, the ones where it doesn't matter what my oppenent killed me with,  I could not play magic.

No amount of money fixes this problem. 

If my opponent storms me out of the game, I should have played more turn 0 interaction. That's on me. 

If my opponent locks me out with counter top, I should have played more varied mana costs.

If my opponent wastes all my land, I should have played more basics. 

If i draw an extra card at comp rel, I needed to be more careful.

However if i mulligan to 5 on the play and see no lands, and then my opponent wins, then neither i nor my opponent had a meaningful impact on the game, with the small exception of him playing a 2/2.

These are not "real games," these are "nongames," and it seems from talking to other people locally that I have a much stricter view that they of what consistutes such.

	<TEXT> In a perfect world, I would agree  with you.

In the world we live in, the increased power of the individual to collect information is the only way to fight the increased power of the organisation to mislead and obfuscate.

This doesn't even have to be intentional, as time goes on, it becomes more and more clear that TYT for example has its own series of biases. 

Actually scratch that. Anyone who thinks that TYT hid their bias at any point was paying woefully little attention to all the times they said " We're biased, but we quote our sources and try to be as factual as possible "

On context, the historical, societal and cultural stuff behind voter id laws are fact, not opinion, and as such that stuff isn't up for debate. If you look into that stuff and say that its strange to not have them, you have formed an opinion based on the facts you have.

The only thing  I could say is maybe to give related facts too?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, checking the source, it doesn't look like the chart differentiates black nationalists from black separatists, and it really should as there is a difference. Because blacks are a minority in the states, black nationalists can't really get away with saying stuff like "peaceful ethnic cleansing" 

If/when blacks become the majority, we can talk about rebalancing the other way a bit. I'm sure that at that point, blacks will start talking about genocide, and whites will have to fight it, because being an idiotic homicidal dick knows no color.

Not right now though, right now we gotta try to balance this way.

Cenk is going to need to at least look into this though, if something challenges your worldview, you need to verify it and then reexamine what you believe in the context of the new info.

I understand the Wtf emotional phase though. I just had to fight through it myself. I need more verifiable data to compare to before i just take this at face value though.

*doesn't show difference between white nationalist and white separatists either,  much less of a difference here though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think thats it for me, due to the fact that it's very easy for me to forget to tilt during any game after the one in which I had reason to believe i got unlucky, coupled with the fact that I spend a bit of time trying to find reasons why being salty is unreasonable before deciding that yes, I did get somewhat unlucky and given the circumstances, a modicum of salt would not be entirely untoward.

Of course this becomes a bit of a problem whenever someone asks how my last round went. Nothing refills the salt shaker like having your round 3 opponent ask you how your event is going when you lose to screw/flood in round 1 and then get the bye in round 2.      </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Been playing breakfast off and on for about a month now, and i need some help with my lists mana. I'm not actually sure how much mana to put in here, given the list that i'm running.

The most relevant part:

lands: ?

brainstorm 4  
ponder 4  
gitaxian probe 4   
aether vial 4   

Full list :  
4 brainstorm  
4 ponder   
4 probe  
4  aether vial  
4 force of will  
4 nomads en kor  
4 cepalid illusionist  
3 narcomoeba  
1 shaman en kor  
3 recruiter of the guard  
3 cabal therapy  
1 dread return  
1 azami, lady of scrolls  
1 labrotory maniac  
1 angel of glory's rise  
3 daze  

cards that can be cut:  
1 x therapy  
2- 4 probes  
1x ponder  
1 x force  
1x swamp

current mana:  
1 swamp   
1 island  
1 plains  
4 flooded strand  
4 polluted delta  
2 hallowed fountain  
2 underground sea  
1 scrubland  
1 cavern of souls  

how the deck works for the uninitiated:   
step 1 : play nomad  
step 2 : play illusionist, infinitely target it with nomad to mill yourself, therapy your opponent and then yourself to get rid of dead cards, then dread return angel to reanimate azusa/ lab man and win.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interestingly, opening a crummy sealed pool is still a situation that someone can meaningfully influence. Winning with garbage is worth a modicum of bragging rights, if nothing else.

Getting mana screwed can be a problem in deck construction or mulligan decisions, and usually I think about that before I move to the salt step.

I have so few things in the first catagory that it might be shining a magnifier on this stuff when it happens.

Sometimes whether a loss is your fault or not can be hidden information,  like when you lose in the deckbuilding phase of a new deck after having a lot of success with it because you are playing one less land than you should be.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> should have been more clear.

Its not necessarily the outcome of the game, but how much control I/my opponent has over it. If I lose because I threw away my guy for no value, or  my opponent countered all my spells, or even because I screwed up and drew an extra card at comp rel, That's fine.  None of those things are affected by the kind of variance that grinds my gears.

mulling twice into a four land hand and drawing two more lands over 4 turns is where I start getting a little bit irate, but only if I run down the list of " Did i build my deck wrong?" type of things, and only until the next game that I have input into.

The salt can only exist inside and immediately after a bad game of magic, one where the outcome of the game is entirely decided by the vagaries of randomness. </TEXT>

It's  interesting because IRL I don't stress over that kind of thing. I suspect that it's because magic obfuscates what you can or can't influence so often that it becomes hard to identify what you have influence over.

	<TEXT> I should have been much more clear. I get salty sometimes when I lose matches in which I have such minimal input that what my opponent does to beat me almost doesn't matter. The litmus test for those is " If all my opponents cards were grizzly bears, would they have still won the game?" There is very little to learn from games like that. 

I'm approaching all my games like playtesting sessions. In that context, losing "grizzily bear games" are the worst, followed by winning such games, followed by getting the bye, followed by whatever.

The best losses are to grindy control decks, because there is so much data to work with there, followed closely by losing to something I haven't seen before, followed by something I haven't yet played against.   </TEXT>

deck constuction, deck choice and mulligan decisions are all places where if I get mana screwed it could be my fault, and I try to consider all of that before I begin the saline infusion.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lately I realize that I'm getting a little too salty when I lose. I recognize that variance is a thing in magic, and i feel like the reason why  take things so hard is because I just don't get to play enough magic.    
4-7 matches per week is just not enough to divorce the salt from the variance.

I should add that the way I "desalinate" is always by playing more magic. My  goal in any given tournament is to play the maximum
amount of magic, sometimes to the detriment of my win loss record but not to the detriment of my opponents.  

I should also add that traveling an 1 - 1.5 hours to play 3-4 rounds of magic and then spending that same time traveling back makes getting the bye seem awful in the context of my goal of playing the most possible magic.    </TEXT>

but that doesn't jive with this:  "You mean you're doing tiny problems to help you learn the basics, and it's not obvious to you that it shouldn't take half a work week to solve a single problem? What the fuck?"

	<TEXT> Its not obvious to me! Is it too long? I have no context. 

That's why I asked. That's why I'm asking! How long is it supposed to take to solve a problem? How do i get faster at solving problems if such a thing is taking too long?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See the section I wrote on me thinking maybe 20+ hours at my computer is maybe too long trying to solve one problem?

I finally realized the thing about videos when I finally found a video resource that I was more confident I was understanding(reflected by my much greater ability to write code that wasn't carbon copy from the video that did all the extra/different stuff I wanted it to do), I went back to reference earlier videos for something and found doing so to be a pain in the arse.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unity and Unreal have 2d and 3d support, and Unity is slightly better documented.

I think unreal is more friendly to coding, but don't quote me on that, I'm no professional.

	<TEXT> Thanks!

Related question, how would I go about testing to see what knowledge I do have, what I need to brush up on, and where I should be given how long I've been at this.

The only thing I'm sure of is that after 4 years I should probably be better than this.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah learned this the hard way. I also don't like when you go to use something in chapter 5, for example, and they don't explain the gotchas for that thing until chapter 12 or they only do it in the context of something else.

I don't think I know what an official resource would even look like and how I would be able to find one. Do you mean like the free harvard course I've seen floating around?  Do colleges publish programming textbooks? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What official resources, msdn? I didn't even know it existed until halfway through my second year trying to learn. 

If not msdn, i dont actually know what official resources that you are referring to.

Just to give you an idea of how borked I've been, I started with c++ for dummies while using New Boston for a video resource. I did that for six months, then tried to do some pretty basic multi-file and inheritance stuff and hit a softwall doing multiple inheritance.

I then dropped that for a bit to change gears, using SDL to do a series of videos for a bit before  striking out on my own as far as trying to make a text rpg. This is something i managed to get working, before I got over ambitious  and learned the hard way to google version control for the first time.

Just to be clear, I didn't know to google version control, I found out that there was a thing called version control after trying to find out if there was a better way to save my files.

I got pretty discouraged for a while, then came back and gave myself a refresher on the basics using Codeabbey/another video series/ a bunch of c++ ebooks. After doing well enough that I thought that I could move on to making my own  stuff again, I started doing that, then unreal engine became free and my eyes got bigger than my brain(or some such analogy).

I proceeded to screw around with doing stuff with that for 2 months off and on while still doing the other stuff,  learning naming conventions and code organization and all this other stuff that i thought there was no other way  I would be able to understand without looking at a complex code base.

I then tried to do something (cant remember what), got discouraged when it didn't work and I couldn't fix it(!), took a break and refocused again.

Right now I'm using a Udemy course to learn the Unity engine while
working on unity side project stuff. C#. 

Lately I've come to the realization that programming video tutorials are awful if you want to do any sort of review of information. I just want a transcript of these videos. Or ideally, a freaking textbook. A good one for once in my life.     

Edit: Ha, case in point, see mod reply. I really wish I knew that reddit existed more than 6 months ago, would have saved me a lot of grief I think.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! How would you suggest i know when I'm looking at something that that is going to do more harm than good?

This may or may not be a separate question, but how would you suggest I know when i should stop trying to parse the text or video or whatever that i'm looking at and try an alternative resource?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been having a hard time understanding the basics of various
things for a while now, and it may be because of the tools i'm using to learn. I'm getting there, but it is extremely slow going.

I just last week noticed that the vast majority of learning resources I had been using  are marked as discouraged resources here. 

I usually see a cool new concept, make sure i understand it, then go to implement it and realize i don't understand it at all. This usually results in me spending 20+ hours over the next week or so 
trying to figure out what it is about the latest thing that i don't understand.

My understanding of a thing is entirely based on if i got exactly that thing working before, because i have no confidence that i can get a variant of that thing running in any reasonable amount of time.    

Not having milestones on a reasonable path to proficiency is also
eroding any confidence I may have left. Even a " Now that you know  X, Y and Z, you should be able to do this" would be helpful.

I have no idea where my gaps  even are, and this might be due to the moving from tool to tool and resource to resource I've done every few months. 

I would just like to have something like a way to compare what I think i know, what i can actually execute, and what I should know after 4 years at this.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm already running the full compliment of firecraft and vortex has been way too awkward in that matchup. pillar has horrible disssenergy with flame rift, which is proving itself to be the best card in the deck.

I also would have to hear why you think that pillar or votex are better than scald.  </TEXT>
