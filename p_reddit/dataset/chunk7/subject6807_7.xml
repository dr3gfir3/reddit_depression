	<TEXT> Watched it again a few days ago.

Besides being very funny, it's also a genuinely good movie. Something comedies/spoof films often fail at.

	<TEXT> Yeah, it sucks. But I just don't look at it/use it. 

The old system actually was functional, but apparently most people didn't use it and prefer the B/W good or bad thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Everyone says this but I haven't got around to them for a reason.

Plenty of good movies have been made through the years. Hell, you don't even have to go way back, to the seventies or forties or something. At least I personally miss out on films every single year.

Just trying to look at it in a positive way.  </TEXT>

I just don't agree with the idea that we have to pick sides when it comes to our central characters, because they all have their issues.

Ex Machina, Whiplash, Selma, Arrival, The Nice Guys, Mad Max Fury Road, Room, Creed, Pete's Dragon, Hacksaw Ridge and 10 Cloverfield Lane are all abysmal?

	<TEXT> I have actually found it hard to dig up some stuff now and again. But to be fair, it was obscure stuff. 
For instance (I was reminded of it because you mentioned Bates Motel) there's a doc called The Psycho Legacy that I was never able to find in any legal manner. At least there was no access to it where I live. Or I'm just dumb, that's not out of the question.

Anyway, I agree, there are definitely a lot of options. </TEXT>

I'm not saying there is no actual hotel, but I do think it's a good idea to keep an open mind. Sure it seems *unlikely* that something genuinely supernatural wasn't going on... but that doesn't mean something supernatural was going on.

I have no idea where they're going with this, but it wouldn't surprise me if it ends up more mundane than many might expect. They have kept their options open.

But really, she probably drank the water.

	<TEXT> If no real effort is put into it, I will probably not watch it. That means it might be a fairly polished, pro product, but if it's just going through the motions and it's obvious no one involved cares, I'll probably consider it bad... even if it technically isn't. 

I'm thinking of something like those CSI shows or what have you.

I can forgive shows having bad elements, if there are good things in the middle of it all. An example could be Bates Motel, which is kind of all over the place with regards to its narrative and characters, but seems to genuinely be trying and the two lead actors put on one hell of a show.

Not sure if this makes any sense, but there you are. </TEXT>

Another idea: some cross-cutting between wide shots of New York and Texas in order to show the scope of the show. Hell you could maybe even throw the cave woman in there to really show just how big they go. Unless of course you only want to tease with your back door plan, in that case you should probably mainly focus on season one. </TEXT>
