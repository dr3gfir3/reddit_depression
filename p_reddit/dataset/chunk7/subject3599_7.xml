	<TEXT> I read somebody trying to justify their purchase. My experience was being invited to a home for several annual birthday/charity fundraisers. The mutual friend and I share an interest in home theater/audio/recording with the homeowner. 

The homeowner had just torn out a 5.1 system consisting of Energy Veritas V2.3i in the front, V2.0c center, v2.0r surround, powered by a Lexicon LX-7 amp and Anthem D2V preamp in a dedicated room. Subwoofer was a JL Audio F112. I've heard the system on numerous occasions and thought it quite good. 

What he'd installed this last go round and what I heard was a setup of Silver Phantoms. My issues with the Phantoms? The white cases reflect light like crazy in a darkened room, especially with the sides pumping away like mad. The sound is very good, very dynamic, and with a solid foundation, but I don't consider it lightyears beyond what can be achieved with traditional componentry. Also, they manifestly do NOT do room lock and shudder the way a proper sub does.

I also found that I missed the point source bass as opposed to the more omni nature of the Phantoms. The Veritas played quite low so the F112 only handled bass below 40Hz. I recall the last time I heard the system a much more distinct precision =ability to 'locate' a sound even down into the lower registers. That was diminished in the bass although improved over the veritas through the midband and treble. The Phantoms also were missing musicality. I'm also an analog guy and my current setup is B W 802d fronts, HTM-2D center, and XT2s for side and rear. We also listened to some jazz tracks and some of the nuances I'm used to simply weren't there.

Again, I'm not saying they suck at all. I do not believe they're the end-all be-all and for $15k I can put together a system that sounds better TO ME. It will not be as convenient but it will not have the software quirks either. To each their own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some conversations, you simply cannot have with parents. They have their beliefs, you have yours. That they, by dint of parentage, feel entitled to shower their opinions upon you, is something you can challenge, if you wish, by enforcing boundaries. I regularly tell my parents, "I love you deeply, I'm not going to discuss those subjects. I respect your beliefs and hope you respect that mine differ." And then change the subject. If they keep rejoining, leave. Took calmly saying goodbye and leaving on two occasions (once before dinner, the ultimate insult in a Jewish home ;) ), but we no longer have those problems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...because people that achieved what is being claimed in many cases witnessed and did things that are beyond words and in some cases cannot be spoken of at all. 

Because claiming that valor and those achievements is a fraud perpetrated upon a public. Because in doing so, by their conduct, those that perpetrate such fraud diminish and dishonor those that have been there and done that and the armed forces as a whole. 

What impression does it give for some broken down jackhole to be claiming they singlehandedly killed fifteen people with seemingly no thought or remorse at all? Is that the impression you'd want conveyed? I've never taken a life. Everyone i know that has mostly does not talk about it and sure as hell don't brag about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's what that is. The first is making it illegal to *fraudulently* deface coinage. To make defacing a coin illegal, one must intend to deceive. 

Or.

One must *fraudulently* be in possession of currency or attempt to pass such currency *knowing* that it is altered and not as originally was. 

So if you have a quarter coin that you remade as a dollar coin, that violates both. But again, the key word is, for both, fraud. You must intend to deceive. If you remake a quarter as a metal teddy bear, you aren't intending to deceive that it was originally a quarter or pass it off as a different coin.

Ironically, one could violate the above by taking a quarter and somehow making it into a penny.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if it compromises a potential claim but what you might try if you otherwise like your boss, need the job, and want to take a step before going to HR is to confront your boss, tell her you do not appreciate such rumors and do not consider it a laughing matter (if she says she was joking) and that you're asking her to call everyone in that she told and refute the message with you present as well as issuing a public apology. A sexual harassment claim is a big deal and can have huge consequences. If the culture there is to play fast and loose with such things? Might be better served to attack head on instead of possibly poisoning things by filling a claim.  

Good luck OP. If you want,  i can check in with an SPHR I know for best practices. Shoot me a PM if so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They may want it to be their primary platform? And as cord-cutting continues to grow that may be the case. Yet "primary platform" does not in any way mean "shutting down satellite distribution". The costs to do so would be absolutely astronomical in terms of equipment replacement for home and commercial subscribers. Absent a heretofore unseen and unplanned leap in wired broadband availability and capacity, satellite will continue to be necessary for at least a decade. Wireless is a nonstarter; LTE networks would be brought to their knees by mass IPTV use in the home. A bunch of 360p streams to phone screens is very different than 2-5 DirecTV boxes per home multiplied by hundreds of homes per neighborhood all streaming different programs at 1080p or 4k and then potentially recording another 2 or 3 programs at the same time. That scenario doesn't even work over Uverse copper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...and he's wrong as phone compatibility with AT T goes. The C-Spire version of the S7 supports CDMA and GSM. It's not going to be perfect because it doesn't have a few bands AT T uses such as UMTS band 4 but it does 850/1900 which are the most important for 3G and has all the crucial LTE bands (2/4/5/12/17). You'll miss Band 30 which is a capacity overlay band. Not sure if C-Spire ships their phones SIM unlocked the way Verizon does. If not you'll need to have it unlocked. If C-Spire refuses, there're other ways to get it unlocked but you'd be better served to sell it and get an AT T version at that point.

EDIT: Missed that this was an Ebay auction. You're better off paying a bit more and finding a used AT T version. Model number you want is SM-G935A.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, it's the exact opposite. AT T is trying to do away with Uverse TV entirely and move all video to DirecTV which is far less service intensive and places fewer demands on the copper plant/allows them to market higher speeds since no bandwidth is needed for video. Eventually they want to do away with copper entirely and be all wireless. They're likely going to end up just giving up on wired broadband entirely.

He may not have intentionally disconnected you (may have knocked your pair loose while in the box) or your service may not have been properly marked so he didn't know he was taking you out of service; but he was there fixing someone else's service and needed a new wire pair and there yours went. Just went through that and it took FOUR callouts to get it resolved. I R did have to come fix the problem and we ended up getting a free speed upgrade and a bonded pair circuit due to all the trouble.
