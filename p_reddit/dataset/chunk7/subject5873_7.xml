Like I said in my OOC post I have a hard time of finding a balance between over-describing things and under-describing. Sometimes I find myself getting carried away and never getting to the heart of it and then other times I try to get to it too quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I posted this today in NS but it was removed because it wasn't horror enough. What would you do to bring it to the next level? 

I've never posted a story for critique so this would be as good as any. Pick it apart, help me clean up my writing, whatever you can think of!

On to the story! 

---------


Somehow, deep down, I always knew Id kill myself. I never had much to live for. Grew up with no money and no friends, not particularly bright or hardworking enough for scholarships. My family are a bunch of loners and hatemongers, tearing at each other each Thanksgiving like carrion birds flocking to new death. 

I worked a real shit job on a real shit shift in a real shit part of town. Literally. I was an overnight sanitation worker at the sewage treatment plant. Armed with a hazmat suit and a forty foot paddle I pushed shit around all night long to keep the pumps from getting clogged. If one did I would get lowered down into a giant steaming vat of watery shit to manually unplug whatever horrible excrement-monster was gumming up the works.

When you get dunked into a vat of shit day after day you begin to only smell shit. Flowers smelled like shit, food smelled like shit. And of course I smelled like shit. That suit didnt do as much as you would think to protect me. No amount of showers could wash away the smell. You think I had a lot of friends or girls coming around? But dont feel sorry for me, I earned that life. Deserved it even. 

It was on one such shit-clogged night that I had to go diving into the swirling mess of my towns buttholes when my decision was made. My partner checked my suit, gave me the OK, and I was lowered down. I immediately knew something was wrong because the smell was much worse. Then I could feel it - the thick, stinky liquid began filling my suit. I tried to signal but the crane operator wasnt paying attention and by the time he did notice and lifted me out the foul brew was almost to my chin. 

I tried to keep my lips sealed tight but the herky-jerky movements of the cable sloshed shit all over my face. Some splashed into my nose and ears and some got past my lips. I gagged, vomited. More entered.

Everyone apologized; my co-workers, my supervisor, the nightshift plant manager. I was having none of it.

I got into my car, still covered in shit, and floored it out of the compound. With no traffic in sight I was free to let my 89 Ford Festiva open up full throttle. The car shook and convulsed once we hit 58 miles per hour but still I forced it further. The front bumper collided with the cement freeway pillar at 71 miles per hour and pushed inward until it met the trunk barrier. In movies the cars erupt on impact and a massive fireball ensues but that isnt real life. The car never caught fire, thank goodness for that. Can you imagine the smell of cooking shit?

You may be asking yourself How the hell does he know all of this? Apparently you cant commit suicide if you are already dead, drowned in 50,000 gallons of shit water. Somehow I made it out of my body before it ceased to exist without knowing, fueled by a hatred for the life I had led and tried to end it.

Watching your own funeral is quite sobering. It is hard to tell if anyone there is sincere or not but there were quite a few nice things said about me. It is no matter, I like the body I am in now. I am strong, tall, a bit more handsome that I used to be. I am married to a sweet, soft-spoken woman and have two children. One is even named after me. The job I have is fine albeit boring. Sit at a desk, answer calls, and tell a few people what to do. It can get maddening at times but at least I dont smell shit all day long.

The problem is I am getting a little bit bored. I never really wanted kids so they get on my nerves too easily. My wife keeps saying I have changed and has begun pestering me all the time. Oh, and her cooking, atrocious. I may give this suicide thing another try. Maybe I can bounce into another body that I like better this time. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Never fully dismiss your fears - Part 2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-29 14:27:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Before](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/60uov0/never_fully_dismiss_your_fears/)

I am writing this from my mother-in-laws house, trying to recall everything I can over the past few days. Fear doesnt know age.

-------------------

When you watch a scary movie you are jumpy, nervous, on the edge the entire time because *you know* something is going to happen. It wouldnt be a scary movie if nothing did after all. Once the movie is over you slowly come down from the edge but you are wary, apprehensive. Strange sounds set your heart into overdrive and your imagination goes wild. When a lightbulb fizzles out or a door closes by itself that fear flares back up for a moment. That is how my family and I felt for the first few days back in our home.

Lights were left on all night in the hallway and kitchen, the vent fan in the bathroom turned on to mask the sounds of the night, and the bed was pulled away from the walls. When nothing happened that first night a wave of reassurance washed over us and we began to behave more normally again. The house was filled with the soft, tinkling laughter of our daughter and her silly antics removed any lingering fear or worry. 

It was good to be home. It is so easy to take for granted the things you have until they are taken from you. I found myself working harder at my job, more productive, so that I could get home sooner and spend time with my wife and daughter. I am pretty sure she knows the sound of my car now because when I open up the front door she is already moving toward it with an expectant grin. Those bright, blue eyes filled with the innocence and joy of a child lumbering toward me with each disjointed step. 

Every day she seems to learn something new. Just last week she has said four new words, signed two more, and began walking. But my favorite of all is hide and seek. Babies love peek-a-boo which is just a stationary version of hide and seek so it makes sense that they love the mobile game as well. She will crawl around behind her toy house and peek her head through the windows until I catch her gaze, then duck down and giggle. 

My wife and I bought her a nylon tent with tunnels that connect to each side for her birthday and set it up in her nursery this week. She loves it! We bought a little campfire set with the logs and fire and smores and hotdogs to roast and a little lantern to hang at the top. This is her new favorite place to play hide and seek. So many places to hide and crawl around, her own little maze. 

Every evening when I get home my girls give me a big hug and kiss, my daughters little arms grip around my neck and she says dada nonstop for the next half hour. I set my things down and crawl around after her while she hides and giggles and screams in delight. Ill pop my head through a tunnel and reach my arms around the other side to tickle her chubby thighs. Suddenly I am on the other side reaching through the front flaps. Then my huge body worms down another tunnel and I take all of the space up inside of the tent while she escapes down another tunnel toward freedom. Round and round we go until I am tired and dinner is ready. 

You would think with all of this play time she would get worn down by the end of the day and zonk out on her mommies belly after a good nursing but she is a ball of boundless energy. What used to be quiet time for my wife and I has been pushed from 7:30 to 8:30 and now this week past 9:00 PM. We still turned out all of the lights at 8:00 except for the reading lamp and let the night lights illuminate the rest of the home.

After dinner I was down on the floor reading her favorite books to her while she went back and forth between building a tower out of blocks and knocking it down. I finished the fourth or fifth book and clapped my hands as is custom at the end of a kids book and she took off for the nursey. I sighed and looked at my wife with a smile as my little girl waddled off for me to follow. On all fours, I growled my big scary daddy growl and slinked along the floor.

I smell a little baby, yes. I moved forward slowly, sniffing around the corner and peeked my head into the dimly lit room.

She sat at the edge of the tent with one hand on the flap looking over her shoulder to make sure I was following. Her eyes lit up and she lunged forward into the tent, knees sliding noisily along the nylon fabric. I waited until she stopped moving before proceeding to the tunnel she occupied, pushing my hand down to poke her in back. I was rewarded with a little squeal and the swish swish swish of her chubby legs motoring forward to the center of the tent. I gave my best lion roar and pocked my head through the flaps. She jumped backward and tugged on my hair before moving to another exit. 

I circled, growling softly, pushing my hands in this spot and that spot to see if she would grab back like she sometimes does. Tiny little razor sharp teeth clamped down on my finger and I pulled back quickly. 

Dang it! No biting, sweetie. She has been teething non-stop for over a month and chews on everything. It is a work in progress. I poked my head into the tent to pull her out but was met with her little feet churning away quickly to the end of a tunnel.

I wanted to get a hold of her quickly before the biting left her young mind so I leapt over the tent and reached into the tunnel she was in. I gently grabbed hold of her shoulders and her teeth immediately sank into my thumb. Only this time she didnt let go. I pulled her out to give her bottom a pat but was greeted with a furious swipe across my face. Razor sharp nails dug deeply into my skin and drew blood and tears. My vision was blurred but I could make out *something* resembling my daughter. The eyes were dark, dim, deeply set in anger and hatred. It was her sweet little face cast over with a horrible evil sneer. I gasped and out of the corner of my eye could see my daughter worm her way out of another tunnel, looking up at me with wide eyes. 

I tried to blink away the blood and tears but whatever this thing was squirmed out of my grip and sank its horrible teeth into my calf. I could feel the muscle separating inch by inch. Howling in pain I swiped out for it only to retreat back into the tunnel. My wife came running in as I was scooping up my daughter and limping forward to the door. Her eyes took in the damage to my face, the confused fear coated our daughter, and realization set in. She took our daughter and ran to the car.

Closing the door on her heels I turned slowly just in time to see the thing spring forward, nails glinting in the dim glow of the night light. I barely had time to raise an arm up before it crashed into me with surprising force and I staggered down to one knee. My leg throbbed all the way up to my knee, hot searing cuts opened on my arm where I had taken its charge. Blood continued to trickle into my eyes blurring my vision and I flung my arm out in a wide arc to try and slam into my tormentor. 

I felt the back of my hand connect with its leg and saw it fling sideways off balance. I lunged forward and landed directly on top of it. Bones cracked and a high-pitched screech sent cracks across the mirror and windows. I clutched at my ears but gasped when a talon started to burrow into my chest. Reaching under me and rolling sideways I held it at arms length and battered it into the solid wood drawing table. Another series of cracks, probably ribs this time. Between rapid blinks I could see pure hatred mixed with pain in the mimics face. 

Adrenaline coursed through me and powered my arms into action. I bent and twisted and squeezed and tore at the horror in front of me. Blind rage overtook me. Invading my home, tormenting my family, scaring my child. My hands did not leave much left when I was done. With my one good eye I watched the life slip from the terrible thing and once it did I broke down. My body wracked with sobs and somewhere deep inside I knew I would never be the same.

Then a slow, maniacal chuckle echoed through the house.

Fears never go away, they just get suppressed. And they get stronger.

It can be anything I want it to be. Im at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, exploring deep and mysterious trenches. Im in the depths of space, further away than the Hubble can find. Whole galaxies wink out of existence before my eyes. 

Eyes. The other things I see. Many sets of them just out of reach, always staring at me. How do they see me? They follow my movements.

I can hear their voices now. Before all was silent but I can hear them now, bits and pieces. Discussing me. 

Sensory stimulation isolation. Strengthening others by removing. Questions?

Darkness. It can be anything I want it to be. I am exploring a virgin cave.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/612wbn/healthlink/)

So after the incident with Stephanie I have tried to keep my head down and focus on staying busy to not attract attention to myself. I knew something was wrong but I had no idea what just yet. The best way to find out anything is to gather information so I took on as many work orders as I could around the hospital in hopes of overhearing conversations or witnessing any more strange behavior with the staff.

Over the course of the next few days I didnt see anything strange or off-putting, just more of the same. The staff, nurses and doctors especially, were overly active towards their patients. Instead of ignoring the first alarm or sighing and trudging into rooms they practically bounced out of their chairs or broke conversation mid-sentence to go check on an issue. Is this a bad thing? No, of course not. But it is *different*. Such a drastic change in a short period of time sent off alarm bells in my head. 

Once I had determined that their eager-beaver attitude was key to this whole thing pieces started to fall into place. Maybe I wasnt paying attention to the right conversations before or maybe it took a little time for the wheels to start falling off but by the end of my weekend shift I felt like I knew what was going on.

The first conversations to strike me were about staff sickness and sudden turnover. If you have ever worked in a hospital you know that people get sick all the time and not everyone is cut out to work in such a high stress environment. People fizzle out and quit within days, sometimes not even making it through a full shift. Because of these reasons I didnt immediately take notice of all the talk but it seemed to be everywhere, every department, and not just new hires leaving. A lot of grizzled veterans were just leaving without even calling in or giving notice. The hospital is the top paying in the state so it wasnt hard to find new bodies to fill the positions but with so many new faces running around there was a lot of training to do.

The other conversations were regarding new hire orientation. I didnt get to hear much about this but basically none of the new hires can remember it other than they went to it. They came in and got their badges and met the CEO and their department heads, discussed the hospital values and goals and that is all they can recall. Eight hours of orientation and they can only remember two hours worth the material. I can still remember my orientation and it was eighteen years ago! 

I knew that I had to get to the bottom of this and the bump on Stephanies neck kept flashing across my minds eye so I set out to figure out what it was.

Every opportunity I had I checked peoples necks. I am probably labeled as the weirdo now after following behind closely or giving a fake neck massage to random people. Hey you look tense but I was correct in my assumption. Everyone has that same square lump at the top of their neck, old and new employees alike. I felt my neck, used a mirror to check it, no lump. Was it an oversight? Did I get missed because I was sent to training? I asked around to see if anyone else went to an off-site training and only a few had, but they all had the lump.

I tried to replay the training in my mind. The first day we were given a tour, shown the expansive product line, how they all tied in together. The next few days we worked on some hardware, taking it apart, checking for common issues, that kind of thing. On the last day we had a wrap up, Q and A session and then a long lunch break. Oh! Thats it! I headed down to the center of town to check out a steak place the other guys said was amazing and got stuck down there. Some kind of parade. My car was blocked in for two hours so I never made it back for the last half of the day. That is when they must have put the lump in. So what does it do? What is it for?

I am surprised they didnt realize I was absent. It may only be a matter of time before they know. Maybe they already do.

The rest of the day was less about doing work and more about trying to be around scenarios similar to what I witnessed in the ED. I balanced most of my time between ICU and ED looking for reasons to be there. One older gentleman in ICU was brought in after suffering a stroke at home and was in a bad state. By the time the nurse checked him in and talked with his family for a few minutes he started to look a lot better, his vitals becoming steadier. At the same time I could see the exhaustion and pain slowly creep into the nurses face. Suddenly a seizure ripped through his body and staff went rushing in to help. 

As his vitals spiked and crashed all over the monitors the nurse crashed with him. She lay there on the cold tile floor as others rushed around her to stabilize the man. I ran in and tried to get their attention but no one seemed to hear me. Fearing they would step all over her I scooped her up and brought her out to the nurses station where another nurse did some manual readings like pulse and blood pressure. Her body went into another series of spasms and just as the flat line from the room sounded through the department the nurse in my arms stopped living. 

Each time they tried to resuscitate the man the nurse reacted similarly, as if the paddles were on her chest on not his. Several moments later both were dead. I have seen patients wheeled out on the red gurney, covered in a soft red velvet sheet but never a staff member.

As you can imagine I was freaking out! I followed her and the security guards down trying to get some answers. What the hell happened to her? Why was no one trying to help? Then I realized we were not going to the morgue in the basement but a sub-basement where all of our boilers and other huge, loud machinery is kept. I yelled and cursed at them for answers but they acted like I didnt exist. 

Her body was wheeled deeper and deeper through the maze of pipes and vents until we hit the back wall where a massive furnace was located. What the. NO!

I slammed my body into one of the guards and knocked him down, trying to wrestle the gurney away from the other. I made it a few steps before one was on my back and took me to the ground. I watched helplessly as her body was pushed forward into an orange dancing wall and turned my face, hot tears flowing down my face. 

They left me there, again as though I didnt even exist, and entered the elevator as though they didnt just burn a body. I dont know how long I lay there crying but eventually I stumbled outside and took off in my car until my gas tank dipped dangerously below empty and pulled into a motel. I am writing this now in the hopes that I can warn enough of you to make a difference. Once I submit this Ill be calling the police, FBI, CIA, whatever I can to try and get these psychos shut down. 

I think that lump was a control chip that connected the staff to the patient. I think the staff give their health in order to cure the patients. I think if they fail they die. If you see HealthLink logos at your hospital dont check in. Turn around and alert the police, the media, whoever you can.

	<TEXT> Excellent post and excellent points. I wish I was a better writer to be able to write longer stories. I feel like I either get too bogged down with details and lose the audience or I don't have enough substance and lose the audience. 

Because of this I've fallen into a short, catchy series of posts instead of working harder to get the story to flow properly in order to keep readers for a single, longer one. 

I WANT to try for more single stories in the future.  </TEXT>
