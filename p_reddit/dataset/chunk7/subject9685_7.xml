	<TEXT> So my buddies and I were having a secret Santa party at one of the guys apartments and there were no spots available for me to park in. However, one car was parallel parked in the fire lane area so I decided to pull in behind them. I asked one of the guys that lives there if it was cool and he said that people did it all the time. 
So I go out later to put something in my car and see that my front right bumper and quarter panel are dented. 
One of the guys that lives there saw a text in a group message from a girl that lives there that her friend backed into my car. 
Am I at fault for this or is she?
Should I get her insurance information and file a claim? </TEXT>
