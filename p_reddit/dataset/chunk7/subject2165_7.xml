	<TITLE> The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle - Cuts, Confusion and Maybe Some Clarification? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-27 16:05:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't often post here, please forgive the format or the subject matter, which is probably well-travelled ground, from what I can tell.

So.

I recently finished The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, by Haruki Murakami, and let me tell you, it was a slog. I felt like I was fighting the book to finish it, chipping away for a few months. I first became interested in the book because of multiple posts to this sub in the recommendations thread, so I have all you lovely people to thank, r/books.

I have been reading that there were big cuts (25k words?!) made from the Japanese Hardcover to English version. I have read in a [few] (https://www.reddit.com/r/murakami/comments/2lc9jk/the_english_edition_of_windup_bird_chronicle_is/) [places](http://www.randomhouse.com/knopf/authors/murakami/complete.html) about the "how and why" of the cuts, but not much about the content cut, other than that it was considered expendable by both editor and Murakami. Does anyone have any info as to the content that was removed? I suppose you would have had to read the original, original Japanese and the English. I don't know how slim those odds are.

I ask this because one of the biggest difficulties I encountered was the classic "What the Hell is the point of all this?" A lot of what was happening seemed disjointed. Much came together later, but the first two parts (which I've learned had been cut most) felt very random and, apologies to the author, boring. Toru lurches from one thing to the next with seemingly very little memory for what he was involved with before. "The cat is missing, but oh, now my wife is too. And oh look! Here's this well and a girl, and oh, to hell with that, now I'm some kind of creepy magic gigolo for affluent women." 

Before you think I hated the book, let me say there were parts that I loved: Lt Mamiya's tale was gripping and disturbing, and I loved the characters of Nutmeg and Cinnamon. 

And could someone just help me out: Did he cause, in a dream, Noboru Wataya to have a stroke in reality? Or...what?

In the end, this is probably the most challenging book I've read in some time (I tend to wallow in sci-fi, fantasy and humour) and damned if I didn't love and hate the challenge all at once. I've started on Norwegian wood. Fourty pages in and we've got 1) lost love and 2) a mysterious well, so ... familiar ground.

This post has turned out longer and different than I intended so

**TL;DR** Does anyone want to help me understand exactly what was going on in this novel?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Considering Havana over Christmas, hoping for some suggestions </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We each have some days to use up before year's end, and a non-resort trip to Cuba keeps popping up. I've never been, and she's been briefly, and broke-ly. Heading down over the holidays (23-29). Haven't begun to scratch the surface on research, so I apologize for the basic questions. Just looking for some experienced opinions!

**Stay** - I see Airbnb operates in Havana, with some nice looking properties, and at this point looks like our favourite option. Are there any hotels anyone would recommend? Our budget is moderate, but willing to splurge for something nice. Is Old Havana where it's at?

**Food   Drink** - I've heard the off-resort food in Cuba isn't a great thing, but always from people who only go to resorts. Our tastes run more adventurous, typically, and the more local/authentic/delicious the better! (Unless that isn't a thing) We enjoy a drink or four in the evening, but trend towards pubs over bars/clubs.

**The Sights** - What can't we miss? Should we rent a fancy old car? Beaches? Are they decent outside of the resorts?

 Looking forward to suggestions, and sorry again for the vague/uninformed questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find Lore has a very didfferent tone than M L. As if he is trying to make it more spooky in the telling. I prefer, I don't know how to describe it... Maybe a more "objective" tone in the telling? Still a good podcast, and I'm giving it a chance, but we may part ways.

Edit: And in the interest of equality, I don't like when M L veers of into jokes and disbelief either. Just tell the story! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone wants to go south on woodbine! But that light doesn't care! Then you have the "west on O'Connor" set risking life and limb trying to get into the other lane. It is a mess. 

I'm never a pedestrian at that intersection, and I wouldn't want to be. My sympathies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People turning north from the westbound O'Connor lanes (my frequent choice for travel) also need to learn how to stay in their lane. How many times do I see someone almost get sideswiped because they drift into the left lane. Brakes are hit, traffic slows.

The two eastbound left turn lanes sounds good, since the one through lane becomes a de facto left turn lane once the proper one fills up anyways.

They could save some headaches for people getting onto eastbound O'Connor by revoking the option to turn right onto Greenwood. I've almost rear ended a lot of "blinker impaired" people who hang that quick right with no warning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This could be a great series. I've read the first two books, with the third queued up. The idea of a detective trying to maintain normalcy in the face of almost certain doom a few months away is great. Hopefully they don't run it 22 episodes a season, or else the plot might get a little diluted. 

Also, how exciting is a Roadside Picnic adaptation!  </TEXT>
