	<TEXT> **Abstract**

 This study explores the concern in Epicureanism to create brief renderings of its philosophical tenets. It is argued that although the Epicureans were characteristically apprehensive about simplifying their philosophy so that it would appeal to a broad audience, they utilized literary formats such as epitomes to allow new students and well-disposed outsiders to gain an overview of the philosophy. From around 15050 BCE evidence though emerges that some Epicureans produced heavily abridged and simplistic texts in order to promote the philosophy widely and to ease the induction of new recruits into the school. This study allows the character and intentions of this largely forgotten movement to emerge, and the potential this has for aiding our understanding of the dissemination of philosophy and intellectual ideas in antiquity to be highlighted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many people are busy because they have to in order to be able to barely support their families. Other people are busy because they chase after something which can be interpreted as illusion and forget to live. Near the end of a life full of being busy many realize what they have not experienced and complain about the shortness of life. But most often life is not too short, we are just wasting too much of it. Getting one's priorities straight can be hard indeed.

	<TEXT> I agree that this particular difference is being overstressed quite often indeed, although it is not wrong.

 I believe it's often the Stoics who embraced a rather conservative outlook on society, since the actions of others and the whole social order are in Stoic terms not "up to us".

One has to distinguish between Stoics and those who are interested in Stoicism as a reservoir of self-help strategies. When I write "Stoicism", I mean the ancient philosophy and do not refer to the self-help industry at all. What you attribute to Stoicism may be true to the self-help people, but contradicts ancient Stoicism quite clearly, since we are social animals and have our duties towards society, according to Stoicism. Marcus Aurelius, for example, compares us to limbs of a single body which is humanity. We are just not responsible for other people's actions, but only for our own actions.

 Its interesting that, for example, the Roman Stoic Musonius Rufus claimed that not only men but women too should be educated in philosophy, but (correct me if I'm wrong) no female Stoic is recorded in antiquity.

There are not many sources at all for whole periods of ancient times and there is no surprise that we have no Roman sources in that regard, given the situation of Roman women. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it completely depends on how you use social media in particular and the internet in general. Posting videos and pictures of yourself certainly contradicts the Epicurean saying *"live unnoticed"*, but I don't see participating in /r/Epicureanism as anything an Epicurean should avoid per se. However, don't fall into the trap of posting at reddit.com or elsewhere in order to collect karma.

According to my opinion, it is preferable to reduce one's online activity and be active in only as few sites as it is still possiple to use them virtuously. If there is the choice between posting many short and pointless comments in many forums or only few meaningful comments in few forums, one shall choose the latter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A stone in a shoe is morally indifferent and therefore neither good nor bad, according to Stoicism. Therefore, leaving a stone in the shoe is neither virtous nor vicious. Since not having a stone in the shoe is preferable to having a stone in the shoe, a Stoic will eventually solve the problem, too, although it may be right to say that a stone in the shoe is a lesser problem to a Stoic than to an Epicurean.

On the other hand, a Stoic may use hardships like that for character training (cold showers are more typical than stones in shoes, though). But that does not mean that not solving problems is anything a Stoic subscribes to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my favorite German translation "compulsion" ("Zwang") is used instead of "necessity", which makes the passage more understandable to me. I guess it's a play of words of which we cannot be completely sure what it means, though.

It may mean that you are not forced to endure compulsions, because it's usually possible to avoid many compulsions by retracting oneself from a major part of social life or even to escape them completely by committing suicide. At least there are coping mechanisms for not having to live with compulsions.

I don't know for sure, if I'm right, but that's how I understand the quote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Meditations makes a good entry point,  as does Epictetus's Enchiridion.

I second your recommendations, but I'm not convinced that Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* is good as entry point; at least what I am concerned, my enjoyment of studying it has been increasing along with my growing knowledge of Stoicism. Learning the basics of Stoicism before reading Marcus Aurelius certainly makes sence, according to my own experience. I'd read Epictetus' *Enchiridion* (and maybe some of Seneca's works) first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Anyone comparing payed labor to slavery is laughably ignorant of the truth of the horrors of slavery.

If you are refering to slavery in the south of the USA, you are completely right. In Ancient Rome the situation was much more complex: there were a lot of slaves living and working under extremely horrible circumstances like in mines, but there were also other slaves which can be compared to labor as we know it today indeed. It just depends on what Bukowski is thinking of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Abstract**

 In the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Trojan legend was one of the most popular myths in the European courts, and in the Burgundian court in particular. Thelegend was depicted in numerous tapestries and illuminated manuscripts. This article examines the image of Troy in Franco-Flemish illumination of the fifteenth century. I explore and interpret the iconography of Troy as a mental and semiotic construct linked to such real cities as Jerusalem, Rome, and Constantinople. I will examine images of the real cities and the ways in which they influenced the formation of Troys iconography, a connection overlooked in current scholarship. The research will therefore focus on the permanent architectural and landscape elements borrowed from real cities, which were mythologized and sacralized in the European tradition. Emphasis will be placed on the citys visual representation in the miniatures as influenced by literary materials (i.e. medieval manuscripts containing stories of Troy). My particular interest lies in how the image of Troy evolved simultaneously through a religious and political perspective. That is to say, I will pay particular attention to the cultural codes, the sacred topography and the contexts creating images of the nonexistent city. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think, this makes your position much clearer. I've to admit that I misunderstood your previous comment, too, but now I see your point and agree. Discussing with irrational people in a rational way can be very difficult and exhausting and rarely improves the situation indeed. This is also what I've experienced.

Nevertheless, there are some rare moments when irrational and close-minded people are more open than usual. Carefully and emotionally worded, but otherwise rational remarks (maybe even being placed apparently at random) may eventually show some positive effect. Trying to understand the reason for their irrational believes may help a lot, too. In the case of a close relative or friend there is some chance to help this way with a lot of patience (I've already seen the success of such a strategy). </TEXT>

[**New online ecology of adversarial aggregates: ISIS and beyond**](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6292/1459)

by N. F. Johnson, M. Zheng, Y. Vorobyeva, A. Gabriel, H. Qi, N. Velasquez, P. Manrique, D. Johnson, E. Restrepo, C. Song, S. Wuchty

 **Abstract**

 Support for an extremist entity such as Islamic State (ISIS) somehow manages to survive globally online despite considerable external pressure and may ultimately inspire acts by individuals having no history of extremism, membership in a terrorist faction, or direct links to leadership. Examining longitudinal records of online activity, we uncovered an ecology evolving on a daily time scale that drives online support, and we provide a mathematical theory that describes it. The ecology features self-organized aggregates (ad hoc groups formed via linkage to a Facebook page or analog) that proliferate preceding the onset of recent real-world campaigns and adopt novel adaptive mechanisms to enhance their survival. One of the predictions is that development of large, potentially potent pro-ISIS aggregates can be thwarted by targeting smaller ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cicero was an eclectic, but quite interesting for Stoics nevertheless.

One of Cicero's teachers was Philo of Larissa, the head of Plato's Academy. Consequently, Academic skepticism was also a philosophy Cicero subscribed to. However, he integrated Stoicism in his philosophical views and writings quite substantially and he was influenced by the Peripatetic philosophy as well.

*De Officiis*, which is one of Cicero's most famous and influential works, is said to be based on a book by the Stoic Panaetius. Cicero's work is also quite important, since he is one of our main sources for the philosophy of many Stoics whose works are lost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fully agree with /u/SigmaX about Seneca's *Letters to Lucilius* and have nothing to add. And I love the Socratic style of Epictetus' *Discourses*. These two books and Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations* don't leave many desires unfulfilled.

The *Enchiridion* is great, of course, and certainly the kind of text you may carry with you to have a text about the Stoic core teachings ready all the time. However, I personally think one should at least have read Seneca's *Letters* or *Essays* or Epictetus' *Discourses* first to get the most out of it. The same is true for Marcus Aurelius' *Meditations*. It's one of my favorite books ever, but it's better to already know the basics of Stoicism before reading it for the first time. </TEXT>

There is no broad consensus on how far something we know as meditation today is part of Stoic practice, but it's certainly no large part. Stoics are no Buddhist monks after all. I'd say that mindfulness meditation may fit best. Mindfulness is important to Stoics indeed and mindfulness meditation may strengthen that skill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Among the people I admire there are Christians and also people of other faiths or of no faith at all. I don't admire anyone because of one's faith (or lack of it), I admire good people.

I admire much of Christian art - paintings and sculptures and music like Haendel's oratories and Bach's cantatas -, however, not because of their Christian content (but also not despite it). I am fascinated by old cathedrals. The same could be said about the equivalents of other religions, but I am living in a Christian cultural area and therefore that's what I am familiar with.

The bible is interesting, too. I have read Genesis very often in several translations and that is also true for other parts of the bible. It's more a piece of literature to me than a religious text being the base of my faith, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Renaissance there were a lot of humanists being influenced by Stoicism heavily. Among them were Lipsius and Grotius (I have linked an article by John Sellars about that some weeks ago). Stoicism also had a significant impact in the age of enlightment when a declaration of human rights were written by authors influenced by Stoicism.

Stoicism has influenced a lot of politicians and even kings like Frederick the Great, who is very well known in that regard (I have posted an article about him some while ago). According to his own statements, the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt has studied Marcus Aurelius his whole life. I also remember that Obama named Marcus Aurelius as one of his most favorite books. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I found it interesting that monotheism was embraced by a divine Emporer

You are wrong in virtually all your statements about Stoicism and that's also the case here. Marcus Aurelius did not believe in a monotheistic god, but in a pantheistic one. In that regard he did not differ from all other ancient Stoics we know: all of them did not believe in a monotheistic god.

If you are seriously interested what we are discussing here, you may read a good introduction like [this one](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/stoicism/) or [this one](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoicism/) (both articles are entries of encyclopedias with high reputation). </TEXT>

However, they may eventually ask explicitly for what one stands for or what philosophy or religion one subscribes to.

This isn't only true for Stoicism, but for other philosophies and religions as well. It may be most obvious for Eastern philosophies, where there are some extreme examples in which some Western versions are virtually complete fictions. The wrong labels are highly problematic indeed.

 I am an eclectic who agrees with the Stoics on some important points, and enjoys studying and discussing even aspects I disagree with.

	<TEXT>  Like anything else, watering down stoicism to make it palatable means you are not actually living like a stoic, you're living like you want to.

That is very well said!

 A counter argument is that even if everyone is practicing only half-assed stoicism, that's better than people not practicing it at all.

Usually people pick and choose some methods and teachings from Stoicism, but ignore the rest. I am not against ecclecticism and I agree that applying Stoic methods outside Stoicism can be very helpful indeed (there are even efficient psychotherapies which are based on that). But I see a problem in labelling the result of one's ecclecticism as Stoicism. In my opinion one really should not do that!

 Also practical stoicism is a journey.

I don't think that ancient Stoics would use exactly your words, but the concept is not foreign to them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading Stoic texts regularly has become very important to me, I personally love Marcus Aurelius. His *Meditations* are the result of exactly the spiritual practice which is highly important for a Stoic. This kind of self-reflection helps a lot and we should practice it. Asking oneself what Marcus Aurelius or Epictetus would do can be helpful, too.

We are no Stoic sages, though. We lose focus more often than we should and when we regain focus, we should not be discouraged. Just returning to the path and analyzing the reasons for losing focus rationally helps a lot more than angering about one's failure.

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/9577317/The_Cyrenaics_on_Pleasure_Happiness_and_Future-Concern)

 The Cyrenaics assert that (1) particular pleasure is the highest good, and happiness is valued not for its own sake, but only for the sake of the particular pleasures that compose it; (2) we should not forego present pleasures for the sake of obtaining greater pleasure in the future. Their anti-eudaimonism and lack of future-concern do not follow from their hedonism, nor from their maximizing model of rationality (*contra* Annas), since the natural position to adopt if one has a maximizing hedonism is Socrates prudent hedonism, as described in the *Protagoras*. So why do they assert (1) and (2)? After reviewing and criticizing the proposals put forward by Irwin and Tsouna, I offer two possible reconstructions. In the first, I explain claim (1) as follows: happiness has no value above and beyond the value of the particular pleasures that compose it. Also, there is no structure to happiness. The Cyrenaics are targeting the thesis that happiness involves having the activities of ones life forming an organized whole, the value of which cannot be reduced to the value of the experiences within that life. I explain claim (2) as follows: a maximally pleasant life is valuable, but the best way to achieve it is to concentrate heedlessly on the present. In the second reconstruction, the good is radically relativized to ones present preferences. The Cyrenaics assert that we desire some *particular* pleasure, *e.g.*, the pleasure that results from having this drink now. Thus, our *telos*which is based upon our desiresis this *particular*  pleasure, not (generic) pleasure or the maximization of pleasure over our lifetime. As our desires change, so does our *telos*. I conclude that the scanty texts we have do not allow us to decide conclusively between these reconstructions, but I give some reasons to support the second over the first. </TEXT>

Thus, the Jefferson Bible is interesting regarding the study of Jefferson and his understanding of Jesus, but not regarding the study of Jesus.

Jefferson may have seen something in Jesus indeed, but he had to pick and choose heavily. Concerning Jesus, I think that there may be some proximity to Cynism, but less so to Epicureanism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/25627889/Philodemus_and_Epicurean_Philosophy_Changing_Perceptions)

 This paper focuses on the Epicurean philosopher Philodemus of Gadara (c. 110 BCE to c. 40 or 35 BCE), who lived and worked in Italy during the late Roman Republic. It examines the impact of his works, which were preserved by the first pyroclastic surge of Mount Vesuvius, on our understanding of Epicurean philosophy. Prior to their discovery in the Villa of the Papyri at Herculaneum in the 18th century, knowledge of Epicurean philosophy came from a very small number of extant Epicurean texts or from overtly hostile sources such as Cicero and Plutarch. Extant Epicurean sources, which included the account of Epicurus in Diogenes Laertius Lives of the Philosophers and Lucretius De rerum nature, did not provide a full picture of Epicurean doctrines, while hostile sources actively misrepresented the schools views. Owing to their fragmentary state, many of Philodemus works were little studied until the 1970s when Marcello Gigante began the Centro internazionale per lo studio dei papiri ercolanesi (C.I.S.P.E.). Since then, new editions and new technologies have made these difficult texts more accessible. Material from Philodemus, who wrote on a wide range of topics including death, rhetoric, music, poetry, logic, theology, epistemology, the history of philosophy and ethics, has thus changed perceptions of Epicurean philosophy. They have also provided insight into how Epicureans dealt with the competing claims of philosophy and a Roman context. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  some even referred to it as a "third baptism"

From the [Wikipedia article about Anabaptists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anabaptists#Persecutions_and_migrations):

 Roman Catholics and Protestants alike persecuted the Anabaptists, resorting to torture and execution in attempts to curb the growth of the movement. The Protestants under Zwingli were the first to persecute the Anabaptists, with Felix Manz becoming the first martyr in 1527. On May 20, 1527, Roman Catholic authorities executed Michael Sattler. King Ferdinand declared drowning (called the *third baptism*) "the best antidote to Anabaptism". The Tudor regime, even the Protestant monarchs (Edward VI of England and Elizabeth I of England), persecuted Anabaptists as they were deemed too radical and therefore a danger to religious stability. The persecution of Anabaptists was condoned by ancient laws of Theodosius I and Justinian I that were passed against the Donatists, which decreed the death penalty for any who practiced rebaptism. Martyrs Mirror, by Thieleman J. van Braght, describes the persecution and execution of thousands of Anabaptists in various parts of Europe between 1525 and 1660. Continuing persecution in Europe was largely responsible for the mass emigrations to North America by Amish, Hutterites, and Mennonites. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The teachings of Epicureanism were rather stable during ancient times. There were not as many Epicurean philosophers than, for example, Stoic philosophers who refined and expanded the philosophy significantly.

There were some Epicurean poets like Lucretius and Horatius, though, but I am not sure whether calling them philosophers is correct. If these poets count as answer to your question, I will choose both of them. </TEXT>

[**Early Neanderthal constructions deep in Bruniquel Cave in southwestern France**](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v534/n7605/full/nature18291.html)

by Jacques Jaubert, Sophie Verheyden, Dominique Genty, Michel Soulier, Hai Cheng, Dominique Blamart, Christian Burlet, Hubert Camus, Serge Delaby, Damien Deldicque, R. Lawrence Edwards, Catherine Ferrier, Franois Lacrampe-Cuyaubre, Franois Lvque, Frdric Maksud, Pascal Mora, Xavier Muth, douard Rgnier, Jean-Nol Rouzaud   Frdric Santos

 Very little is known about Neanderthal cultures, particularly early ones. Other than lithic implements and exceptional bone tools, very few artefacts have been preserved. While those that do remain include red and black pigments and burial sites, these indications of modernity are extremely sparse and few have been precisely dated, thus greatly limiting our knowledge of these predecessors of modern humans. Here we report the dating of annular constructions made of broken stalagmites found deep in Bruniquel Cave in southwest France. The regular geometry of the stalagmite circles, the arrangement of broken stalagmites and several traces of fire demonstrate the anthropogenic origin of these constructions. Uranium-series dating of stalagmite regrowths on the structures and on burnt bone, combined with the dating of stalagmite tips in the structures, give a reliable and replicated age of 176.5 thousand years (2.1 thousand years), making these edifices among the oldest known well-dated constructions made by humans. Their presence at 336 metres from the entrance of the cave indicates that humans from this period had already mastered the underground environment, which can be considered a major step in human modernity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I'd start with our [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq). It is not only a very recommendable introduction to Stoicism, it also offers good information about books, translations etc.

That being said, there is an excellent video introduction by Massimo Pigliucci: [Stoicism 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=seLLJP3H1FU). I also enjoy [Gregory B. Sadler's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/gbisadler) which contains a lot of interesting videos about Stoicism. Jan Edward Garrett's [The Stoic Place](http://people.wku.edu/jan.garrett/stoa/) offers a lot of good material, too. [Stoicism Today](http://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/stoicismtoday/) is a good blog with some free courses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/11301216/Epicurus_on_Pleasure)

 The paper deals with the question of the attribution to Epicurus of the classication of pleasures into kinetic and static. This classication, usually regarded as authentic, confronts us with a number of problems and contradictions. Besides, it is only mentioned in a few sources that are not the most reliable. Following Gosling and Taylor, I believe that the authenticity of the classication may be called in question.

 The analysis of the ancient evidence concerning Epicurus concept of pleasure is made according to the following principle: rst, I consider the sources that do not mention the distinction between kinetic and static pleasures, and only then do I compare them with the other group of texts which comprises reports by Cicero, Diogenes Laertius and Athenaeus. From the former group of texts there emerges a concept of pleasure as a single and not twofold notion, while such terms as motion and state describe not two different phenomena but only two characteristics of the same phenomenon. On the other hand, the reports comprising the latter group appear to derive from one and the same doxographical tradition, and to be connected with the classication of ethical docrines put forward by the Middle Academy and known as the *divisio Carneadea*. In conclusion, I argue that the idea of Epicurus classication of pleasures is based on a misinterpretation of Epicurus concept in Academic doxography, which tended to contrapose it to doctrines of other schools, above all to the Cyrenaics views. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the [article](https://www.academia.edu/1038463/Stoic_Practical_Philosophy_in_the_Imperial_Period):

 In what follows what I hope to do is to show the way in which the idea of a *philosophical exercise* played an important role in the understanding of philosophy in late Stoicism. I should stress that my reconstruction  drawing on material from a range of sources  is inevitably somewhat speculative. I should also note that although what I have to say will on the surface look quite similar to what Pierre Hadot has said about *spiritual exercises* in ancient philosophy, there are some important differences between his account and mine. Finally, I should make clear at the outset that the significance of the account I am about to give about philosophical exercises in late Stoicism is due to the way in which it enables us to approach certain late Stoic texts  in particular Epictetus *Handbook* and Marcus Aurelius *Meditations*  in a new light and consequently to re-assess their philosophical significance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Abstract**

 This paper is a plea for hedonism to be taken more seriously. It begins by charting hedonism's decline, and suggests that this is a result of two major objections: the claim that hedonism is the philosophy of swine, reducing all value to a single common denominator, and Nozick's experience machine objection. There follows some elucidation of the nature of hedonism, and of enjoyment in particular. Two types of theory of enjoyment are outlinedinternalism, according to which enjoyment has some special feeling tone, and externalism, according to which enjoyment is any kind of experience to which we take some special attitude, such as that of desire. Internalismthe traditional viewis defended against current externalist orthodoxy. The paper ends with responses to the philosophy of swine and the experience machine objections. </TEXT>

They defeated the Romans near Carnuntum, which is not far away from Vindobona, where Marcus Aurelius died. Then they even got to Italy indeed. For example, they besieged Aquileia and destroyed Oderzo in around 170. </TEXT>

[Metaphysics of the Tea Ceremony: A Randomized Trial Investigating the Roles of Intention and Belief on Mood While Drinking Tea](http://library.noetic.org/library/publication-scholarly-papers/metaphysics-tea-ceremony)

By Dean Radin, PhD, and Yung-Jong Shiah, PhD

 **Abstract**

 Why does mother's homemade soup seem to taste better than what is nominally the same soup extracted out of a tin can? Besides the use of fresher and perhaps more nutritious ingredients, homemade soup offers a component that is absent from commercial soupsmother's nurturing intentions. Do such intentions matter? A previously reported study investigated this question by exposing samples of chocolate, a natural mood enhancer, to focused beneficial intentions, and then testing under double-blind conditions whether people eating the intentionally treated chocolate would report better mood as compared to people eating untreated chocolate from the same source. The study's outcome supported the intention-enhancement hypothesis.

	<TEXT> I assume that the purpose of /u/Eroaster's comment was not to say that enthusiasts should not engage in this subreddit. I think the comment was targeted against misogynism and it reads like being written in rage.

That being said, I am neither happy with misogynism nor with describing lay people pejoratively as armchair enthusiasts, even if it is being done accidentally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just imagination. Hubert Sattler travelled a lot and visited Egypt. During his travels he made sketches and bought photographs which he used to create his paintings at home in Austria. Sattler also toured through Europe showing his paintings in exhibitions. One can see many of his paintings in the [Panorama Museum Salzburg](http://www.salzburgmuseum.at/index.php?id=1830). It's a small museum worth being visited. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoyed your video very much!

That part was certainly meant as joke, but Austrians by far do not eat only Wiener Schnitzel, although it's one of the Austrian's favorite dishes indeed. It is usually eaten with potatoes and rice (some like to eat it with French fries), but never with spaghetti as shown in your excellent video. The traditional Austrian cuisine offers quite a wide range of dishes, many of them have their origin from all over the former monarchy (with goulash being one of the most important examples).

There are also many sweet dishes, for example all kinds of strudel (Apfelstrudel, Topfenstrudel, Marillenstrudel, Heidelbeerstrudel, Zwetschkenstrudel, Nussstrudel, Mohnstrudel etc.) which can be eaten as main dishes or as desserts, warm or cold, optional with vanilla sauce or whipped cream.

I know I have to stop now, your video is about music after all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The two most favorite words of this blogger seem to be "shit" (16 hits), "fuck" and "fucking" (together 16 hits). Although that's certainly not the kind of article I like, I'm completely fine with the fact that different people like different things.

That being said, what did you like about that article and its supposed connection to Stoicism? </TEXT>
