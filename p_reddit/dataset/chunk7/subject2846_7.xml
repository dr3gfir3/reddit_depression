	<TEXT> 900 is about the cheapest we can find. Salt Lake, where I live, is in the middle of a boom, rent has risen by over 200 bucks in the last year. We are repaying phones, but if both were repaid, after fees, taxes, etc the phone bill is still 150. I've looked into replacing phones, T mobile doesn't allow jumping to a cheaper phone once you are in a higher tier. 

The furniture we have is (mostly) secondhand or homemade. The only new things are a TV shelf and a new desk, and a queen sized mattress, which neither of us had beforehand to reuse. We have already sold a car to reduce the cost associated with owning it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey folks. Need advice, and i really have no clue what to do. 

To start, ill give a run down on the sticky situation we are in. I am a college student, and graduation is probably around 2 or 3 years away, before i start med school (hopefully). My wife works a full time job with benefits and an approximate salary of 29,640 or 14.25 an hour. I work, but recently quit my job due to personal injury.

We have a combined credit card debt of about 5,000 dollars, coming from a lack of prudence when buying furniture, housing stuff, etc, when we first got married.

Our monthly expenses are as follows:

Phone bill ~$200

Gas and Electric ~$75

Rent: ~$875, this is the cheapest place we can find, income restricted housing.


Car Payment and Insurance: $~310

Credit card payments total at about ~$150 for everything, and i have one outstanding balance with Verizon that i thought would be covered by our phone company when we switched, but ended up not being covered, which is about $500 dollars, and is in collections.

I get my student loans this week, which is what i was planning on using to ease our burden financially, but i dont know how to spend it. It will be about 2,000 dollars before books, lab equpment, etc, which i think will leave me with around 1600 to 1700 dollars.

Obivously im going to pay off my collections debt before anything else,  and after that, we have 3 credit cards, almost all maxed that need to be paid down. one with a balance of 3000, one with a balance of 1500, and one with a balance of 500. 

My plan was to pay off the 500 dollar card, and as much as the $1500 balance as possible, then using our tax refund to pay off the rest of that and as much of the $3000 balance as possible.

We are trying to work on our credit so we can refinance our car loan, and here is where the plot thickens.

We are upside down on our car loan. We bought a car from Carmax at what was "slightly above market price" and ended up getting royally screwed when we found a few problems that manifested themselves after the initial return date. Long story short, the current loan is for 9000, the car is valued at 5,000.

With all of this, i just need some advice on where to go. My wife might get a raise if she applies for the new position in the company that could put her around 35,000 salary. We have meals planned out and a monthly budget started, but there is just so much that we are starting to feel lost. :/

Any advice would be fanstastic, else this is just a rant of helplessness ha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother is a principal. She once caught one of her first grade teachers dictating test questions and answers to her class, which she said was a huuuuge no no. This teacher, if not for tenure, would have been fired. 

So I would say teaching the test, no. Teaching things like the test, probably.

Note, the test was an official district test that is used for all first graders, and wasn't subject to change. So she was just having them memorize the answers to get better scores to keep her job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, time for round 2! 

First, one of my companions stories. He was opening an area known for macumba (a brazilian religion called candamble, kind of like voodoo, channeling spirits and whatnot) with a disobedient companion as his senior. They get into the home and never bless it. The first two weeks he is there, he wakes up at 3:33 every night. Finally, one night he wakes up like usual, but there is a dark thing standing over his companion. He is too terrified to do anything. His companion wakes up, and sees the thing, and makes eye contact with my buddy. The spirit leaves, they get up, and there is goo all over the other missionary's face. They dedicate the house, he slept well the rest of the transfer.

One of my own, very briefly is meeting who I am sure was a friend of mine from the pre-existence who chose to follow lucifer, in a dream. He was sent to try and invade my body. i remember having a dream of being held under water and then it moving to seeing him. He was naked from the waist up, bald, and had a very evil look to him. Interestingly enough, i had the most spiritual experience of my mission almost directly after this.

A more light hearted one now! At the married housing at BYU, a man and woman were being intimate. The wife was undressed and tied and the husband, wearing the costume of the Gotham Knight, is here to save her. While leaping from the dresser, he hits his head and falls unconscious. The wife is tied and cant help, so starts shouting. A concerned neighbor comes to the rescue, and thus lives this story.

Another one, and i believe this is in an older (i.e. Seventies) Ensign, where it talks about an eye witness to the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum. The reason the body wasnt desecrated was because when the mob approached the body, a man was struck by some sort of lightning, and ran off, and was cursed to run until he died. 

Another, Gordon B Hinkley mentioning that one of the Three Nephites was in attendance at conference.

I think we all know about the White horse prophecy, Cain being bigfoot, some other tidbits that may or may not be legit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I'll go first!

The first is the first MTC story I ever heard. I knew some elders in my zone who were going to Mozambique and they knew elders going to the Congo. Apparently someone knew someone who said careful for voodoo then told them this story.

" Two elders were riding bikes down a road in the middle of the jungle when the one behind hits a rock and falls, breaking his arm. The first elder was aways ahead and when he turned around to look at his companion, there was a shaman who ran out of the jungle, and was standing over his companion. When he gets back to his companion the guy runs back into the jungle. His companion, whose arm was broken, is now healed. They rush to the mission presidents office, who immediately gives the elder a blessing to remove the black magic the man performed on the elder. The minute he ends the prayer, the arm snaps."

If you are doing it right. It should go like this.

Her: "Wow, you play guitar! That's awesome! I wish I could play!"

You: " it is actually not too hard. Here, I will teach you something!"

At this point, you hand over the guitar. Teach them something like a C chord or something else mega basic. You can touch their hands without it being weird. The rest of it will go like this.

Her: "Wow, I'm not very good."

You:" It just takes practice! If you want, I can teach you some more!"

From here, if she is interested in you at all, she will say sure. Set up a meeting, have fun, go on a date, the rest is history.

This has worked more for me than a few times. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not by any means a Trump supporter. I tolerate him at the very most. Regardless, a lot of his economic and refugee policies are not bad. 

The fact that he isnt going to tear down Obamacare completely also has swayed me in to believing that he wont be terrible. If he backtracked a little on abortion, tweaked his tax plan, and decided to reform his immigration stance to include a way to amnesty, then i could see myself rooting for him, and i think that would earn a lot of support from moderates. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but how about taking care of the fucking air quality. Herbert hasn't done shit and it gets worse every year. I had Asthma as a kid and it took moving to Utah for it to flair back up again, to the point that I need steroids. 

At least a Democrat would do something to take care of it, instead of ignoring it like every other fucking politician that waltzes through the governors office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a conservative party came around that was pro science and socially moderate, i would hop on that train.

One of the various problems with Republicans is that they have worked really hard to "brainwash" their base. If any party came along to try and take their place, their media would crush it with their inflammatory stories on websites like the blaze, drudge, etc. They wield this conspiracy laden media sword and the base attacks where the sword points.

I cant remember the last time I had a political talk with my father, a very educated man, and he hadnt mentioned something about Obama being the worst president, or that solar or wind power, or global warming was something that was exaggerated by liberals and their cohorts to make money. 

The claims really have no base, but people eat it up. They pander to a lack of critical thinking and to the poorly educated. They pander to fear and veiled racism and to the "us vs them" mentality. 

The tools to fight the problems we have are the tools they keep from the people. Educated, healthy adults with a little perspective could change the world, but the republicans fight that. Cut education, fight for a lack of health care, and close your ears to anyone who shares an opinion that differs to yours. It is a toxic way of doing things, but it seems to be working for the people who have read into it. 

It took me two years living outside of the US in a poverty stricken country, and coming back to really see how many of our resources we spoil on other wasteful things when we could be helping the citizens of our country.

rant over i guess. I get so upset about this kind of stuff! </TEXT>
