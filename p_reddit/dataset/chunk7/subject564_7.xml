	<TEXT> Hmm.. Just not a fan? I shouldn't have to say this but it seems I must - art is subjective. His music is absolutely art, maybe depressing art, but art nonetheless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very envious of you.  I, unfortunately, only came across his work today..  
I went on a deep dive (4 hours..or more) into his music and was completely blown away.  I listen to a few tracks and was hooked then started reading more about him... The first track I listened to after I read about his death was "Coward". It really hit me hard.  Wish I would have known about his music sooner.  </TEXT>
