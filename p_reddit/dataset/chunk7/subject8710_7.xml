	<TEXT> Damn, that's one long interview. All my life growing up, I've always thought of Real Madrid   Bara as the "biggest" clubs. Because they were. They always signed the superstars and had the biggest revenues. Only recently as in the last few years have we begun to see English clubs as the biggest and it's thanks to the Premier League TV deal. Manchester United having been so successful during England's golden age in Europe (2005-2012) reaped the benefits of that hard. I don't know if Manchester United are bigger than Madrid or Bara but I think there's a lot of aura that surrounds the club from the plane crash in the 50's, to the dramatic treble in the 90's, to Sir Alex and his 20+ years at the club, etc. It's a club shrouded in aura that draws people. </TEXT>

Giuseppe DOnoffrio, a well-respected medical expert, and Sandro Donati, a former athletics coach and an anti-doping legend. Both argued that documents seized from Juventus in the late 1990s were a dead giveaway of blood manipulation, either via EPO or, less likely, 1970s-style blood transfusions. (Both were banned in 1996 and remain so.)

United has the highest debt in Europe and at 400M it's the equivalent to half the worth of clubs like Arsenal, Juventus, etc. What happens when Glazer's decide to sell?

	<TEXT> Sure, let me tell you about Suarez, Ronaldo, Vieri   other transfer records we've broken. Inter has more money than Juventus, always has. Interisti aren't upset about Cannavaro. Thanks for Ibrahimovic, we got 50M   a treble off his sale. 

Let me also tell you about how the FIGC excused Inter from bankruptcy in the 50's. If you ever think Juventus is biggest club in Serie A again, remember this.

Good luck on your 4th attempt at suing the FIGC for damages.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Juventini might not want to admit Inter is more historical   more successful but I wonder what it says when a club legend like Cannavaro shits on Juventus? Cannavaro Interisti confirmed? </TEXT>
