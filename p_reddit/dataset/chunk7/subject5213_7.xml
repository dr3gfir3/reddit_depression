	<TEXT> This was at the Primanti's in Indianapolis.

My first time there I asked if the sandwich came with sides, the waitress smiled and replied "the side are IN the sandwich".  Sold.  Was delicious.

	<TITLE> How do I install an aux in Acura TSX '05 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-26 07:04:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure where to post this, but I really need help. I currently have a 2005 Acura TSX with the original radio/stereo thing. The problem is that this damn car doesn't have an aux port but it has an aux button and it also has XM radio.
I have to drive a lot more now and the radio is driving me insane. I've been looking for ways to fix this but they all seem complicated and I've never split a wire in my life. I don't care for XM radio, it's too expensive anyway. I just want to be able to plug my phone into an aux to listen to my Spotify and never have to hear another radio host again. 

I took out a piece to allow me access to underneath the stereo and I can see 2 wires going into it. (I'll try to provide pics taken to display this)  From what I understand one of them can be unplugged and I could plug a kit into it. It would make the xm radio feature not work, but I don't care as long as I can listen to Spotify through my phone. I'm not even sure what the best thing to buy in this situation is either. 
Any help/advice for someone who knows hardly anything about anything related to cars/wiring?

tl;dr: I have an 05 Acura TSX with no aux port. Need to know the cheapest and most dummy proof way to fix this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably not a popular opinion, but unless you were endangering your parents they should not have kicked out their 16 year old son.  Especially one who had to grow up in an inner city and endure trauma, and unfortunate circumstances that first got you addicted to painkillers.  I'm not saying they should have coddled you, but helped you through it.  

They gave up on you, and as inspiring as your story is -- you could have easily ended up dead.  I don't understand why they couldn't have just laid the law down, gotten tough, tried rehab.  From what I've been reading, you didn't steal from them or harm them in that way. 

I'd recommend writing a letter.  Tell them you don't forget all the things you did back then and pain you caused, and never will.  That you wanting them in your life does not mean pretending those things never happened.  But you want to reconnect and be there son again.  You want your kids to know their grandparents.  If they never want to see you again because of the pain and shame they still feel, you will respect their wishes and go on with your life.  But if they don't want to see you because they believe you're the same addict you were at 16, they're wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was playing World of Warcraft way too late one night, especially considering I had work the next day.  But I was having fun so I went against my better judgement and queued for one more dungeon.  I was playing a druid and there happened to be another druid.. we were both in cat form so I emoted /purr to be funny.  One thing left to another... and we started dating.  We've now been together 4 years now, and have a house and dog.  All from one purr.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've gotten sick numerous time in my life -- usually always from big name fast food chains. Not once has a home cooked meal of tamales or empanadas I bought gotten me sick. I would trust buying ceviche any day from an experienced home cook than a restaurant. This is a dish people have been cooking their entire lives. They know how to safely prepare it.
 
To me this is no different from a bake sale.  I have bought items from bake sales that were for personal gain - not always "nonprofit" causes. To help a student through college. For a Disney World Trip. This is no different than that. </TEXT>
