	<TEXT> The game should absolutely not freeze nor textures fail to load. Did you install the app or are you simply playing the web version?

As for getting 100k+ scores, focus on always having two possible moves after the tile you just did. As you get better at that focus on creating 3+ line combos to get there quicker. </TEXT>

Since then I have been [traveling the world and building games](http://venturebeat.com/2015/10/14/meet-hex-frvr-the-new-puzzle-game-thatll-take-over-your-life/), something that would not have been possible without all of you! So a big unconditional thank you!

Today I finally released version 3.0.0 with translations to 30 languages, new skins, better mobile versions, bug fixes and much, much more! I truly hope you enjoy it.

Happy to answer any questions you might have and would love ideas and feedback for version 4.0.0 :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's single threaded, you have 12 cores in, assuming nothing else than the benchmark ran you should see 8.3% CPU usage due to your beefy CPU.

When that is said, single core performance is quite important as most unspecialised tasks are typically single threaded due to the complexity of building multi threaded applications. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, realworld is quite fare away from benchmark, simple things like the quality of the software and on desktop how good you are at keeping your computer clean mens a lot.

When that is said, I for once is excited that ARM chips are getting into the territory where they start being true competitors to Intel as AMD don't seem to be able to keep the pressure on Intel to keep innovating as fast as they used to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Using Geekbench 4, single threaded, we can see that [your computer](https://browser.primatelabs.com/processor-benchmarks) scores 3549. Comparing that to the old iPhone [iOS benchmarks](https://browser.primatelabs.com/ios-benchmarks) (no iPhone 7 yet) we can see that the A9 in the iPhone scores 2400. Give that a ~40% increase in performance we get ~3360 as expected score for the A10/iPhone 7.

Assuming the A10x gets the same performance improvements as the A10 you should expect the next iPad Pro to be about 20% faster than your desktop computer for single threaded applications.

On the plus side, your desktop CPU will still kick it's ass for multithreaded applications.

This experiment, and those of contemporaries like Louis Pasteur, confirmed that many diseases are caused by microscopic organisms. Microbes, which had been largely neglected for a couple of centuries, were quickly cast as avatars of death. They were germs, pathogens, bringers of pestilence. Within two decades of Kochs work on anthrax, he and many others had discovered that bacteria were also associated with leprosy, gonorrhoea, typhoid, tuberculosis, cholera, diphtheria, tetanus, and plague. Microbes became synonymous with squalor and sickness. They became foes for us to annihilate and repel. Today, we know this view is wrong... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's worth noticing that flying was quite expensive back then, an economy ticket easily cost the same as a business/first class ticket would in todays money. 

At those prices people expect great service and good food. [Here](http://www.pointsmd.com/flight-review-cathay-pacific-first-class-hong-kong-hkg-new-york-jfk/) is a rundown of the experience you can expect if you feel like spending $3k+ on a ticket.

On Apple nothing is required but they do generally care about their new features and initiatives, but it's just a multiplier on your chances, your game still needs to be good. Go implement with the Apple Watch, Replay Kit, or similar to increase your chance currently. Likewise, remember it's humans on the other end, they will be influenced by description, art, music, etc. Do what you can here to get an edge, such as embedding an image in the email to Apple and link to a video of gameplay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oki, you are looking at a fairly young audience then. Closer to my [Hex Game](http://hex.frvr.com) than my [Solitaire](http://solitaire.frvr.com) and [Mahjong Games](http://mahjong.frvr.com/alc/).

**For those your primary install sources are going to be**

* Getting featured, yes this is possible. Even crazier is that people typically get their first Apple feature by simply emailing appstorepromotion@apple.com (Yes people actually read that thing)
* Social sharing, if you look at games in your category, social sharing is how the game becomes super big. Make it easy for people to share on Twitter, Sina Weibo etc.


**Paid acquisition**

* For this type of game, this is a perfectly valid strategy, but only if the social sharing component work. E.g. if you on average get 4-5 installs per paid user. A great way to test this is to go crazy in a under performing territory. For Denmark + Island for instance I was able to bring [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) to #1 app by spending less than $1000 on each.
* For larger markets, you want to use paid advertisement as a booster. If the game is going viral in an area, use your money to boost that virility. I did this in for  [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) in Taiwan, where I moved the app from #5 to #1 in the iOS app store, again for less than $1000 USD.
* Facebook ads, Facebook ads, Facebook ads. Ad your budget level, this is pretty much the only source that is likely to work for you.

**Other feedback**

* Add an easy to compare level of measuring success. Games for younger audiences are typically driven by competition. Getting to 2048, having the highest flappy birds score, etc.
* Make sure your game is easy to find in the App Stores, preferably with a one keyword search. E.g. AA, 2048, Flappy etc.

* You get 25 points for removing any set of points
* You get a bonus for clearing the board with tiles left over. First tile is 50 points, second is 100, third is 150 and so on.
* You loose 30 points for using undo.

To get the best score, simply complete the game with as many tiles left over as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I implemented a function that given a seed always returns the same sequence of pseudo random numbers. I then use the current day offset as the seed and feed the random numbers into a custom level generator that creates resonantly good mahjong level geometry. 

As for the tiles, I randomize those when you restart a level (to ensure people don't get stuck) by simply randomly removing two tiles at a time to the board is cleared, and assigning them the same random tile face.

As my heuristics for generating the random level geometry is a bit specific, and the amount of tiles on the board is limited, I actually only have about 235000 unique levels. I did however ensure players will not get the same level inside a sequence of 1000 levels, so you will have to play more than two years back before risking seeing your first repeat. </TEXT>

[LiveStreetMedia](http://www.lifestreet.com) has a pretty neat display network for this type of content.

Likewise as you have a shop you could use reward videos as an alternative to payment "pay now or watch video" alike. Take a look at supersonic.

Also I could totally see roTopo game do well on mobile. Although you should smoothen the tutorial such that it skips levels if you play perfectly. I found it to easy up to the very end and would not have continued if I was not playing it after stalking your comment history.

It really needs a UI design refresh though, it's confusing and very programmer art alike, very much not something the audience who plays this type of puzzle game likes. Your inspirations should be monument valley, two dots, three, alphabear etc.

	<TEXT> Great question and not rude at all! There is multiple answers to that question.

1. I really like puzzle games myself. I casually joke that I am a 45 year old american woman inside. 
2. I find the activities involved with building a company rewarding. Releasing the games, seeing users flow in, doing marketing, PR, etc. 
3. I take great pride in polishing the games, making sure it lives up to peoples expectations.
4. It's still pretty fun to code, beats doing websites any day.
5. The games are still very much my own. It's like saying your new car is not yours because it's not unique.

Lastly, I also do unique games such as Hex FRVR and there are more of that type of content in the plans down the line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was referring to their ability to run WebGL in the mobile browser. A lot of my users come from people playing the web version on their phone, then installing the full app.

This is where the engine size comes in as well. Application size from something in the app store is not super important. However when people share a link to the game, you want the game playable ASAP. 

All my games are playable and running after loading less than 400kb of data. Giving me an average load time of just [below 3 seconds](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ck1n3gbide806i/Screenshot%202016-07-02%2017.18.03.png?dl=0). In tests I losse about 10% of users for every extra second the content take to load. People really do not have any attention span. This is also why I dump people directly into the game, rather than showing them a menu screen.

In short, Unity3D is not ready for the kind of web games I do, I wish it was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Using a game engine is a really good idea. Quite honestly you should never be writing a game engine yourself. [I talk at length about this here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/107990203647/manning-up-and-taking-my-own-advice). However now where I do have the resources to pay other people to do it, it's quite reasonable to get something build just for FRVR.
2. [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) was original.... until all the clones kicked in. However it just so happens that game mechanics cannot be [copyrighted](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/273935/Texas_court_affirms_game_mechanics_not_protected_under_copyright_law.php). This is a good thing btw, otherwise the gaming world would be dominated by the EA's and King.com's of the world. For something like Solitaire and Mahjong, those games pre-date the internet and even computers, so even if there was a copyright it's long expired by now.
3. I just wrote the website in vanilla HTML.
4. For the first half year of FRVR I had a full time job paying my bills. Likewise I saved up for 2 years to be able to quit without being particularly worried. Likewise, something like FRVR can relatively easily be build during a few hours every night.  It helps that I watch very little television.
5. Not really no, my work here is based on years of experience with game development and javascript. (My first real job was to build multiplayer javascript games. This was in 1999 before HTML5, Firefox, Chrome and pretty much anything that makes the internet what it is today.)

[Edit] As for Unity3D the WebGL support they have would not fit my needs. Their core library is about 3x the size of my entire games including art and music. Even worse their exports do not work on Mobile. It will likely be fine in 4-5 years when phones are faster and Unity's exporter is better. But for now I get to have a bit of a competitive advantage. </TEXT>

Here is the randomiser code in all it's glory. You get easier to use tiles when your score is low and the game becomes slightly harder as you score rises.

    var rnd = scoreValue*Math.random()
    if(rnd10000    Math.random().5){
    	//Less than 10k All except two evil (50% of the time).
    	type = Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-2)0
    }else if(rnd50000){
    	// 10k Add in half moon tile
    	type = (Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-1)0)
    }else if(rnd100000){
    	// 50k Cut out the 1 tile
    	type = (Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-2)0)+1
    }else{
    	// 100k Add Cross tile
    	type = (Math.random()*(tileConfig.length-1)0)+1
    }

Your just getting better at the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ideas are a dime a dozen, it's all in the execution. If you are an execution guy you could deconstruct my business model from observation in a few days anyway. My hope is to motivate more people to get going - likewise the market I operate in is hyper saturated already, one or two more players are going to do nothing to my chances of success.

Well that totally depends on conversion rate, price per game etc. It's very likely I would have done better by now with a paid mobile app. I have about 1.5m installs in total. Had I managed to get about 12% of that to pay $.99 I would have made the same amount of money in total. However it would be a much more hit driven business where I would be dependent on cranking out games frequently. I like passive stable income a lot more.

	<TEXT> 1. The majority of revenue comes from mobile ads. I have indeed considered other revenue streams but is very carefull to not alienate my userbase. All of FRVR is focused on long term growth, making money now is less important than making money over the next 10 years. For instance I do not run video ads, nor do I show ads to new users playing the games. While I do allow people to disable the ads with a micro transaction (about $2k of revenue I forgot to report in the blog post), I don't believe the quality and complexity of the game is good enough to charge for. 
2. Mobile is such a better eco system. People already have their credit card on file and Apple/Google has done an amazing job of educating users that it's ok to pay for digital content. I am on the tail end of that, having users that can be moved into better paying games. In the long run you could imagine FRVR building some high quality paid games and using the potential ad traffic to directly monetise the user. This could increase revenue 3-4x but is currently out of scope.
3. It's a risk reward consideration. Look at Solitaire on the blog graph. It's low revenue but incredibly stable. That's the kind of revenue I want right now (I want 10+ of such). Stable, dependable, long-term.
4. Yes, I believe (Untested assumption) that for my type of games it's a waste of time. I want less interaction with the users not more. This is also a big reason I do not do paid games, as it comes with a huge overhead in fraud   support.

I will take free distribution any day, even if it does not directly generate revenue. Hosting is a fractional cost these days and it's still [building the brand](https://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=frvr). You are so much better off being everywhere than trying to be monopolistic - the exception is of-couse people who straight up steal the game or parts thereof. (I have taken down more than 200 mobile apps that did this to date) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the in-depth, [annotated list of the tools I use to build FRVR](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/136256124252/the-tools-i-use).

As for initial traction, it's all web based by old Flash websites that now also distribute HTML5 games. Try [this Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=%22mahjong+frvr%22) and see how many websites already carry the game. Most of the sites have minimal traffic, but together it's substantial (10k DAU+).

Likewise, I try to release everywhere the kind of user who will play my game exist. E.g. it would make little sense for me to release on steam.

The success of Hex FRVR was pretty huge for me, it grew the game from ~$50/day to about ~$150 a day pretty early on in the release of the game. However it dwindles in compared to the game going viral on Chinese twitter clones. That's when the game shot about 1k USD / day. </TEXT>

I am not on windows mobile as I don't think the effort would be worth it just yet. However when I have more games it might make sense.

* [Play Mahjong FRVR as Google Chrome App](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/mahjong-frvr/ifjbgjmaflfjiffgalgflmnhibhgbbeo)

Saying that you can still be lucky. [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) grew quite a lot based on social sharing on Chinese twitter clones. The html5 nature of the game allows this, but it was a channel I help create. However games released with the latest version of the shared components now have localised share opportunities based on language. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pixi was a quick way for me to gain easy WebGL usage with good canvas fallback. However in the latest Pixi releases the canvas fallback has become less and less a priority for the engine. This is really concerning to me as major handset operators in china such as Xiaomi are still selling handsets without WebGL support in the millions.

Likewise drawing a vein diagram of what Pixi can do and what we really want to be able to do we only get about 85% overlap. I would really like to dip into some 3d embellishments for card flipping but I have no need for the way Pixi handles high DPI screens.

Overall Pixi is 100% the right choice for someone starting out but as with any tool you might end up outgrowing it.

An important note here -- It's more about the distribution than the game. You can still do the games you want to do, you just really need to understand where to find the users for it.

One smart thing I did was write a small script that scraped google for smaller game sites, then hired a guy on upwork.com to collect contact information from the sites. This list today has more than 5000 emails and as people reply I move it over into the verified contact list.

No I do not make any money from the web versions of the games. They do however aggressively promote the mobile versions, see for instance the sidebar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I have run minor paid ads experiments, I have yet to do so cashflow positively. I get my traffic from free organic channels. To that end FRVR games are build specifically in HTML5 to be easy to distribute. 

If we look at [Mahjong FRVR](http://mahjong.frvr.com) which has only [been live for 14 days](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/146701550847/mahjong-frvr) the major traffic sources are:

* iFrame embeds from 2291 unique domains (I allow my games to be embedded into 3rd party websites - [Example](http://www.gamesgames.com/game/mahjong-frvr))
* Social sharing (The game is easy to share as it's just an url)
* SEO - Traffic from google as a result of people searching for other FRVR games.

	<TEXT> My revenue sources are as follows

*  $32,123.21 from [LiveStreetMedia](http://lifestreetmedia.com) (Facebook Ads)
*  $134,633.97 from [Google Admob](http://apps.admob.com) (Mobile Ads)
*  $7,166.74 from [Facebook audience network](https://www.facebook.com/business/news/audience-network) (Mobile Ads)

I specifically do not run advertisement on the online web versions of the game, rather I use those as a way to generate mobile installs where the revenue potential is much higher. The only exception to this is the Facebook apps as Facebook do send huge amounts of free organic traffic to high recency content (which my games are).

Likewise I have taken a lot of choices focusing on increasing longevity of users rather than immediate monetisation.

* No video ads (Would likely increase revenue with up to 100%)
* No ads are shown to new users for about 30 minutes (It's better to have a user return than make money right now)

Money is generated by pure volume. I do about 2.2MAU/170DAU, in that context I make almost nothing compared to some of my competitors. However for me it's all about the long game, building a big userbase that are addicted to a large set of core FRVR games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2) Yea for levels you already played it's a non issue

3) It should be fairly easy to re-introduce, I will play with it. A interesting note here is that you actually do not even need to rotate the tiles. You simply need to re-arrange them.

As for payment vs ads, I mostly introduced the option because people kept complaining about them. However for heavy users I believe it's a better business for me to keep the ads, but I just could not get myself to make it more expensive. (For someone playing for years, I would need to charge $10+ to break even).

Also I decided against the recommendation of disabling the game when the ads are not loading. So if you are using a ad blocker or have no internet, there will be no ads but the game will still play. </TEXT>

2) I will look into this, it is however a bit computationally heavy as I use a bunch of math to generate the individual levels, rather than hand making them.

3) I originally had this, but it feels really strange when tiles un-luck in the wrong direction (From bottom and top, rather than the sides). Likewise the game is not the same if the tiles are unlocked from the sides. I am thinking of releasing another mahjong game, simply to also have a portrait mode gameplay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah yea, a good time based lock stepped physics simulation that runs similar on server and client will get you really far. 

Be aware that you might get small changes in the simulation due to diffrent processors doing floating points slightly differently.

The fun stuff is then compensating for other players lag using interpolation between updated coordinates and actual coordinates. [this should help](http://www.gabrielgambetta.com/fpm3.html)
