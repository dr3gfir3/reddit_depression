	<TEXT> got inspired by a previous reddit entry (http://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/39l747/beetroot_and_gin_cured_gravlax/) and thought I'll try it myself. It is super easy to do.. now I wait!

	<TEXT> "... he wants the app company to direct users to more major thoroughfares instead of sending them through residential streets ..." - does the guy understand the purpose of waze? The next step probably is to propose toll on residential streets. 

Anyhow, waze could use some improvement. How about teaching the app to not make you take a left turn on a six lane street without a traffic light? </TEXT>
