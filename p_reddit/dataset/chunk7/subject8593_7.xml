	<TEXT> Thank you so much! :) Ah, good question! When designing the bunnies I really wanted to keep the face area as simplistic as the bodies just to keep a balance, as there's always a lot going on in their ears and around their necks. An embroidered nose cluttered up the top of the bunny too much. Plus, rabbit noses are often pretty much hidden with them resting a little bit under a flap of skin. I figured the triangular point of the head seam mimicked the 'v' shape of a bunny's nose well enough just on its own. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear that you're in a fight with depression. I, too, had been battling it all my life, unknowingly until I was diagnosed. It's good to hear that you're starting to be able to manage it though, it's not easy. /hugs 

I do sell them. :) They're all here in etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/thetinyteaparty
And I take custom orders if there's nothing there that takes your fancy.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so happy that these were able to make you smile. :) You should definitely give sewing a go, it's very theraputic to watch something transform in your hands. I was terrible when I first started - I had absolutely no experience in sewing at all - but I just kept at it through determination. 

If you ever decide that you do want to get into plush making and need some help getting started, just pm me! 

And I wish you the best with getting through the tough times. /hugs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I understand it might not be immediately clear to other people how much materials cost and how many actual hours of work go into the plushies. A 6 inch bunny at 25 costs me 8 and six hours of work to create. A bigger and more complicated plush like the Pokemon/Ponies, can cost up to 20 in materials and can take me 24 hours of work when the shifts are combined. 

(This doesn't included the weeks of work I spend drafting and proto-typing my plush patterns before I can put them on the market.)

This is my only income, and so I treat it like a full time job. Most of the time I'm not even meeting half of minimum wage. There are some plush artists out there who often charge two or three times the amount I do for a similar product.

I appreciate your honesty though. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much! I do sell them, I have an etsy shop: https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/thetinyteaparty :) I was finally able to quit my horrible job (that was making my depression worse) a few months ago and take the plushing full time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much! Honestly, I came to plush making with absolutely zero experience in sewing. It was a long, steep learning curve, but once you've made a couple of plushies from some simple free patterns and got a hang of the basics, the rest just follows. :) You should give it a go! If I could do it, I'm sure other people can too! 

(And if you're stuck for where to start, what patterns to begin with, what fabric to buy as beginner etc etc, just pm me!)

I do sell them! I've actually recently been able to quit my horrible retail job and do the plushing full time. :)
