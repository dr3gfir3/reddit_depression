	<TEXT> We typically schedule in 30 minute increments. I work with three doctors and they sound similar to yours - one typically moves quickly and is usually out early and rarely out late; one is pretty consistently on time and occasionally runs over; the other runs over most times. It's not perfect but I think by scheduling 30 minutes, it evens out over the course of the day! </TEXT>
