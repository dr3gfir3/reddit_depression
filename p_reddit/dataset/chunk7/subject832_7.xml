	<TEXT> A friendship where I don't feel like I'm an impostor. Or where I feel they are going to turn around and say 'wait, how did I end up friends with you, you aren't who I thought you were at all!' when they realise I'm a fake.
A friendship where I feel I can bring up my own conversation topics without being judged, instead of leeching off theirs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worry a lot that I don't know who I am socially. Whoever I spend time with, I assess what they mind find funny or want to talk about and assume that role. I only ever try to fit in with others by blending in to their image, but I never feel like I belong. 

What am I really like? I don't even know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is EXACTLY how I felt about the whole thing. Still basically undecided even as I was stood in the booth with the slip in front of me; went with my gut and said leave. I had done a ton of research and for all the fear mongering that was going on I couldn't see many positive reasons to stay, only 'look at all this terrifying shit that will happen if you leave'. 
There's no reason England cannot do well on its own. Change breeds progress! </TEXT>

I feel like I irritate my boyfriend a whole lot. He's away on business right now and I am losing my mind but trying to to text him every second of the day because I will annoy him if I do that.

If you want to PM me ever, please do. We sound like kindred spirits! </TEXT>
