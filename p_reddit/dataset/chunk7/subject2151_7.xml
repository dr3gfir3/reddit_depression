	<TEXT> Using "you" or "you're" in those cases is just improper grammar. One should say "I hate it when one is driving and one hits a pothole." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aloe "vera" is a lie. It's Aloe barbadensis, which is in fact less helpful than Aloe arborescens for all those things you want it to do consumption-wise. The "vera" part means "true aloe" which is a marketing ploy, because that aloe (A. barbadensis) is far easier to produce and is bulkier, thus more weight to sell.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like you want a lot for nothing. The places you're looking for at that price will not have Wifi, hot water, nor free drinking water. You're obviously American, everything there is cheap by comparison, so why don't you just go and live it? And why in the world would you want to go to Guatemala/Central America just to talk to other Americans? Talk to the people there! It will help you work on your Spanish and you'll enjoy it more.  </TEXT>
