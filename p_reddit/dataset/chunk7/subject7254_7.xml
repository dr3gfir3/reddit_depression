	<TEXT> Something similar. Some of my first games for Xbox One were SoM and Alien: Isolation. 

SoM makes me feel like a god every time I play it. Alien however... I never know if I'll survive or not. 

It's a constant cycle of feeling unstoppable to feeling helpless. I can't play one right after the other </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right in that it doesn't affect the argument for it's legality. We would still have the same arguments. I'm simply saying that I don't know whether or not being sexually attracted to your own gender is a choice or not. Nobody really *knows*. It could be genetic, or it could be a subconscious psychological choice. 

I truly do believe that who you *love* is absolutely a choice. Whether it be Romantic or platonic. It's still love. It still means the same thing. Romantic love just has the added perk of sex lol. 

I love several guys. But it's all platonic. They're my boys. I love several girls. It's all platonic. They're just my friends. I'm *in* love  with one girl. God I wanna have sex with her haha. 

However, if gay marriage were legalized, I could just as easily choose to marry one of my bros, one of my female friends, or that girl I'm in love with. Marriage is a choice. Love is a choice. Sexual orientation is up in the air.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I meant about choosing what you're attracted to lol. I'm not sure if people do choose that. They do choose whether or not to act on it. 

It's similar to how it's not illegal to be a pedophile, but it is to be a child molester. As long as you don't touch the kid, under the law you're fine. 

Right now, in most states, if gays got married somehow, it either wouldn't be legal or they would get in legal trouble. 

Besides, even as a straight guy, I can still look at a dude and say, "Man, you're not that bad looking. No homo." As in I can see aesthetically how women or gay men would find them attractive, though I don't myself </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At this point, I can't think of one. I'm Catholic and I agree the only arguments against gay marriage are religious or moral in nature. In fact, politically, it could be a *good* idea. 

More adoptions, tax benefits, sharing finances, etc. 

I go by the stance of, "They can get married if they want to. I'm just not gonna marry a dude." </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> She's a very good friend of mine. We love watching scary movies together, so I figured I'd show her what it's like to be IN one. 

She's adorable, blonde, 16, and very sweet looking. 

I get to the point where you choose Crew Expendable, I'm like, "What mode should I choose?" 

She says, "Do Nightmare! Haha!"

I played one time, died, yelled, "Oh crap!" And she's just looking at me and laughing. 

Then I said, "it's different when you're the one playing."

She takes the controller, puts on the headphones. It's dark in the room we're playing in. She dies almost right after the first airway lockdown. Goes out the door and the Xeno is there. I tell her maybe she could throw a flare to distract it. Draw it into the room so she could make it through the hallway. 

Gets to the same point. Lights flare, door opens, couldn't figure out how to throw it (I didn't explain well enough lol) Xeno gets her. 

Third time, she goes through the hallway, nearly makes it to the second vent lockdown before the Xeno got her. 

Not only was she not scared... She was good. 

It was pretty attractive lol. She wants to play more. 

We're gonna start playing story mode together. 

TL;DR: Don't judge a book by it's cover </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so I wash my gens thoroughly. However I cannot shave down there. I tried twice before. The first time, after it was over, I was like, "I should have done this *years* ago!"

The next day it itched like a motherfucker. Swore I'd never do it again. 

Two months later, I do it again. Same story. 

TL;DR: Trim your bush, don't set it ablaze </TEXT>

Seriously just act like yourself, as cliche as that sounds. Girls love a few things *almost* universally:

1. Humor

2. Passion for a hobby/sport etc. 

3. Someone to hold an intelligent conversation with. 

Just like talk about your passion. If they're interested, they'll eat it up.

Maybe in a few years when we both mature a bit. We both care about each other a lot, and I still find her insanely attractive. 

Today she changed her hair color.
