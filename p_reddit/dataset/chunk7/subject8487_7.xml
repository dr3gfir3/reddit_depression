	<TITLE> Remote controlled fans </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-21 03:15:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have several fans (Lasko brand) that are remote controlled.  There is no hard on/off switch.  You plug it in, it's always off until you turn it on vs. the kind that you could turn a hard switch on, plug it in and it would start spinning.  

My question is: does anyone know of a work-around with Alexa and a smart-plug?

I'd like to be able to voice-control it.  

My guess is, I'll need to wait for fan tech to catch up.  

Thanks peeps.  </TEXT>
