	<TEXT> When I was in school, we had a teacher called Mr. Green. He was old, doddery and looked like a turtle. He was brought out retirement, and we used to call him Hans after Hans Moleman from the Simpsons, as he was his doppleganger.

He used to do crazy shit experiments with us, such as lighting magnesium strips on fire and then seeing what happened when you doused them with diesel. I doubt he knew much about health and safety, but he was fucking awesome.

One day, he made us mix some lethal acid with some other chemical shit and observe a reaction. He did this with a bunch of 12 year olds, high on blue food colouring and coca cola, it was bound to go wrong. Well some little dickwad knocks over this acid shit all over Mr. Greens wooden stool accidently. Our chemistry stools had dips in them, shaped for your butt, so all the acid collected in them.

Mr Green always wore plastic-y rubbery trousers that looked like they were for fishing. Because he was so old and pretty unaware of his surroundings, he accidently sat in this stuff. I remember, to this day, him standing up, looking at pieces of his plasticy, rubbery trousers disolving, his saggy old man arse hanging out, proclaiming to the stunned class ''Oh No, I sat in Acid.'' </TEXT>
