	<TEXT> I think there is sometimes a perception that we're stingy or come to a store to just look at the testers. I also come from a smaller Midwest place, so I guess that's more common? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry that happened to you! Unfortunately a lot of makeup counters people are super judgemental when it comes to looks. there had been multiple times when I have walked into a makeup store and not been helped even when i explicitly ask. A lot of them have been accompanied by whispers of "She's Chinese so she's probably not going to buy anything." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I meant that there have been several reviews talking about a bug that made it seem that all their reminders were wiped and started them on the app like a new user.

Regardless, thank you for your help! I think Alarmed would be a better option for me since I really enjoy having the timeout function on the auto snooze actually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can someone with experiences with both apps tell me which one they prefer for reminders? The two apps seem to have very similar functions. While Due is productivity cult favourite, it seems that the newest updates have been erasing user profiles and that seems like a frustrating experience. However, Due has a Mac client while Alarmed doesn't? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is pretty much how i found mindcrack. Yogscast, captainsparklez and the machinima group, seth, etho. For a while I've pretty much stopped watching content from anyone but mindcrack and friends, but lately since they're doing more and more videos with people like Parv and Captainsparklez, I've gone back to watching yogscast again. It has come full circle. </TEXT>
