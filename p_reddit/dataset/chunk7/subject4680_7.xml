	<TEXT> I can't remember which writer but someone said the natural path to take is poetry, short stories, then novels. 

But I think the important thing is to read a lot. Learn how writers function and deliver their messages. It's important and it'll teach you a lot. And besides. Referencing other works will make your life easier because it can clue readers into what themes you're talking about. 

Sorry to ramble. But that's my advice.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First review! Just happens to be what I'm smoking rn so I thought I'd share. 

Fruity Pebbles
Hybrid
THC 19.61%/CBD 0.06%

Flavor
Fairly tasty. It has a fairly fruity flavor that smells good and the smoke goes down pretty smoothly. 
[7/10]

Looks
I actually think this strain is really pretty. It's mostly green, but pulling it apart reveals bits of purple hidden within. Looks beautiful in my bowl. 
[8/10]

High
I liked it! The high crept up on me. I didn't realize I was getting really high until I already was, which, at least for me, made the session pretty smooth. The high made me and my SO incredibly relaxed and at ease. At first we were acting really goofy but before I knew it I was lying in bed and my muscles were so relaxed I couldn't feel them anymore. Thought it was a shockingly good high.
[8/10]

Overall
Pretty damn good, really. I bought it because I was at a dispensary and my SO got all excited about the name. I didn't expect it to be all that good but I liked it quite a bit. Would recommend.

	<TEXT> Story time. 

Not about my SO, but actually about me. On one of our first dates (I think the third) and I was freaking the fuck out because I was really into her and our previous dates had gone... Poorly. So I wanted to do this right. I tried to be romantic. I cooked her dinner with her favorite meal and she wanted to show me a movie she loves. So we ended up in my dark basement watching Silence of the Lambs. I was way too nervous to pay attention to the movie. We're cuddling up and I thought I should give her a compliment and so I turned to her, in the middle of a dialogue with Hannibal Lector, and say "You have such soft skin." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello!

It was always a passion of my family to host parties and a big part of that was bartending. My dad was an incredible bartender in his heyday and I always admired it. Now I am 21 and want to carry it on. Problem is I don't know shit about what booze to get. 

I'm a broke college kid but I've got a little money to spend. How do I maximize the amount of drinks I can make while going on a budget. If it helps at all I really love rum and my wife really loves vodka so we'd be willing to splurge for those. 

Thank you so much. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys! 

I came up with an idea for a deck but i need help creating it because I know jack-dittely shit about the class I'm thinking about here.

My idea was for Illusion Rogue, or a control rogue archetype build around Violet Illusionist. Basically, the idea is to use Violet Illusionists to make your weapons into an incredibly powerful and cost-effective removal tool. Deadly Poison plus Violet Illusionist turns your dagger into a three damage removal with very little drawback. 

So far I've played one game with the following decklist but I know NOTHING about rogue so I need help building this up. Anyone willing to assist?

Here's the list

I'm gonna be totally honest and say that I'm pretty sure this subreddit is kind of... Confused. If you look at its sidebar info, it has some ideas mixed up. Maybe a little delayed in their timeline. 

Their timeline states that Modernism was sort of the advent of seeking trough through science, but actually Modernism was a very specific break from that mentality. It rebelled against the truth-seeking Enlightenment thinkers and discussed subjectivity. For examples, see Nietzsche, Sartre, or literary examples such as Woolf or Faulkner, even Joyce, all as evidence that the Modernist movement was largely about subjectivity of truth, which the subreddit claims is the idea that Postmodernism focuses on.

If we remember way back to the Idea Channel episode on Community, we find that Postmodern is about meta-narratives, which is what most of this subreddit seems to be discussing. 

If you ask me, which you probably shouldn't because I'm just an English major whose knowledge of philosophy is mostly surface level, I'd say that post-postmodernism does exist in the world and that there are several philosophical and artistic movements rebelling against Postmodernism in the same way that Postmodernism rebelled against Modernism before it, and so on and so forth into philosophical history ad infinitum, but it seems more like this subreddit is filled with Postmodernists who are a little confused about the definition of Postmodernism.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Farmhouse </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-27 11:30:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello r/paranormal. 
I've been wanting to share my experience with the internet at large for a long while and I finally found this subreddit.

My family owns a farmhouse out in the middle of nowhere. There are two houses nearby, one of which we share a fence with. Otherwise it's just farms as far as the eye can see. 

One day extended family and all were hanging out there when we heard a scream and a gunshot. I can't be certain of what exactly went down because I was in the basement. My uncle, a veteran, ran down into the basement where I was taking care of the younger kids (I was about sixteen at the time) and told me to stay down there and away from windows. 

Me and my brother and our cousins pretty much cowered in fear in the basement until my dad came downstairs and told us it was okay to come up. There were a shitload of police officers at the house next door. Turns out the lady next door had locked her daughter in her room and held the husband at gunpoint for a few hours before she noticed her daughter escaping through the window. She shot them both and then was killed by the police. She had the highest BAC I had ever even heard of, at about 0.7 blood alcohol content. 

Nothing strange happened immediately, but the next time I went up there I noticed footprints leaving the house as I was leaving. They appeared to be that of a goat, which I thought was weird considering they went neatly up the stairs as if they had been walking on two legs. 

I put that aside as a trick of the light (which I still sort of do, tbh)

The next time my family went up there things were weirder. The entire place smelled fucking awful and there were scratch marks everywhere. I immediately assumed a cat had gotten in, but then I found handprints on the basement walls, as if someone had had their hand covered in soot and pressed it against the wall.

Furthermore, everyone there acted very uncharacteristically. My family, which usually got along very well, broke out in several fights, and one of them even got very close to getting violent. 

Any thoughts? Do you think something weird is going on? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A meaningful Yggdrasil tattoo request </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-19 03:40:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! 

I don't mean to be annoying but I know what I want in my first tattoo but I can't draw... And I'd really like someone to try to draw this so I can see if it works at all or looks dumb. 

My idea was to get a tattoo of the Yggdrasil ash tree from celtic mythology because that symbol means several things to me on a few different. (If it would help to know those things send me a PM)

Anyway, specifically, I envision it having a natural to digital-looking progression, with the trunk (preferably a curved trunk, as is traditional with Yggdrasil tattoos) and roots being elegant and lush looking, and the branches and leaves looking more geometric and digital.

I'm sorry to be so specific but if anyone would make that, it would be fucking amazing.

Thank you so much.

Sincerely,
Splendidman </TEXT>
