	<TEXT> Normally that's true.............................however I think with these captures a little pointing goes a long way. Its not misleading to time stamp and tell someone where and when to listen in. Carefully. Especially a video that's an hour or so long. People want the meat and potatoes. And they want it quickly. I dont edit, or splice my videos for people to hear. I time stamp and tell you were the evp will appear. U still have the job and ordeal of actually hearing it.  Very few come back to me saying they cant hear.The evp is that precise.

But the best one is  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDauzQr58ro at 18:58 "  "you chickened out you puss"  a third voice is whispering while barb and I both talk.  Clearly not us talking. A few whispers before, unable to tell what being said.  Sounds like Ray encouraging its subordinate to do something. ONE OF THE STRONGEST EVPs captured in regards to intent and maliciousness."

Part Two of House Attack June 30th 2014. Motion detection, camera movements and furniture displacement into my upstairs office. Narrative is I come home from work late in the day(already knowing chair would be in my office from the email pics I got) Arrived to this. Revisiting the video ti would seem there are voices embedded within the video that are not mine. Ex. 4:02  "Aye" I say Im putting the cross back and something says "Aye"  EVP at 5:13 I say so it seems nothing is out of order a whisper can be heard of "NO" at 5:34 and  at 5:35 faint whisper "You're Wrong?" 5:48 "No" again 5:54 EVP Faint but present. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Evidence is in the eye of the beholder.  You NOT BELIEVING DOESN'T cause me to loose sleep at night.  Sorry to bust your bubble it really doesn't. Odds are you're not a believer of the paranormal.  Odds are you view yourself and both judge and jury on whats paranormal and what's not. Odds are you view everything with an extreme inordinate amount of skepticism. Odds are you comb such communities to prevent others from taking a serious look.   BUT the more you engage me in a back in forth the more others read this post and private email, agreeing with my cclaims based on their own experiences.  So by all means keep engaging with me.  I told you before my goal is to increase the dialogue on what malevolent entities are.  To increase the dialogue around the and talk about the science behind it. Trust me I know your kind. We moved in this house May 2012, and the evidence compiled, shared and still being analyzed is making reverberations through out both paranormal and parapsychology community. My claims. Better yet our claims were substantiated months ago. SO please do your home work and play catch up.  If the truth of the paranormal interests you then ask an intelligent question. Until then the only thing you're doing is blowing smoke and voicing an opinion and you know what they say about people with opinions?

You ignore other key components i.e. facts. You ignore the men present and the organization they represent SSPR and SEP. You ignore the EVP'S that come with the video. You ignore or fail to make mention the 300+ other videos. 

You ignore due dilengence and you cling to while throwing the it around at the same time. That word being hoax. This case was settled back in January.  I'm just sharing snippets of that investigation.  One out many that discovered and brought to light the home in question is occupied by land locked phenomenon.

	<TEXT> Once again you're throwing out innuendo and speculation. You imply or suggest hoaxing when you offer no evidence of the sort.  You know little merits of the case. About the case and therefore wish to deduce that there is hoaxing.  Hoaxing means nothing unless you can prove it. Its the skeptic and cynics EZ way out.  You dare not advance the discussion by asking pertinent questions which MAYBE, JUST MAYBE might give you the evidence you need to suggest hoaxing. But right now all you're doing is grasping at straws.  I deal with skeptics and cynics everyday. Have been for the past 4 years.  Your argument is always the same. I swear you all must come from the same cookie sheet. You can't prove hoaxing. You can only suggest it.  if you want the truth then ask intelligent questions and cease with the ass-umptions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi GhostCheese your analysis makes a lot of assumptions, many which lack evidence to support them. The men in the video are from both Scotland and the UK. Combined 60+ years in paranormal research. Neither of them would ever call themselves an expert in the field but I feel safe saying  their methods used to determine paranormal activity are indeed sound and prudent. Not on their own merits but on the merits of hundreds of other tests done within this house.  Granted your looking at one piece of the puzzle so you're fundamentally handicap and by handicap are therefore quick to throw out suspicion and baseless innuendo.  Its funny how you think one could be so crafty to invite men and organizations from half way across the world. Travel 10,000 miles and rig a house with gadgets and ghost detection gear, which includes a rotating camera that must be manually controlled when its rotating and BUT "ooops someone forgot to remove the fan." Not only that WE still include the fan in the video which took hours to edit and upload.  Thats a folly thought.   This house has been lived in for 4 years, investigated for 2 weeks by the men u see in the video and investigated by others for one year who are not in the video. All though they dont regard themselves as experts are (who is?) highly regarded and respected in the paranormal.  Just because an event can be hoaxed doesn't mean it was. You have to prove its a hoax and up until now you have not. Your suggestion that all of this is rigged and orchestrated has not been proven: merely suggested.  Its text book innuendo.   You'd be doing  yourself a favor by carefully researching the entire case vs. making baseless assumptions via peeping through a key hole which up to now is all you have done.  Why dont you try asking a question first?  This is not the only video where trip wires were activated, we have others. We have EVPs. We have statements of objects being moved minus the visible aide of someone: some of which these men have seen. And we got previous tenant testimony and thats just for starters.  Saying you work for or use to work for a InfrRed company therefore qualifies you as a subject matter expert on trip wire is ludicrous.  How can we verify that?  I could be the King of Spain for matter. And lastly two different trip wire models made by independent manufacturers going off in different rooms multiple times over a span of days and weeks is not coincidence.  Not when you add in the other factors.  You're best bet is too just ask questions vs. verbalize your innuendo or assumptions. I said in the video notes(read them) the alarms where set off purposely ( to draw us upstairs ). As was Steve camera dying almost immediately upon being set down.

Its ok to debunk stuff. But debunking minus deep thought, deep review of all the evidence makes your efforts futile.
