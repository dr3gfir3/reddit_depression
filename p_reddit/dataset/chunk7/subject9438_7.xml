	<TEXT> So tell me why he is a good choice? Did you see recent news? He wants to interfere in Ireland's tax code to raise corporate tax which will lead to possible crash of the economy. How can smaller country like Ireland compete with France or Germany? They are not on level playing field so having the same rules for both economies will destroy the smaller one. Macron is stupid if he thinks that all countries have to maintain the same ratios of employment, welfare payments, medical care, luxury taxes, road taxes etc, work weeks, holidays etc.
Ask yourself why he wants that? It boils to the fact that one of bigger neighbours dislikes smaller countires because they are unable or unwilling to compete. </TEXT>
