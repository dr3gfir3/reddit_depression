	<TEXT> Are you serious? If the game does exist then how did you come to know about it. Anyways, I was really surprised to know that something like this actually exists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You say that capture the flag might be unfair because of difference in movement speed and abilities, but don't you think even a normal siege match could sometimes be unfair, for example if the whole team chose all tanks, the match will mostly be won by the tank team unless and untill they all are just noobs. 

What I mean by capture the flag is that it should not necessarily be exactly like that but something similar. They could have some limitations on the hero selection or something like that.

Your idea of conquer the fortress sounds pretty nice. It would be interesting to explore if it were to be made into an actual thing by Hi-Rez. </TEXT>
