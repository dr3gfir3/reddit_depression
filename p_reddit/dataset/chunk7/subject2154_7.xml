	<TEXT> It is simply this, their PR/Community Manager/Whateverheiscalled can't take the slightest amount of criticism and has become an excuse machine.  I am as frustrated as the next person that we were essentially lied to during the Kickstarter campaign and instead of handling it correctly, that bozo became a mod for this subreddit and started banning people.  I wont rehash all of that, but that become a tipping point for me.  I went from slightly annoyed, never posting on this /r/ to angry and disappointed.  
    
People f-up, I f-up, its the way life is.  They f'd-up bad with this kickstarter.  There are always going to be critics, even of the most dedicated and honest among us.  But if you mess up, you own up to it, say your sorry and you then dedicate your energy to making it right.  Instead, they just continued to do the same crap, creating more problems and pissing off more people.  Personally I feel they lack any sort of ethics, integrity or common sense.  
    
If they are a great, organized, efficient, well managed company, then the community manager should be fired because he reflects something which is the complete opposite.
    
If the community manager was really good at his job he would have a found a way to make things right, to make folks, like myself, happy.  It's called, Making Lemonade.  You take a problem and turn it into something good.  "Hey, we really pooched this release bad.  Please forgive us.  To make up for it, here is a free copy of the game to give to a friend"...whatever, say your sorry a hundred times and give us a reason to cheer you on again!
    
I hope at the end of the day they produce a great solid product but they've done exactly ZERO to prove to me that this will happen.  At the end of the day, I'll never buy a product that any of those folks will ever produce again.  That is how much the community manager has angered me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry to hear of your loss and the passing of a great Cub fan.  2 1/2 years ago my grandfather passed away at 96, never having seen the Cubs win a world series.  Just let that sink in...  

  We were able to memorialize his and my grandmothers love of the team a few years before his passing by purchasing them an engraved brick that is now part of the paving outside of Wrigley.  We all spoke at his funeral in great depth of his love of the Cubs and I promised him that I would be carrying a picture of him when my son and I watched the Cubs finally win the series.  I then emphasized, "when...not if"!

May you pass on the same love and passion for our team as she has passed onto you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shortly after I backed this game on Kickstarter (July 29th, 2012) , one of the updates, [Kickstarter diary number four : Credit Island](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/902505202/castle-story/posts/291052) dated August 18th, 2012, mentions Credit Island.  [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K0DDysCC4Y) is the YouTube video posted on that update which goes into more detail.  I don't recall seeing anything further mentioned about that (but I could have missed it).  I was wondering if this was still planned to be included in the game as originally promoted? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was at the Iowa Cubs game tonight, just walked in the door with 3 sleepy kids.  My son got Bryant's and Baez's autograph.  We sat in the 2nd row right by the on deck circle and 10 seats or so from the dug out, so we got a close look at these guys we've read so much about.  

Tonight, the Cubs pitching was really shaky, starter Pimentel wasn't very good, he had some great help defensively to keep things from getting really out of hand.  I believe it was Kalsih that nearly climbed the center field wall to stop an easy double.  Vizcaino came in to relieve with a 14 something ERA and left at over 16. 

 I can see the concerns with Bryant's defense.  He fielded 4 challenging hits very well, unfortunately the first two were followed by bad throws to first, one way over Watkins head.  The last 2 were excellent and on the mark.  Of course his home run was amazing, it left the park, disappeared into the night.  Glad I have it on video.  

Baez looked sharp, at the plate and in the field.  Vitters and Jackson still the same...struggling at the plate...saw Wada standing in the dug out as well as Manny.  I'll post some pics tomorrow perhaps.  These guys were no more than 8 feet away from me, it was pretty cool.  

====
EDIT
====

[Here](http://imgur.com/a/jMl9F) is an album of some of the pics, mostly of Baez and Bryant.  I also tried and successfully made a terrible GIF of the Bryant home run.  Sadly the video isn't any better but it was a sight to behold.

	<TEXT> this may seem like "no big deal" and certainly I can appreciate the frustration.  One thing to consider is who has to deal with that ultimately.  Having worked for a business downtown, public urination is a huge pain in the ass.  In my case, basically bar folks would wonder off the main drag into the alley and piss on the door/wall behind the business.  Not only did we have big puddles waiting for us in the morning, many times they would piss on the door handle, or in the door seams, I assume, trying to get piss inside.  Any time we had to walk in/our of the back door, we had to walk through and smell piss.  On top of that, it could at times make the back area of the business smell like a urinal.

So some of us, including the owner, had to take time out of our day, quite often, to hose off the back wall, door, etc.  It just really sucked and not something most will consider when squatting in the alley.  It got to the point that my boss installed cameras and started turning them all into the police.  These weren't homeless dudes, they were the college kids who, like me at the time, didn't consider the bigger picture.  We then would get the pleasure of watching them come down and clean up the mess they left.

So while I get there are "bigger fish to fry", if you ever own a business and some asshole pisses on your door every night or you have to take time out of your IT job to hose piss off the back door, you will go...ahhhh...I was being a douchebag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> haha.  I had the pleasure of visiting your fine university for business many years ago and at the Paul W. Bryant museum they play a video over and over of Coach Bryant.  I was speaking to some of the staff and they were telling me that you will regularly find older fans standing, watching the video and crying.  Not once in a while, nearly every day.  I thought that was very interesting but also a little strange.  It was a cool place to visit nonetheless.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a thousand times this.  I bought a "lifetime license" back in 2009.  The article linked above does a good job of describing what happened shortly thereafter.  I simply won't give them another cent in the future.  I felt they were dishonest and underhanded.  I don't mind paying for a product, I just wasn't provide what I was told I was paying for...on top of that they disabled features that I had access to at the beginning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> same here.  I have an SSD and in beta and before the first patch, I always loaded during the drop sequence or at the "waiting for players" screen.  It now takes about 2 minutes to load and I start on the ground, have to hit esc and choose my burn card.  as far as I knew, this was a known issue post patch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> to be fair, I have titanfall on a SSD as well.  In beta and then upon release, I always started during the drop sequence. After the first big patch, 19/20 times I start on the ground and have to hit esc to play my burn card.  It takes almost 2 minutes for a level to load.  

Nothing has changed on my system or connection.  I thought this was a fairly well known issue at this point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used Kaseya for two years while working for a local IT company supporting small and medium sized businesses.  That was 5 years ago so things may have changed and I may have forgotten 90% of the features we used.


Personally, I loved it.  I believe at the time we were supporting approx 40 accounts with around 700 total users.  The product provided a centralized way to manage all of our client workstations and servers.  Remote access, vast assortment of alerting/monitoring that worked with our ticketing system, install/uninstall applications, windows update, wake on lan, etc.  If it didn't do something out the box, we would write scripts and execute them per a schedule or you could find something on their forums that was provided by other admins.  Kaseya also had a very good backup product and it also had integrated AVG what we used for some accounts.


Obviously, a very high level generic response but I do miss having it at my disposal and my experience was very positive. </TEXT>
