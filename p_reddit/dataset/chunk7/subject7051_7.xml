He brought a backpack full of books and games over to his friend's house one time and slipped the pocket knife in to show his friend, who is eight. He forgot his backpack there and it took a couple of weeks to get it back (they were on holidays). When his mom returned the backpack she asked if we knew our son had a knife. We told her that we were aware he had a knife, we gave it to him, but not aware he had brought it to his friend's. She told us that her son snooped through my son's backpack, found the knife and that she didn't want her son exposed to that sort of thing. She won't allow our son to play with hers any longer. Over a silly two and half inch long pocket knife.  </TEXT>
