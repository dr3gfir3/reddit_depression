	<TEXT> I stopped in [Lucerne for a night](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/06/lucerne-night-along-lake.html) on the way up from Lauterbrunnen to Frankfurt late in May. It didn't seem to touristy to me. I mean, there were tourists, but not the huge crowds herding along like in Rome, for example.

I really loved this little town, even if I was only there for a night. It was very scenic! A little bit of everything: a lake, a river right through the city, the alps surrounding it, etc.

What else did you do? See? Eat? I'm just curious to see what your experience was like compared to mine.

Thanks for sharing! </TEXT>

You're going to want to rent a car. It just makes things easier. I've had no experience with the public transit though... so, grain of salt?

I did not stay at any all-inclusive resorts. Sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the leading photos in [the article](http://www.choosetravelonline.com/pacific-northwest-top-5-must-see-places/) and the video is Palouse Falls. Just curious as to why it didn't make the list?

I enjoyed the factoids for the descriptions in 2-5, it was fun to learn a little bit about each one!

For Seattle, I felt commentary was a bit lacking. What small shops? What craft breweries? What diverse neighborhoods? And what about them is particularly unique enough that I'd want to visit Seattle?

Good work and really gorgeous photos! </TEXT>

However, I decided to try and summarize the entire trip and answer some FAQ I've received since then. Since /r/travel was so helpful in our planning, I thought I'd attempt to return the favor. Hopefully, someone finds this even a tiny bit useful!

	<TEXT> I went to Oahu for my bachelor party. It has a more "big city" feel to it. One of my best memories, besides the beaches and resorts, was doing an [ATV tour at Kualoa Ranch](http://www.kualoa.com/oahu-tours/atv-tours/).

For my honeymoon, we went to Maui. It felt more relaxed, slow, and more like a getaway than my visit to Oahu. We did lots of beach time just laying around. We also did zip-lining at [Kapalua Ziplines](http://www.kapaluaziplines.com/) and a luau (I forgot which one). We stayed at the Ritz-Carlton, which I highly recommend!

Most recently, I went to wedding on the Big Island. We spent most of our time Kona side, but the wedding was on the Hilo side. Hilo was wet and rainy, but the Kona side had all the nice beaches. My favorite beach was [Manini'owali Beach](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g60872-d622557-Reviews-Manini_owali_Beach_Kua_Bay-Kailua_Kona_Island_of_Hawaii_Hawaii.html), which takes a bit of a drive through lava rocks to get to, but it's gorgeous! We also did a coffee farm tour at [Hula Daddy](http://www.huladaddy.com/) and a macadamia nut self-guided tour at the [Hamakua factory](http://www.hawnnut.com/).

Good luck, have fun, safe travels! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For what it's worth, I recently posted a recap of [my trip to Amsterdam](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/07/amsterdam-vice-of-netherlands.html) this past April. Some things to note:

* Eat rijsttafel
* Eat stroopwafel
* Heineken is great on tap, but try to check out Brouwerij 't IJ
* Don't take photos of prostitutes (duh)
* Book entry to Anne Frank House ahead of time, if you plan on going

I really enjoyed Amsterdam! Have fun!

	<TEXT> I know a ton of casual lifters who don't give a shit about bulking/cutting, linear progression, carb cycling, etc. They get along just fine. I also know a ton of goal-driven lifters who want to optimize their time, effort, and energy in the gym to get where they want to.

Personally, I go through phases. Some months out of the year, I track macros religiously and stick to a lifting program (SL5x5 most recently). Currently, I eat whatever I want and lift PPL, just because I don't have goals in mind at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just me, but I personally have had most success during my bulks when I eat some combination of:

Carb:

* rice
* black beans
* potatoes

Protein:

* chicken thighs (breast are fine too, but I get sick of it really easy)
* top sirloin steak
* ground turkey
* eggs (white AND yolk)
* tuna in a can

Vegetables: any vegetable, and as much as you can possibly stomach.

I know it isn't anything special, but I hope it's what you're looking for. You can buy most of it (especially beans and rice) in bulk. Soak the beans in water overnight to make cooking them faster the next day.

Costco is your friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you plan on running anything more than 5k, I recommend getting a pair of dedicated running shoes. For lifting, anything with a relatively flat sole would be good, Nike Metcons or Reebok CrossFit shoe perhaps. 

Obviously, dedicated shoes for each activity is going to give you best comfort. However, a pair of minimalist shoes might work just fine for light jogging and lifting.

For 3 years, I ran and lifted in [Merrell Trail Gloves](http://www.merrell.com/US/en/trail-glove-3/17571M.html). When these went to shit, I purchased a pair of [Inov-8 F-Lite 195s](http://www.inov-8.com/new/global/Product-View-FLite-195-Black-Lime-Azure.html).

	<TEXT>  This building dwarves our building in a monumental way, one resident said. These are condominiums that are owned; these are not apartments. Were a 3-story building, you could (call) it four because of the height of the loft ceilings, to be fair, but its not six. Well have no light. Between the micropod building behind and this building, we will literally be walled in; well have no sky view whatsoever for 19th Avenue Lofts and an east-facing unit like me.

Call me insensitive, but I don't feel bad for this resident. Especially if the new project might bring **180 market rate residential units** to Capitol Hill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I visited Florence last month and shared some [details of my visit on my blog](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/05/florence-living-out-italian-renaissance.html). It was my favorite city in Italy!

Some of the things we did:

* Il Duomo di Firenze - the belltower was also very cool and has a view of the Duomo itself.
* Ponte Vecchio - cool bridge with jewelry shops, good stop on the way to Piazzale Michelangelo.
* Piazzale Michelangelo
* Eat a sandwich at All'Antico Vinaio - Do. Not. Miss. This!
* Eat Bistecca alla Fiorentina (Florentine T-Bone Steak) - make reservations early on, this is very popular!

Have fun, and please share your experience! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way I see it, establishing the run is like establishing a nice jab in a boxing match, you always try and do it first. It sets up other combinations: jab-hook, jab-straight, jab-over-hook, etc. In previous years, our jab could also be our knockout punch because of how powerful our jab was. Moving forward, looks like our haymaker will be our passing attack.

Either way, you still want to establish a good jab. I think that's what people mean by being "run first". It isn't the perfect analogy, but hopefully you see my point. </TEXT>

Rome. It's crowded and crazy at times, but absolutely wonderful for people interested in ruins, art, and museums.

 like to walk/hike

Despite how touristy Cinque Terre can get, I'd still recommend visiting. It's breathtaking! Stay the night there and get up early enough to hike around before the day-trippers get in.

I recently visited Italy and shared photos/recaps on my blog, you might find some of these useful or interesting:

I'd also make a stop in [Cinque Terre](http://urban-trailseeker.blogspot.com/2016/05/cinque-terre-dream-come-true.html) and hike around.

You had mentioned you'd been to Paris already, but I'd recommend staying or spending time in Montmartre. It's up some hills, but a nice, "out of the way" experience.

I really enjoyed the London Eye while in London. Also, drinking at various pubs around the Hackney neighborhood. Old George and Sebright Arms come to mind.

Those are some things that come to mind, PM me if you'd like more detail on anything. Have fun!

If you are going along 101, there's a lot of nice viewpoints from the parks along the Oregon coast. I can't remember a lot of them off the top of my head, but a quick Google search would bring up the major ones.

I'd recommend driving down 101 and back up I5, as it's easier to turn right than left against oncoming traffic to visit sights. Just a tiny bit of advice.

Good luck and have fun, it's a great road trip! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just in Venice last week. 4 days is quite a bit, especially for a place like Venice. There are some nice trattorias and osterias that are open "late", but most of the place shuts down as the day-tourists leave.

If you decide to hang out there, I'd recommend hitting up cicchetti in the area just north of Rialto. I hit 4 of them and enjoyed Valpolicella at each:

- Osteria Do Mori: old school vibe, closes kind of early
- Cantina Do Spade: can get busy, draws a younger crowd, lots of good food options
- All'Arco: standing room only, not very good wine or food options, but the servers were jovial
- L'Aquasanta: more of a restaurant, but had a good amount of space and good food

The whole town is "touristy", so be ready for that. My favorite part was walking around the narrow streets and simply getting lost.

Good luck and have fun! </TEXT>

Compared to these cities (which are huge and much older than Seattle), the mass transit in Seattle is so-so. With the exception of Florence and Venice, all these other cities have vast networks of underground subways (metro, tube, etc.), upper ground trollies or trains (trams, streetcar, etc.), and intra-city railways, in addition to busses. Yes, we have light rail, street car, etc., but they aren't as vast. We're getting there though... </TEXT>
