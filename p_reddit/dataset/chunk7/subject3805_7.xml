	<TEXT> The more mentions of creepy smiles and tall men creeping around corners, the better. SERIOUSLY.

Just load your story with them. Don't even worry if they make sense:

"Jim was eating sushi, wearing a huge, face-splitting grin"

Utter.

	<TITLE> CAPTCHA told me to kill my roommate when I tried to watch Twilight. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-18 02:22:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I might be a big, fat idiot, but I didnt think anything was wrong when the CAPTCHA Are you Human? screen told me to kill one of my roommates.


I was trying to stream *Twilight* online, but I want you to know right now that it's not because I actually like the movie. I was drunk and needed something to laugh at, okay?

Anyway, I was past three shots of rum when the CAPTCHA screen appeared:


KILL ROOMMATE


I showed it to one of my roommates, Rachel, who almost pooped herself laughing. It wasnt actually that funny, but drunk people think dirt is hilarious. Rachel and I watched the movie, while our other roommate, Ava, did homework in her room.


I was hungover in the morning, so I stayed in bed and streamed more movies. It was time for *Breaking Dawn*, except this time I was actually interested in Bella and Edwards relationship. Dont judge. I was sprawled in my bed, weakly navigating to the stream page, when another CAPTCHA appeared:


KILL AVA


I narrowed my eyes. What the fuck? I forgot about Breaking Dawn and sat up, rubbing at my eyes. At this point it wasnt funny anymore, it was just weird. Ava isnt a very common name, and what kind of sick CAPTCHA algorithm would generate stuff like that? I mean, Im majoring in Tourism Management, but I sure as hell know that companies block out phrases like that.


Someone had to see this, no matter how bizarre it was. It was Sunday afternoon. Rachel was gone, and Ava was usually at the Souths most annoying megachurch, NewStart!!. Yes, the churchs name has two exclamation points in it. I heard some rustling on the other side of the apartment Ava mustve skipped.


Yo, Ava! I yelled. Maybe CAPTCHA went all NSA on me. Come on, I want to show you something!


Yeah? She rounded the corner into my room, wearing her usual placated smile.


I spun around the laptop on my lap to face her. I tilted the screen so she could read, and as I did her expression dropped from a smile to neutral as stone.


I watched her expression with one of those eager dog faces after you show someone something funny.


She punched me in the mouth.


I whipped over the side of the bed and smacked on the floor, eyes rolling to Ava for a split second before she kicked me hard in the stomach.


I retched and rolled over, scrabbling to get up, hair in my eyes and my heart thumping. She was screaming the entire time, this shrill, one-note screech, kicking me over and over again. As she rolled back for another kick my mind suddenly snapped into action. I threw myself to my desk and she threw herself at me, screaming and scratching at my eyes. I grabbed the knife in my desk and jammed it in her shoulder. She screamed, dislodging herself before running out of my room.


I stood, shaking, before lunging at my door to lock it. I drew back and caught my face in my mirror my mouth was dribbling blood and I was missing a front tooth. I looked like a hillbilly. Whatever. I already go to college in South Carolina. Deal with that later.


Nothing that happened in the past five minutes made any sense, but I knew that I had to get out of the house. I couldnt stay locked up in the apartment with her.


I grabbed my tote bag and pocketknife before waiting at my door for a minute, listening.


Nothing.


Knife in hand, I cracked my door open and looked around the crack. The living room was empty. I inched out of my room when I heard a whisper. It was coming from Avas room; quick and frantic whispers.


*FIRSTANDLASTfirstandlastfirstandlastnononononononononononono*


First and last? Uh, no thank you.


I rushed past her door and out the front door to the apartment complex. I decided to go to my friend Sams apartment. I thought that once I got to his apartment, I could explain things and call the police. Sam gets drunk a lot and wears fedoras ironically, but hes still a pretty normal person.


He answered the door on the first knock, giving my hillybilly mouth the stink-eye. Kierra, what the hell happened to your face?


Ava beat me up.


*What*?


I pushed past him and dumped my stuff on his couch before grabbing paper towels from the kitchen. He plopped his generous frame on his couch and I explained my story in detail, pausing once in a while to blot my bloodied mouth. I split my lip on my tooth and it hurt like a mofo.


Was she drunk? he asked.


No. You know she doesnt get drunk. I was getting antsy. I tossed the paper towel in the trashcan once the bleeding steamed. The whole thing seemed completely batshit. Ava was tough, but she wasnt unstable.


I finally looked up at Sam. Any ideas?


Call the cops?


Well, no shit, I couldve just sat on my ass in my locked room and done that 30 minutes ago. I picked up my phone to call the cops when my phone buzzed. A text from a blocked number:


CAPTCHA
NEWSTART!!
GO NOW


That damn church Ava always went to. Great. This was the last thing I wanted to do hungover. Sam looked over my shoulder and we both frowned. 


Who the hell texted you?


I dont know. But I think we need to go to Newstart!!.


No way.


The last time I didnt do something internet communication told me to do, I got the shit beaten out of me.


Thats a stupid reason to follow some random text!


There was a knock on the door.


I flinched, but Sam brushed me off. "It's just Trey back from church."


He waddled to the door and Trey stepped into the apartment, smiling, before his eyes locked on me. His expression slacked.


"THE FIRST AND LAST," he screamed.


Oh, shit.

	<TEXT> Many, many people say that too much cursing in a story is inappropriate. I politely disagree with them.

It really depends on what kind of story you're writing, and who your narrative voice is. You might have a nun who never utters more than a "holy moley", or you could have a character who truly does curse every sentence.

When you develop your character, you choose a writing style for them. Tons of people curse, and curse often. Why can't that translate into writing? Go for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just YOLO it!

The definition of this phrase that I literally just made up means: "Just go for it". I could've said "just go for it", but I was feeling up to using the word YOLO.

But seriously, I would say just go for it. If you feel really nervous, you can post on a throwaway account. Or, have a trusted someone read before you submit.

A story based off of mental illness is very plausible. Just make sure you've researched. Good luck! </TEXT>
