	<TEXT> I decided i'd play pretty much all of Alien: Isolation in the dark, with headphones on at all times. Lots of screaming happened, but a couple of moments stand out:

Sneaking around an outdoor power plant area literally full of androids. I finish my objective, but one spots me, and naturally calls his horde of buddies. I then sprint away until my backs against the wall, and somehow manage to bolt gun thing or cattle prod all of them, one by one as they come towards me, for like ten heart stopping minutes.

Another time, the alien was being especially annoying, popping up literally every ten seconds as I was trying to go down a flight of stairs. After some locker hiding and flamethrowing, i make it to the corridor i felt safest, and chill in the vent just to heal up, maybe make something if I have time...only to turn around, and see the fucking xenomorph casually army crawling up to me, like its come to say hello.

He just stares and I don't even make a sound, completely stunned, for what is the longest half second I have ever spent gaming. Then he lunges and I proceed to nearly need new pants.

So many more examples (RE4 comes to mind) but I'll literally be typing all day :3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Theres 5 of them, and I'd recommend being around 70's to fight them. They are:

Phantom
Kurt Zisa
Ice Titan
Unknown
Sephiroth

You'll need to synth Ultima Weapon too and stuff which I found to be a chore compared to KH2's, but it's immensely worth it.

I'd say it goes easiest to hardest from phantom-sephiroth on that list, but i recommend actually doing Ice Titan first, the keyblade you get is very handy for phantom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of story you're literally one room away from finishing. But honestly if you stop straight after the story you're missing out on the good stuff imo. Postgame bosses are incredible </TEXT>
