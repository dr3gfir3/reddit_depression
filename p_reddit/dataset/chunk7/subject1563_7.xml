	<TEXT> It is what OP said. 

 what I believe should be available in every city

As an author I want as many people to read my books but I need to balance that with the pitiful income I generate.

If I want to give it away I can do that on amazon or post it online. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This should not be encouraged on any level. Even charity shops should be boycotted. Most authors make so little from their work the idea that it should be received for free or for minuscule amounts does not bode well for authors or books in general.

While this project may be culturally valuable in certain less fortunate areas adopting it as a widespread phenomenon would be a negative for writing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If there are places like this on a large scale which are offering nothing in terms of compensation to writers like most libraries then instead of buying the authors book you just pick it up in a place like this for free.

So the author loses out. And if this becomes a large scale process most authors, who earn incredibly small amounts of cash from their work, will lose out even more.

Most people don't know how much a author gets from a book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's obviously smart enough to make his own decisions. 

Nothing stopping him doing some art house pics for every big film.

If talking about anxiety, how he even tried to act in the first place I don't know. When I read about people using it to conquer their nerves I laugh. Get in front of people? How about get out the front door?

It is hard to feel that sorry for someone who seemed to get success very quickly when others either as actors or sufferers of anxiety and depression get nothing.

The actors because of luck I imagine, he's not in anyway special, and would be quite replaceable by other actors waiting in hollywood now. This is not DeNiro.

The others, because they can barely get out the door because they are too afraid and don't have the money for private therapists or even meds.

By any standards he was successful as an actor very quickly, and I am pretty confident he was making good money, far more than all of the actors I know.

How much do you need so? Why not go on stage and do 3 plays a year in Pasadena. He could have.

The reactions on here I cannot understand for the most part. 

Crying over the emotional health of middling talent millionaires is bizarre.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah did you get downvoted to hell and get threatened? I certainly did.

Popular entertainer using his connection with the fans to get their money to protect his 'vision'. Cause he's fucking Kubrick. 

Cause he didn't have enough money of his own. And had to get some A List star. And pay his brother and himself. Or at least get the funding so they can get paid after the film starts earning. What risk.

Wonder how much he makes in the end? I would love if they came out and showed proof.

Fucking joke if I ever saw one. Anyone who invested should be ashamed. If they had any respect they should go out and invest the same in another project, one they find interesting that doesn't have the hack from scrubs involved.  </TEXT>

If they were coming up now and had the same exposure to the speed of the game and the fitness levels who can tell. One would imagine they would be great again, but perhaps they were better suited to a certain time and way of playing.
