See my ex dumped me in summer, and my friend got killed 3 summers ago, so its a hard time.

I have been self harm free for oh, 4 weeks now, only stopped because I was sick of it not helping me.

Havent attempted my own life for 2 weeks now i think. so thats good?

I just feel so alone in this house and this world, have talked to people on here who offer support, but then they do nothing after a few days and leave me.

I have been holed up in my room for the past 2 weeks due to surgery on my foot, and get my stitches out tomorrow, am nervous and dont know what to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was told to run through a field, so I did.

Not knowing some asshole had stuck pencils in it, I got one through my shoe and had pencil lead in my foot for the following 12 years. 

After 12 years of pain, I got the surgery last Teusday to get it removed from my foot. It hurts to walk still, but thats hopefully because of the stitches.

They came out inspected it and then called us today saying they wouldnt honor the warrenty because it has a stain on it.
