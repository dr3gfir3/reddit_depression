	<TEXT> I've been on a confidence streak, ironically because I'm in the process of hopefully leaving my boyfriend of three years. I'm trying to embrace the slight positivity I'm feeling about my body. Here's my other costume, a cat 

I know there are some major problem areas like my hips and stomach and my legs but I think in a few more pounds I'll look a lot better. http://i.imgur.com/ufUqgIZ.jpg  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I'm sure you look amazing too! I have some days where I can't even stand to look in the mirror, I was just feeling more confident yesterday :)

Also I don't do any workouts but I used to do squats, hence the larger thighs haha. Also I'm pear shaped so that's why my legs are so much larger than like my arms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so I'm not crazy. He makes me feel like I am for being upset over this. It's embarrassing that I don't like him to watch porn but I'd rather get it out in the open at the beginning to avoid potential heart break than just deal with it. And what do I get? Heartbreak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when I first started dating my bf three years ago, I told him I'm not comfortable with porn and that id rather we not be together if he wants to watch it. I had a traumatic experience with porn when I was a child and have not been able to cope much with it but am still working on it in therapy. He said yeah he won't watch it no prob! He started using it again within a month of me mentioning that and did a shitty job at hiding it. 

Since then I tried to get over it and even tried watching it with him. I faked that I was ok but I had a mental breakdown later that night without him knowing. Yesterday I left the house for a half hour and in that time, he jerked off to porn. I feel like he's waiting for me to leave sometimes to go masturbate. We argued about it and he said *"sometimes I don't want to think about you when I jerk off and I wanna look at other girls"*

That tore me to pieces.

I think I'm going to leave him.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The pretty people from my highschool are all gaining mad weight. I just wanna be the one with a consistent skinny body. I was a twig in middle school and high school because I was an athlete. After college hit me, I gained 15-20 pounds in 3 years, as a result of SSRI meds, binge tendencies, and lack of physical activity. I'm glad I realized it when I did and have already lost the weight. I now weigh what I was when I first came to college.

I know how I have (internally) reacted when I see people I went to highschool with and they gained over 20 pounds. I just *NEVER* want someone to see me that way. I want them to think I got more attractive, rather than fatter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm we've been together for three years. We had really good sex at the beginning when I was 116 pounds, then I gained close to 20 pounds and I noticed sex slowed down a lot. I know he's an ass man and always would grab my ass and stuff but it never really led to sex. I think he's still attracted to my body at a higher weight, but doesn't want sex as much when I look like that as opposed to when I look tinier. I just think he doesn't want to tell me I'm better looking now because it would probably (for lack of better words) feed my eating disorder.

Also, in a sick way I think he wants me to be bigger because he gets jealous that other people hit on me   -_- </TEXT>

Also our sex life has been better than ever since I dropped the pounds.  </TEXT>
