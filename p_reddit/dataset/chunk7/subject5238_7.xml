	<TEXT> For my holo recording of [Episode One](https://www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes/comments/5zri8v/thanks_to_you_sith_lords_im_rewatching_the/)

Episode 3eeeeeee

the opening shot following obi wan and anakin's two fighters then revealing the epic scale of the battle is jaw dropping.  coruscant is an awesome backdrop in the shots 

I know lucas actually used a combo of cg and models but whatever he did with this opening battle it looks amazing 

cool, anakin no longer looks like a teenbop coverboy 

obi wan and anakin trying to get past the vulture droids, lucas indisputably knows how to direct spacefight scenes

oddball is the call sign of a clone, I wonder if he was in the animated clone wars?  I saw it a while back but cant remember 

when anakin compliments r2, he really seems more comfortable in his own skin and matured

buzz droids attacking! love the variety and depth of the world

obi wan in trouble, says hes running out of tricks but he hasnt tried spinning smh

anakin saves obi wan's life only to try to kill him at the end, tragic 

nice little touch with r2 taking out buzz droid

I am just really starting to realize that they were fighting above coruscant, dooku was very close to winning if it werent for obi wan and anakin, tragic!

the nemoidian talking to grievous doesnt have a bad asian accent like in episode one, also I recall the one in episode two didnt have it either, you cant say lucas didnt try to improve 

obi wan and anakin take out an elevator full of droids, anakin seems like his powers have indeed doubled 

anakin and obi wans bickering seems also to have matured, they really are more like brothers now

lol at the rivalry between obi wan and anakin about r2 and implicitly r4

three way fight with dooku begins, much has been said about spinning and jumping shit, but there is real weight and tension in each attack here

lol the extra reason for anakin not to kill dooku came after he killed him, so hes needing less reason to kill.  nice to see hes still conflicted though.  I wonder if Palpatine somehow gave anakin the edge over dooku

I thought anakins outfit was black but now I think it might be more of a dark brown, if so, a nice progression from light to semi dark to dark

classic side of ship to side of ship firing, but in space

I cant help but wonder what dooku's republic wouldve looked like, he knew the corruption in the senate and jedi council to an extent but also fought as a sith

grievous looks amazing

"youre a lot shorter than I expected," "jedi scum", the humor without jar jar is just the right tone 

love how the good guys keep getting captured

those roman sentry droids look cool

anakin trying to land says "extend all flaps and drag fins", lucas' love of flying is showing 

sheev looks actually worried hes going to die lol

the problem qui gon had reacting to the green screen during the fish attack in episode one doesnt look like a problem anymore during the landing with anakin and obi 

great shot of ani and obi getting close to camera as they land

coruscant still looks amazing

its shameful how manipulated the jedi council was by sheev

sam jackson needs to say motherfucker once and id be complete

padme rocking the buns, so much hotter than leia

hes eventually happy but i wonder why ani hesitates when padme says shes pregnant

coruscant at night is blade runnerish

love john williams music from start to finish in all the movies

dayum, hayden without his shirt, has filled out nicely

padme's apartment seems to have the best view of all of coruscant 

ani is revealing his premonition to padme and hayden is acting circles around natalie

seeing the jedi temple reminded me of a thought from episode 2, the youngling who gives the answer to where kamino is looks like the same youngling anakin kills at the end 

aang from avatar goes through same dilemma as ani when theyre told to let go of love, here it's clearly an either or situation, I forget how avatar resolved it but he did end up happily with katara and his powers didnt suffer

palpatine gets granted more emergency powers to fight the war, reminds me of bush

obi warns ani to beware palpatine and in next scene, palpatine says trust me, he mustve sensed ani's doubt 

sheev putting anakin on the council is a masterful move and so is the council asking ani to be a double agent, poor ani, much tragedy

ani takes the request and everything personally, obi reminds him it's not him asking, I seem to remember maybe in the clone war series there was an answer to this dilemma of balancing love and the force

"have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?"  "what do you mean?"  "what if the democracy we thought we were serving no longer exists.  and the republics has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?"  "I dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist." "this war represents a failure to listen."  - this conversation could be had now and im not sure which side id take

lol now padme is asking anakin to talk to sheev.  anakin is torn on not just two but three sides and from the one he loves most.  padme told ani before that democracy is hard when both sides think theyre right.  ani is living it now

wtf is the show at the concert hall sheev is watching?

sheev makes a good point about the council being hypocritical by asking ani to spy on him, but I guess only if you take too idealistic of a reading of the jedi code is it unforgivable

"all who gain power are afraid to lose it, even the jedi."  "the jedi use their power for good."  "good is a point of view."  mic drop

sheev hits a wall with ani in his case that jedi and sith are similar, ani still believes jedi are selfless, so sheev brings up the story of darth plagueis, using ani's fear to bring him closer to him

anyone know in the canon if sheev can create life like plagueis?

kashyyyk looks amazing and camouflaged stormtroopers!

ani's being sweet apologizing to obi for his arrogance, and obi is very generous with his praise of anakin, it's nice to see anakin's at times still a good guy

nice to see clones show personality in banter with obi as on the clone wars show

lucas gets knocked for his dialogue but padme promising ani she wont die in childbirth and ani responding with "no, I promise you" is perfect 

utapau looks part amazing, part too much cg like geonosis

windu says if they destroy sheev, theyll have to take control of the govt to ensure a peaceful transition, yoda says "to a dark place this line of thought takes us," which raises an interesting dilemma, do the jedi have to become more like the sith to defeat them?

coruscant looks beautiful at sunset 

sheev took out three jedi masters in three seconds, wouldve liked to see a longer fight.  ah well, I got to hear the magic lines at least

sheev's snarl was pretty autistic

ani comes to see mace about to arrest sheev.  sheev tries a sneak attack but mace defends.  both say each other is the traitor.  mace says the oppression of the sith will never return.  sheev says only he has the power to save padme.  the fate of the galaxy and your loved one is at stake.  what would you do?

I wonder if sheev's skin was always that fucked 

sheev masterfully playing possum to make ani come to his aid because thats the one thing ani will do, save people he cares for

mace now wants to kill sheev.  ani says he cant.  but mace says sheev has control of the senate and the courts.  ani has been taught that the jedi are righteous and tries to talk mace out of it.  but in the end, it comes down to ani wanting to save padme and he kills mace.  I guess he was hoping to learn from sheev when he was in prison. 

the actor playing sheev is brilliant.  I think he just had an orgasm after killing mace

but maybe mace is alive.  we saw ani and obi flying through the air in episode two

ani's "what have I done" is truly heartbreaking.  he wanted both padme and the jedi way and both mace and sheev betrayed him, but only one way will help him save padme so the choices seem limited 

ani's dialogue about pledging himself is rushed, but hayden does a great job of selling it 

sheev knows he still has to convince ani to do his bidding, makes a seductive argument about having to eliminate to jedi to prevent a civil war 

the killing of the tusken raiders' children was a nice setup for the killing of the younglings at the temple 

sheev says once more the sith will rule the galaxy and theyll have peace, and come to think of it, was life in the empire really that bad?  we shouldve seen more of it in the ot

order 66 music is awesome

padme is a bit too helpless with anakin, though I guess powerful women can be like that around the ones they love 

now anakin's lied about what he did at the temple, his descent into darkness is extending to their relationship

obi and organa walking through...it's the recreated corridor set from new hope!

mustafar looks amazing

seems a lot longer but the time of events between pt and ot is only two decades

did yoda just bat a laser blast back like a baseball?

sheev using jedi "rebellion" to gain more power.  reminds me of trump and his wiretapping and biased media claims.  also reminds me of what padme said, "democracy dies when people stop believing it works"

senate applauding sheev's proclamation that republic will be replaced with an empire, it must be sheev's senators 

obi and yoda recalibrated code to warn jedi to stay away from the temple, I guess empire hunted them down before the ot

obi really believed in ani, shouldve known it was ani who killed younglings but still had to check security holograms

security hologram of sheev and ani, were the jedi bugging sheev?

cg yoda looks great

obi tells padme the full truth, what a stand up guy, couldve done the same for luke ha!

obi goes to padme to find out where ani's gone, so he knew they were lovers but hadnt said anything

obi now stowing away on padme's ship, hes becoming more like qui gon, using deceit when needed, maybe qui gon (and mace, not like the jedi hadnt killed before) was on to something, not being so rigid in dogma as the jedi had become 

the viceroy is trying to tell ani the truth, that hes been working with sheev, but ani is too far gone and kills him

I love padme taking a moment before confronting ani, it's a nice moment alone with her

portman runs to ani, not really something a pregnant woman would do

lol ani smirks big time when padme says obi wants to help them, he really thinks hes all powerful and doesnt need any help

padme says let's run away and ani gives his "I am the one who knocks" speech

wow ani was going to overthrow sheev and I think he couldve but then he got fucked up by obi

ani and padme are acting great here 

I love ani circling obi before their duel like a dance

"only a sith deals in absolutes", I dont agree with that exactly.  both sith and jedi have shown to be open and closed but maybe the problem is they dont listen to each other as ani's mom had said

ot's lightsaber fighting is a lot more basic, though theres some high jumps.  I wonder if it isnt also because the jedi and vader had lost their skills by then

ha its the blue business guy that was said to be buying off the senators from episode one now standing with sheev

I dont think yoda shouldve gotten hit by sheev's lightning, he had blocked dooku's in episode two easily

ani and obi fighting in the hallway, lights going off and on for a strobe effect, every movie lucas does this it works

ani just jump kicked obi like obi jump kicked jango, lol still weird when they do this 

yoda and sheev fighting on senate floor, this is perfect

dual force pushes by ani and obi, yes!

uh oh, ani just hit the computer, love how elaborate the action set pieces are

yoda repels sheev's blast and sends them both falling but only yoda falls, it's almost as if it was fate that decided which would win

I still think yoda shouldve beaten sheev but I guess then thered be no ot

it bugs me during the heavy cg scenes when they at least dont use real foreground material

volcano going off around them looks epic

I remember yoda doing a bruce lee like wipe of his nose either vs dooku or sheev but I havent seen it on the blu ray, wonder if they changed this along with puppet yoda

cool to see organa getting screen time

obi ani fight is crazy, theyre trying to kill each other while on a floating antenna on a river of lava 

obi makes a good point when he says ani is lost, though the jedi are far from perfect, theres a clear distinction between them and the sith

obi looks like hes holding in a smile after he cuts off ani's legs

ani rocking those darth maul eyes 

obi not saving ani, he knows ani is still dangerous, nice that they didnt make it so he was cold hearted

obi comes back to the ship, c3po freaking out, obi gives him a comforting tap on the shoulder when hes the one who just nearly killed his friend and brother, what a good dude

sheev actually touches ani and looks like hes giving him comfort, well he is a master manipulator and politician and wants ani to live as his apprentice, contrast that with obi's reason for his comforting touch to c3 and padme

asteroid they're hiding on looks amazing 

nice parallel with padme giving birth while ani undergoing his operation, padme dies while vader and the twins are born

obi didnt tell padme what he did to ani before she lost her will to live so perhaps she sensed it through the force somehow

oohbah oohbah...

the scars on ani are pretty gnarly

til the end, padme believed in ani and said to obi there was good in him, I wonder how much that affected how he dealt with Luke in new hope

sheev tells ani he killed padme in his anger, ani says she couldve have, he felt she was alive, but what choice does he have but to believe the emperor at this point?  still, his "no" comes too fast and is still cringeworthy

room where organa, obi and yoda convene looks like from an 80s video game but hey it's a real set

yoda tells obi he will teach him how to commune with qui gon, that hes mastered immortality, pretty awesome that qui gon mastered immortality first, the true way, unlike sheev's way, and it makes sense qui gon was the one, he went against the council by vouching for ani and showed he was more one with the force than yoda

naboo at night at padme's funeral procession looks appropriately haunting

aw, padme is holding ani's pendant he gave her in episode one, much tragic

darth, vader, and cg tarkin? on destroyer looking at death star.  still think r1 went too far by bringing him back to life and actually acting, thats very sithlike

back on tatooine, luke meets beru and owen, beautiful call back shot of the two suns from new hope ends the movie, perfect ending

	<TITLE> Been a long time since I saw Stsr Wars Episode One, rewatched it and here are my thoughts, both good and bad </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-18 15:02:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> so far a lot more sets than expected, the Neimodian ships are sets with green screen for the windows equivalent to the matte paintings in the ot

blu ray looks great.  much less sterile, more definition than dvds.  but definitely the dark or dirty scifi aesthetic is not what theyre going for here which kinda makes sense as films go from light to dark

Neimodians' racial casting is awful

every line is memeable, must resist the urge to type them all down

god, liam neeson must be half a foot taller than McGregor.  already the tone is set, jokier and lighter based on their dialogue than the ot though I remember ot had quite a few jokes with r2 and c3po to start 

whoa, qui gon and obi wan escaped the droidekas using superspeed

Fuck, it's jar jar.  him saying "my" instead of "i" has me asking "why."  gungans are supposed to be creole I guess, racial casting is truly horrible.  I get hes supposed to be comic relief but he is a no buts about it disaster

gungan city is beautiful.  

the vfx holds up very well ie the droids 

the green screen is showing when they leave gungan city and are attacked by the giant fish, qui gon hardly reacts

naboo scenes clearly all shot on location (also remember this was said on commentary)

natalie portman is too wooden, I guess shes supposed to be a queen but she probably shouldve really britished it up

damn, ani and padme just met, hes way too young for her, creepy how they vet together.  still, cute and innocent enough meeting

jake lloyd is great, he really nails the character, innocent but flashes of anger

he just said "yippee".  yep, still awful

tattoine scenes also clearly shot on location.  watto's shop is a set

watto cg holds up well

interesting that the tatooine scenes revolve around junk as in new hope

the market stall owner looks like hes in a costume/make up instead of cg

lucas seems to love open market scenes as in indiana jones 

every scene jar jars in, im just looking the other way.  seeing a lot of interesting stuff in the frame id never seen before, little details of acting, props 

I forgot darth maul could talk.  and apparently hes british

anakins mom has an accent, maybe Greek?

qui gon's out-negotiating watto for the podrace, impressive 

a lot of jar jars bits can be cut and wouldn't affect the story -other than making it better.  so george if you can hear me how about a special edition of phantom menace 

qui gons lied quite a bit, to ani about freeing slaves and about why he was taking his blood, to watto at their first negotiation 

at the hangar before the podrace, nice to notice many of the aliens in the background arent cg

the hanger is also an extended set 

ani's friend just said "this is so wizard".  too bad that never caught on

and theres the tusken raiders, they actually helped ani win by taking out some of his competition

podrace scene is exciting as I remember 

the heck, is that willow next to watto during the race?

padme just tucked ani in with a blanket, creepy

coruscant looks amazing 

"there is no civility, only politics.  the republic is not what it once was.  the senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.  there is no interest in the common good.  the chancellor has little real power.  he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.  the bureaucrats are in charge now.  our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor.  one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice." - parallel with current state of american politics is timely 

I didnt understand anything about politics when I first watched it but whoa, palpatine was a senator from naboo.  padme is partly responsible for palpatine's rise

"enter the bureaucrat.  the true rulers of the republic.  and on the payroll of the trade federation I might add".  lucas studied his roman history

Palpatine says tragedy twice in the senate scene.  I wonder why he loves that word.

qui gon went against the jedi council despite obi wan's warning and said he still has much to learn.  did qui gon know how ineffective the council had become?

they dwell quite a bit on anakin's fear of losing his mother.  very nice foreshadowing.

Palpatine's manipulation to become chancellor is brilliant.  he schemes with the trade federation to blockade naboo, manipulated padme to ask for a no confidence vote against then chancellor valorum, knowing naboo's blockade would give them the sympathy vote 

lol obi wan warns qui gon about anakin being dangerous to take on as a padawan learner and qui gon says "from your point of view."

r/getmotivated quote from qui gon to ani, "your focus determines your reality."

yes, the duel of fates!

qui gon and darth maul's deaths are effective, good job 

yoda's cg holds up well 

love the celebration scenes at the end

okay that's it.  final thoughts: love the depth and originality of the story, some flaws but blocked out jar jar and enjoyed it, memorable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> part 2 of my commentary on episode 3

wtf is the show at the concert hall sheev is watching?

sheev makes a good point about the council being hypocritical by asking ani to spy on him, but I guess only if you take too idealistic of a reading of the jedi code is it unforgivable

"all who gain power are afraid to lose it, even the jedi."  "the jedi use their power for good."  "good is a point of view."  mic drop

nice parallel with padme giving birth while ani undergoing his operation, padme dies while vader and the twins are born

obi didnt tell padme what he did to ani before she lost her will to live so perhaps she sensed it through the force somehow

oohbah oohbah...

til the end, padme believed in ani and said to obi there was good in him, I wonder how much that affected how he dealt with Luke in new hope

sheev tells ani he killed padme in his anger, ani says she couldve have, he felt she was alive, but what choice does he have but to believe the emperor at this point?  still, his "no" comes too fast and is still cringeworthy

room where organa, obi and yoda convene looks like from an 80s video game but hey it's a real set

yoda tells obi he will teach him how to commune with qui gon, that hees masterpiece d immort, pretty awesome that qui gon mastered immortality first, the true way, unlike sheev's way, and it makes sense qui gon was the one, he went against the council by vouching for ani and showed he was more one with the force than yoda

naboo at night at padme's funeral procession looks appropriately haunting

aw, padme is holding ani's pendant he gave her in episode one, much tragic

darth, vader, and cg tarkin? on destroyer looking at death star.  still think r1 went too far by bringing him back to life and actually acting, thats very sithlike

back on tatooine, luke meets beru and owen, beautiful call back shot of the two suns from new hope ends the movie, perfect ending

	<TEXT> because of you Sith Lords, I decided to complete my running commentary for episode three

the opening shot following obi wan and anakin's two fighters then revealing the epic scale of the battle is jaw dropping.  coruscant is an awesome backdrop in the shots 

I know lucas actually used a combo of cg and models but whatever he did with this opening battle it looks amazing 

cool, anakin no longer looks like a teenbop coverboy 

obi wan and anakin trying to get past the vulture droids, lucas indisputably knows how to direct spacefight scenes

oddball is the call sign of a clone, I wonder if he was in the animated clone wars?  I saw it a while back but cant remember 

when anakin compliments r2, he really seems more comfortable in his own skin and matured

buzz droids attacking! love the variety and depth of the world

obi wan in trouble, says hes running out of tricks but he hasnt tried spinning smh

anakin saves obi wan's life only to try to kill him at the end, tragic 

nice little touch with r2 taking out buzz droid

I am just really starting to realize that they were fighting above coruscant, dooku was very close to winning if it werent for obi wan and anakin, tragic!

the nemoidian talking to grievous doesnt have a bad asian accent like in episode one, also I recall the one in episode two didnt have it either, you cant say lucas didnt try to improve 

obi wan and anakin take out an elevator full of droids, anakin seems like his powers have indeed doubled 

anakin and obi wans bickering seems also to have matured, they really are more like brothers now

lol at the rivalry between obi wan and anakin about r2 and implicitly r4

three way fight with dooku begins, much has been said about spinning and jumping shit, but there is real weight and tension in each attack here

they did a good job replacing dooku's head with cg

lol the extra reason for anakin not to kill dooku came after he killed him, so hes needing less reason to kill.  nice to see hes still conflicted though.  I wonder if Palpatine somehow gave anakin the edge over dooku

I thought anakins outfit was black but now I think it might be more of a dark brown, if so, a nice progression from light to dark

classic side of ship to side of ship firing, but in space

I cant help but wonder what dooku's republic wouldve looked like, he knew the corruption in the senate and jedi council to an extent but also fought as a sith

grievous looks amazing

"youre a lot shorter than I expected," "jedi scum", the humor without jar jar is just the right tone 

love how the good guys keep getting captured

those roman sentry droids look cool

anakin trying to land says "extend all flaps and drag fins", lucas' love of flying is showing 

sheev looks actually worried hes going to die lol

the problem qui gon had reacting to the green screen during the fish attack in episode one doesnt look like a problem anymore during the landing with anakin and obi 

great shot of ani and obi getting close to camera as they land

coruscant still looks amazing

its shameful how manipulated the jedi council was by sheev

sam jackson needs to say motherfucker once and id be complete

padme rocking the buns, so much hotter than leia

hes eventually happy but i wonder why ani hesitates when padme says shes pregnant

coruscant at night is blade runnerish

love john williams music from start to finish of all the movies

dayum, hayden without his shirt, has filled out nicely

padme's apartment seems to have the best view of all of coruscant 

ani is revealing his premonition to padme and hayden is acting circles around natalie

seeing the jedi temple reminded me of a thought from episode 2, the youngling who gives the answer to where kamino is looks like the same youngling anakin kills at the end 

aang from avatar goes through same dilemma as ani when theyre told to let go of love, here it's clearly an either or situation, I forget how avatar resolved it but he did end up happily with katara and his powers didnt suffer

palpatine gets granted more emergency powers to fight the war, reminds me of bush

obi warns ani to beware palpatine and in next scene, palpatine says trust me, he mustve sensed ani's doubt 

sheev putting anakin on the council is a masterful move and so is the council asking ani to be a double agent, poor ani, much tragedy

ani takes the request and everything personally, obi reminds him it's not him asking, I seem to remember maybe in the clone war series there was an answer to this dilemma of balancing love and the force

"have you ever considered that we may be on the wrong side?"  "what do you mean?"  "what if the democrqcy we thought we were serving no longer exists.  and the republics c has become the very evil we've been fighting to destroy?"  "I dont believe that and youre sounding like a separatist." "this war represents a failure to listen."  - this conversation could be had now and im not sure which side id take

lol now padme is asking anakin to talk to sheev.  anakin is torn on not just two but three sides and from the one he loves most.  padme told ani before that democracy is hard when both sides think theyre right.  ani is living it now </TEXT>

	<TEXT> great write up.  it's fascinating to get someone's thoughts as they happen.  a couple things I differ on is that I thought there was too much green screen at genosis,  it was the first time in the series for me that it became distracting.  even most of the sand was cg.  

also, I think the romance couldve been less cringey if they bonded at the start but anakin was pretty creepy the whole time.  I think padme shouldve had a bigger reaction after anakin's admission he killed the tusken women and children, but perhaps shes just a really out of touch queen and had no thought about the tusken other than what shed been told that they were animals.  but overall I think they did a good job with the romance and you gave a great read on their characters.  theyre both flawed people who cling to the past, one in a good way the other in a bad, so what happened seems like it was the only logical conclusion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hello there, darth u/hideous!  I too have just begun a prequel marathon but since I have no gif ability, I wanted to share my play by play of episode one 

so far a lot more sets than expected, the Neimodian ships are sets with green screen for the windows equivalent to the matte paintings in the ot

blu ray looks great.  much less sterile, more definition than dvds.  but definitely the dark or dirty scifi aesthetic is not what theyre going for here which kinda makes sense as films go from light to dark

Neimodians' racial casting is awful

every line is memeable, must resist the urge to type them all down

god, liam neeson must be half a foot taller than McGregor.  already the tone is set, jokier and lighter based on their dialogue than the ot though I remember ot had quite a few jokes with r2 and c3po to start 

whoa, qui gon and obi wan escaped the droidekas using superspeed

Fuck, it's jar jar.  him saying "my" instead of "i" has me asking "why."  gungans are supposed to be creole I guess, racial casting is truly horrible.  I get hes supposed to be comic relief but he is a no buts about it disaster

gungan city is beautiful.  

the vfx holds up very well ie the droids 

the green screen is showing when they leave gungan city and are attacked by the giant fish, qui gon hardly reacts

naboo scenes clearly all shot on location (also remember this was said on commentary)

natalie portman is too wooden, I guess shes supposed to be a queen but she probably shouldve really britished it up

damn, ani and padme just met, hes way too young for her, creepy how they vet together.  still, cute and innocent enough meeting

jake lloyd is great, he really nails the character, innocent but flashes of anger

he just said "yippee".  yep, still awful

tattoine scenes also clearly shot on location.  watto's shop is a set

watto cg holds up well

interesting that the tatooine scenes revolve around junk as in new hope

the market stall owner looks like hes in a costume/make up instead of cg

lucas seems to love open market scenes as in indiana jones 

every scene jar jars in, im just looking the other way.  seeing a lot of interesting stuff in the frame id never seen before, little details of acting, props 

I forgot darth maul could talk.  and apparently hes british

anakins mom has an accent, maybe Greek?

qui gon's out-negotiating watto for the podrace, impressive 

a lot of jar jars bits can be cut and wouldn't affect the story -other than making it better.  so george if you can hear me how about a special edition of phantom menace 

qui gons lied quite a bit, to ani about freeing slaves and about why he was taking his blood, to watto at their first negotiation 

at the hangar before the podrace, nice to notice many of the aliens in the background arent cg

the hanger is also an extended set 

ani's friend just said "this is so wizard".  too bad that never caught on

and theres the tusken raiders, they actually helped ani win by taking out some of his competition

podrace scene is exciting as I remember 

the heck, is that willow next to watto during the race?

padme just tucked ani in with a blanket, creepy

coruscant looks amazing 

"there is no civility, only politics.  the republic is not what it once was.  the senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.  there is no interest in the common good.  the chancellor has little real power.  he is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.  the bureaucrats are in charge now.  our best choice would be to push for the election of a stronger supreme chancellor.  one who could control the bureaucrats and give us justice." - parallel with current state of american politics is timely 

I didnt understand anything about politics when I first watched it but whoa, palpatine was a senator from naboo.  padme is partly responsible for palpatine's rise

"enter the bureaucrat.  the true rulers of the republic.  and on the payroll of the trade federation I might add".  lucas studied his roman history

Palpatine says tragedy twice in the senate scene.  I wonder why he loves that word.

qui gon went against the jedi council despite obi wan's warning and said he still has much to learn.  did qui gon know how ineffective the council had become?

they dwell quite a bit on anakin's fear of losing his mother.  very nice foreshadowing.

Palpatine's manipulation to become chancellor is brilliant.  he schemes with the trade federation to blockade naboo, manipulated padme to ask for a no confidence vote against then chancellor valorum, knowing naboo's blockade would give them the sympathy vote 

lol obi wan warns qui gon about anakin being dangerous to take on as a padawan learner and qui gon says "from your point of view."

r/getmotivated quote from qui gon to ani, "your focus determines your reality."

yes, the duel of fates!

qui gon and darth maul's deaths are effective, good job 

yoda's cg holds up well 

love the celebration scenes at the end

okay that's it.  final thoughts: love the depth and originality of the story, some flaws but blocked out jar jar and enjoyed it, memorable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but he did leave his studio.  they shot in italy and went back to tunisia for the sand stuff.

youre not speaking to the motivation though, youre talking about the process, if he was going for the look of a futuristic and ideal republic, I think he achieved it.  whether or not it works is subjective.

ok so now youre talking about use of space and green screen making it feel empty/artificial (ill add in cinematography), but if youre an artist and you want to make it a point the republic is corrupt/empty, it makes sense to try to be sterile.  I still would've preferred it more "natural" though.  I think many of its flaws couldve been overlooked if it looked a little cooler -ot had flaws aplenty - despite the artistic motivation argument.  but you know I think he was trying to push the envelope as he had done with ot and I dont fault him too hard for that.  

yes, I was trying to say ilm's work led to yoda and Gollum but explained it poorly

	<TEXT> be george lucas

make star fucking wars

spearhead creation of indiana jones franchise 

create ilm thats done cgi for every big tentpole like jurassic park

inspired james fucking cameron to get into movies

give fans up close look of how star wars was made because you want to share, knowledge they will later use against you because they have no fucking clue how collaborative movie and tv industry is

decide to fix a few things always wrong with ot, most good which goes unnoticed, some you prob should have left alone, but hey those fans will still have the originals 

but at this point no one says no because youre george fucking lucas 

decide to finally give fans what they want and creates the prequels

no one says no when you decide to push boundaries of film again and film mostly with green screen (though no one remembers you still used a shit ton of practical effects and sets and models).

no one says no when you create jar jar

no one says no when you go for a cinematagraphic look that is too clean which makes the cgi more sterile (though thematically makes sense, light to ot's dark)

but you got bombass music from john williams for ot

and ewan mcgregor as obi wan and liam neeson as qui gon

and a story that parallels nazi Germany's rise

and does the exposition work needed for ot to make sense

also sweetass worlds like the wookies'

fanboys revolt and say you ruined their childhood, bully jake lloyd into mental illness

you get fed up with fanboys but still want them see your life's work continue and sell it to Disney

they reject most of your story ideas and instead rehash new hope which is opposite of what new hope was, intended to break new ground

you see fanboys love the rehash and start even comparing it to the ot

you see another director like peter jackson fuck up but not get nearly enouh same hate

a minority of lucas fans know what you did, and shit like midichlorians are just a sign of the force, not the force itself

but majority hate you

fans become as emotional and ugly and controlling like the sith despite what you tried to teach them in the movies 

you have no idea why your work has suddenly become so unpopular

because you were george fucking lucas </TEXT>

	<TEXT> finally, people who can understand!

I believe the prequels use of green screen was artistically motivated.  Filmmakers do it all the time: a movie starts out bright and gets darker as it progresses, both with story, lighting and mise en scene.  

Also I'd like to point out for those who haven't watched the extras on the prequels that it had many sets (iirc 72, rewatching now and much fewer green screen was used, most of ship scenes were on sets including ; models, and existing locations (most of the Naboo scenes were shot in Italy, desert scenes in Tunisia, Anakin and Amidala's retreat in episode 2, Uncle Owen' home, they rebuilt the corridor from a picture of one from episode 4 for the ship in episode 3).  It's the bright "pure" aesthetic they were going for that made it seem artificial.

Two more points: the ot had the equivalent green screen use in its use of matte paintings throughout, to name the ones off the top of my head, Luke and Leia's rope swinging scene in the Death Star, the fighter launch bay at the end of movie one, the exterior shot of Cloud City.  

And Lucas wanted to give audiences something new; as the founder of ILM, that was by delivering vfx that had been behind the hits of movies like Jurassic Park.  I remember from the extras that he had wanted to go with the Yoda puppet in the prequels but his team had impressed him with their CG Yoda and again, CG Yoda was in keeping with the polished look of the prequels.  Indeed, it broke ground for later CG characters such as Gollum.  

Tldr: Lucas has pushed the envelope his entire career and with the prequels, has been misunderstood

An aside: I believe the pent up demand for more Star Wars was so great that anything other than nearly exact clones of the ot would have satisfied the fanbase which is why TFA was so popular, moreso when the prequels didn't give the fans exactly that (yes I'll be the first to admit it had its flaws but the shame is completely dismissing its highs, and it came from an older and more meditative filmmaker).  

Also, Lucas had been perhaps too transparent giving fans an inside look at how the sausage was made so some of the magic was taken away, and so it was easy to armchair quarterback his decisions as a director which were reduced to his working with talented people when it is par for the course and to have many bad ideas on the table to get to the good ones.

	<TEXT> you have no clue how much they have to know to be able to open up a store.  ten years to master something is not a hard rule but if they been working since they were 19 then I guess it fits into your rigid definition.  plus most tech schools are less than four years. in any case, maybe you feel more comfortable with specialist.  basically, stop hating on people doing their thing.  trust me, no one really cares about what anyone does, it's either love or envy and life's too short. </TEXT>
