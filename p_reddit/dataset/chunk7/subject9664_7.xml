	<TEXT> I understand that breasts aren't genitals, but they are sexual organs, and not just because some men ages ago decided that we can shame women with them. Men's chests are not sexual organs in the same way, and not just because we're used to seeing them more.

Women's bodies are different from men's bodies. Is it double standards that women don't have urinals in their bathrooms? No, because they have different bodies. I understand that people want to argue that women's breasts aren't sexual organs, but I assure you that men don't feel the way they do about them just because they're not used to seeing them.

Edit: Also I want to state that I'm not arguing for or against a woman's right to go topless in public. I just think there is no hypocrisy or double standards at play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so you're saying that if hygiene wasn't an issue, then public nudity of ALL kinds should be absolutely fine. That's a perfectly fine stance to have, but it's one I think you have to accept. Although it may be your argument against public nudity, there any many people who consider it inappropriate for reasons aside from hygiene. 

The reason I'm pressing this point is that you seem to imply that people single out female breasts, when they don't, because they feel the same about genitals of both genders, and not for hygiene reasons. My point is, there is no hypocrisy or double standards at play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've sidestepped the argument by bringing in hygiene. There are many situations where hygiene isn't really an issue, for example, the beach.

Your second argument can also be applied to full nudity. I don't think you have a serious argument unless you can address this issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think that people, both men and women, should be allowed to go fully nude in public? If not, then why not? It seems like you have selected toplessness because you see it as "unfair" that men get to go topless and women don't. The thing is, female breasts are much more of a sexual organ than the male chest. That's probably a mix of culture and biology, but that's not changing any time soon. 

Even if you changed the laws (I don't know what they are) about women going topless in public, how do you expect to change how men "feel" about breasts. What point are you actually arguing? Are you just stating that it's not fair? Because it's also not fair that women have to deal with periods every month, or experience pain in childbirth. These things aren't decided by men, they're the way things are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In most cases, I don't consider lying about something rape. That doesn't mean it's ok, obviously. I don't think it is useful to stretch the definition of rape to things like saying you don't have a girlfriend to someone. I'm sure there are exceptions and extreme situations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly, do you not think it's a good thing to try to speak out against the injustices in the world, to help change the world for the better, however slight that change may be in the grand scheme of things. For example, should gay people have not said anything about the prejudice that they faced? Change doesn't happen if nobody vocalises the problems and injustices. That goes from important things like racial prejudice, to more insignificant things like a workplace environment being demotivating.

Secondly, people are people, they need to express how they feel. Everyone has problems. It gets you through life to share them. I'll share with friends or a partner problems as big as someone i care about dying to as small as missing a train, and they will to me in return. It helps us through life. It doesn't mean that we don't realise that many people have it much worse off than us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I believe that anything that you hide from your partner where they would not consent to sex with you if they were informed of it is considered Rape by Deception.

This is a problem, because you don't know what every person's boundaries are. Some people wouldn't sleep with someone if they'd slept over a certain number of people. It's not rape to not disclose that information beforehand. So what's the difference? 

You can say that there are many people would be MORE upset by finding out a partner's birth gender is different than they thought. That still doesn't make it rape, whether it's ethical or not.

You haven't provided a reason why birth gender is somehow different to religion, race, number of partners, sexuality, favourite football team, etc etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To the people claiming they don't get why it's cringey, it's because a man is being told off in the middle of doing his job on live tv, which is probably quite embarrassing for him. Something can be cringey and funny at the same time. I don't know why there are always comments saying "this isn't cringe". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I'm focusing on that definition is because you've defined "God" but then are using that definition to make claims about a different definition of God. 

I accept that you can define God in the way that are you (albeit unhelpfully), but you can't use that to make any logical claims about religion or belief systems. 

I'm not just disputing your premise, I'm also disputing your conclusion. If God is all, I believe that many belief systems are not true. You say that if God is all, then the bible is the word of God. Which definition of God are you using, your definition or the Bible's very different definition. The Bible claims it is the word of the Christian God. It doesn't claim it's the word of your God definition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it wouldn't matter unless I was talking to another person (because then they don't know what I'm talking about)

You are talking to other people and I have no idea what you are talking about because you are taking a word and using it in a way that doesn't make sense.

So let's call it "goopurt".

The major world religions don't really have anything to say about goopurt, they make claims about various Gods. When they make claims that are true, that is goopurt, as goopurt is everything. If they make claims that are false, for example about the nature of God, that is goopurt too. Because goopurt is everything. Just because something is goopurt doesn't make it true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God has a specific meaning, which it seems like you have changed without justifying why.

You can't just say "God is everything". What does that actually mean? By most definitions, God is a personal and powerful creator, of some sort. 

What evidence do you have that God is everything?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem stuck on the point that being black makes you "more likely to be prone to crime".

I want to take the analogy that  /u/wonkay gave and explore it.

Imagine that 70% of American boys had their legs operated (for whatever reason) on to make them significantly weaker at running fast. 

Now the statistics will say that American men are bad at running. 

Now do you think it's reasonable to say to an American man who has not had that operation as a child, that he is more likely to be bad at running because he is an American man.

If he explains to you that he hasn't had the operation as a child and that he is a very fast runner, will you tell him that the statistics don't lie and the "reasons" behind them don't matter?

The reason why racism is bad is that we should judge people as individuals, not based on statistics.  </TEXT>
