	<TEXT> Listen buddy boy. 

If you get it, then you would understand that the voting at the end of a skirmish match is pointless if everyone leaves after the match. Which happens constantly.

Secondly, the current matchmaking is garbage. So the more posts that point this out the better. The matchmaking should have more variables. Some people want to play 4v4 with no boosts or equipment stats, then let them queue with these settings. Some people want to queue for duels with boosts and equipment boosts, then let them. 

Some people want to queue with all randoms and no preset teams, etc. 

Now go take your meds and take a nap. You sound tired and confused.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When you want to play 4v4 elimination and you need to wrestle with the matchmaker that means that the matchmaker is broken. 

It's very simple:

If I set it to elimination, it shouldn't *try it's best* to put me in an elimination game. It should either put me in an elimination or make me wait longer until one opens up. Not put me in a god damn skirmish game. 

Whoever designed this matchmaker system is really low brow. 

In fact, not only should I have the option to set it to 4v4 elimination. I should also have the option to set it to no Equipment stats etc. 

Let the players decide what is feasible and enjoyable for the matchmaker. 

Furthermore, we need a mercenary mode. I don't want to play against preset teams of 3 to 4 against my team of all ransoms. 

Come on Ubisoft, this is 2017. Matchmaking and its standardization have evolved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have any, but my dad did. He used to tell me about all the snowmobile, atv, hunting, fishing trips that my grandfather used to take my uncle and my dad on. 

They would head into the bush and sleep under the stars, or in a tent depending on the season. Always with their rifles and hand guns, hunting and/or fishing. 

When my dad was older, early 20s, his parents split up. My grandfather bought a huge acreage farm. My dad would head out there once in a while, and sometimes they would just sit in the porch of his house and shoot coyotes out in the fields. My dad told me these were some of the best times he had with his dad out at that farm. 

My dad never took me out to do the same types of things. Different locations and circumstances, but I have some physical pictures of their moments. 

I envy this type of shit. I feel like I missed out on some of the best things that life offers.  </TEXT>

But every time you go into a gun shop, the owners or employees have a little smile on their face, are really friendly, really informative, and always make you feel like you aren't going to get ripped off.

Any secret to their happiness? Just a fulfilling job? They deal with great customers on the constant? Interesting products?

Or am I the only one who have these good experiences? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because the media never emphasizes how progressive tax systems work. If people understand the progressive tax and YOUR effective tax rate, then people would understand that the current taxes aren't that bad. The people with more disposable income pay more taxes.

Fox news clumps people making 30k a year with people making over 250k a year, with this idea that the 35% tax rate is all encompassing.

I'm Canadian, and we seem to have a better understanding about the progressive tax system here. I think it's because we learn a little about it in high school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my memory it wasn't sexual conduct. The artist painted them in a natural way. 

I don't remember the details but it wasn't "sexual". 

It was a public art gallery for artistic value. Not sexually stimulating. I can't find the incident but it was a while ago. 

The issue at hand is where do we draw the line between art from original mind (from the mind without a real subject), and then actual child pornography. 

We need to protect the interest of children, but not at the expense of over reaching laws that put legitimate artists in jail for drawing art. 

I'm not an artist myself but I'm sure people could interpret what the artist was trying to accomplish by doing what he did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This right here. 

I remember taking a law class once where you really learn how a lot of laws have overreaching breadth. 

In Canada we had an election coming up, and the incumbent government wanted to be tougher on Sex offenders. 

They wrote a law where basically it had such overreach that even artists portraying art in a public art gallery were shutdown and arrested. I think the artists painted pictures of naked children, painted from his mind, not actual subjects. 

If a 17 year old couple video taped themselves having sex and possessed that video when they turned 18, they were in possession of child pornography. 

I'm all for going after people producing real child pornography and real sex offenders doing especially heinous sexual assault, but I also want to make sure none of these laws are over reaching, especially for political gain and agendas. 

These people writing the laws are elected because we believe them to be intelligent enough to write laws to protect society, protect the innocent, and respect the super law(constitution).  </TEXT>

But can you blame them when the government came up with silly colour coded degrees of terrorist danger?

The government fabricated a boogeyman to make up for their own inept ability to prevent 9/11. They knew that there was an organization out there planning to use planes to attack the US and ignored it., or didn't take it seriously enough. 

They then invaded Americans personal rights to privacy and life in an attempt to what? I still don't know what the patriot act achieved. 

What they did achieve is a destabilized Middle East, a population of Americans who can't dissent because they are either labeled as traitors, or worse terrorist. 

I love seeing some accountability on the government. These whistleblowers are needed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who played end game ffxi back in 2003 and early 2004, I came back because of the trusts. 

Anyone who played back then knew the pain of doing things. You had to either get your linkshell to help or you had to fuss with the translator (most of the high levels were JP after the NA launch because the game launched in Japan before NA). 

The other reason is because places like sky were a pivotal part of my time in ffxi back then. Watching my alliance both kill and get slaughtered by sky bosses was fun. 

Sky was one of those places in a video game that felt living and breathing. It pulled out linkshell together to overcome its challenges. 

Seeing things like the hauberk and sniper rings being dirt cheap today also is hilarious. 

Hanging out in lower jueno before the Ah's were linked was crazy too. 

Chains of promethia the first day it came out was nuts. Crafters making a fortune off of lvl 30 gear. Chains of promethia was both difficult and wonderful. 

Lastly, while the community is friendly and helpful now, I miss my old ffxi comrades. Something about this game pulled the community together. 

So in short, what brought me back was the curiosity of changes to the game, state of the community, and trusts. Also the game was on sale for $10, can't argue giving it a go again at that price point.  </TEXT>
