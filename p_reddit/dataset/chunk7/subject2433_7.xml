	<TEXT> Mainly trying to lose weight. Like with diet, I may eat healthy for 1 day, but then the urge to eat unhealthy overpowers me the next day. I try working out, but I can barely do more than 19 minutes on a bike at the gym before getting tired/bored </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up with a controlling mother, and was used to her being the leader of my life and doing things for me and telling me what to do, and I let it happen because I love her and trusted her. She thought she was helping me making my life easier but really she was setting me up for failure because I never learned how to be the leader of my life. Subconsciously, I am constantly searching for someone else to make me happy or tell me what to do.

I believe this is why I procrastinate so much and lack motivation to do anything. what can I do about this? how can I take control of my life? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really sure. All I know is that I was prescribed antidepressants.

Though how did you get those thoughts out of your head? No matter what I try, I can't get rid of them, unless I'm playing video games or something </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was recently diagnosed with depression by a physician, and it seems to fit. it kinda explains why its been so hard to try and achieve goals and improve.

has anyone here been able to work through it though and overcome it? as I mentioned, its so hard right now to achieve goals like trying to lose weight,and going to the gym doesn't seem to help even though I thought its supposed to. right now it just feels like I'm not living life, and even more so since the days just seem to drag on with nothing to do, and usually ends up with me going to bed extremely early

so any tips on achieving goals and being productive while depressed? I don't want to have to wait for months while the meds they gave me take effect before I can start doing things.

also has anyone been able to completely conquer depression and lead a happy and successful life? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do i stop comparing myself and my life with others? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> my friend pointed this out to me the other day, and he's right, I am always comparing my life to others and it is always making me miserable and ruining my goals

for some reason, I always see myself as inferior to other people when I compare myself or others, or my life seems less fun and exciting when comparing it to other peoples

it makes it feel like I need to play catch up with other people in life. every time I try starting a goal, it ends up turning into "but this friend is already way ahead of me, I'll never catch up to him so why bother"

I also compare my quality of life with others. for example, this summer break from college I'm stuck at home with no friends, while everyone from college is posting on Facebook about going on road trips with friends and doing all kinds of things like that which I wish I could be doing this summer.

I don't know how to stop. Its hard to avoid, since it seems like it always happens when people talk about their lives. and my life always seems to suck in comparison </TEXT>
