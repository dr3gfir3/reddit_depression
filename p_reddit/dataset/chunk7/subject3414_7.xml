	<TEXT> No me, but my mother. 
She says the only thing keeping her alive is knowing that her family loves her no matter what. 
I noticed you said you live in a small town, so do we. 
My mum self diagnosed herself by researching all her symptoms on the internet, after printing of something like 60 pages and taking them to the doctor, she was able to be put through to a specialist who confirmed what she had found to be true.   
She has depression but wont admit. Its hard for her, not being able to work anymore is the worst thing for her. She says that she feels like a burden because our family only has one source of incomes. 
We dont go on holidays anymore because of her illness. She cant do many day to day tasks like the average person. Im just rambling a bit here, but its hard for her, and for us. Its not easy to watch your hero go through pain day after day and not do anything to help. 
I asked my mum your question, and this is her answer to you. 
"Hi Tomqvaxy, its not easy having an illness, once you have it, all you want to do is get better, and you cant. That is the worst thing about it. If you have a supporting family who is there for you every waking minute of the day, it will be easier to live with. Just know that there is help out there for you, and what ever you can get, take it. I wish you all the best with things, and please feel free to talk to either me or subject3414 at any time."

Hope this gives you a bit of help. Inbox me anytime you need a chat. 
Sending my wishes your way.  </TEXT>

A few times at a round-about, i've thought I've got enough time to go, but this guy looks like he is traveling pretty fast, so I might wait a extra few seconds, and sure enough, they are, and for all I know, it could have been a life saving decision.  
I must say though, my accident only gave me really bad whiplash, and soreness around my arms and back from the impact, so I wasnt in that bad of a shape, my dad made me get in the car the day after it happen and drive him to work. It was the hardest thing i've ever done. I broke down crying 3 times and had to pull over.  </TEXT>

I havent been accepted yet, but since announcing to my family my decision have been so supportive like never before. 
Im focusing more on my fitness and health, and starting to study which I did not do much off during my schooling years. 
My Uncle has been the most supportive has none of his kids decided to join the Australian Defense Force, and knowing that his niece is joining in his honor and to try and start a tradition of keeping our family name i n the ADF has made him extremely proud, and I dont think there can be a better feeling then having your family proud of you.  </TEXT>

Friends my age (20yr old) only care about drinking and party every weekend, and is okay working in an average job for the rest of their life. Myself on the other hand, complete opposite. I'm always thinking about what will benefit me in the future, and what is best for myself. And theres nothing wrong with that at all!
