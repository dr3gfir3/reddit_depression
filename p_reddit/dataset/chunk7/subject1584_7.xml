	<TEXT> When I played the game Until Dawn for the first time, it was about 3 in the morning and I was playing through a (very loud) headset with all of the lights off. There was a jump scare that freaked me out so bad I leapt out of my chair, clawed the headset off of my head, and screamed "FUCK" as I threw the headset at the TV instinctively. The headset cracked the TV. I was playing at a friend's house. It was his TV.  </TEXT>
