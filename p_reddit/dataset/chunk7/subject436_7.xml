	<TEXT> Question is if it's beneficial on the long run, aka decreases mortality/morbidity. It's been known for a while that doses up 10,000 UI/day are (apparently) safe.

Also, it's strange, if it's 600 IU for most people, why do supplement labels always list 400 IU as 100%?

I'd assume it's because they didn't update their information. IOM (after much debate...) published the new Daily References Intake recommandations in 2010

	<TEXT> The new study, which involved more than 77,000 adults, found that people consuming healthy vegetarian diets may have a lower risk of colon and rectal cancers than non-vegetarians, Orlich said.

"Our vegetarians not only **ate less meat than the non-vegetarians, but also less sweets, snack foods, refined grains and caloric beverages**," he said. And they ate more fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans and nuts, he added.


Peer reviewed research paper source http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2174939

Vegetarian diets are associated with an overall lower incidence of colorectal cancers. Pescovegetarians in particular have a much lower risk compared with nonvegetarians. If such associations are causal, they may be important for primary prevention of colorectal cancers. </TEXT>
