	<TEXT> Not ones with real significant powers. 

That's not really accurate, larger councils (as in not parish councils) absolutely deal with substantive issues, and have responsibilities that are pretty important. That would include housing, education (although academisation has changed that), transport, fire and public safety, social care (hence issues there..), some aspects of health provision, transport and so on.  A lot of what has an impact on day to day life for a lot of people is a council responsibility. 

Councils have to fund a lot of fairly important things, council funding cuts really hurt that (councils had to stop funding things that weren't core, and cut back on core services, hence why so many places lost libraries and similar..) and if you look at the devolution models for places like Manchester, you can see how government could shift costs and blame further if it goes that way.

The two agencies aren't leaving in the next few weeks either.. 

 They should leave when we do.

Why? They should move when the EU has set up alternatives (which they are only now starting to do..). An orderly transition, on both sides makes sense after all. It's not like they are packing up and leaving next week, the EU has just made it clear that it is starting the process of identifying where they will move to, and will move.  That'll take time anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, quite the opposite, it's important. 

We merged the state with religion, have bishops in the Lords, prayers before meetings, state sanctioned religion in schools and I think partially because of that, and more, we treat religion as an unimportant cultural addon that's sort of nice, no-one actually believes in any of it, but we know the words to some of the songs, and the ideas are non-threatening, and frankly we occasionally wonder if the priests actually believe in god..

The US on the other hand has strict separation, no religion in schools, protests against prayers near meetings and as a result, they have people screaming about religious persecution, religion being vital in politics, visible religiosity being demanded, violent anti-abortion events on the back of religion, mega-churches that both fuel more religiosity and drag in money from people who can least afford it and so on..

We essentially made religion irrelevant by making it less about faith and more about culture and politics, that seems to work quite well... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having a preference is one thing but how strong and for what reason?

Broadly a weak preference (in that it wasn't a high priority) and a variety of different reasons...

It seemed pretty clear to me that many leave voters, voted that way due to local issues that had nothing to do with the EU whatsoever. 

I'm not sure it was particularly and anti-Westminster vote, although there was a bit of an anti-politician vote (aimed at both the EU and Westminster).  But again, there were a lot of different drivers, some valid, some less so, and on both sides of the issue.

It wasn't that long ago that leaving the EU was little more than a pipe dream and joining the euro was the main EU related issue in the UK.

You'd be right to say that not long ago, leaving the EU was seen as a political impossibility, no-one was offering it, but then again joining the Euro was pretty much a non starter too, there was little to no support. Even at the height of Labours popularity there wasn't enough support to push it through.

It was mainly brought up by parties like the BNP which most people don't want to be associated with. 

That isn't true. You've had sections of both the Conservative and Labour party who were anti-EU, they were just never the controlling factions. On the harder left and harder right there has always been an anti-EU preference (On the right for reasons around immigration, nationalism and the ability to legislate on areas that were under EU control, and on the left for reasons of anti-globalisation, anti-capitalism, internationalism, the idea that the EU is broadly hostile to the 'global south' and the ability to legislate on areas that were under EU control.. However, broadly the major parties platforms were pro-EU, so if you wanted sane health, education, defence, transport and other policies, you had little choice.

While there were other parties like UKIP, the Referendum party and Veritas their support was incredibly low. 

Indeed, and quite self-destructive. That's what I was talking about in terms of there being little political choice, no real options to express an anti-EU view (especially recently) at the ballot box, without also voting for parties that were pretty problematic.  That meant people felt disconnected and not listened to on the issue.. Not positive for the EU and a good culture to grow scepticism in, quite correctly..

While the press were Eurosceptic and politicians tried everything not to appear to be too nice on Europe..

It wasn't a high priority, and no-one in the centre of politics would stand up for it, but a lot of people were euro-sceptic. You would not be surprised to find someone in favour of leaving the EU, and even less surprised to find people who were critical of it.

It has less support in the UK than it does in many other developed countries....  It is pretty clear that the UK has the opposite agenda as shown by the ban last year .

Yes.. But there is quite a bit of popular support for it.. 47% of people in the UK would like to see legalisation, 39% don't.. It's not a fringe issue (again, you don't have to look far to find people who support legalisation, and many of them in the centre ground when it comes to politics, but you'd have to look quite hard to find a major party supporting it..).

There are or at least use to be many people who would say yes in a poll to pretty much any referendum...

That's slightly misleading though, essentially that's polling to suggest that people would like to have a say in things, but broadly people don't call for them, and the UK doesn't have them on minor issues..

Personally, I was against it when it was first announced so you can't accuse me of opposing it just because I didn't get the result that I wanted.

You'll note I haven't..

It was David Cameron who pushed for it and he managed to convince people from other parties to vote for it..

The point is that our representatives, the ones we elected, overwhelmingly voted to give people a choice on this issue, in part because one side of the argument was poorly represented.  In democratic terms that seems like a net positive.  You could of course argue that they failed in their primary duty, and instead we should have had a 'leave the EU' bill with the attendant lobbying and consultation instead, but I'm not sure that would have fixed the underlying issues..

Not really, David Cameron announced his intentions about 3 years before announcing the date that it was going to be held. During that period there was little debate and the only real major debate was the Clegg v Farage thing during the European Elections...

That's not how I saw it in the UK, although of course my view will likely be different from other peoples.. The issue started to come up in lots of related areas (doing some work in TTIP it came up again and again..), there was certainly more focus on Europe, people became more aware of what was going on and informed themselves about the EU (which both helped cement opposition and support...).  The noise levels grew at the end, but the discussion seemed to start much, much earlier.

UKIP always did that but it was only then that they had enough support to do that. However the EU wasn't in the top issues for many UKIP voters.

I'd argue that for UKIP voters, the EU was the top issue across the board. UKIP tried to tie everything into the EU, even in local elections.. It was all about the EU, all the time... I'd also argue that the EU was the only sensible position that UKIP had to attract voters from other parties, without the EU, UKIP was just BNP light.  Frankly it'll be interesting to see where UKIP goes without the EU as a central issue to tie things to..

To be honest they are pretty low in many countries so it isn't just a UK problem. People don't really have a strong enough reason to care about these elections as such don't vote. 

That's not an argument against my point though, it's arguably an argument that it's valid in more countries than just the UK.  You are right though, most people didn't care enough about these elections to vote, they didn't see that they had any influence at the EU level, and didn't really see governments representing their views at the EU level either. At that point, why vote...

UKIP do much better in them because so few people bother to vote and they spent so much time and effort in marketing themselves during them while other parties don't.

Absolutely, and they could get their core vote out.. It also helped that the EP elections were more proportional and over a wider region.

I don't agree one bit. There was a decent idea of what will happen, at least in the short term if remain won but nothing for leave. Such thing should be unacceptable in such an important vote.

We knew what would happen in the short term, because it's in the treaties. The UK would notify and then negotiate with the EU.  Everything else is up in the air and down to what can be agreed.. The government can promise literally nothing at this point, beyond that they won't take a deal that is actively damaging (where leaving without a deal makes more sense..).  They have and continue to lay out their approach in a very vague way, but frankly that's more long term anyway.  

It is actually rather contestable with many people arguing that it isn't. There has been loads and loads of articles about how it wasn't the will of the people. 

About the only thing that is clear from the referendum, is that more people would prefer to see the UK outside of the EU than in it. Anything else, the level of support for various approaches now, is up in the air.  Now I had a quick look at the links you dropped in and frankly, they are infuriating. Polling is less accurate than an actual referendum, we don't get to analyse polling data, which specifically requires you to get the weighting and extrapolation is right, and assume it is more accurate than the actual election.  We also don't get to look at demographic shifts and imply changes in opinion on the back of that.. We had a vote, in that vote, more people voted leave than voted remain by a small but significant margin. Turnout was reasonable and there hasn't been a significant shift back.  Yes, I'd have liked a larger margin (I'd actually bet that if we ran the vote again now, we'd see a larger margin..), but surely it is not reasonable to infer that actually people didn't mean to vote leave, or that leave voters are old and so will die soon etc.. but disregard an actual poll with tens of millions of votes..

That is why we needed a plan so people had less doubts on what they were voting.

We don't get to decide that though, it's a joine EU/UK negotiated position. 
 
That could simply be that people tend not to like change but once it is implemented they are more supportive of it.

Yes.. it could be that, and I suppose we will find out because the city level devolution is taking place.

It could be much better, if it was there would be little appetite for referendums as they would feel rather represented already. 

Agreed, although I think there is already little appetite for referendums.  That said if people were better represented generally, the UK would potentially already have left the EU.

FPTP creates a lot of disenfranchisement, I despise UKIP but it is unfair that they only got one seat with nearly 4 millions at the last election.

It is, and the same goes for parties like the Lib Dems and Greens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The public demand wasn't actually that great and was pretty much a non issue until fairly recently. 

It was a continuous low level thing though, and across the political spectrum. You had a lot of people (as evidenced by the referendum..) who had a preference for leaving..  The issue essentially was that it wasn't on offer by anyone you'd actually want to vote for (leaving UKIP..).

Leaving the EU was largely a fringe issue until the coalition. This issue pretty much crept up on many people. While the Conservatives have been fighting about Europe since Thatcher was PM.

I don't think it was a fringe issue in the sense that most people didn't have a view, but a fringe issue in that it was far less important than almost any other issue. It's a bit like saying legalising cannabis is a fringe issue, it is, but a huge number of people would support it if you offered it (and arguably it is an issue with more mainstream party support than leaving the EU...).

Referendums are very popular, in general even if I think that they are a terrible idea for many reasons. As such they are quite an easy thing to sell to the public. As on the surface they give the appearance of max participation.

I don't think that's terribly fair. There isn't a lot of support for other referendums, including on contentious issues. No-one is calling for a referendum on the privatisation (or not..) of the NHS for example, or a referendum on Tuition fees..  The EU referendum was more akin to the Scottish Independence referendum in that way, it was about governance and association, with no other political mechanisms available to make it an issue (without throwing away every other position..).  

And obviously it was a referendum that was authorised by Parliament, with the commons voting 544 to 53 in favour of holding a referendum with only the SNP opposing the Bill... It wasn't a government pushing something through, it was well supported by all parties, including parties that are now utterly opposed to the result.

It was one of many issues and to most people not a particularly important issue. It was through great effort that anti-EU people were successful at pushing their agenda. While the pro-EU side didn't really bother until it was far too late.

Very true, but again, once a referendum was offered, the discussion and debate essentially started immediately. It's not as though everyone ignored it until the official campaigns kicked off.  UKIP did a very, very good job of putting it front and centre of the political agenda once the referendum was on the cards, but that's to be expected. It became a more important issue once people became aware that they would actually be able to have some sort of input (something that had been missing in the UK, on the EU for a long time, as evidenced by the voter turnouts in EP elections..).

Then he shouldn't have hold the referendum if he wasn't going to plan for it. They don't actually put issues to bed and there was no excuse to think that it would work like that.

I mean, don't get me wrong, I agree with you that the government should have done the prep work in the run up to the election, but the lack of planning was by design.  And more to the point, you could argue that there was no need to plan for either outcome because the referendum was the starting point, there would be time after the result to plan to implement it.

No it wasn't people who voted leave were voting on what their perceptions on it were and if the alternative was pretty much the status quo it seemed rather attractive to many.

People would always have voted on what their perceptions of the result would be. It's not as though the government could have offered an exact outcome of things like the UK/EU negotiations (they'd have had to essentially say what they are saying now, which frankly would have been more beneficial to the leave side than remain..).  As it was you had discussions about what possibilities there were and what the issues with the EU were.

You don't have to have a referendum for those issues either and there a many other ways to deal with them. 

Such as?  The UK has elections, or referendums.. I suppose you could throw in public consultations and the like, but they still come down to parliamentary votes based on the outcomes of referendums..

The US for an example has a super majority system for major constitutional changes. While many other countries think that an electoral mandate is good enough. 

The UK generally takes the latter approach, except in a very few, select instances, AV, Scottish independence and the EU (joining and leaving I suppose) seem to have been the primary ones.  The UK could of course have just had a parliamentary vote to remove itself from the EU, but instead had a parliamentary vote to set up a referendum instead.. that seems reasonable.

I am personally not keen but if we are going to have a referendums especially on such monumental and wide ranging decisions there should be great care and effort put into them to make sure that they truly reflect the will of the people.

I don't think there is much question that the result of the EU referendum reflects what a majority of people want, that is to say they'd rather see the UK not be part of the EU. The issue really is the wider question of what the new relationship should look like. That is complex, and now that there is an indication that people want to be out of the EU, it seems that the nature of the relationship will be down to Parliament and this, and of course future governments.  Surely that is reasonable?

I would argue that Germany is much more successful MMP is a much better voting system than FPTP 

I'd mostly agree with you, although I've come to rather like the constituency link in the UK context and think something like AMS, to preserve the geographic link and create a more proportional outcome might be a way forward..

and Germany has embraced federalization but I digress. 

The UK has an issue there, there isn't any support for it. Even the devolution at the city level taking place now is essentially against the wishes of local populations.. That is something that probably needs sorting, but now I digress.

My point would be that the UK does a good job in terms of it's democracy, yes it has issues, but it does balance the various issues that we have in democratic systems reasonably well, as well as any other EU state at the very least.

The UK never had a nationwide one until 1975 and as such it is a pretty recent thing. In fact some people in the past thought that they were anti-British.

Indeed.

	<TEXT> I think someone did calculations on it a little while ago, essentially they took the UK's net contribution of 8.6bn (what the EU would lose) and compared it to the amount of people currently making use of EU freedom of movement  (1.2m) to assess what the EU might consider a reasonable contribution (annually, not one off) to cover the loss.  

Just redoing the numbers, it'd be 7100/y assuming just the people already in other parts of the EU took it up, 3500/y if everyone already in the EU, and a similar number in the UK took it up, and anything down to 500/y if everyone who voted remain took up the offer (although I dount all would, and no doubt some leave voters would..).

That said, I doubt the EU would take that approach and obviously it could be a lot less, and no doubt the rights you'd have would be different, but it's certainly interesting to think about.  I could see some glaring issues though, you'd hear complaints that people who voted leave would take advantage of it to retire and work in the EU etc.. Criticism that young people and poorer people would effectively be locked out because of costs and so on.

Still, 1000/y for EU citizenship doesn't sound too bad, if it takes off the EU might want to offer it as a way of making some money to other nationalities..

	<TEXT> The referendum was called primarily for party political reasons and was rushed through with little considerations.

The referendum was called for political reasons, but those political reasons included public demand. There has been support for a straight in/out referendum in the UK for quite a while, and a long period of people not having their views on the EU being represented by any of the major political parties.  That suggests that as well as the political reasons, there was a practical and very sensible reason to call a referendum.

The campaigns made practically no effort to contribute to constructive debate and inform the public. 

That I can't fault, the campaigns were pretty shite, but then the discussions on the EU started well before the campaigning did and there were many, although fewer than I would have liked, opportunities for people to debate and discuss the EU and the UKs membership.  

 There was no plan in place and David Cameron was so confident of a remain victory that it didn't matter. 

Cameron was confident of a victory and seemed to believe that not allowing the civil service to plan, and not having the government plan would aid the remain argument.  To be honest, the fact that leave won the argument despite that, and that the new government after Cameron's resignation put a plan together and is now running through that would suggest that the lack of a plan was somewhat immaterial to the referendum.  

I don't agree with referendums at the best of times but such terrible mismanagement is inexcusable.

That's a perfectly valid position to take, but it does raise the problem of how you deal with divisive issues that people can't get a resolution on in the normal political framework, whether that is electoral reform, independence, or membership of super-national unions.  There is a place for referendums, and in the UK at least, they are all authorised by a representative body in the first place (one that could act unilaterally on the issues too..) so it's not that problematic.

 Germany is a successful democracy that has outlawed such referendums and it has worked very well.

The UK is a successful democracy that has referendums reasonably rarely and it seems to have worked very well too, so I'm not sure that the referendums aspect is the biggest issue..

 There is no reason to hold referendums in a representative democracy anyway.

There are very few reasons to hold referendums in a representative democracy, but the exercise of self determination would be one good reason, determining the shape of governance would be another.  Mostly though you are right, you don't need a referendum for the every day running of a country. </TEXT>

I'd agree that having a two way agreement would make sense, but having it one way seems less optimal for the EU.

	<TEXT> Long story short, it only costs about 100 quid to stand in an election.

It costs nothing to stand in a local, and 500 in a parliamentary (and then goes up for regional). You can stand in a council election if you can get some mates to sign your nominations papers.  A little harder if you want to do it as a party (because you'd have to set up, and maintain that admin) but still not expensive.

You'd spend more on leaflets (free postage with a parliamentary run though) than on deposits in most cases, if you get one to everyone who can vote in any case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't. In the case of spain you can reside for three months. After that you have to apply for a visa and satisfy the conditions laid out in Spanish Order 1490.

Not quite, you would have to register with the authorities and obtain a residence certificate, (which requires you to prove you can support yourself financially and have healthcare insurance), but that isn't a visa, that's essentially showing that you conform to the requirements of exercising your right to free movement under the treaties. 

If you compare that to the requirements you'd need to meet to move to Spain as a non-EU citizens (well, in most cases anyway) it's far easier, and nothing like one of the visa processes, you also end up with more rights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be great for the EU. The inevitable brain drain from the UK to EU will be so much easier.

It'd continue the conditions under which the UK has operated for the last few decades, so I'm not sure why you'd see an increase in migration out of the UK, especially as it'd take the pressure off people who had intended to leave but see Brexit as a threat..  About all it'd do is mean that UK citizens had far more opportunities than EU ones (and remember, there are more UK citizens in Australia than across the EU..).

The UK is a developed economy where smart people can make a lot of money and live a decent life, that'll always be attractive to migrants and it'll make a brain drain far less likely than if the UK were an unattractive place to live for smart people.

I mean seriously, you think the EU would see this as an optimal outcome? EU migration to the EU under normal visa rules and any Brit can up and move whenever they want, set up businesses in the EU and generally access all the things they can now, but without the UK paying for that or reciprocating? 

I doubt that the vague notion that there may be some positive benefits from UK migration to EU countries, beyond what exists already will be sufficient to offset the negatives. If you add on political perception (Brits get to keep all their rights, but the UK has no responsibilities..) it gets even worse.

Now I'd agree that a sensible bilateral agreement makes a lot of sense, but the EU simply deciding that UK citizens can just keep whatever rights they have and be done with it seems unlikely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Political polarization in the US is a one-sided phenomenon. The right has been gunning toward the extreme right for decades. The GOP is now full of ideologues who refuse to acknowledge objective facts let alone attempt any bipartisanship. If you want to learn more, read about the southern strategy and how racism was used to pull white workers into the extreme right. Look up how the mercers and kochs have extorted the republican party to turn into the extreme right.

 Look to the ACA, which was the conservative healthcare plan. It was very similar to Romneycare. Romney is a conservative. The ACA received over 150 revisions from the republican party and it did not include a national public option (which is something the left wants and the right are against). It is a right wing plan. But when it came to vote, 0 republicans voted for it. Why is that? Why would republicans vote against their own plan just because a democrat was president? Could it be that the extreme right threatened to fund primaries of every moderate who voted for it, thereby eliminating the chance of bipartisanship? Why did republicans vote 60 times to repeal their own plan when Obama was president. And now when they have congress and the presidency, they can't repeal it. Why is that?

Indeed, that became very visible when the Tea Party rose to prominence and has continued from there, through the last election with Trump.  But the question isn't so much about party positioning, as it is about people too.  Why is the more extreme view being supported by so many people on the right, and why is the response by the left in the US so seemingly weak?

If you look at the issues being raised in the linked article above, it is about the apparent extreme positions on both sides, not the middle ground and the middle ground seems to be getting lost between both parties.  

The GOP has moved into the extreme right. They live in a different world. They do not agree on basic facts of reality.

The democratic party has actually moved right as well. But the GOP has moved sooo far right, it can't even see the same reality as anyone else.

Right, but the people who support either side, are actual people, who have to go to work and live etc.. with people who have different views than their own.  If the division is now so large, how do you address that? Surely there is something more useful to be done than shouting insults at either side.

The issue that seems really problematic is the instinct, on both sides, to take any argument from the other, and discard it as racist/stupid/xenophobic/unpatriotic/weak or similar rather than on actually looking at the issues.

The ACA is a great example of that, it's a shit bit of legislation, but it's much better than what was there before. It does provide more protections to patients, but it also cements the value for businesses... In all it is obviously a compromise, at least partially forced by the right, but it is also pretty clear that there would be better ways of doing it. Everyone seems to agree on what is needed too, in terms of costs, but no-one seems to want to entertain any kind of real discussion about what is wanted and how to get there (and yes, that's a horrible oversimplification).

I only see one side that interprets the bible literally- that think noah's ark actually happened. I only see one side claiming that a zygote or a fetus is a human. I only see one side claiming that Obama is a muslim. I only see one side fetishizing guns. I see one side denying climate change. I see one side shouting to "build the wall".

Yeah, that'd be the extreme right, and all of those are incredibly idiotic views.... But you do have issues on the extreme left too, and you generally only hear about them from the right, in much the same way as you mostly hear about the views of the extreme right, from the left.

That's the problem isn't it? You tar people in the centre with a brush that includes a lot of views from the fringes, and then wonder why they think your views aren't realistic.  

And again, you seem to be very keen on presenting the views of a party, and often the fringes of that party, as the views of everyone who you see as the opposition. 

Of course you aren't going to convince a hyper-religious, climate change denying, anti-abortionist racist, with no critical thinking ability that birth control is important in medical provision, but you also aren't going to convince the average 'normal' conservative to listen to you if you assume that they are a hyper-religious, climate change denying, anti-abortionist racist, with no critical thinking ability.

Let me know when you figure it out.

I'm not a conservative, certainly not a Republican so I don't know why it's relevant to the idea that you can simply ignore a huge swathe of a population.. But hey, that's up to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope that the EU puts the UK in its place, but allows the UK to survive.

That's a slightly bizarre statement, the EU can't really 'put the UK in it's place' at best it can offer a shitty deal that the UK can't take, but under any scenario the EU isn't in a position where it could threaten the survival of the UK..

The sensible scenario is still a deal that provides as much benefit to both sides as possible. The drama really is around whether the EU Parliament can do much to influence the end position, beyond threatening to veto, that'll be interesting to watch, but I don't think the end result will be a powerful EU parliament dictating to the UK.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's reasonably true of new-builds, but leaseholds are incredibly common (as in the vast majority) for flats, and very common for existing houses in at least the North East and West, the difference on the latter is usually that they are very long leaseholds and usually with very minimal fixed ground rent, to the point that it makes almost no difference whether you do or don't buy the freehold. With new-builds it seems leaseholds are the exception and that really should have been pointed out by the solicitor, especially if you are talking about something where you have an escalating ground rent, or indeed if the leashold ends within a reasonable amount of time, like 50 years or so.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's either that or hard border in Ireland, if that's so important for Ireland, the UK will oblige right?

Why is that or a hard border? Again, the EU can't force Ireland to put up a hard border, neither the UK nor Ireland want one so it's not going to happen, and the UK isn't going to give the EU the power to determine how it manages internal borders between different parts of the same country..

What the EU can do is set up borders agains't the whole Ireland.

Ireland isn't in Schengen, it has borders with the rest of the EU..

The UK is weaker than ever, it's the perfect time to make a move toward the reunification.

Yeah, that'll happen when people in Northern Ireland and Ireland want it, and that doesn't look like any time soon.

About the only thing you'd achieve with your suggestions is anger in both the Unionist and Republican camps in Northern Ireland, and piss off the Irish government and people whilst you are at it. 

And it still won't happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Leasehold is nothing new as in the case of my parents house 30 years ago, it was 10 per year but I don't think anyone bothered to collect it.

Ours is about 4 a year and we have to go to an office where we pay it (and it gets noted in a large, paper book to boot..).  It hasn't ever really been anything other than a minor thing, I can't imagine what it'd be like to find that it increases to the point of being serious money. The same goes for permissions to do things on the property, we've never been charged to get permission and I'd be pretty peeved if someone tried to charge hundreds of pounds to allow me to modify a property I own, even if they own the land..

I also would not touch new builds with a barge pole, every few weeks there seems to be something in the news about developers cutting corners on the builds then the houses start to fall apart after a year or two.

Sort of, my parents bought one a little while back and it's fairly decent, I assume it matters what you buy and how though.

Seems to me they are praying on the naivety of first time buyers and perhaps not reading all of the small print that the solicitor should be flagging up. Question is, where is the money going? I have no doubt that brown paper bags are being exchanged between the developers and local councils to free up the land for cut of the leases.

Well, apparently the builder only got 140k for the leasehold, the company that bought it seems to be in a position where it could make rather a lot more. I doubt the council is involved though, I can't see any reference to the land being council before hand, and there is no eminent domain type deal occurring (As we've seen with some of the shady London deals). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I was discussing this with the other half a while ago (I hadn't seen this on reddit either..) the scenario that I can see as really problematic is the involvement of the solicitor.  If this was planned in some way, and the solicitor pushed the agreement on the leaseholds and didn't press for the freehold, allowing the builder to sell to Gateway property management (for a really low sum given the return..) and for Gateway to make a lot of money, then it seems far more dubious.  I suppose we'll see what happens.  I'd sort of assume that the same solicitor wouldn't want to touch all of those elements though (the conveyancing, the sale of the freehold and potentially the terms as well) as that mush lead to some sort of conflict.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly don't see how anyone looks at the Syrian conflict and doesn't conclude that the EU should have acted decisively (certainly with hindsight) given the plight within Syria's borders and the consequences for europe (economic, social, political, security)...

I think there is a difference between concluding that the EU should have acted decisively and concluding that the EU can't act decisively.  I absolutely agree that action should have been taken, and far earlier, preferably with as much international support as possible, and preferably led by European countries rather than the US. However, I would also say that the EU is incapable of acting and the few countries that could have didn't have any interest in doing so unilaterally, or in conjunction with Russia or other regional partners.

As far as US involvement, again I'm perplexed by the view that US involvement is based on regime change.

I think part of that is because the US has maintained the position that there should be regime change, and supported groups in Syria who went beyond simply fighting ISIS. Regime change in Syria is a regional policy and preference for the US..

US has been dragged/shamed into the limited role it has played. Hell, just look at the red line bluff -- Obama had no interest in getting involved other than addressing the brutal human rights violations/crimes.

The US has essentially been more interested in containment than anything else, the US could end the war in a matter of weeks if it wanted to (by invading..) but quite understandably doesn't want to. So could Russia for that matter, or a combined European force, assuming the other major powers involved agreed in any case.

I think the problem is that the stated aim is dealing with IS, but that has morphed into very limited action by everyone involved, bar the Syrian government and Russia who have been prioritising recapturing the country, with fighting IS being a bit of a sideline (and then there is Turkey doing its thing too, and Iran for that matter).

In short, it's not simple. The US isn't there for purely humanitarian reasons and it's acting as it is to balance its interests, which frankly is what every other country is doing too, so it shouldn't be held up to a massive amount of shaming either.

That said, I haven't really seen (from the UK side at least..) a lot of demands that the US do more either, in fact I've seen a few groups opposed to US involvement and the usual (and again, reasonable..) criticisms when things go wrong, but no shaming of the US in general. I think in other parts of the EU there are more people arguing that this is all essentially the fault of the US/UK and so they should be responsible for fixing it (and so responsible for the refugee crisis and so on) but that's broadly a minority view too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the US would have had a problem with europe deciding to take on the situation in syria... 

That would depend on how the EU decided to take the situation on to a large extent. If it didn't follow the US path, I doubt it'd be seen as a positive.

and why on earth would russia's interest preclude europe from having position.

It wouldn't (and doesn't) preclude the EU from having a position, or any European country from having one, it would however limit the options for the EU or individual EU countries from acting on that position.

Europe has endured costs from the Syrian that are far greater than Russia's benefits -- your comment re Russia makes my point crystal clear.

Right.. And Syria is still formally a Russian ally, even the US refrained from striking Syrian government positions or Syrian military assets up until the cruise missile strike this week, and then it was with pre-notification to the Russians (sensibly..). The EU could either work with Russia, or it would have to be in a position to act in opposition to Russian interests. How many EU countries do you think would have any interests in the latter? And do you think the US would be happy with the EU working with Russia and so the Syrian government to stabilise the country?

Neither the EU, nor any other European state, nor the US for that matter involved themselves in Crimea at least in part because the risk wasn't worth it and there were fewer regional factors for the US. The same broadly goes for the issues in Georgia. It isn't that different in Syria, the EU and European states would be constrained in what they can do by how far Russia would allow them to go before intervening more strongly to support Assad.  

Of course, and just allow Assad's slaughter to run its course.

That's not the reason the US is in Syria though is it? 

The US isn't in Syria to take down Assad, it is in Syria as part of a multinational effort to degrade and destroy IS (or what was referred to as ISIL/ISIS). That effort includes Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates as well as some of the groups in Syria that aren't IS affiliated. 

It's probably worth noting that the EU as a whole isn't part of that multinational effort either, nor are most European countries, with some somewhat opposed to operations. Last I checked the countries in support of the anti-IS operations included Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Turkey and the UK, of which all bar Turkey are EU members, if you switched that to an anti-Assad operation, you'd probably lose a few of those too (likely not Turkey or the UK, but potentially the others).

In short, half of Europe doesn't seem to see Syria as an issue that is relevant to them, the remainder see it as an anti-IS operation not about removing Assad, and the UK/US element, which is both anti-IS and anti-Assad doesn't have the backing to do more and is currently essentially continuing a fairly long established policy of maintaining regional influence and denying it to other regional players. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EU as a unified block is the only thing that can oppose US hegemony.

That's a nice notion, and it's true in a sense, but I don't think the EU is even on a path in that direction yet.  The EU isn't even heading in the direction where the US, and US dominated groupings like NATO are less important for European defence than the EU and frankly in the absence of the UK that seems less likely now than ever.  The EU is even further away from being able to challenge US interests or policy positions outside of the EU's own borders, even when that applies to it's immediate neighbours.

How do you see this going? The EU taking a first step toward superpower status might be interesting, but it's be a very long road and I don't think a lot of EU members would be on board for a lot of what would be required.  Hell, even countries like China don't seem keen on that and China is far more united and able to act as one entity than the EU is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are pretending that the rights of EU citizens in the UK suddenly end after Brexit.  I don't believe that is the case. Ultimately, what their future rights will be will depend on the negotiations

Their rights under the treaties end. Those resident in the UK will get whatever rights are agreed under the exit terms with the EU, and I hope that they are essentially drop in replacements for what they have now in the context of the EU..  

My point however isn't that they won't have any rights, but that EU citizens currently are unclear what those rights will be. As such some are quite sensibly looking to secure their position under existing UK law (outside of the EU context) now, so that regardless of the negotiation outcome, they will have the right to continue to reside and work in the UK etc..

They may not need to do any of that, but at the moment some people are playing it safe and securing their position regardless of whether the UK and EU agree on something or not.

For the UK to preempt that negotiation by trying to create facts on the ground by a tough line against EU citizens is certainly not correct.

What is the UK preempting? If you've lived in the UK for a certain amount of time legally, you can, under UK law (and irrespective of EU agreements) apply to have your status as a resident recognised, or even apply for citizenship etc.. That's what these people are doing, the UK hasn't changed anything, but people are using processes broadly intended for non-EU nationals to secure their future beyond the period where their rights are guaranteed under the current arrangements...

No-one is taking a particularly tough line against EU citizens, the processes being used and the responses being received are the same as those that would go to any person (EU or non-EU) applying for a specific immigration status.

To put it another way: An EU citizen currently in the UK, under the current arrangements does not have to apply for ILR to remain in the UK long term, someone on a visa would have to as they came to the end of their visa period. If an EU citizen however decides to apply, because they are now concerned about what will happen when the UK leaves the EU, they will go through the same process as any other applicant.  The exception being that if an EU citizen is turned down, they won't have to leave the country (because they have additional rights to remain that a visa holder likely doesn't..).

That process is not, and has never been particularly nice, it is bureaucratic, involves a lot of admin, and the burden of proof is on the applicant.  

The point is that up until recently EU nationals haven't felt the need to go through the process of formally getting residency (the same would be broadly true of applying for citizenship), but now they are doing so voluntarily, before the negotiations on status.  They aren't being discriminated against and the UK isn't taking a tough line on EU citizens, it's just that the UK has always taken a bit of an arseholish approach to those applying for residency..

The home office have always been a bit harsh when it comes people applying for residency and similar, EU citizens haven't had (and still don't have) to, some are now doing it in anticipation of the UK leaving and it turns out the home office are still being a bit harsh..

Does that make more sense?

	<TEXT> Either nations within the EU need to start acting more unilaterally, or EU needs to act more deliberately as a whole. 

France and the UK do act unilaterally when their interests are at stake, they can't act unilaterally in Syria though, given they'd be stepping on both the US's and Russia's toes.. The remainder of the EU can't really act unilaterally as they aren't that capable.. 

The EU also can't act as a whole, because it's not a country, and only a relatively loose union when it comes to defence and foreign policy. It's not like the EU as a whole can dictate a direction and within the EU you have countries that take very conflicting views on what is required in Syria..

seeing the consequence of something like Syrian civil war (imho) leading to a major EU player leaving the union

The UK isn't leaving the EU because of Syria.. The immigration issue that raised its head in the UK wasn't primarily focused on refugees or migrants, but rather internal EU migration. I'm sure the refugee flows had some impact, but they weren't have been anything like as relevant as a lot of other issues that the EU has.  The UK has never been that keen on the EU political project (although was very much on board with the trade aspects) and has been diverging for a while.

the EU needs to wake the fuck up and start being more proactive

How? The EU can't act unilaterally without consent of Russia and the US, it can't simply intervene in Syria because it'd end up facing a massive response from Russia (or the US) either directly or indirectly and it doesn't have anything like the capabilities or depth that the US does militarily.

Instead of hoping the Americans take care of the problems (even if the problems aren't of EU's creation, still need to deal with problems caused by others).

To be fair, the US could pull out of Syria tomorrow, they won't because they are concerned about the region and want to see a solution that fits their positions in the middle east, rather than a Russian or Iranian one. 

This isn't about the US doing a job that no-one else wants, it's the US trying to maintain the power balance in its favour in the Middle east, and no-one else really being in a position to do much about that.. </TEXT>

I'm confused where you are getting the idea that anyone is suggesting that..

If the cruise missiles were used to attack that airbase specifically

The claim is an air strike, not a cruise missile strike..

then the "depot" of chemical weapons was also on that government controlled airbase?

So no..

	<TEXT>  Immigrants from outside the EU are a different matter. Most people in the world don't have a chance of ever emigrating to the West.

The point is that EU residents are currently applying for things they don't actually need, under routes geared toward non-EU residents. So it's not really a different matter, it's the same process.

We are talking about free movement in the EU, and that hasn't suddenly changed after the referendum. As long as the UK is part of the EU, EU citizens shouldn't have to worry about the rights they have always taken for granted.

They don't have to, as long as the UK is in the EU. The people in this article (and the UK citizens in other EU countries..) are concerned about what happens when the UK leaves and they no longer have those rights. Nothing has changed yet for them, they are trying to secure their rights beyond the UK exit, and there isn't currently a process designed for that.  It's not like they are being denied any of the treaty rights they are entitled to.

Is it just incompetence on the part of the Home Office? Or is there a directive from the top to make life hard for EU citizens? 

To be fair, it isn't even really incompetence, it's essentially a hostile process. You are responsible for meeting the requirements and proving them, if you don't and are denied (As in this case) that isn't incompetence, it just isn't particularly helpful.  

I can't of course tell, but I don't believe that lower rank bureaucrats decide these things on their own.

The decisions are made by individual immigration officers based on the operational guidance that is derived from legislation, as far as I am aware (and I know quite a few people who do that work at various levels, and a few immigration lawyers to boot..) there hasn't been any specific directive to make life hard for EU citizens, and if there were, it would be massively problematic for the UK government and the government would lose in court (and it would end up in court almost immediately). 

The notion that the UK would punish EU migrants is frankly laughable and utterly without basis. You'd be better off looking at how other, non-EU nationals fare through the same process, I'm willing to bet you won't find many differences (bar possibly that those people will have kept records and understood what is required in advance, and in many cases will have hired someone to help them through the process).

In the context of NATO? As much as I'd trust anyone else, what is absolutely clear is that the EU as a grouping couldn't replace the loss of capacity or capability, nor recreate the strategic depth that the US offers...

The EU isn't a superpower, it isn't even a regional power right now, it needs to do a lot more to get there, and that means tight integration in areas of defence and foreign policy if it wants to be able to defend itself and protect its interests.  It's not there though, not even in terms of support from EU members. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a lot of these, and I think it highlights just how aggressive the Home Office is when it comes to immigration, naturalisation and residency etc.. Which should be seen as problematic (I mean yeah, have strict rules and apply them, but don't be an arse about technicalities either, it should be reasonably to complete paperwork, have error's queried and so on so that people with the right to something can get it, rather than just being rejected on essentially administrative grounds, especially since people are paying for the service..).

That said, I think what this does highlight is that in the context of EU citizens, where none of this has really been relevant before, the government hasn't put anything in place yet to deal with their special situation, and it should.  I mean granted, we don't have any settlement on the issue of EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in Europe (and that's an issue for both the EU and the UK..), but you'd think people would have been able to think ahead a little bit.  

It's really quite shitty to see this happen when the rules seem to be in favour of the applicant, and the process is getting in the way.

What I will say is that I have seen issues in other EU countries (Germany and France as it happens), but more for non-EU citizens than EU citizens. It's just being focused on the UK at the moment because there are about to be a lot of people who have had no need to have any contact with government about their residency or status up until now, and often who haven't really been concerned about the rules that do exist and weren't particularly tightly enforced, having do to so now.

Just for context, I had some friends who decided to go for German nationality fairly recently (been in Germany for a long time, have kids that went through German schools etc..) who had everything go through for half the family, but not the other half, and are now messing about, 6 months later trying to find out what has gone wrong and how to fix it (something about different surnames being processed by different offices etc..).

Hope it gets sorted out here sharpish though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It does, but you can draw a line under weapon types (rather than impact), we have a pretty good definition and grouping when it comes to NBC weapons (so nuclear, biological and chemical) as well as a long term understanding of their impact in warfare and on non-combatants. There are also reasonably well understood policies in place about the use of such weapons extraterritoriality at least, as well as understood consequences.

The problem with propaganda and potential false equivalence in this context really is a huge one though. Using the claimed or actual use of chemical weapons, to justify a preexisting policy that has essentially nothing to do with either removing the ability of someone to use them is massively problematic and starts to look like a repeat of previous scenarios.  The problem there then obviously becomes that the chemical weapon issue doesn't actually get resolved, and any trust and credibility is lost..

Syria is a mess and no-one seems interested in actually dealing with that issue and far more focused on regional politics and power, but not enough to make a strong intervention, or allow anyone else to either. </TEXT>

Ha, same here mostly now, yay for us..

how ever alot of smokers ive seen (not all) that stand in groups or sit outside coffee shops just blow it in any direction with out thinking, vapor has no harsh chemicals just (some) nice smells and water vapour

True, although some of the tobacco flavoured ones are pretty awful as smells, and some of the more artificial smelling flavours have a chemical tinge, although they are just flavourings and water, so it's not like second hand smoke.  It can be pretty unpleasant though.. Although there was one guy in Manchester with a really 'fresh apple' smelling vape, had to ask him what it was (turned out it was home brewed and as it turned out, didn't taste as nice as it smelled..).

As a side note, has anyone else noticed the almost 'curry' tinge in some of the cheap liquids? That's actively nasty.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sort of...or exactly lines up a little to perfectly?

The Russian story in isolation lines up, the US story in isolation lines up. The moment you add in any of the shards of additional information you end up with problems, essentially the narratives are a little too clean and without enough independent corroboration. And we've been here with both the US and Russia before, and recently when it comes to trying to present far too clean arguments about how and what occurred. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bounced around a bit too (and yeah, started with the awful fake fags..), payed around with the sub-ohm stuff and dripping.. and then ended up preferring the 1.8 ohm coils, an air flow addon and a decent sized tank with a not too huge battery pack. TBH the airflow control makes the most difference and anything above the 1.8 seems to offer too much resistance, whilst anything below seems to offer little in the way of flavour and mostly just burns through juice..  

As a comparison to 'normal' smoking (which I haven't done for about 2 years.. yay me) I think the amount of vapour I put out now is about equivalent to, maybe a little less than from a rolled cig, although obviously less persistent, but it certainly isn't the steam train approach quite a few people are going for (and are amusing to see in cars on occasion...).

That said, it's a personal preference thing.

Although if you are smoking bubblegum flavoured, super strong vape it has an impact on people around you too (and I say that as someone with a preference for vanilla liquids..).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I saw the reporting, as well as the push to link that to Russian support. But it's not external or independent verification, although I'd lean that way given the absence of anything else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 10 for 30g tobacco which won't last the week or 12 for liquid that will last the week.

Yeah, it's cheaper than tobacco and has been for a long time, but you go through massively more liquid if you produce a lot of vapour in my experience, so a bottle that'd cost you 7 or around that will last a few days rather than a week and a bit or more..

Add on papers and filters and it is a lot more economically viable.

Indeed, (although don't forget batteries, cartridges and so on on the ecig side). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been repeated a lot and seems to be the case, the target has generally been IS and affiliates (and other groups..). The term 'deliberately' is somewhat important in that context though, and it's worth remembering that targeting Syria as a Russian ally could be seen as a tad problematic too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's a better feeling with a big cloud and you get better flavour as well.

I'm really not sure it does, or rather, that there is a point where it doesn't get any better and you are essentially just producing excess vapour.. As to battery life and liquid, I've got 1800mah in battery capacity that lasts 2-3 days and go through 15ml (at 7..) in about two weeks, if not more (depends on usage obviously..) and I played around with resistance, voltages, and liquid mixes quite a bit.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mostly agree. However, on chemical weapons, it's not an arbitrary line really, the weapons are more indiscriminate even when used 'properly' and a cheap way of killing lots of people. In short, I'd rather the killing stopped altogether, but I'd also rather not see escalations where groups use chemical weapons (because they are cheap and pretty devastating, especially to civilian populations).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely. The 'stop using chemical weapons' bit seems more important than whose ally did what when, but the focus seems to be immediately on the political rather than the actual reality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think my problem with the term is that Europe has a lot of internal differences in terms of values, whilst having broader common values with other countries that aren't European. It's much harder to pin down European values as a separate entity, never mind regional and inter-European differences. 

Don't get me wrong, I think there are a set of shared values that broadly apply, just that they aren't specifically European.  The clash in values seems broader than that. </TEXT>
