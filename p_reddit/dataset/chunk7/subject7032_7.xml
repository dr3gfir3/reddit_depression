	<TEXT> 1) It's common for children to inherit their family's possessions and pawn them off without either party knowing their value. 
2) My guess is that he mistook it for a cheap poster or reproduction, although the unnatural presence of the thing probably accounted for both his interest and quick decision to get rid of it. 
3) The page is about 3x2 feet, the largest medieval manuscript ever made. Combined with its vellum material and my familiarity with the style from research, it wasn't a difficult identification. 
4) Pages of such iconic books often run for that price. Compare with the [guttenberg bible](http://www.greatsite.com/ancient-rare-bible-leaves/gutenberg-1455-leaf.html) which often reaches 100k per page, and there are multiple copies of that unlike the Codex Gigas. 
Hope that helped your confusion. Cheers </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The truth of the Codex Gigas - aka the Devil's Bible </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Allow me to take you on a journey with me to Stockholm Sweden, where the 2017 International Antiquarian Book Fair is currently in progress. Cases of illuminated manuscripts, first editions of classical masterpieces, original drafts and letters in the genius's own hand, and of course the omnipresent odor of old leather and paper. 

Yes there are similar book fairs held all over the world, but this one is singular because of the invaluable artifact I am carrying in my possession: a lost page from the [The Codex Gigas](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e4/Devil_codex_Gigas.jpg/500px-Devil_codex_Gigas.jpg). 

The Codex has long held fascination for me since I discovered the legends surrounding its mysterious origin. The bible was created in a 12th century Benedictine monastery in Bohemia, now part of the Czech Republic. It was written by the monk known as Herman the Recluse who reportedly broke his monastic vows and was sentenced to be walled alive inside the monastery as punishment. 

In a desperate attempt to avoid his fate, Herman offered to write a book containing all human knowledge in a single night in exchange for leniency. Herman attempted this impossible task, but his prayers for divine assistance were ignored. As a last resort, the monk offered a prayer to Lucifer who agreed to finish the book in exchange for his soul. The monk added [this picture](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Codex-Gigas-Devil-enhanced.jpg/340px-Codex-Gigas-Devil-enhanced.jpg) of the Devil in gratitude for his aid. 

Since its creation, the book has traveled thousands of miles as it has been lost, traded, stolen, and handed down through the generations. The book was damaged when it was plundered in Sweden's 30 year war before reaching its final destination in the National Library of Sweden. Although some of the lost pages have been recovered, many more were destroyed or secretly coveted within private collections around the world. 

So you can imagine my excitement when I stumbled upon one of the pages being offered in a pawn shop adjacent to a used microwave and a doll house. The owner didn't have the faintest idea what it was, but he said he was happy to get rid of it because of the oppressive atmosphere which seemed to surround it.  

"Makes the whole place feel like a graveyard somehow," he told me. "Beautiful on the surface, but you can't enjoy it proper on account of what's underneath." 

The moment I touched the page, I understood what he meant. It was as though the lights in the shop dimmed, although I could still see with perfect clarity. It is difficult to describe, but imagine shutting off the lights the same instant you developed the ability to see in the dark. I attributed this to a fanciful imagination born from those old legends however, and I didn't let it disturb my alacrity at such a valuable discovery. 

The Latin text was indecipherable to me, but I figured it was just more psalms and could be translated at the ongoing book fair. I brought my prize inside and quickly found a vendor willing to exhibit the page for 125,000$ in exchange for a commission. The page wasn't on display for more than five minutes before a small crowd had already begun to form. 

"I'll take it for 100,000," an elderly man said. He wasn't so much wearing spectacles as they were wearing him, and I could barely see his face through the massive lenses. 

"110,000," from an woman wearing so many furs that I shouldn't be surprised if she started howling. 

"Don't sell it yet - wait for the representative from the National Library," from a third, rushing off through the fair to find him.  

I readily obliged, my mind already tracing a hundred ways for me to spend my new-found fortune. I expected a fussy old librarian to come and try to convince me to donate my find, so I mentally prepared myself to negotiate against the growing number of bids. It took a moment before I recognized the tall man in a suit who returned to be the librarian. His keen blue eyes, long blonde pony-tail, and hard uncompromising jaw did not fit the stereotypical profile.

"200,000 as a final sale," were the first words out of his mouth. The bubbling requests around us immediately died down into a hushed murmur. The librarian ran his fingers expertly over the vellum page as though caressing a loved one. 

"250,000, and you do not consider other bids," the bespectacled man chirped. I couldn't very well ask if anyone could beat it with that stipulation, so I simply raised an eyebrow and waited to see if someone would interject on their own. 

The librarian pulled out his phone and started texting. The phone slid into his pocket, and he put his arm around my shoulders in camaraderie - or at least that's how he no-doubt intended it. The gesture felt more like a car salesman trying to change your mind from a minivan to a sportscar. 

"200 is more than fair, and it would be a national travesty not to have this be reattached to the book it was stolen from." 

He was trying to subtly steer me away from the other bidders, but I held my ground. "I'm sorry, but if that other gentleman is the leading bid -" 

"What other gentleman?" he interrupted. I turned to scan the crowd, but there was no sign of the bespectacled man. 

"Where did he go? He offered 250,000 for -" 

"Oh that old trickster," the librarian said, his grip tightening slightly around my shoulders. "He's been making false bids all night just to get a reaction out of people. Come now, you won't find a better deal than 200 grand." 

I literally paid 80 dollars for the page this morning. I didn't want to get greedy and push my luck, so I agreed. All the proper paperwork was filled out and the exchange was made. The librarian (Dr. Beckel), congratulated me and wrapped his arm around my shoulder once more as we parted.

"Did you feel it? When you touched the page?" Dr Beckel asked in a half-whisper. 

I didn't need to ask for clarification. I just nodded, not wanting to sound foolish by indulging my fantasy. 

"It's nothing compared to the presence of the book. And did you know that it gets stronger with every page that is added?" 

The warm buzz of the book fair faded away around me and I felt a clammy chill dash across my skin. 

"What is causing it?" I asked him. 

"You know," Dr. Beckel grinned. "Would you like to touch the book after your page has been restored and re-inserted?"

"What on Earth for?"  

His smile widened, and he pulled me a little closer against him in his conspiratorial fashion. "To greet him with me, of course."

	<TEXT> I'm not quite sure why I was called, but as long as I'm here..

If you're trying to build a fanbase, then I think it's important to keep an archive on a social media site. I've been experimenting with a few different angles, but here's what's working best:

1) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade) - Share a link every time you post a story, and put a link at the end of each story going back to your fb. The fb fans will help upvote your story and make it more visible, which in turn will bring new people to your page, and so on in a continual feedback loop. Then you can use fb notes or an album for a comprehensive archive. 

That's all you'll really need if you're doing this as a hobby. 

2) [Website](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog) - If you want to consider making a career out of writing, I think a website is a must. Once you have a decent fb fanbase, you can start linking your website at the end of stories and directing your fb fans there. Just search youtube for how to make your own wordpress website, and there are some pretty simple tutorials which will guide you step by step. 

Websites are great because they look a bit more professional and will allow you to start monetizing your writing if you want to go that route. A combination of social sharing and naturally generated search engine traffic will help increase your exposure too. You can make use of your traffic with google adsense, affiliate sales, or selling your own published works when you're ready. 

3) [Mailing list](http://eepurl.com/cy-S15) Mailchimp is a great way to create a free mailing list. Used in conjuncture with your website, it can send out automatic RSS updates whenever you post a new story. This has been my best way of gaining long term readers and creating a captive audience to market published works. 

The easier you make it for people to find your work, the more readers you'll get. Good luck! </TEXT>
