	<TEXT> The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell.

	<TEXT> yeah you are right better listen to  the grunts and interjections of  this lame ass trap niggas who say nothing at all. If you really listen to his songs his lyrics are very deep and intuned check out Ill Mind Of Hopsin 7 and tell me any rapper with a lyrics half as deep.. yhea go on down vote this too see if I give a fck lol
Yo, fuck anybody I might alarm

Life is a tour, I sit and ride along

Taking some notes and then I write the song

I'm staring down the road my life has gone

Is this where I belong?

Is it wrong to not believe in right and wrong?

My mental state is fucking me up

And I cried upon while asking you for some answers

But we don't have that type of bond

That my desires gone with the way that I've been living lately

If I died right now, you'd turn the fire on

Sick of this bullshit, niggas call me a sellout

'Cause I hopped on Christianity so strongly then I fell out

Now I'm avoiding questions like a scared dog with his tail down

I look at the Earth and Sun and I can tell a genius man designed it

It's truly mind blowing, I can't deny it

Is heaven real? Is it fake? Is it really how I fantasize it?

Where's the Holy Ghost at? How long it take Man to find it?

My mind's a nonstop tape playing and I can't rewind it

You gave me a bible and expect me not to analyze it

I'm frustrated and you provoked it

I'm not reading that motherfucking book because a human wrote it

I have a fucking brain, you should know it

You gave it to me to think to avoid every useless moment

It was a mission that I had to abort

'Cause humans be lying with such an inaccurate source

It's gon' be hard to put me back on the course

Next Jehovah's witness to come on my porch, I swear I'm slammin' the door

A lot of folks believe it though, but I'm not surprised

Humans are fucking dumb, still thinkin' that Pac's alive

	<TEXT> The Snipet is from hearing of the tape they made killing their last victim, 16 yrs old shirley lynette ledford. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own. I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real. It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents. It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it. If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with that but how about Russia? Russia is advancing deaper and deaper in to the arctic drilling for oil and releasing tons of methane gas in the process. Unless they is a  legitimate agreement between countries that claim the arctic circle ie- Canada, US, Russia and Denamark it doesnt make sence to stop only American companies from exploring the Arctic, some might even say unpatriotic.

Here is a very explanatory video on  the geo-politics of the Arctic, I highly recommend you watch it.

	<TEXT> What I loved about the Brendan Frasier movies was that they didn't take themselves too seriously and were reminiscent of classic adventure films with great humour. So lets take the fun out of it. Add typical Tom Cruise running, CGI's, loud explosions and one liners that we're supposed to take serious. Oh and the mummy is now female. Brendan Fraser and Arnold Vosloo would roll over in their acting career grave. </TEXT>
