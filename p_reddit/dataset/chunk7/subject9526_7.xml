	<TEXT> I was hypnotized (and put to sleep) in front of a crowd once. The way a hypnotist works is really counter-intuitive when you experience it.

The common misconception that the hypnotist is actually making people go unconscious is nonsense. The way they work is they really get into your head and make their volunteers want to participate and follow directions. When he stared into my eyes and told me promptly to "sleep!" I found myself simply under the spell of just following directions.

So I dropped to the floor (completely conscious) and acted as if I was sleeping. It's almost as if he goes into your head and says something like "Hey, we're gonna get this crowd good, so why don't you play along and we can put on a great show, okay?" 

There's also lots of other commands such as getting people to dance like crazy that can be even more entertaining. It really just boils down to the hypnotist picking who he thinks will be truly susceptible to playing along with his show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a gum graft done because my gum line was unnaturally low on my bottom teeth. 

What happens is the doc cuts out a hunk of skin from the roof of your mouth and sews it on top of your low gum line for it to heal up. 

It's really not too terrible if you don't have a light stomach, but with only simple numbing during the operation, I couldn't help but squirm in my seat when I felt the pressure of a razor against my poor tissue. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [HoMM3] A few questions about running the HD Mod </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-17 02:08:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I bought HoMM3 Complete on gog.com and downloaded the HD mod for it. As I am playing on a laptop I feel as if it's maybe running a bit too slow for my liking, so i have a few questions about how to use the HD mod interface:

First, I have to confess that for the most part, I only got the download for it's tweaks and cool features. I actually don't mind the old graphics of the game (it has the kind of charm that the pages of a really old book have). So if there if some way to play on the original resolution (for optimal speed) but still have access to all the nice features, could someone let me know? 

As for the HD, I find that it's not too hard on my machine until I load up an XL map and start making my way towards multiple towns and heroes. That's where most of the crashing goes on. So as for now I've simply stuck to the lower resolutions while I'm playing. 

I really do love the interface and features that are displayed in the higher resolutions though. By this I mean not having to scroll through your 8 heroes, and the town display popping up as a window (two things that aren't offered at lower res). If there are any ways to speed up the gameplay while still keeping all the awesome tweaks, do let me know! </TEXT>
