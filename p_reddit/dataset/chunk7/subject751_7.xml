	<TEXT> Elder Scrolls: Oblivion; I just think the quests are way more interesting than the endless crypt raiding of Skyrim.

	<TEXT> So, how would I incorporate the page number?

Something like (Virgil 89; 2.541)?

I just was under the assumption that epic poems were exempt from the page number rule. For example, [this](http://academic.reed.edu/english/courses/hum110hayden/paperpolicies.htm) link leads to a website that seems to be a college professor's guide on parenthetical citation and he includes only book and line numbers.

Though I will ask her tommorow what her marks mean, thank you for the help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, our teacher is allowing us to make corrections on our papers after she has made marks to show us what is wrong. All across my paper I have cited the Aeneid by Virgil as (Virgil 2.541) where the quote is from book 2, line 541. On each of these citations she has marked across the "Virgil" and after hours of googling and contemplation I have no idea what's wrong. Please help and thank you in advance! </TEXT>
