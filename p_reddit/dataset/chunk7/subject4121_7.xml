	<TEXT> I agree that there's a strong possibility that people are barking up the wrong tree with pizzagate. That being said, there are still massive amounts of pedophilia happening in our gov't that is being covered up. Pizzagate is there to make it ALL seem crazy meanwhile it's happening right under our noses and is being covered up just like the Lawrence King thing in Nebraska and countless others. To make the rape of children into a political thing is sickening. It's happening across the board, both sides. So fuck all this republican and democrat shit and focus on the children. They are the victims...not your pride. </TEXT>

Also, maybe they can even put a bounty on somebody if they run out onto the field. It would be great. Instead of a 260lb former middle school P.E. star security guard tacking them, a fan can just shoot them from the stands. Maybe add in a prize if they kill or paralyze them... Maybe something like a Toyota Rav-4 or a lifetime of diet Dr. Pepper(they say it tastes just like regular Dr. Pepper).

	<TEXT> Just a quick thought. Trying to get other people's opinions on it.
I'm starting to get this sinking feeling that Hillary is going to be president.
It just seems "they" are putting the pieces in place to be able to perform a coup.
Whether it's pushing the popular vote thing, some electors saying they won't put Trump in, now saying the Russians hacked shit to win election for orange julius, and so on and so forth...
With all these corporate douchebags that Trump is putting in his cabinet and "transition team", like the ceo of Exxon, it seems to me like he knows he isn't going to be president and is just making more super elite buddies in order to help his businesses when he goes back to that shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "On November 13, a Swedish prosecutor agreed to interrogate Julian Assange at the embassy of Ecuador.The interrogation took place six years after the Swedish prosecutor issued an arrest warrant and extradition against the founder of Wikileaks, to respond to allegations of rape and assault two women whom he met in Stockholm, AA and SW Three weeks after that interview, Assange has decided to publish its full declaration, eldiario.es offers exclusive and serves as a chronology of his case.

In the first part of the document, Julian Assange describes the climate of persecution and harassment that precedes and surrounds your trip to Stockholm.Two weeks earlier, Wikileaks had published thediaries of the war in Afghanistan, some 75,000 classified Pentagon documents with information about the death of tens of thousands of people.Assange documents the escalation of threats articles media like The New York Times, The Washington Post and Harper's magazine, where Pentagon statements and the Ministry of Defense posed drastic and even illegal measures to capture the Australian.

Harassment extends to other members of Wikileaks, which are repeatedly detained at airports and other countries.Washington warns Switzerland to "carefully consider offering asylum to someone who is fleeing from the law", and Iceland that could be a review of its relations with theUS because of thenewspapers.Arriving in Sweden, Assange finds that Wikileaks accounts and cards have been canceled."Because of this (...) I had to rely on others, not just to have a roof but for food and money."This is where the two women who accused him of sexual assault, harassment and rape fall.

"SW knew an unusual amount of things about me"

During the first days, Assange had stayed home from AA, members of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, AA, with whom he had relations.SW Meet in a chat and a later meal, which they leave together.The woman makes it clear he wants to have sex with him and the two go by train to his home in Enkoping, west of the city.

According to the Australian, W. behaves flamboyant and intensely, asking if stays home and getting angry A. when looking at his mobile instead of paying full attention."SW knew an unusual amount of things about me."Assange feels that "risked reveal my location and could behave unpredictably if I thought that was rejecting".Later he discovers that his Flickr account was full of pictures of him.Despite his intuition, they sleep together "four or five times" between night and the next morning.She accompanies him to the train, where goodbye with a kiss and remain on call.She does it the next day but he is so busy that he does not until a week later, when someone warns that W. is in the hospital."At first I was afraid I had hurt herself to get my attention."He is wrong: the girl is being done tests can rule out STDs and he also wants to do.Julian can not go that day and left for Saturday.The next day Assange learns from the international press has been arrested "in absentia" for rape.

"The police had invented the charges"

To support their claimthat sex was agreed at all times, Assange appointment W. messages sent during those days from your mobile and that the police seized.There heshares with someone his desire for Assange ( "I want him. I want him") and later says all is well between them, except for STD testing.More relevant to thecase, he writes that "did not want toaccuse Julian Assange of nothing" and that "the police wanted tocatch him" and that was a shock hearing the accusation of rape.He also said that "the police had invented the charges" and that she only wanted the test was done.Later in several exchanges of messages with AA, the two women talk to tell their story to the press in exchange for money.Assange believes that these "speak for themselves".

On the main charge, that she was asleep when he entered and did not consent to maintain without acondom, Assange says, "is false. I was sure that SW was not asleep. I was also sure that he had given his consent to have unprotected sex before having sex. "In their messages the night of their first meeting and says "JA (Assange) willnot use condoms."That morning, moments after the alleged rape, W. wrote that " Iwas half asleep."

A pattern of illegal conduct

Assange says in his statement voluntarily spent five weeks in Sweden to answer all police questions and only left when I got permission from the prosecutor to return to London and the case was closed.

Shortly later, on November 29, Wikileaks Cablegate begins publication.251,287 diplomatic cables of the US State Department come to light with the help of a consortium of media including The New York Times, The Guardian, Le Monde, Der Spiegel and El Pais.

"The cables revealed that Swedish intelligence services had a pattern of illegal behavior when they were at stake the interests of the US government," says Assange, including cases of torture linked to the CIA.

Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange.The case reopens.

Assange explained in a letter published this document because "I want people to know what abuse has been this process", which has not been entitled to the presence of his Swedish lawyer Per E. Samuelsson, or access to documents handled the prosecution.He also reiterated that the refusal of the Swedish prosecutor to conduct interrogation in the last six years is illegal and unacceptable.

Some preliminary that stretch six years

From the outset, the prosecutor who reopened the case, Marianne Ny,told the mediathat the Swedish law and the British did not contemplate the possibility that Julian Assange could offer testimony electronically, or anywhere that does not outside Sweden, including the Swedish embassy in London itself.Two years later, Ny admitted thatthere was a mutual legal assistance treatythat allowed that kind of arrangement, but it was not appropriate because itneeded toquestion himin person.

The agreement, however, provides the ability to interrogate Assange by telephone, video or in person, accompanied by British police, with the permission of the Ecuadorian embassy.During all this time, Assange has maintained at all times." that the accusation is a pretext to extradite him to the US, where he could face the death penalty because of the leak of secret US documents by Wikileaks."

Then it shows the letter he sent from "December 7th, 2016".

	<TEXT> It was a false flag. He is a crisis actor that did this to escape jail time for hitting the teen with his car.  He has an imdb page, ties to the owner of Comet Pong Pong,  he hit a teenager and fucked them up permanently with his car a month ago and facing charges, THE WASHINGTONIAN WROTE ABOUT IT BEFORE IT HAPPENED, traffic cameras were taken down and moved hours before the incident, and his dad has a film studio and ties to correct the record. 

It was set up to make it seem like this "fake news" stuff is gone too far and it's creating "crazy conspiracy theorists" so it must be stopped. They are trying to discredit everything without addressing the evidence and connections. All mainstream media on tv and internet is scrambling to try and supress it. Once you lift the vail over your eyes it's easy to see what they are doing.

	<TEXT> I'm not debating there is false news. I'm saying that we are setting a dangerous precedent when we allow the msm to be the ones who declare what's "real" news or not. Like this whole pizzagate thing. They are saying it's fake news without explaining what it even is or discussing the connections to Podesta and everybody else. You have to admit he is sick. Who has art like that in their house? The pedo rings are being run by the likes of people like Jeffery Epstein and company. Blackmail is a powerful tool. He has dirt on many people. Isn't it worth it to the kids to at least have a real investigation into this? I guess not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just because you don't want to believe shit like this is happening doesn't mean it's not. This has been a huge problem for a long time, not only in our country but all over the globe all the way back to ancient Greece. Hell, up till 1880 you could marry a 7 year old in Delaware. All the details and to what extent this is happening we don't know yet but it's happening and right under our noses at that. People are starting to wake up though. The ball is now rolling and one day these fucks will be exposed as long as we keep fighting for the truth.
