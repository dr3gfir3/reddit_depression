	<TEXT> Guys, so I always read while travelling, its a very old habit. Whenever I spot a fellow reader ( books ofc, not magazines/newspaper), I get this uncontrollable urge to see what they are reading. Sometimes, I have noticed people reading one of my favourite books also, but I never get the courage to discuss it with them. However a few times other people have asked me about what I was reading, in such instances, I feel really happy but in the excitement, I have never been fully able to communicate what the book is about. I do however manage to convey to some extent how the book makes me feel. What are your experiences in this regard, any interesting anecdotes are welcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This I understand because only the light with energy greater than the bandgap of the semiconductor matters for the solar cell, so as long as the colour of the solar cell is compatible with those range of wavelengths, it is enough. There is no point in shining higher wavelengths which will not be converted to electricity and will contribute only to heat. However I do not understand the momentum explanation by /u/HugodeGroot.

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I hardly understood this book. I understood that characters were drunk and hallucinating most of the time. Actually, I skip these kind of passages in most books and don't try too much to find meaning in them, but this whole book was full of it. What I did follow was Joel had to come back to his father who was wounded and paralyzed by Randolph who is a homosexual (and a pedophile maybe ?). Joel is disillusioned because his step mother and Randolph are drunk and hide his father from him (why'd they do that ?). In the end Joel resigns himself to his fate because he got ill while running from home. There is a lot about the hermit I don't get and who was the woman that Joel kept imagining in the window ?. I decided to read this after having read 'In cold Blood' which I really liked. I can't bring myself to believe both the books are written by the same person. What are your thoughts on the book, what am I missing ? Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for the late reply, what I mean is you cannot integrate along theta and phi directions with a r vector inside the integral (r vector keeps changing direction). Integration is just summation right, and you can add things in the same direction only. So split your ar^ vector in 2 directions, one perpendicular to the base of the hemisphere, one in plane of the hemisphere. Only the components perpendicular to the hemispherical base get added up. The components in the plane of the hemisphere get cancelled. So going back to maths right your ar^ vector as -acos k^ + asin i^ , your final result will be in -k^ direction. With the additional cos term inside the integral you will get the correct answer. More questions are welcome, I dont agree with /u/Indian_Nazi, no method can be written off. For a certain type of application your method may be the best way.

Edit : http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/363780/how-to-integrate-a-vector-function-in-spherical-coordinates This will help you </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read about relative velocity and you will understand better. Intuitively you may also realize that when if T1 and T2 move towards each other T1 will observe T2 to be moving much faster than if it was much stationary. So, velocity of T2 with respect to T1 is vel(T1) + vel(T2). (note -If they were moving in same direction there would be a minus sign in the middle)

Now for both the persons the opposite train is moving with the same velocity 100+120 = 220 km/h

so length of train for passenger in T2 = velocity * time = 220*6/3600 [km]

w.r.t  passenger in T1 speed is again the same, so time = Distance/velocity = (220*6/3600) / (220) = 6/3600 [hrs] = 6 sec </TEXT>

Let us first start aligning these cubes along height   = 8 /.75 = 10 cubes

Along width = 14/.75 = 18

Along length = 11/.75 = 14

	<TEXT> s = ut + 1/2 * a * t^2

For x direction a =0, For y direction a = -9.8 m /s^2 = -g

So equation for y direction is:


y = vt - 1/2 * g * t^2

v = y/t + 1/2 * g * t

PS - If  is calculated from say pt1 to pt2, then v   u are at point 1 in these equations. So after u cross the top point, y will start getting negative values.

	<TEXT> Assuming system is in equilibrium,

T_AB = T_CB (Tension in the same string) and T_CB = F1  (By same logic)

Thus,  =  from your 2nd equation

However first equation is not correct for equilibrium of point B:

T_AB cos+ T_CB cos = F2 = 1000

Thus, cos = 1000/1800 = 5/9

tan = sqrt(1/ cos^2  -1) = 2/5 * sqrt(14) = 2/x

x = 5/sqrt(14)

Edit y= 2 since  = , I hope it is correct

	<TEXT> Guys, I have a related question how can /u/Bricejohnson2003 decide what MW of solar farm is possible on 400 acres let us say if investment is not a criterion. I thought there were 2 possible ways to go about it :

1)Oklhoma has an average irradiance of 5kWh / m^2 / day, so with 0.15 efficiency it is possible to produce .75kWh / m^2 /day. So for 400  acres (1.6 mil m^2) 1200MWh / day. If there is 8 hrs of sunlight, the power of the farm is 150 MW.

2) The other way is lets say he wants to use 250W panels to cover the whole area, now a single 250W panel has an approximate area of 1.6 m^2, so total MW possible = 250 MW.

My question is which way is the correct method or is there a third criterion ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes your logic is correct, the measure (say x) to compare all pizzas is Area per unit price.

So you calculate this x for each option and maximum x is the option you choose. Only thing you can avoid is multipkying pi each time as it is common, i.e. x can be defined as diameter^2 / price.

Edit : The method proposed by u/cornholio702 is correct as well but he is taking price/area so u pick minimum

your function, y = 5cot(2x/pi)+6

dy/dx=-5 * 2/pi * cosec^2 (2x/pi)

For x=0, goes to infinity it seems

Hope, I didnt miss something </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The film was good for the action, but the premise of Ben being a savant and then doing those action sequences is not good. True there are many forms of autism but I'm sure for most patients their life is devoid of sensationalism, it is a challenge for them to adapt to society and function as the rest of us and requires constant support from family/friends, they can't manage it alone. Remember rain man, that was real. The movie can be enjoyed, like we enjoy so much over the top stuff in movies, but somehow I don't want to, no not for this. </TEXT>
