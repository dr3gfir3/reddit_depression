	<TEXT> Big Data ie Data collection, tracking and analysis HAS been big business   is part of the issue here, not just providers.

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-06/carriers-sell-users-tracking-data-in-5-5-billion-market

Tracking software and companies have already caused some controversy because schools and testing companies wanted/want to use that same software/tech to track students through LIFE. 

https://www.thenewamerican.com/culture/education/item/15213-data-mining-students-through-common-core

 It's not just provider or tech companies is the end user/marketer that want's this as well. Over the last decade Sears and others were caught  using software from likes of  comScore to track customer activity.

http://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-sears-use-of-comscore-software-falls-short-on-privacy/

So the telecom, tech, marketing and retail lobby probably had as much to do with this passing as others.

	<TEXT> The free market has to be built with big medicine, not big insurance. Big insurance dictates the market at times over or under paying. The providers of care should be dictating the market. But the providers don't seem to like upfront pricing with disclosure of fees. Big hospitals have inconsistent pricing dependent on insurance company plans which leads to disguising the true costs with things like the $100 aspirin.

To top it off too many issues have to be addressed with actual care, billing, fee structure, big pharma etc before any plan would stand a chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A foreigner should've been the one under surveillance. 

If the FISA warrant/s were requested or obtained under the premise the foreigner was the target but purposely obtained to listen to American or another person that is an illegal practice called 'reverse targeting'.

https://www.brennancenter.org/analysis/nsas-backdoor-search-loophole

Inadvertent or 'incidental' collection of non specified American individuals now kicks in although wording and/or laws are loose.  Those individuals and/or  collected information is supposed to be  'minimized'.


Then there is the 'backdoor search loophole' which comes from poor or lack of 'minimization' of non specific target's information that was 'inadvertently' or 'incidentally' captured.

Just keep in mind 'reverse targeting' is an illegal practice used to skirt around a rubber stamped FISA warrant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the US insurance based health care or 'somebody else is paying for it' perpetuates inflationary pricing for insurance and service. Also in America it depends on the insurance plan one has which creates 'flexible' and/or inconsistent pricing. I know people who paid cash for an MRI or CAT scan for less than $500, with insurance $3000-5000 in many cases.

One of the reasons costs are out of control is they are not as identifiable as they should be. A reason there isn't upfront fully disclosed pricing/fees with many providers so they can bill/bilk the insurance as much as possible even if it's above their average. They also over bill for certain procedures   supplies to cover other costs. Any business has to cover cost but most business don't have insurance or a third party paying for their service. I'd rather see honest more precise pricing that pay $100 for an aspirin.

Lack of upfront disclosure and third party reimbursement help drive excessive cost in America. </TEXT>

The problem with all these plans/ideas is they don't address COSTS and actual causes of high cost. A BIG problem now is that providers billing varies by insurance company  and designed to ferret out the biggest payment rather than cover ACTUAL costs ie the $100 aspirin. Until accurate in detail billing accompanied by upfront/fully disclosed pricing   fees costs will never be properly addressed. People will simply look for ways to throw money at the problem through third party insurance companies or government/tax payers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Republicans failed to pass their version of health care because they did the same that Obama Care did. They created an INSURANCE bill, not a care bill. 

Republican messaging needs to include the COST issues of actual CARE. Insurance is just a method of payment or source of money for the health care industry. Third party money creates inflation and lays the seeds for exploitation. Ironically one way that will help but not cure cost issues are the markets. But when an entire market relies on a optional form of payment called insurance it is not a free market. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Republicans originally endorsed REPEAL, not repeal and replace. The first time I heard a Republican including repeal and replace you knew it was game over.

REPLACE was an over promise. DAY ONE was an over promise. 

But the pundits on the left were right, what are you going to replace it with. I would've repealed and offer up medicare/medicaid expansion right off the bat. Keep it simple. 

By redoing Obama Care which was nothing but a short recycle of the original it gave openings to special interests like big insurance and big pharma.

Republican messaging SUCKS. The conservative media gets it and gets their message across. One of the things they do is they deal in detail, the minutia much better than Republican politicians. 

The Republicans should have worked on reasons to repeal messaging a few months longer hammering, driving home the point and issues of premium increases, limited choice of doctors and plans/companies, mandates and costs like deductibles. Also needed to emphasize and relay the message that Obama Care was a tax AND those paying higher premiums are paying the tax or for others subsidized health care-that's another issue the Republicans failed to pursue. Obama Care was/IS subsidized health care. By subsidizing it and consumers getting a health insurance through a private sector company many FAIL to realize their plan is subsidized.   </TEXT>

http://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/high-drug-prices-Obama/2012/06/09/id/441767/

To many issues/associated bills for an insurance bill to " solve " all the health CARE issues at once. The Republicans duplicated the Democrats here as well. A onetime huge piece of legislation will not solve decades of issues, problems, costs etc. They have to pick away at it piece by piece line by line. Or let Obama Care fail and then they even more proof it's not working.

Should add yes 'without standardized costs' or lack of upfront disclosure/pricing is a major ingredient to exploitation of the current big insurance based system. </TEXT>
