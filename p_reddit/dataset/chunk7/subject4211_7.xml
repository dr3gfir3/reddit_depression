	<TEXT> House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes said Wednesday that President Donald Trump's personal communications may have been picked up by investigators through "incidental collection."

Translation: investigators are conducting surveillance on what we'll call a bad dude.  Trump communicates with the bad dude.  Investigators now have Trump's communications with the bad dude.

Nunes said at a news conference he discovered the potential surveillance of Trump himself while reviewing intelligence reports, but said it was not related to Russia.

Being "not related to Russia" only narrows it down somewhat.  For example, could the bad dude be an Azerbaijani money-launderer?

"This is a normal, incidental collection, based on what I could collect," Nunes said. "This appears to be all legally collected foreign intelligence under" the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

Okay, investigators are not overstepping their bounds here.

Nunes said the collection included Trump transition officials, and also said that it happened after the election. He said he could not say whether it meant that Trump was "spied on".

"I'm not going to get into legal definitions, bit clearly I have a concern," he said.

Uh, yeah, I have a concern too: why are Trump transition officials, and possibly Trump himself, communicating with a bad dude? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the full text of Comey's opening statement, arbitrarily split into paragraphs by me, with grammar and punctuation also corrected by me.

Mr. Chairman, ranking Member Schiff, members of the Committee, thank you for including me in todays hearing. Im honored to be here representing the people of the FBI. I hope we have shown you through our actions and our words how much we at the FBI value your oversight of our work, and how much we respect your responsibility to investigate those things which are important to the American people. Thank you for showing that both are being taken very seriously.

As you know our practice is not to confirm the existence of ongoing investigations, especially those investigations that involve classified matters. But, in unusual circumstances, where it is in the public interest, it may be appropriate to do so, as Justice Department policies recognize. This is one of those circumstances.

I have been authorized by the Department of Justice to confirm, that the FBI, as part of our counterintelligence mission, is investigating the Russian governments efforts to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. And that includes investigating the nature of any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign and the Russian government, and whether there was any coordination between the campaign and Russias efforts. As with any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.

Because it is an open, ongoing investigation, and is classified, I cannot say more about what we are doing, and whose conduct we are examining. At the request of congressional leaders, we have taken the extraordinary step, in coordination with the Department of Justice, of briefing this Congresss leaders, including the leaders of this committee in a classified setting in detail about the investigation. But I cant go into those details here.

I know that is extremely frustrating to some folks. I hope you and the American people can understand, the FBI is very careful in how we handle information about our cases, and about the people we are investigating. We are also very careful about how we handle information that may be of interest to our foreign adversaries. Both of those interests are at issue in a counterintelligence investigation. 

Please dont draw any conclusions from the fact that I may not be able to comment on certain topics. I know speculating is part of human nature. But it really isnt fair to draw conclusions simply because I say I cant comment. 

Some folks may want to make comparisons to past instances where the Department of Justice and the FBI have spoken about the details of some investigations. But please keep in mind that those involved the details of completed investigations. Our ability to share details with the Congress and with the American people is limited when those investigations are still open. Which I hope makes sense. We need to protect peoples privacy. We need to make sure we dont give other people clues as to where were going. We need to make sure we dont give information to our foreign adversaries about what we know or dont know. We just cannot do our work well or fairly if we start talking about it while were doing it. So we will try very, very hard to avoid that, as we always do.

This work is very complex, and there is no way for me to give you a timetable as to when it will be done. We approach this work in an open-minded and independent way, and our expert investigators will conclude that work as quickly as they can, but they will always do it well no matter how long that takes. I can promise you we will follow the facts wherever they lead.

And I want to underscore something my friend Mike Rogers said: Leaks of classified information are serious, serious federal crimes for a reason. They should be investigated and where possible prosecuted in a way that reflects that seriousness so that people understand that it simply cannot be tolerated. And I look forward to taking your questions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the tenor of the Comey and Rogers hearings going on right now are any indication, House Republicans are not yet generally ready to move toward impeachment, and such a move toward impeachment would seem to be a precondition for a Trump resignation.  Obviously, if truly significant developments were to occur, such as the FBI starting to arrest members of the Trump campaign, then the landscape would change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since I'm intimately familiar with model theory, please allow me to go into pop-science lecture mode for a few moments.

In mathematical logic, if our set of axioms is inconsistent (contradictory when taken as a whole), they're useless, because with such a set of axioms, we can prove any proposition both true and false.  So it is of utmost importance that our set of axioms be consistent.

We'll talk about "sufficiently powerful" a couple of times, which is here roughly defined as "supporting addition and multiplication of natural numbers" (that is, nonnegative integers).  Obviously, this is not a particularly high bar for a set of axioms.

Gdel published two incompleteness theorems in the 1930s.  The first was shocking and controversial in its day, but somewhat ho-hum now.  The second theorem, however, is undiminished in its jaw-dropping consequence.

The first incompleteness theorem states that any consistent, sufficiently powerful set of axioms is incomplete: working from those axioms, while we can prove that many propositions are true, and that many other propositions are false, there are propositions which we can neither prove true nor prove false from those axioms.  This theorem was shocking in itself at the time because it immediately made useless any attempt to create a complete mathematical model.

But the first incompleteness theorem is no longer particularly shocking.  No one tries to create complete mathematical models any more, and the propositions shown to be beyond the power of proof were essentially of the form "This sentence is false", which are yawn-inducing.

The proof of the first incompleteness theorem was controversial at the time, because it essentially treated what we might now consider to be "code" as what we might now consider to be "data", and very few people in the 1930s had any framework for accepting those concepts.  But we treat code as data all the time now, and we're very comfortable doing so.

Ah, then we come to the second incompleteness theorem: given a consistent, sufficiently powerful set of axioms, among the propositions that we can neither prove true nor prove false is "This set of axioms is consistent."  Think about what this means for a minute.  If we can never prove that our set of axioms is consistent, then we will never be able to rule out the possibility that everything we do with those axioms is pointless, because we could be unknowingly working with an inconsistent set of axioms.

Now we turn to real life.  Sometimes people try to pretend that they are coldly logical machines, and that they always act strictly in accordance with a set of principles.  Well, if that set of principles includes the ability to do fourth-grade arithmetic, then we know that either that set of principles is inconsistent with itself, or at least that we'll never be able to prove consistency in that set of principles.  So every reasonable belief system is in some sense a house of cards, necessarily based on a certain amount of unprovable faith in its consistency, and deservedly subject to skepticism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I upvoted you for your thoughtful and painstaking response -- but to use your phrase, it's close to "absolute nonsense".  Considering those of us who endorse the evolution of species, the benefits of vaccination, a heliocentric view of the solar system, and the like: far, far more than 0.1% of us have considered the evidence directly.  Further, there is a qualitative difference between falsifiable beliefs subject to the scientific method, and unshakeable beliefs independent of evidence.

Of course, we all choose (or arrive in some other way at) our personal axioms that we live by, and Gdel's second incompleteness theorem lurks as a trap for the unwary.  But there are fundamental and real differences between critical thinking and uncritical acceptance, and between logic and illogic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's talk about the two pieces of this.

1) White House Press Secretary 101: deniability.  It is the job of the Press Secretary to avoid being a person of interest in any story.  That's so, for example, you can answer questions like "What went on in XYZ meeting?" with "You'll have to ask the participants in XYZ meeting."  That answer doesn't work if you yourself were in XYZ meeting.  Sean Spicer needed to get almost anyone else in the Trump administration to make those calls to CIA Director Mike Pompeo and Senator Burr.

2) Contacting the head of an intelligence agency and the Senate Intelligence Committee chair to have them speak to journalists, if they're pushing back against a story that ends up being true, is participating in a cover-up.  Covering up something that may well be a crime can itself be a crime. </TEXT>

Oh yeah, they'll have that opportunity **every single day** because he's the everloving **Press Secretary** and answering questions from the press is **his actual job.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want so badly to play poker against Trumpindeed, against most of the people in his administration.  They're a total mess of tells, giving away so much information about their guilt.

Were they innocent of treasonous Russia conductwhich they've made very obvious that they're notor even in the actual scenario in which they're guilty, the simple and effective strategy is to put on a brave face:
We welcome all inquiries into the nature of our administration's relationship with Russia.  These inquiries will allow us to make clear that our conduct has been aboveboard and that we have nothing to hide.

Then, you fight your PR war with subtlety: get people to think of the investigations as a "partisan witch hunt" and a "waste of taxpayers' money" by using your backchannel contacts.

But no.  It's all bluster and bluff and blather.  We know you're holding only seven-high and you're going to lose the showdown; every move you make just reinforces that certainty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now dear to you. It is justly so, for it is a main pillar in the edifice of your real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your peace abroad; of your safety; of your prosperity; of that very liberty which you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from different causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, many artifices employed to weaken in your minds the conviction of this truth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which the batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly and actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of infinite moment that you should properly estimate the immense value of your national union to your collective and individual happiness; that you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment to it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the palladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its preservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may suggest even a suspicion that it can in any event be abandoned; and indignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to alienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the sacred ties which now link together the various parts.

But, crucially, some do: among active state militias are the California State Military Reserve (LAX is in California), the New York Guard (JFK and LGA), and the Virginia Defense Force (IAD). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's possible to be simultaneously "up with America" and "down with Trump".  You don't.  That's fine.

I think it's also possible to be simultaneously "up with Foreign Country X" and "down with Foreign Country X's current government".  That's how I feel about Israel, for example.  I won't necessarily assume that your attitude about the USA generalizes to foreign countries; I understand the argument that it's different with one's own nation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I not only honor the flag when at a sporting event, I honor the flag **when watching the national anthem on TV.**

I understand and support the people who choose to protest during the national anthem.  But it's not my personal means of protest.  To me, the anthem signifies a country where, among other things, we value the power of the people to resist even their own democratically elected president. </TEXT>
