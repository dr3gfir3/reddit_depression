	<TEXT> I don't know why but I'm weary of trying that. I guess I keep thinking it won't be compatible and will lock the box. I'll try it now after your comment  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like calling off work and just playing games all day.  This brings back so many memories. It's like having a mini arcade with all the games you grew up with. I just played a little NBA Live 95, some Shadowrun, F-Zero, and Rock n Roll Racing. All played just how I remember them. I really appreciate all the help everyone has provided and especially the main guys who made this easy for the rest of us. I don't plan on going extreme with the modding, I just enjoy playing the games. Having the option for SNES and Sega is just mind blowing.

I apologize if this post isn't relevant to anyone, I just wanted to share. </TEXT>
