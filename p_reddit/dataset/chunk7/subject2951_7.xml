Because providing evidence in a rape case, is not the same as someone being too lazy to go and find that which is readily available. If you actually cared, you'd have gone looking. Instead you're sitting there demanding someone else do the work for you, you could have been spending your time learning rather than posting here. 

You are not entitled to someone doing that work for you. Do it yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Football (soccer):*

A set of individuals paid entirely too much, running about in shorts and t-shirts, discovering new ways of flinging themselves on the floor, in order to curry favour with the referee so that a member of the opposition will be sent off the pitch. The object of the game, is to see how many times the team can get the peanut gallery to run onto the pitch armed with sponges and a stretcher to make everything better.

People gather *en masse* to watch such events, usually and generously marinaded in alcohol, to the point where they believe this is all very entertaining. Players can also be seen procuring the services of working girls, only to deny all knowledge of the fact later on. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-03-16 15:57:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello :)

So my friend who isn't a redditor, but since I am, I'm asking on her behalf. Her mother is Lithuanian but she's not very forthcoming with information. When my friend was a child, she remembers her uncle calling her *shmekla* (written phonetically because she's not sure how to spell it properly and Googling hasn't really given her much in terms of answers). 

When she asked him what it meant, he told her this:

*You little girl like nymph. You appear from from nowhere and cause all this mess, then POOF, you gone and I clean up. Like Shmekla. Chaos. Go play.*

She desperately wants to know what the right spelling of the phrase is, what it means etc. She only has basic information about her family, and she's trying to learn what she can. She knows a few words and phrases and wants to learn more, but there's no Lithuanian community where she is now. She finds it hard to learn from apps and such, she needs people to bounce questions off etc.

Any help would be very much appreciated. I spent some time asking Google myself for her, but I can't find much, aside from learning bits and pieces that made me realise I'd love to visit one day.

Thank you in advance.  </TEXT>
