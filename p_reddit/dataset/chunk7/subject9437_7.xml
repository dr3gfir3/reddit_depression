	<TEXT> Yes they are. When you have ancient scripture shit purporting that the earth was created in six days and that it is 6000 years old. That contradicts established evidence from geology and paleontology. It makes claims that are false and stupid because it was written down by an ignorant cunt like Jesus who was basically talking out of his ass, that is if he ever existed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have done first year chemistry and yes I have dealt with that. And I have used Bayes theorem to model evolutionary trees. 

You do not need to master science to see through the stupidity of the Bible and the mythical delusional nonsense therein. Anybody with a sensible state of mind will know that it is hugely improbable that Jesus walked on water or that he brought people back from the dead or that he created the universe. You can be an idiot and see through it. 

I don't need to understand science to know that it does indeed work in the same way that I don't need to understand how computers work to know that they actually do. 

What exactly is your point? I don't need to be a scientist to refute the crap that is the Bible and see how much of an ignorant fucktard Jesus was.  </TEXT>
