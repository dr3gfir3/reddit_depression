	<TEXT> For context, the quote is from the diesel-punk/noir/science fiction series *Grimnoir Chronicles*. The man speaking is somebody with magical powers, regarding legislation that would regulate persons with powers.

"FDR can go to hell. I'm a man. Not a type, not a number, and sure as hell not something that can be summed up as a logo to wear on my sleeve. A *man.* And I ain't registering nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, the reason why Spectacular Spider-Man ended how it did was because of the deal Disney made when they bought Marvel. Simply put, Spidey has separate television and film rights--Disney bought the television rights, but had to make only original stories. They couldn't continue the Sony-run Spectacular. 

Which is a damned shame, since Spectacular is one of the best animated stand-alone superhero series of all time (I'm not sure whether it's fair to bring up the DC Animated Universe here) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's certainly possible, maybe even probably. Going off Winter Soldier, we know that Senator Stern was HYDRA (and possibly others on the committee and in Congress in general).

Stern wanted the Iron Man technology, supposedly for the US military, but HYDRA would definitely have access.

Stane was quite possibly a link to Stern, and who knows? Maybe he's the one who let HYDRA know that Howard Stark had finished reverse engineering the Super Soldier Serum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When he was born, both of his parents didn't show up!

And when his parents were expecting again, they believed it to be a girl, and spent all their clothing money on dress material. But it turned out to be a boy (Roger) and so Heinz had to wear those dresses to school for a year.

And when poverty struck the family, he had to act as their guardian lawn gnome, and stay outside in the dark, with nobody to talk to.

And his only friend was Balloony, the ballon. But Balloony floated away one day and he never saw him again.

And he was eventually disowned by his family and raised by ocelots.

And he was terrible at kickball. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We met at college, freshman orientation. She was smart and funny and had dark brown hair and deep blue eyes. She didn't wear much make-up, but she always colored her fingernails and toenails with Magic Marker (She explained that it was much easier to clean that way).

She didn't like to party at all. Which was okay with me, since I didn't like the taste of alcohol (My parents let me have one glass of champagne at my cousin's wedding. Didn't care for it then). So we'd spend our Friday nights watching tv or going for walks on campus.

She was a business major, but she also loved reading and drawing. Just reading for fun and drawing for fun. When we would spend time together, sitting under a tree, she'd bring a book and read aloud.

I could never fail to make her laugh. She'd laugh at pretty anything, from dad jokes. She snorted when she laughed really hard. After she had had a bad day (getting a B- on her first test), I tickled her and she laughed so hard, she cried. Between her giggles, she said "thank you," and then she kissed me.

Our romance was short-lived, sadly, ending in October, about six weeks after we met. 

See, it turns out she was a Yankee fan, so I had to break up with her. Red Sox forever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Citadel [Once again, a bit of a place-holder name] is the headquarters/school/sanctuary of the Shepherds, a group of knights who took it upon themselves to protect the realms. 

The Citadel is first a castle--not unlike Hogwarts, or the Academ from *Codex Alera* by Jim Butcher, or even Bone Academy from *Children of the Red King.*

The consciousness-shifters act as gamekeepers, maintaining the castle, and making sure there are plenty of statues and suits of armor for their souls to take in the event of attack. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The consciousness-shifters, [I haven't decided on a proper name yet], are a race of humanoids that live throughout the realms, though their largest population resides on the greater grounds of the Citadel where the Shepherds live.

Consciousness-shifters posses the ability to leave their bodies behind, and take on the form of other existing objects. Suppose you were to leave your body behind to animate a statue or a suit of armor. 

More powerful consciousness-shifters, if they sit in close proximity to one another, can take on multiple objects and share the new bodies. 

Unlike golems, the consciousness-shifters are not limited to organic matter, and can even take over machines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, Legend of Korra was meant to only be a miniseries (With that in mind, the first season isn't that bad, if one considers it stand-alone)

Season 2 was an abomination, with one shining gem of a two-parter. Though "Beginnings" does raise plenty of questions of its own, related to the nature of the Avatar in general. I'm fairly certain the writers originally said that the "Avatar spirit" was the "spirit of the world" which allows for moral grayness. Ravaa and Vaatu made it good-versus-evil/order-versus-chaos.

But I also recognize that the writing crew for "LoK" didn't have their best writer. Aaron Ehasz didn't return. </TEXT>

In the "Infancy Gospel of Thomas," Jesus kills several other children, and blinds their parents.

	<TEXT> He's likely referring to the Gnostic gospels, a collection of works that emerged starting around the middle of the second century A.D. or later. (For context, the canonical gospels were written between 60 and 90 A.D. or so. Several of the letters attributed to St. Paul are dated between 50 and 60 A.D.)

The Gnostic gospels include "Secret Gospel of Mark" and "Gospel of Thomas" and "Gospel of Judas." They included some stories of the early life of Jesus, and the depiction is less than flattering. 

They were thoroughly discredited by the early Christian Church and  condemned as heretical. </TEXT>

It's more apparent in the books, but some of Voldemort's followers were just as scary. Bellatrix Lestrange, Antonio Dolohov (who killed Lupin), Augustus Rookwood (who killed Fred Weasley in the books).

Seeing as we know that Dumbledore is the one who defeats Grindelwald once and for all, it's going to be a little anticlimactic seeing him fight Newt and friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why I like Force Awakens so much more then R1. Rey, Finn, Poe, and Kylo Ren are all great and likeable characters, even if (in some cases) they aren't even super relevant to the plot

That's something to that I think. One thing I noticed in Rogue One is that the two main characters in particular are rather unnecessary to the plot. Jin's father already had that one defecting pilot bring the secret information to the rebels. 

And I definitely agree that about the "fuck yeah" moment. Force Awakens may have been a bit paint-by-numbers, but darn it if the actors playing Fin and Poe weren't having the time of their lives doing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great - but: Would you guys really want to be lumped in with all the crazy?

I'm not an atheist but I am familiar with the phenomenon. These "atheist churches" sprouted up because the members missed the aspect of community. Or the music. Or the organization. 
And some atheists attend Unitarian-Universalist services, which emphasize social justice. 

I mean all religious people are IMHO delusional (loved the book "The God Delusion" - Thanks Mr. Dawkins!)

I. Am. Not. Delusional. Have you ever actually discussed religion or spirituality outside of the Internet? 

You bring up Dawkins? Have you ever read the works of atheists who found faith? C.S. Lewis? Lee Strobel?

hell, by starting an "Atheist Church" you kind of go down to the fucking level of SCIENTOLOGY (that fucking sect started by a fifth rated (if not worse!) science fiction author should IMHO be forbidden!), I just don't know if that's worth it!

I am insulted on behalf of all atheists for that statement. And Ron L. Hubbard is one of the best science fiction writers of the twentieth century. If you think he's "fifth rate," than I am genuinely curious to see what masters of wordsmithing you consider to be good.

ps: Germany is great this way, we have a lot of atheists here (former East-Germany (the disbanded German Democratic Republic!) had a lot of non-believers because they tried to get people away from church during the cold war (when that part of Germany was under socialist/communist "management")) 

You do realize that the Soviets had a habit of slaughtering priests and other religious figures? They had a god, and it was the State. That's not exactly something to get excited about.

so we kind of have a voice in parliament (sure the believers often manage to drown us out (in certain instances they really pile on the pressure and muslims stand with jews and christians against us non-believers...strange right?)

If by "voice in Parliament" you mean advocating for complete secularization of society. I haven't forgotten that Germany outlawed home-schooling, and threatened Christian parents with arrest.  

Also, the inter-religious conflicts of the Abrahamic religions is far more complicated than what your statements imply. And I don't know where you get your sources, but in the West, Christians and observant Jews have been getting along recently--to use your juvenile terms, we like each other.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why bigoted? 

Not so much in your original post, but scrolling down you mention your complete disdain for religion, snidely referring to it as akin to having "imaginary friends."

That's bigotry, that is. 

I want her to seek treatment for what I see as some grief left over from seeing her mother die and some delusions from her dad who raised her as best he could but actually needs treatment himself?

We have no notion that Luna didn't get some sort of treatment. She's clearly far more at peace with the idea of death, and the possibility of an afterlife, than anyone else in the canon, except perhaps Dumbledore or Nicholas Flamel. 

There is nothing to indicate that Luna suffers from delusions, which are neurological in order. Conspiracy theorist and amateur cryptozoologist she may be, but the fact of the matter is she is **not** delusional. 

At only a very few points in the canon do we actually see that Luna is factually wrong about the various conspiracies. [Sirius is not a musician. The Rotfang Conspiracy is most likely bogus. Fudge is not baking goblins into pies {though I wouldn't be surprised if he's killed a couple; we know he was trying to steal away control of the banks).

And similarly, Xenophilius does not appear to suffer from delusions either. </TEXT>

Cap didn't die until after Civil War was over though, and to be fair to Tony, he was distraught over it.

I don't get it about comic book writers either. The comics are written with a very...authoritarian bent (They came out and said that Tony was meant to be the good guy in Civil War. And that's not even factoring into the even worse Civil War 2, which had the side that advocated imprisoning people before crimes were committed).

Contrast that to the extremely popular Captain America films that some have argued possess a libertarian world view. </TEXT>

In a world with Billywigs [tiny electric blue wasps that cause people to float when they're stung], those two are remarkably plausible). Luna is not delusional.

	<TEXT> Sometimes I think that Civil War gets a bit of a harsh deal. That said, I only read the original seven issues (all in one volume).

The instigation/prologue/whatever-you-want-to-call-it isn't bad at all by any means. It makes sense that collateral damage would eventually lead to public outcry. We've seen it before in our own world many times.

And some of the side stories are great. Peter's defection to Cap's side. Hank Pym being sick with remorse over what's happened. The role of the Punisher.

And Hercules, he was awesome! Just plain awesome! When is he getting a MCU movie?

But there's also a lot that really, really, really sucks. 

Richards and Tony go on and on about how "the public wants this to happen." They say public wants, I say mob rule.

And that ending--okay, so the Constitution means squat, Captain AMERICA?! So long as the public gets what they want?

Vernon's a bigger arse than before? It's all but stated there's Someone Else trying to pull strings.

Snape's a villainous villain from Villain-ville? It's pre-DH, the fandom was split down the middle on Snape's allegiance.

Malfoy? The kid could pull off Serpentsorsia as a second-year. 

Politics? The most we really see outside the custody hearing is that one party at Longbottom Manor. And it's more a bunch of stuffy old people being stuffy and Neville barely escaping being bored out of his skull.

If PBS were to lose its federal funding (and that's a mighty big IF), most of the children's shows would be just fine.

Sesame Street (which now airs its newest episodes on HBO) and Arthur have lots of merchandise--picture books and plush toys and video games. Arthur would be able to adjust and find a new distributor.

What would be at risk if PBS were to lose federal funding are the regional shows that are allotted the aforementioned funds in the first place.

If Levar Burton was able to raise over a million dollars for a Reading Rainbow-inspired program (which far exceeded his expectations), I really do think that Arthur could do the same. </TEXT>
