	<TEXT> Name's Zach. I'm 22. I'm a very laid back guy and easy to get along with. I prefer people the age of 18+. 

I play BO3, GTA V, Rocket League, Garden Warfare 2 and more.

My PSN is bigheartedboy. If you add me, say you're from Reddit and your age. (Btw don't judge my username I made it years ago on the PS3 and waiting on Sony to implement a username change.) :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys. Thought I would give this a shot. Looking for friends to play on the PS with. I'm a laid back guy and enjoy having conversations while playing games. At the moment I'm currently playing Plants Vs Zombies Garden warfare 2 which is a great shooter. I have COD BO3 and GTA V that I play as well. PSN is bigheartedboy (I made this years ago and wished I could change it). Feel free to add me. I'm off for the weekend and would like some new friends! 

Thank you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (I forgot to mention my timezone is central.) Hello, I'm Zach. I'm 22 years of age. I'm a pretty laid back guy and love to laugh. Now that I've gotten a PS4, I pretty much don't have anyone to play with. Yeah, soloing online is alright for awhile, but then it just gets kinda boring without anyone to play with and that's why I'm here. I'm very easy to get along with and also an open minded gamer. I play on the PS4 as of right now and play GTA V, Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare, and Rocket League. I will also be getting Black Ops III when it arrives and will be buying Battlefront as well. Feel free to ask any questions or PM me. I'd love to have a friend to get to know and play with.  </TEXT>
