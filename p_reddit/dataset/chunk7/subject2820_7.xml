	<TEXT> I appreciate the criticism, the darker eye should be moved a little away from the nose so the spacing is correct. An easy fix. As for the mouth it because of the way the shadows are working that give her that make her mouth look extended, which can be adjusted with shading. The top of her head is in the shadows and it's not being hit by the light source, so it makes it appear like I cut her head short lol. The lighting is pretty unusual tbh, and not many people see the character like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never read a short story this long on Reddit before, but this entire senerio and humour reminds me of "The Martian" and I absolutely love it. wouldn't mind reading a book based on this that goes into more detail and is emotionally gripping and funny like "The Martian" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My grandparents went to Mexico to see family this week. Apparently they are in Manzinillo, which is unfortunately right in the path of the hurricane. All my aunts and uncles are freaking out in a group text over what's going to happen to them. The people there haven't evacuated. My aunt got a hold of them and they are getting all the residents with weak homes and sheltering them. They're so unaware of what's about to happen. I hoping I can still see my grandparents by the time this is over  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My grandparents went to Mexico to see family this week. Apparently they are in Manzinillo, which is unfortunately right in the path of the hurricane. All my aunts and uncles are freaking out in a group text over what's going to happen to them. The people there are stuck since the government has shut down the roads leading out of the area. My aunt got a hold of them and they are getting all the residents with weak homes and sheltering them. I hope they can endure whatever this monster of a storm produces.  </TEXT>
