The GPS on my course's carts shows an overhead map of the course, with a touch-screen allowing me to see distance to certain objects. So if it's a 420 par 3, I can tap the screen in the middle of the fairway and it will split it into, "250, 170" yardages. Really helps strategically play.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The above rule doesn't matter if it's intentional or not, though. 

 A batter is out for illegal action when: He interferes with the catchers fielding or throwing by stepping out of the batters box or making any other movement that hinders the catchers play at home base.

I agree it was unintentional, but he still stepped out of the batters box and got in the way of the throw pretty egregiously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is such a misrepresentation of what happened. Sanders was asked if he endorsed Ossoff, and he said he didn't know him very well. So the reporter said, "Do you think Ossoff is a real progressive?" (a ridiculously loaded question), [so Bernie then said](http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/329559-sanders-i-dont-know-if-ossoff-is-progressive):

 I dont know. If you run as a Democrat, youre a Democrat. Some Democrats are progressive, and some Democrats are not."

The journalist was trying to bait Sanders into a controversial comment, and when Bernie gave him a vague nonspecific answer to avoid it everyone took it out of context anyways. He's not the one creating some sort of "purity test". 

**EDIT**: as /u/deaduntil showed below, I'm wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not being a dick at all.

Guys like TheJester, John Schindler, and MikeFarb (who all have various IC sources) have suddenly started chatting about a big news story breaking today. Usually they have info about 24 hours in advance because newspapers call people in advance for their statement (which is why Trump always knows when to cause a tweet storm when a big story is breaking). 

Yeah, I know that "Some guys on twitter says so" isn't a strong case, but they've almost always been right when things are about to drop.  </TEXT>
