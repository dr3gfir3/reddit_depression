	<TEXT> Sooooooooooooo, here's my notes:

- Yes, I believe taking a bit more time may have benefited you. I don't mean this in an offensive way, but it almost seemed like I was reading a comment on an AskReddit thread about creepy experiences as opposed to a story. 

- With that, I really dig the concept. It was a little freaky to think about that ending for a second when I put myself in that situation. I would aim to elaborate if you want to revisit this. You can really creep it up, so to speak.

- Avoid using two words close together. I believe it was your second paragraph's first sentence that began with "now" and ended with "now." 

- There were a lot of unnecessary details that didn't affect the plot. Try to limit those. An example would be how it's normally dark when you went to work that time of year. I get why it was mentioned, but it didn't actually have anything to do with what was going on. 

I like it. Don't take my notes as a deterrent! I like to be honest in order to help :)

Keep writing!

	<TEXT> Felix Blackwell's series about his fiancee made me super uneasy. I had a hard time sleeping every night I read an update. 

The Queen's Guard series by /u/inaaace, specifically the last part, messed me up bad, too. I have a huge front window in my house and I live in a very dark area. I kept my blinds closed for a while due to that part. 

There's been a few more, but those are the two that immediately come to mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might be misunderstanding you, so I apologize if I miss the mark here.

I don't think that the two points you made about the true intent of the rule and the role-playing aspect are mutually exclusive. The role-playing is almost necessary to preserve the "sanctity" of the comments. To me, the role-playing is the means by which the true purpose of the rule is upheld. Also, some of these stories are *really* fucking believable. A lot of people moght think they're true. I know I've gotten my fair share of messages from people who genuinely seem to believe my stories. Just wanted to add that in.

Let me know if I missed your point though. I love discussions like this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of ruins the excitement of a cliffhanger, doesn't it? I do see your point. You would know exactly how long it's going to be. You know how much commitment it would take to read a series. You know it has an end.

Well, what fun is life if you know how far out the end of everything is? Life ends, would you want to know when you die? (Don't answer that, I'm being rhetorical)

Also, on a more practical and less I'm-sleep-deprived-and-delusional note, I would wager that requiring writers to post the number of parts to a series would have a direct effect on views. Do you think someone would be more likely to dive into a thirteen-part epic that could run on for weeks or a three-part series that will be done in three days with minimal commitment or waiting?

I'm not good at ending things. Uh. Wubba lubba dub dub, bitches!

	<TEXT> Everyone hates Mondays. I'm not the exception to this. Well, I hate Mon*day*, in particular. I don't hate them all. Just one - the one I'm stuck in. Or...on, perhaps? I don't really know how to refer to this dilemma. If it's truly a dilemma. We succeeded in the Murray Experiment...time is frozen. It's just...I'm the only one here.

Currently, I'm sitting at my desk recording these events in the office I shared with Dr. Parsons. I wish the University would have let him keep his position as a physical science professor. Chris was as smart as they come, but he's...limited when it comes to financial matters. I suppose a job is a job. It definitely was the better alternative offered to him following the experiment.

Dr. Christopher Parsons and I are.*were* scientists. Well...scientists in the sense that we convinced a legitimate educational institution to finance our studies into the applications of time manipulation. 

Yes, that's right - time manipulation is a real thing. Time, as most people know it, is simply a unit of measurement. Minutes, hours, days, years - all units devised so humans can place a number on things. It's a weird obsession we have. None of that is real...tangible. However, it's undeniable that time exists. Organisms age. Seasons come and go. Food decays. Nothing known to man could escape that reality until Dr. Parsons and I discovered the *billimite.*

Yes, as you probably guessed we really enjoy *Groundhog Day.* It was very apropos given our intentions. 


The billimite is a phenomenal creature! Most people are familiar with the tardigrade, a virtually indestructible, microscopic creature that can even live exposed in space. Yes, that is cool. However, the billimite is infinitely more sensational. The term mite is used affectionately. This creature is closer to the size of a rat fetus, and has fully developed, fully functioning body systems. It isn't a mammal, but it's internal makeup is almost identical and the differences are negligible. What truly sets the billimite apart is its inability to age. It simply cannot. Chris and I dissected dozens of these beings to discover their inner workings. They. Don't. Age. Not on the surface. Not on a cellular layer. They're frozen in time. 


We knew that harnessing the ability these things have to cease aging would be a breakthrough unlike anything ever seen by the human race. I mean, imagine the possibilities! The aging process could have been halted. Those with terminal illnesses could be put in suspension until a cure was created. Cryogenics had become increasingly popular, but our findings could have given people the same benefit without putting their lives on hold. Thus began the Murray Experiment.


The trials were only done on mice - terminally ill ones, at that. We had a plethora of them as there was an infectious disease research center sharing the same university as us. I still question why they funded us, honestly. That's besides the point. Chris and I, well, we didn't exactly know where to start. Billimites don't age, but they also don't have anything in their biological makeup that appears to be the source of their...power. So we started with the basics. 


The first trial was blood transfusions. While small, billimites have a full circulatory system complete with red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets...the works. We had to use very, very thin needles as the opaque white skin of the billimites doesn't favor showing any veins. They're also incredibly smooth and a bit of a pain to pin down. Once one got a needle through the subcutaneous layer, the billimites would begin writhing in pain. This, combined with their smooth skin, made it virtually impossible to land a second successful injection. The mice didn't respond well to the new blood. Their bodies began rapidly shutting down within one day of receiving the donor blood. Failure.


Next, we skipped ahead and went with a more...unconventional approach - consumption. We took billimites and carefully (and humanely, PETA) removed various sections from their bodies to feed to the mice. Although we had dissected enough of them, cutting their limbs away was nothing short of bizarre. Upon applying pressure to an appendage, their bones would seem to vanish and we would be making cuts similar to those of a filet mignon with a butter knife. If you can imagine a naked mole rat, 50 times smaller, that's the size of what we had to deal with and we were still having many difficulties cutting away pieces. The mice that ate the body parts displayed symptoms similar to malaria, and died within one week on ingestion. 


The trials were numerous and tiresome on Chris and I. We had many late nights discussing abandoning the experiment over scotch. Every time, maybe due to the alcohol, we managed to convince each other to persevere. One of our last resorts was stem cell injections. We had postponed attempting the technique due to the high chances of failure, but after months of various tests we finally made the plunge. 


It was a Monday. 1:18pm, Eastern Standard Time. Dr. Parsons and I had every single thing perfectly prepared for the transplant. Extra restraints on the billimite. Overly sterilized equipment. Multiple checks. Multiple balances. We weren't willing to try this twenty times like the other, simpler trials. I also used my two index fingers to attempt to keep the billimite stable when it would undoubtedly start convulsing. Chris steadied his needle as a drip of sweat made its way from my brow down to my beard. I was flush. The ticking from the wall clock ceased to exist. We were living in one moment, one last opportunity to possibly save mankind from the inevitable. Chris began his approach with the needle. As the tip penetrated its skin, the billimite let out a small yelp, like a puppy being left alone. We had never heard these creatures make noise before. Chris and I shared a glance, unsure what to do. We had already teetered on the ledge of ethics but that noise unsettled both of us. It was infantile. A helpless baby, crying for help from its mother. We searched the others face for an answer and as I nodded to Chris to continue a piercing pain shot up my hand into my head. The billimite stabbed me with a thin, whisker-like protrusion from its head. I became severely lightheaded and moved back to sit up against the wall.


I nodded off for a brief moment. When I awoke, Chris was on the ground in front of me, body lurched towards the ground, crying. I thought that my attempts to console him were fruitless because he was too far gone. Maybe he finally cracked. We were under a lot of stress due to the numerous failures in the Murray Experiment. 


I ran down to the shared office of the psych professors, hoping they could help. I don't know why. It felt right not making a huge ordeal of the situation. This was a confidential matter between professionals, not a university-wide scandal. When I got the office and knocked, the older female professor, Joyce, answered and looked directly at me, baffled. Then she closed the door. I knocked again. Joyce opened the door, this time coming out into the hallway before she closed the door again. I knocked for a third time. Joyce answered the door again, with an angry demeanor. Stop this nonsense! She snarled out of the doorway. She began to close the door. 


Joyce! I yelled as I grabbed her forearm. She fell to her knees. The other professor ran over to her side, asking if she need a medic. 


No, no...it-its fine. Just a ringing in my ear, that's all. Must have scraped my arm on the door. It burns a bit, but I'm fine. 


I briskly made my way back to Chris. I didn't have time for whatever games were going on or any ridiculous experiments those crazy old bats were conducting. 


Our lab was quarantined and guarded. Chris was gone. 


I didn't wait up. 


I walked back to my house on campus and started frantically looking up any breaking news stories. I needed to know what the media was saying. I needed to have a story ready for any interviews, good...or bad. 


Nothing. It must have been too recent for the news outlets to have grabbed hold of it. 


I got a ping notifying me of a new email. 


*Nate,*


*I'm sorry. It should have been me. I never knew your family or friends, but if you're one of them and reading this, I loved Nate like a brother. I never would have continued our research had I know it could end up this way. I'm so, so, so sorry.*


*Dr. Christopher Parsons, Sc.D.*

*Ohio State University*


The sincerity of his email finally set off a red flag that something was wrong. Chris wasn't an outwardly emotional person. Something happened to me during the Murray Experiment. I responded to the email with a simple question:


Chris, what happened?


In his response, Dr. Parsons explained to me that as I fell back into the wall and sat down, my body began to age rapidly - faster than ice in hot soup. Then it began to decompose into nothingness. There was no trace that I had ever been up against that wall. I was...gone.


I spent that entire day emailing Chris about everything besides the actual experiment. I was bitter about not finishing the stem cell transplant and avoided the topic like a plague. He wasn't arrested in my disappearance. The cameras that the university installed in our labs (unbeknownst to us) caught the same scenario he described to me. It was chalked up to the nature of the experiment. It was covered up and he was free to go. Immediately. While they could take months at a time to process a grant, they somehow were able to cover-up a disaster and make a decision in regards to Chris future in a few hour's time. 


A few hours time? That wasn't right. It couldn't have been. In my years with the university and my run-ins with law enforcement, **nothing** processed that fast. Hell, I was killed on camera! 


It hit me. I asked Chris what day it was. Thursday. The same day my computer was showing me. The same day on the news and my phone. It hadn't dawned on me that I never slept after returning home. Nor needed to use the facilities. Or eat and drink. I went to the bathroom and my unibrow hadn't grown in, as it has every couple days since puberty. Chris agreed to meet me Friday at noon to figure things out over coffee. 


I laid in bed that night, contemplating the circumstances surrounding my existence. I didn't sleep. Sun went down. Moon came up. Moon went down. Sun came up. 


I got to Starbucks a little bit after Chris did. I almost burst into a full run when I saw him and I jumped slightly onto his back when I got close, like old times. He collapsed, but got back up rather quickly, slightly red in the face. 


You okay? I asked him. He didn't respond. Just stuck a pinky in his ear and gave it a quick wiggle. A moment or two later, he pulled out his phone and started typing me an email.


*Nate,


*Sorry I missed you. Have to get to class. Let's link up ASAP.*


*Chris.*


I responded immediately from my own phone. We went to the university, separate...but together. 


We ran experiments in the infectious disease lab. Chris would tell me what to do, and I would do it. Or object via email. 


First objective, grab a mouse. Simple. I placed my hand on top of the one that Chris placed on the table. It cried as it died in my palm. 


Second objective, communicate to someone. I went into the hallway between classes and started calling out familiar students by name. They all had similar reactions - rubbing their ears in one form or another. 


Third objective, lift a book. So I did, as Chris recorded it with his phone. He played it back to me. I saw myself life the book and place it at the other end of the table. On the video, the book just appeared on the other side in a blink. 


We did mundane tests like this for hours - well into the night. Chris and I learned what I'm able to do and what I cannot do. Our hypothesis is that the billimite injected me with some sort of chemical that we hadn't seen in our analysis of their inner workings. That chemical, due to whatever possible reason, was able to imbue me with the same benefits that the billimite has - lack of aging. However, it's also placed me into a sort of ethereal time zone where I can observe the world around me aging and progressing, all the while being absolved from it. 


We need to find another billimite. It appears, however, that someone has wiped them from existence. The best is gone. Our specimens are gone. It's like they never existed...just like me. My house, my belongings, and all of my research have vanished. There's no trace that I existed aside from the memories of people who knew me. I'm a ghost, as is Chris.


He was killed about eight years ago. Chris was at home in his study when a man in red came up behind him and strangled him with a wire. I tried grabbing the man around the neck, but before I could get close his dog came from the other room and attacked me, pulling me to the floor. There were so many emotions running through me at that moment, but I was stuck on bliss. Bliss for the first physical interaction I had in years. It almost completely overshadowed the horror of my only contact in the outside world...and my closest friend...being killed. 


The man in red whistled to his dog once the deed was done and it ceased attacking me. It sat still, in fact. Glaring at me with it's head tilted to the side.


There's others. It spoke to me. 


The man in red whistled again and they were gone. I tried calling 911, but the operators couldn't hear me. After almost ten calls, an officer finally showed up and discovered Chris body. 


They ruled his death a suicide.


In the years since then, I've focused all of my efforts on finding the others that are like me. Chris, while I do miss him, might have served a greater purpose in his death and I've come to terms with that now. I need a way out. We weren't making any progress. The man in red and his dog gave me something Chris never could:

	<TEXT> Everyone hates Mondays. I'm not the exception to this. Well, I hate Mon*day*, in particular. I don't hate them all. Just one - the one I'm stuck in. Or...on, perhaps? I don't really know how to refer to this dilemma. If it's truly a dilemma. We succeeded in the Murray Experiment...time is frozen. It's just...I'm the only one here.

Currently, I'm sitting at my desk recording these events in the office I shared with Dr. Parsons. I wish the University would have let him keep his position as a physical science professor. Chris was as smart as they come, but he's...limited when it comes to financial matters. I suppose a job is a job. It definitely was the better alternative offered to him following the experiment.

	<TEXT> So, /r/writingprompts is great. Most times. Every now and then it gets a little *too* specific. But that isn't the point.

I feel like horror, specifically /r/nosleep, could use something like writing prompts for horror. I'd be willing to start something up if there's interest. Or contribute if something like that already exists. 

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Different opinions on how to proceed with bathroom tiling. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-13 14:12:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm doing a partial bathroom renovation. I'm getting ready to move onto the flooring part and I'm running into a small issue on difference of opinion on how to proceed. 

The house is 100 years old, and the original (under two layers of laminate) flooring in the bathroom was hardwood. It's covered in adhesive and more or less destroyed. **I don't have any pictures handy, sorry**. In all of the tile jobs I've done (assistant, this is my first solo run) I've always pulled up all of the flooring down to the subfloor, replaced if needed, added cement board, and then proceeded with the tiling. 

However, my girlfriend and some of the handier people in her family believe that I don't need to take up the hardwood flooring, and that I can just lay down the cement board over it and proceed with tiling from there. They're quite adamant about it, too (in a nice way - I just don't agree with it). I know it would be possible. I mean, it will add to the overall height of the floor (and I'd have to undercut the door, raise the toilet, etc.) which my girlfriend is fine with. I've explained everything to her very thoroughly. 

My main concern is in the integrity of the tile over time. With an uneven surface underneath, wouldn't that stress the tile and cause cracks years down the road? Or am I trying to do too much on something that doesn't need it? 

If needed, I'll try and snag some pictures later, but it won't be for 8+ hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Piggybacking off of /u/tanjasimone, how far out do you plan your interviews? Is it like a spreadsheet for a X-month period, or do you guys just chat once a month and nominate someone? 

Also, Berenstain or Berenstein?

I'd also like to know how all of you felt about Skittles changing the flavor of the green Skittle from lime to green apple.

Is that too many? The Berenstein question is the most important if it is. 

**EDIT:**

**I LIED I ACTUALLY NEED TO KNOW WHO EACH OF YOU CHOOSE AS YOUR FAVORITE JAMES BOND SO I CAN FULFIL MY HIGHER PURPOSE.**

But I'm going to leave the other questions because I feel that they're pretty okay too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, a couple things go into these being used. 

Exhibit A is karma. What works, works. I don't care who you are, if you're contributing on the main sub, you want upvotes.

Exhibit B, something you touched on, is the inability to use the cheap clickbait titles now. That was the big trend for a while, and now that those are banned, something new needed to take the spot. I'd also like to point out that I don't see these being nearly as bad as those other deceptive titles from before. Same vein, different blood. Or something.

Exhibit C. I'm just really, *really* tired today and I forgot if I had a third point. So yea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *[To the tune of: The Little Drummer Boy]*


"Run!" They told me, "You need to run now!"     
"The Vile King's coming, we need to leave town!"       
"He will take everything! We need to run now!"       
"He will stop at nothing, don't look back now!  Don't look back now, don't look back now."     

 


"Don't you look at Him, or you will find death."       
"Here he comes."


"Little Baby, I'm sorry we stayed."       
"I have no legs to run, but I will hide you."       
"Please sir, I have no souls that I can give you."       
"Nothing fit for the King, I have nothing left.       
There's nothing left. There's nothing left."


"No, please, don't take him sir, he's my only son.       
My only son."


The King took him, to raise as his own.       
An heir to the Blood Throne and all of his lands.       
The boy hated him for what he had done.       
He had a plan for Him, a plan to end it,       
plan to end it, plan to end it.


How He smiled at me, to greet his demise.       
Me and my blade. </TEXT>

night. What got me here? To no delight      
I find myself without answers. 



"Lay down," I tell myself so many times       
here in my room. It works, time zooms..        
...until my legs become dancers. 



The hours become days. I need a      
morning greeting. The ever-fleeting       
sun holds all of my answers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was the First, and she - she was the Fifth. We did dances around each other, beckoning, teasing. Proximity was a flirt. Words were useless. 

I became the Third, and she remained the Fifth. We did dances, slightly less elegant.

Then I was the Sixth, she still the Fifth. "Time heals all wounds." Time is what I clung to. Dances ceased. We started to sing curt phrases. 

Then I was the Ninth, and she became the Seventh. Finally, she danced again...in explosive, rigid movements, singing a song that fell on deaf ears.

"I can do better." I told myself. </TEXT>
