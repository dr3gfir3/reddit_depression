	<TEXT> Drew's a pretty cool dude. He participated and won an episode of Chopped on Food Network and he's a regular writer on Deadspin as well as some other sites/magazines. His other work of fiction, The Postmortal, is also worth checking into if you like The Hike. IMO, The Hike is better and more like his personality, dark but funny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just discovered the sub and love the theme. I had posted this in r/creepy a while back and didn't see it in here.

Anyhow, from the Wikipedia page for John of Leiden, one of the men tortured and killed:

 The army of Mnster was defeated in 1535 by the prince-bishop Franz von Waldeck, and John of Leiden was captured. He was found in the cellar of a house, from where he was taken to a dungeon in Dlmen, then brought back to Mnster. On January 22, 1536, along with Bernhard Krechting and Bernhard Knipperdolling, he was tortured and then executed. Each of the three was attached to a pole by an iron spiked collar and his body ripped with red-hot tongs for the space of an hour. After Knipperdolling saw the process of torturing John of Leiden, he attempted to kill himself with the collar, using it to choke himself. After that the executioner tied him to the stake to make it impossible for him to kill himself. After the burning, their tongues were pulled out with tongs before each was killed with a burning dagger thrust through the heart. The bodies were placed in three iron baskets and hung from the steeple of St. Lambert's Church and the remains left to rot. About fifty years later the bones were removed, but the baskets remain.

Dan Carlin did a podcast on this entire subject called Prophets of Doom. If you have 4 hours to spare, it's worth a listen. Available on iTunes and [here](http://www.dancarlin.com/product/hardcore-history-48-prophets-of-doom/)

I wanted to catch our first Porygon with my son over the weekend but none were showing up close to home. I broke down and drove the 20 minutes during lunch and caught four in 15 minutes. All had shitty IVs, the best one being a 60ish% one with a cp of 20, but I'm happy to have finally checked this off my list. </TEXT>

I think their should be a cap on how many of those can be in each gym, forcing people to have to use different mons. It would give it a Mortal Kombat vibe if there are 10 different types of mons to go through instead of the same 5. Just my two bad cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

So I listen to a lot of podcasts and I try to utilize the Up Next option to setup a playlist. I've noticed a couple of times that, lets say, when Joe Rogan uploads a new podcast, all of his other ones that I haven't listened to yet, will populate in a Resume Playing category under the Up Next one. What did I do and how do I undo it? It's come to a point where I've clicked an episode that I don't subscribe to, hit the Clear Next option, and then go back through mine an add the ones I want in Up Next to undo the long list of ones I don't want to listen to yet.

Sorry this sounded confusing.

	<TEXT> Hola,

Firstly, I am loving this series. The Drawing of the Three started a little slow for me and it became a bit of a chore but once the Leaning Tower *event* took place I got hooked and when Detta made her appearance I became all in. Anyhow, I'm about to finish it and I went to reserve the Wastelands but I want to make sure I'm getting the right thing. 

Through the library, it's listed with the following info:


Title:  The waste lands / Stephen King ; illustrated by Ned Dameron.

Author:  King, Stephen, 1947-

ISBN:  9780452284715 9780670032563 9780451210869

Author:  King, Stephen, 1947-

Edition:  Plume new ed.

Publisher:  Plume : Penguin Group (USA),

Publication Information:  New York : Plume : Penguin Group (USA), c2003.

Publication Date:  2003

Physical Description:  xvi, 422 p., [22] p. of plates : ill. (some col.) ; 23 cm.

Series:  

Dark tower novel ; bk. 3

Dark tower;



I guess what I'm trying to confirm is that this is not a graphic novel but the actual novel. Thanks in advance.

edit: formatting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think so. I used to be a radio listener but since they moved to late mornings I've been a podcast listener. I'm not a fan of the ESPNU/ESPN2 show and I've been listening for close to 10 years now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry dad. Going through something similar although mine are a little older. My 3 year old girl still doesn't understand why she cant see mommy on the days she's with me while my 8 year old boy has accepted this new reality. Just do what you've been doing and be there for her as much as you can. I wish you and yours the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently separated and am in the process of a divorce. I have an 8 year old boy who is my best bud and a 3 year old girl who while loves me and we're close, is 100% a mommy's girl. I was really, really nervous about how she was going to take being away from mom a couple of days a week. She wakes me up every day and we snuggle together before the day gets going. Through all of this our relationship has gotten much stronger. I love my boy with all of my heart but there is something to be said about the connection a father can have with his little girl. I feel like I could move a mountain if she needed me to. </TEXT>
