	<TEXT> My advice to someone with BPD is to get therapy, figure out your triggers, and practice safe self care. I know a few people with BPD who feel that being in a relationship **is** their self care, and to be in love is to be codependent on their partner. I honestly feel that isn't a good setup, because there is no foundation if the partner leaves. To have a good relationship with someone else, you have to be truthful to yourself and have a good relationship with yourself.

I can ask my husband for his advice and post it later. :) </TEXT>
