	<TEXT> With EA and MS it takes less than 30 seconds for a live chat or call. 

When was the last time you've tried to use EA help?

I bought Battlefield 1 the first weekend of the month, on Friday. Installed it Saturday, played for a bit, and requested a refund. I haven't heard a peep from them. **Every single link** on their website 404's. I can see that I've got a Pending Refund on the "My Cases" page, and "Refund Requested" on my Order History page and that is it.

Trying to use Chat just says, "Please wait while chat loads" forever. Any link 404's. They don't have a phone number **anywhere**, and I **still** haven't gotten my refund, almost a month later.

Steam you click refund and the game is out of your library and money returned next day.

I've tried to give EA credit, they introduced a decent Return policy long before Valve did in the US. But they're even worse than Valve. I can't get a hold of either, but at least Valve gives you your fucking money back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Valve needs to get its stuff together but it's been a long time since we started saying it. 

When have people ever stopped staying that?

Shanghai major. TF2 and CSGO all but abandoned. Diretide. DOTA getting worse and worse in regards to earning cosmetics. RNG loot crates. The forgotten Steam Machines. All the drama surrounding Left 4 Dead and it's sequel when that was announced because people expected the first to be supported long-term. **Still** waiting on HL3.

I like Steam. I like Valve. But honestly when have people ever stopped staying Valve needs to get their shit together? Maybe for the first two months of a new DOTA patch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This makes me really excited.

I'm a hardcore DOTA fan, although I just took my first step towards sobriety and uninstalled it after playing since TI2.

I tried out HOTS, and while there are a lot of things I miss from DOTA, I will say Blizzard did a solid job of taking an original take on a saturated genre. One thing I didn't like though was just how brutal it took to level up and get skins; and I sure as hell wasn't going to pay *that* price. So -- at the time -- I just went back to logging a shameful amount of hours on DOTA.

Applying the "Overwatch Model", I'm kinda thinking of going and installing this right now. Me and old friend were just talking about looking for something to play together, and while I do kinda miss DOTA, or wish HOTS had some of those things I like more about DOTA, I don't want to deal with the 50 minute games, getting shit stomped, just wishing it would **end**. The only thing worse than losing a bad game of DOTA is getting kicked in the balls for an equal amount of time.

I think I'm going to go play me some ~~Crystal Maiden~~ Jaina Proudmoore right now. As the top-post says, I wish all the heroes were free but oh well; this is better than nothing.

Edit: Is this like a smoker substituting cigarettes with candies or some other "hand held snack"? </TEXT>

You ever read about the guy who [created the popup ad](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jaymcgregor/2014/08/15/the-man-who-invented-pop-up-ads-says-im-sorry/#44e62daa4ebe)?

Specifically this line*:

 It was a way to associate an ad with a users page without putting it directly on the page, which advertisers worried would imply an association between their brand and the pages content. Specifically, we came up with it when a major car company freaked out that theyd bought a banner ad on a page that celebrated anal sex. I wrote the code to launch the window and run an ad in it. Im sorry. Our intentions were good.

	<TEXT> Is that the Scale75 model? How was it?

This thing is beautifully painted by the way. How'd you do the skin tone? I've been working on trying to step up my painting and every time I'm always disappointed with how the skin always comes out.
I try usually mixing Vallejo's "Pale Flesh" and either a gray or a brown depending on what I'm painting, a light brown wash, and then try to highlight... But it always comes out 1 of 2 ways:

* Too thick
* Too thin and splotchy

In either case, the wash often doesn't look great either.

I can never get a good middle ground between the two paint: thinner ratio, or perhaps basing gray is a problem? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to deal with a player who often gets off topic? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-25 03:54:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing with this one group for about a year now, maybe less. 7-12 months I'd say.

Overall it's a good group, we all get along but I only know 1 of them particularly well (the DM). Something that's been really bothering me recently though is that the player who hosts gets off topic all the fucking time.

We're usually there for 3, maybe 4 hours and it seems like maybe an hour, hour and a half of that is *actually* playing D D.

The rest of the time is him segueing story after story after story that was vaguely related to something that just happened. Sometimes they're amusing, half the time they're about some obscure movie or game system none of us have ever played. But then he gets off topic and eventually someone else has another story to share and it just feeds off him.

Me and the DM try to get things back on rails, but I'm not necessarily the best "leader"; I might interrupt when there's a very brief lull in his stories but I can't always keep the train on the rails. The DM tries, but it's also not a guarantee of any sort that we'll actually start playing once one of us tries to get shit going again.

The issue is that he *is* actually a really nice dude... He's just a fucking oblivious conversation dominator and I guess we're all too nice and don't want to interrupt so we quietly nod a little bit until there's a good opportunity. I don't really know how to bring this up though because it's his house. I don't get the sense that he "likes to hear himself talk" or anything like that. I have nothing against him. It's just that I'm here to play a game and I'd like to actually play the game.

Any suggestions / dealt with similar behavior? </TEXT>

Basically, because rally racing is performed over the span of *hundreds* of miles it's impossible for the drivers to memorize every turn for every stage. So they have a person sit in the passenger seat ("codriver") who actually reads off these pacenotes, which instruct the driver of things like:

I get the whole, "Men and women are different, there are male and female halves of the one power" but it does definitely get  tiring when so many of the characters subscribe to similar ideals about the opposite sex.

I haven't been interested in a single romantic arc between Perrin, Rand, or Nynaeve and so far really wish "love" wasn't part of it.

Elayne loves Rand despite barely knowing him. Nynaeve loves Lan, an emotionless silent stone. Rand doesn't know who he loves despite barely knowing any of the "contestants".

The only relationship that seems remotely "real" is Perrin and Faile because they have actually spent a lot of time together and helped one another. </TEXT>

I'm *almost* done with Book #4 and I just don't think I can do it anymore. 5 and 6 are almost as long. I feel like I've gotten tiny scraps of a reward for having made it this far.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm on chapter 51 of The Shadow Rising. 8 Chapters to go, but right now I'm thinking I'm not going to finish the series.

Book 1 was a bit slow, but introduced enough to get me interested.

Book 2 was much more enjoyable and laid some ground work for all of our characters. I think this was my favorite.

Book 3 was like a mix of 1 and 2, I thought. A bit slow, and while a good amount happened at the same time I feel like not enough happened. Or at least, I was hoping for a little bit more individual development. But there were enough chapters that left me saying, "Fuck that was cool I need more".

Book 4 has just been SO slow. The only reason I'm closed to finished with it is because I had to spend 15 hours in a car the other weekend and was able to get through 20 chapters while listening to the audio book (normally I actually read).

The past few chapters Jordan had laid some serious groundwork. [Perrin spoilers](/s "letting the White Cloaks into town after defending against the Trollocs"). [White Tower spoilers](/s  "Elaida leading an insurrection -- probably the most interesting plot point to me, especially factoring that Moraine is completely unaware"). [Rand spoilers](/s "I just do don't care about the Aiel. All of these chapters are just Rand and Avienda yelling at each other. I get that they're setting up for all the clan chiefs to come and shit's going to go down but I'm just so not interested in their culture, and Rand is still using 'not a tenth of what he's capable of'"). [Elayne and Nynaeve spoilers](/s "Another set of characters where I just want to see some growth but so little is happening. We've been hunting the Black Ajah for how long and there's nothing to show for it, except for a recent brush with another Forsaken who mysteriously mind controlled the girls and made some comments about how weak they are").

I also get really annoyed with a few things regarding the Forsaken. [Lanfear](/s "It annoys how she just pops up at her whim"). [Moghedien](/s "Similarly, her just showing up out of the blue and mind controlling Elayne and Nynaeve really bothered me. It's just like, 'Oh OK well I guess that's a thing you can do. Or maybe only her, fuck if I know"). The Aiel eluded to the Soulless coming next and I'm not even a little excited because I already don't know Jack about the "current lineup of bad guys".

I want to get into the series, especially now that I've invested ~3-4 months of reading. But fuck. Half the protagonists resent everything happening to them, and the other half has not progressed very much. During some of the recent Rand chapters I've had the thought of, "This series seems almost more about just different cultures of people than anything else."

Which is fine, there's nothing wrong with that, it's just not my thing. I don't find the Tinkers interesting. I don't care about Aiel ways and the *proper way* to ask for permission to enter a person's home.

I *do* find the one power interesting. I do find tel'aran'rhiod interesting. I do find... Whatever you'd call Perrin's ability interesting. But after 3,000 pages of reading I just feel like I've gotten so very little reward out of it. Really struggling to want to read them, knowing books 4-6 are the longest 3 of the series.


Without spoiling much, can you guys give me an idea as to what book 5 holds? Will it get more into the story elements I do find interesting? I'm afraid that Jordan has established the "bottom of the ocean" already and that the intrigue of the book is more cultural/political and grounded in character growth as *people* rather than exploring the magic and things like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i5-6500, GTX 970 and 8GB of DDR4, I had very few issues playing at 25601440.

Only time I did was on my Loud playthrough, and even then lagspikes / frame drop wasn't consistently an issue for me. Sometimes it would dip briefly when I first got a dude with lots of NPCs on the screen but it would quickly resume to a playable state.

On my quiet / low chaos, stealthy playthrough I had zero issues ever.

So in my personal experience, I wouldn't consider the performance issues to be significant enough to not buy the game. </TEXT>

Something about "Battle" being too strong of a word, and ".net" just being antiquated.

As someone who grew up playing D2, I think it's dumb. But Blizzard has changed significantly in the past 10-15 years so it makes sense they'd rebrand things to conform to "Modern Blizzard" ideas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see your point but you need to realize internet is not a necessity.

Despite being a programmer by trade, someone who grew up from a very young age using the internet as a daily part of my life, and just generally being a tech enthusiast, I do agree that it's not a necessity.

But I also think that the internet is one of the single greatest things mankind has built. You can learn almost anything. It is the largest collection of damn-near the collective knowledge of the world. It is a tremendously powerful tool regardless of what your using it for, whether it be personal or professional. It has absolutely revolutionized way the world interacts, learns, and generally behaves.

I don't think it's a matter of necessity or not. I simply think it's wrong to allow a select few to indiscriminately track and sell damn near everything I do.

As I edited my post to say, software companies already do this but there's a lot you can do to control what gets tracked. With something like this, though, all bets are off. </TEXT>

For my area, you either live somewhere Time Warner (or should I say Spectrum?) services ($80 for/mo for 60Gb) or somewhere Verizon services with Fios ($55/mo for the first year) for 50Gb.

Can't find what the price goes up to after the first year on their website, but I'm sure it's equally as much of a *great value* as TW.

	<TEXT> I love it:

 The Senate measure was**introduced two weeks agoby Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) and 23 Republican co-sponsors. Flake said at the time that he is trying to "protect consumers from overreaching Internet regulation."**

Yes, protect us from not having our personal data sold. While we're at it why don't we protect us from HIPA too and start selling our medical data.

 FCC Chairman Ajit Pai argues thatconsumers would be confused if there are different privacy rules for ISPs than for online companies like Google and Facebook. **"American consumers should not have to be lawyers or engineers to figure out if their information is protected," Pai recentlytold Democratic lawmakers.**

Yes; now you can all sleep soundly knowing your information is being sold. 

Edit: To everyone already saying, "But Google/Facebook already sell your data!!"

You can change search providers. Lots of people don't even have a Facebook account. For me, I don't use their apps and I only use it for chat to coordinate with my D D groups.

If you think the two are the same then you should seriously consider the differences between the two. You can install browser plugins to mitigate tracking and use different sites, browsers, and devices.

You have some modicum of control.

In most of this country, you have 1 choice for an internet provider. So it doesn't matter what you do or where you go; it's going to them first. </TEXT>

It's absolutely manageable, but anyone who says it isn't there is lying.

I wouldn't say it's bad, definitely easy to correct, but I can feel it in first and second if I floor it. Third... I don't often floor it in third, and if I have recently I can't recall weather / tire temperatures so it might be unfair to say.

Full disclosure; I only have All Seasons for not-winter, and Winter tires. I'm looking to get a set of actual Summer tires this year which I'm sure will help but I don't believe it'll still remove the problem.

Also, as others have said, the factory rear motor mount is absolute dogshit in the Fiesta; the engine seriously moves. That definitely doesn't help. Short comparison video of stock vs aftermarket; https://youtu.be/SfQUrLCX-MM </TEXT>

I just upgraded to 2x 25601440 monitors and was having a lot of issues with the default device drivers. Found some tutorial online for the Nvidia drivers; followed the steps, rebooted, then when I would try to log in my screen would flash random colors and dump me back to the login screen.

It was a relatively new Linux install, after trying to fix it over the course of the week I said fuck it and reformatted the disk from my Windows partition (was dual booting across 2 physically different disks). Rebooted again and now Windows wouldn't boot because the MBR was fucked.

Eventually fish out my Windows disc and repaired that, but fuck what a goddamn headache.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't disagree, but from what I understand "street legal" is actually not an exceptionally difficult obstacle overcome.

 Most requirements for automobiles are consistent between U.S. states. A notable exception is California emission control, which has traditionally been more strict than that in other states. Common requirements for automobiles include structure (examples: hood) and safety equipment (examples: headlamps and bumpers)

- [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street-legal_vehicle)

It's really just lights, directionals, seatbelts. Stuff like that.

Which all adds weight, and every pound matters at this obscene level of performance. But overall, it's pretty easy to meet those requirements.


Edit; Found this link on Google: http://blogs.lawyers.com/2011/01/what-makes-a-car-street-legal/

Again, most of this stuff just adds weight. Sound restrictions probably vary by state, but I've honestly never heard of anyone getting ticketed for such a thing.

So it's really not too difficult to build an obscene car that you could still legally drive on the street. As I said, for this bleeding-edge performance of course every pound matters, but you could get very close to it without sacrificing these requirements. </TEXT>

What has MS done to improve their product by harvesting my data?

Google Suggested Search Queries are crazy accurate a lot of the time. Google Maps traffic updates are **awesome**. Notifications on my phone providing info about an upcoming flight is handy. Swype / Gboard is nice because you don't get the same physical feedback from an actual keyboard so texting is more error prone which they can work to correct.

What the fuck is MS doing with my data? I don't use Bing, or their maps platform. I don't use Skype, or OneDrive. I don't use Office on my home PC. I don't have an issue typing on a physical keyboard.

1) In December 2012, Warren was assigned a seat on the Senate Banking Committee, the committee that oversees the implementation of DoddFrank and other regulation of the banking industry.

2) In May 2013, Warren introduced the Bank on Student Loans Fairness Act, which would allow students to take out government education loans at the same rate that banks pay to borrow from the federal government, 0.75%

3) During the 2014 election cycle, Warren was a top Democratic fundraiser. Following the election, Warren was appointed to become the first-ever Strategic Adviser of the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee

4) July 2015 Senator Warren, along with John McCain (R-AZ), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), and Angus King (I-ME) re-introduced the 21st Century Glass-Steagall Act, a modern version of the Banking Act of 1933. The legislation is intended to reduce the risk for the American taxpayer in the financial system and decrease the likelihood of future financial crises.

5) December 2016, Warren gained a seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, termed by The Boston Globe to be "a high-profile perch on one of the chambers most powerful committees"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think those are all fair complaints.

I think from a mechanics / game stand point, it's superior to D3 in almost every way. But D3 does one thing better: production.

Everything **sounds** good in D3. Even early skills have a nice, bassy rumble to them. Things just "feel" powerful. Input is very smooth.

It's been a long standing complaint that melee is a little wonky in PoE. Combined with the fact that most of their income goes towards development of features rather than things like audio, visual, cinematics or voice overs -- it is easy to lose interest. Especially if you're playing alone.

And by playing alone, I mean without separate voice chat and friends. I actually enjoy the game less in a party with randoms.  </TEXT>

But PoE 3.0 will contain 10 Acts that you play through once.

I'm not hardcore into the game so maybe GGG has detailed things better, but I **think** the time to reach end game will probably still be the same, it's just that no longer need to slog through the same game three times over per character. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> (**Edit:** Yea you guys must be right about it having been the Oculus Rift -- but I wouldn't buy an OR anyways)

I got to play this game "Cranga" - it's just Giant Jenga - for like 10 minutes at PAX East this weekend. It was very simple but I was absolutely blown away by the experience. It completely surpassed my expectations in terms of:

* The headset was very comfortable and lightweight.
* I had no issues with the refresh rate of the displays or anything visually.
* The tracking for the hands felt perfect.

I'm not sure what VR headset I was using. The controllers didn't look like the Vive's, but I just googled [Playstation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/explore/playstation-vr/?emcid=pa-pe-97928) and the headset didn't look like that. Also, I think I saw two little cameras on stands that I assume we're to help with tracking my physical movements, but I don't think the Vive has anything like that, does it?

Unfortunately it was so busy at PAX I didn't really have time to investigate, and English was the developer's second language so I was having a tough time understanding him when I tried to ask a few questions.

1) I thought I read on this sub that people who have had LASIK eye surgery have had issues with VR. I didn't notice any problems but I wasn't playing a "serious" game, nor did I play very long. So for those here had who have had LASIK, how has VR been for you?

2) Would this year be a good year to buy a Vive? My parents asked if I wanted one for Christmas after telling them about it, but I was wondering if a completely Wireless version was in the near future.

3) Accessories! 

- Is the "Link Box" actually as important as its [product description](https://www.vive.com/us/accessory/link-box/) makes it sound?

- What is the nose rest? I'm guessing it goes over the lower half of your face and helps disperse weight that would mainly be supported by your nose?

4) Finally, how often do you guys use yours / what do you use it for? I imagine I'd like to use it for watching videos, light gaming, and I periodically tinker around with game development (Unity, mostly). </TEXT>

This is a concern regardless of the weather. You can be the best, safest driver in the world and still have some jerkoff crash into you.

I live in a state which got ~7 feet of snow from a single storm a few years ago. Admittedly, that was a rather extreme case, but the point is we're certainly no strangers to snowfall.

There are zero laws relating to tires or anything like that. Almost everyone I know follows the, "I've got AWD I'm fine even though I'm driving on OEM All Seasons. No I don't know how many miles are on them, why do you ask?" ideology.

Most people just drive slow as absolute balls. Which is OK, but at the same time it's often super unnecessary just *how* slow they take it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... but in its current form, what you get is simply a Diablo-type game with streamlined loot - you get items that enhance your builds in very specific ways, rather than being given items that are nothing more than bundle of random stats like in most other action RPG games.

Blizzard has done a better job of creating interesting Legendary Effects that make the gear more impactful for Builds, but it wasn't always that way. Vanilla gear was terrible, and even early RoS it was mediocre at best.

One of my issues is is that it's impossible to gear up an Alt like this, because everything you find will suck for that other character unless they use the same stat.

Now OK, I know you can get to level cap **extremely** easily so ultimately that doesn't matter, but I still don't like it. As you said, "within the context of the game it works" but that's what I'm saying: I dislike and disagree with the core fundamentals of D3.

Because some of those Legendaries are so powerful, you don't want to give up their special abilities shoehorning you into keeping it until it drops again but better.

 The issue you're talking about in regards to getting the same items with better rolls only comes up when you still want to keep playing after investing a lot of time on a specific character, which is honestly something you couldn't even do in other Diablo games since the difficulty stopped at Hell.

If by "other Diablo games" you're specifically referring to D1 and D2, sure. But again we're comparing a series that started in 1996 with the most recent base game coming out **16** years later. 12 years after D2, which is really considered to have defined the genre. In that case, I don't think it's fair to flatly compare games that came out more than a decade apart from each other. Gaming and game design has changed significantly in that much time.

But in D2 specifically, I'd disagree. Between runewords, crafting, and trading it wasn't as simple as "I hope this Random Mob in this Rift / this Rift Boss drops a better version of what I already have"

If by "other Diablo games", you mean other "Diablo-like games", I can't comment much here as I never played many "Diablo clones" other than Torchlight and PoE. Naturally all of these types of games will eventually boil down to "The only upgrades I can get are better-rolled versions of what I have", but I think D3 hits this wall very quickly. Certainly more quickly than PoE. I never got very far in Torchlight or Titan Quest to comment on those. Didn't play Grim Dawn or a lot of the others.

Then of course you have all the various difficulty levels, the set dungeon challenges and the upcoming rift challenges which are designed to keep you busy after having played hundreds of hours. And seeing as how the game didn't originally have 13 levels of Torment difficulty, I'm pretty sure Blizzard didn't expect people to want to play the game for that long. 

Given that D2 still has a healthy population, I don't know why Blizzard would think this. I don't have the game installed to check bnet but last I knew when you log in it tells you how many active players there are. But a quick Google search shows threads on various forums from 2016 discussing playing the game, so I'd wager it is still active. I'll admit the Set Dungeons we kind of cool but I don't know much about the Rift Challenges.

 Basically, the reason why they're about to release a new Ancient version of the legendaries we already have is because people are still interested in playing the game even to this day, which sort of proves that the game isn't in fact broken since nobody in their right mind would play a broken game for that long.

OK? If people enjoy the game, great. Good for them. Let them enjoy it. They can disagree with me, and I can disagree with them. That doesn't mean either person is right or wrong, it just means that D3 isn't the game I wanted it to be. And given that a game by Blizzard, one of the most successful studios in all of gaming, has a whopping ~50 total upvotes on this sub shows that a lot of people also agree that it's not the game they wanted. Again, neither is right or wrong, it's just not what *I* hoped it would be.

Furthermore, that doesn't change the fact that Ancients++ are just plain **lazy**. I think even those who enjoy D3 in its current state would agree.

With that being said, little clarification: you can trade with other players in your games, and you are not guaranteed to get your class's main stats on your items either. 

Sure, but trading is more like "Well I don't want/need it so here you can have this". It's nothing like what trading was in D2. And don't get me wrong: trading in D2 is far from great. Trading in Path of Exile, which is very similar to D2, is widely agreed upon to be the worst part of the game.

And the chances of it not rolling your stat is GREATLY less likely than it is to roll yours. So, OK, definitively you're not **guaranteed**, but it's a miniscule chance that it may as well be.


At the end of the day, I just see all these new and interesting content patches PoE releases multiple times per year, I can't help but shake my head when Blizzard announces "Same Gear, Better Stats".  </TEXT>

It's a double edged sword for sure.

Either they get all the benefits and people are attracted to the positions due to self interest... Or you cut pay and benefits and make it more difficult for those to do the job, as you say.

It's kind of like teaching, at least in the US. The salary is so bad that the only people who get into the field really want to be there.

Though unfortunately that certainly doesn't guarantee they'll be good at it.

	<TEXT> Almost as if D2 was from a completely different era of gaming, one might think.

My issue isn't the lack of content. It's that D3 is **fundamentally** a broken game.

Online-only for absolutely no reason, given you can't trade with other players. The game is a giant Loot Pinata, with loot guaranteed to roll your class main stat, which is a standard formula for the damage for Everything. Set Items which make specific combinations of skills distinctly better than coning up with a build on your own -- at least until you start getting Ancient items. Or Super Ancient items or whatever the fuck they're called. In either case, it's loot you've already seen before just with higher stat rolls.

Wow. Such excite. Much creativity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even that's just lipstick on a pig, IMO.

Game hands you loot. No trading. Gear automatically rolls the stats your class needs. And I loathe the "All damage is based off your weapon + main stat" formula. Challenges hand your a free Set for the "Blizzard Build of the Month".

It's just a fundamentally un-interesting game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A paid expansion

They're not even calling it an expansion themselves:

 **Is the Necromancer part of an expansion pack?**

 No, the Necromancer is part of a content pack which includes the class, an in-game pet, cosmetic wings, two additional character slots, two additional stash tabs (on PC), a portrait frame, pennant, banner, and a banner sigil.

 It will, however, launch alongside a free major content patch that includes two new zones, Challenge Rifts, and more. These additional features will be available for all players with Diablo III: Reaper of Souls or the Ultimate Evil Edition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BRZ? It doesn't have a removable top, but it's a lightweight drivers car and can be fully optioned for under $30.

370Z roadster starts at high 30's. Not particularly lightweight, but almost 3x the power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure; but not at this new price point.

Like I get it, light weight minimalistic driver's car. It has it's niche, and it's clearly successful in it.

But **damn** that's a lot of money. </TEXT>

$35 per pair of underwear, $15 for a 5 pack on Amazon -- that's **$160** in profit and you didn't even have to do anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll agree think I think it's unnecessary to require teens to read Shakespeare and write multi-page papers on them.

But I think regardless of your career, history / world knowledge is important.

Maybe knowing something from Indian history could be beneficial so you don't say something offensive in front of a coworker.

Or understanding the conflicts between Israel and Palestine, since it's always a hot topic in politics. Or why North Korea and South Korea don't get along so well, given that SK is a major ally of ours. Or the Presidents from the past 100 years and how their policies have impacted the world today so when a modern Presidential candidate references policies from a previous President you'll understand what it did.

Everything that happens in the world is out of response to something that has already happened, and I don't think it's a good idea to simply remove it from the curriculum. </TEXT>
