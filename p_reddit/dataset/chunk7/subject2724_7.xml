	<TEXT> It's not unfair, it's just inaccurate. My primary concern is with how the process has lead to terrible RESULTS. Many experts here have elaborated on those results, I suggest reading their comments, and also reading the text of the TPP yourself, there's an annotatable version here: https://www.readthetpp.com/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Re-pasting this from below to save myself from carpal tunnel. All of the experts here have been posting tons of specifics about what is in the actual text. You zeroing in on my very real concern about how the non-transparent process is what LEAD to these very specific problems as if that invalidates our real concerns just... makes no sense.

1) The TPP would export the worst parts of the U.S.'s broken copyright system to other countries, without expanding protections for free speech/fair use. This will lead to even more legitimate content being censored and taken down from the Internet, and have a chilling effect on innovation, creativity, and free speech. More from EFF here: http://eff.org/issues/tpp
2) The TPP's section on Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) would grant corporations extraordinary powers to sue governments in tribunals in front of a panel of three corporate lawyers, many of whom rotate between "judging" these cases and being the ones doing the suing, in order to strike down democratically passed laws that might harm a company's "expected future profits." This shocking system essentially gives multinational corporations an end-run around our democratic process, allowing them to undermine or strike down basic protections for environmental standards, workers rights, public health, etc. More from Public Citizen: http://www.citizen.org/documents/ustr-isds-response.pdf
3) The TPP would grant pharmaceutical corporations new monopoly rights to prevent them from having to compete with more affordable generic medicines, raising the cost of medicine for everyone, and disproportionately impacting people in poorer countries. More from Doctors without Borders: http://www.msfaccess.org/spotlight-on/trans-pacific-partnership-agreement
I'll let others chime in with more here -- but you can easily research all of this stuff. Our issues are not with just the process, but the fact that the process inevitably leads to these types of abuses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a good question. The reality is that the TPP would not help those Vietnamese kids either. These types of agreements lead to a "race to the bottom" and make it so that governments have no incentive to improve working standards in their countries. Companies will always just send jobs to wherever it's cheapest for them, and then cut and run as soon as they find someplace better for their profits. The history of these deals clearly shows that they don't improve standards anywhere in the longterm -- they just shuffle the oppression around a bit in the short term but don't improve anyone's situation in the end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a professional musician for 10 years before coming to Fight for the Future, and I supported my family (including a small kid) doing it. There is definitely an important debate to be had about what the right way is to make the Internet work for all creators. In fact, it may be the most important conversation / question of our generation impacting the future of creativity and freedom of expression. That's exactly why the TPP is an absolutely terrible place for policy impacting intellectual property to happen. We need to have an open conversation about this that includes artists, Internet users, and creators of all kinds. Right now our copyright system is extremely unbalanced and privileges the rights of large corporations over supporting individual artists and creators, and it's frequently abused to censor and take down legitimate content from the Internet, which has a profound effect on free expression and our ability to share, create, and learn on the internet. The TPP would lock us into that broken system and export it to other countries, at a time when we should be figuring out how to fix it and make it work for all creators, not just giant corporate ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this is a classic case of the huge influence that corporations already have over our politics. Big companies have the ear of government officials and convince them that giving them these special handouts will lead to more jobs, more economic prosperity, all the stuff that people (and voters) like. But those promises never come true. The TPP would give corporations EVEN MORE power over our government. That's the last thing we need. </TEXT>

I think one of the goals of this tour is to reach people who otherwise would not read an email or newspaper article about TPP but will come out to see their favorite band play a fun show, and then can hear speakers who will be sharing information in a really easy to understand and accessible way. Maybe not all of them will walk away and get involved in the fight, but a bunch will, and that's a huge boost to our movement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great question -- I love talking about organizing and how it works. So beyond the online promotion, we have a coalition on the ground in every city spreading the word through all kinds of channels from putting up posters to making announcements at activist meetings and other concerts. We have unions putting up flyers in their work places, and people phone banking to spread the word. This is a totally grassroots effort and it's amazing to see so many different people and groups coming together to make it happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. I actually have a six year old, and this is how I explained it to her: The TPP is global deal that was worked out in secret. So basically a bunch of corporate lobbyists and government officials sat in secret meetings, where no one could see what they were doing, and wrote rules that are going to affect all of us, without our input. The rules affect everything from jobs and wages to what we can do on the Internet to environmental standards to how much medicine costs. They wrote all the rules in secret and now they've released them, but before they can go into effect and become law, Congress has to approve it. The goal of the Rock Against the TPP tour is to raise awareness so that enough people know what's happening to make sure that Congress never does that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think we should ever just trust any politicians to do the right thing. The reality is that there are so many forces at play: lobbying dollars, campaign contributions, etc. We always need to pay attention and push hard with grassroots pressure to hold our elected officials accountable. Corporate lobbyists keep their staffers on speed-dial, we need to make sure they know that we're paying just as close attention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The TPP is backed by the Obama administration, the Chamber of Commerce, Google, Facebook, the banking industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and basically every large corporation in the world. It's definitely controversial, and there's been a lot of talk in Congress that makes it seem like it's on the ropes -- that's good news. it means we have a CHANCE of defeating it. But if no one speaks out, this thing will almost definitely become law. That's why we're organizing Rock Against the TPP: we need to do more than just petitions and phone calls, we need to make this deal 100% politically toxic, and make sure they can't ram it through during the lame duck session this Fall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the TPP is a perfect example of how the traditional Left/Right divide in politics is kind of failing us. It's pretty awesome to see people from across the political spectrum coming out of the woodwork to oppose the TPP. The artists we have on the tour come from a variety of perspectives, they don't all agree on everything, but they all agree that the TPP is a disaster for our democracy. That's the bottom line here: we need to stop the TPP but we also need to do away with the corrupt thinking that brought it to us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great question. "Free trade" definitely sounds like a great idea. But the reality is that these types of non-transparent trade agreements are anything but free trade. Instead, they allow the largest, incumbent corporations to essentially buy a seat at the table and then set policy that benefits them while undermining the ability of smaller businesses, new startups, and innovative new services to compete. So it's not free trade at all, it's actually an extreme form of government-corporate regulation that runs counter to the concepts of a free market  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are so many reasons to choose from, but for me the #1 problem is that the completely non-transparent process surrounding these types of "trade" deals make them a perfect venue for corporations to push for policies that they know they could never get passed if they did them out in the open through traditional legislative means. The extreme secrecy surrounding the negotiations, and the fact that hundreds of corporate advisors get to sit in closed-door meetings with government officials while the public, journalists, and experts are locked out inevitably results in a deal that is super unbalanced and favors the rights of giant corporations over the rights of average people, small businesses, start-ups, etc. So, while there's a laundry list of problems with the TPP text itself, from the ways that it would enable more online censorship to the serious issues surrounding job loss and medicine access, for me the biggest issue is with the whole process itself: this is just an unacceptable way to be making policy in the modern age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think this definitely happens a lot. In my personal experience I've also been misgendered a lot by journalists who were not doing it intentionally, and who were super apologetic when I brought it to their attention. They just made assumptions based on my name or my voice on the phone. The good thing is the problem is super easy to fix, if news organizations institute the policy the petition is calling for, and just confirm source's pronouns the same way they'd confirm the spelling of your name or your job title. That won't stop malicious outlets from misgendering people on purpose, but it will stop a huge amount of unintentional misgendering from journalists who are just not educated enough on trans issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, Chelsea is a woman, so please refer to her as "she." Second of all, the idea that people are only sent to solitary confinement for being violent is patently false. Even the Obama administration recently called for states to curtail the over-use of solitary confinement. The use of solitary confinement to arbitrarily punish LGBTQ prisoners is well documented. 

Finally, even the U.S. government agrees that transgender prisoners should receive healthcare related to their gender transitions, because DOCTORS agree that these treatments are not elective but in fact medically and psychologically necessary. The fact that you seem gleeful that people are dying in prison from other forms of neglect doesn't diminish this point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclosure: I work with Fight for the Future, a group that supports Chelsea, and I talk to her on the phone roughly once a week.

Chelsea is not currently in solitary confinement. This piece is reflecting on her experiences earlier on in her incarceration. She's currently held in the Military Correctional Facility in Ft Leavenworth, KS. She does not feel in physical danger from other prisoners -- although the U.S. government continues to deny her basic healthcare related to her gender transition, and refuses to allow her to grow her hair past the Military's designated "male," length. 

Many many trans people are placed in solitary confinement as a form of punishment, although it is almost always framed as if it is "for their own protection." What Chelsea's article highlights is that solitary is a form of torture -- so it's not a humane alternative to general population for transgender prisoners, it's often even worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there, Evan here from Fight for the Future. We launched the petition that's linked above. We're fans of coinbase and we've worked with you all previously on Bitcoin Black Friday, if you recall. I'm a bit surprised to learn that you've never heard of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. It's one of the highest profile political fights of the year, and has serious implications for startups, Internet freedom, privacy, free speech, etc. We'd love to chat with you about it and share some information! I also agree with the others here that, if Coinbase doesn't share the Internet Association's position on the TPP, it would be really helpful for you to clarify that, like reddit did, either in a blog post, on twitter, or in some other public manner. Feel free to reach out to me directly if you'd like to chat: evan@fightforthefuture.org </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically the way it works now, the government can get what's called an Administrative Subpoena, which is way easier to get than a warrant and doesn't require probable cause, and use that to force a company (like Google or... reddit) to hand over emails or other data that are either "unopened" or "abandoned" ie being left on a server, for more than 180 days. If this bill passes the Senate, companies would no longer have to comply with administrative subpoenas for content in most cases, instead the government would have to get a actual warrant to get your emails, even ones that are 180 days old. That said, there are still a ton of other ways that the government can (and does) spy on your email, texts, location, and other data, especially if you are not a U.S. citizen, or communicate with anyone who is not a U.S. citizen. So, this bill is a good thing, a step in the right direction, but we still have a long way to go to restore our basic constitutional (and human) right to privacy. </TEXT>
