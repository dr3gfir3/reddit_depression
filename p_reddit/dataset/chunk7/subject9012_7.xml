	<TEXT> From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_from_a_Rose)

"Kiss from a Rose" is a song from Seal's second eponymous album. The song was first released as a single in July 1994. Re-released in 1995, it was included on the Batman Forever film soundtrack, helping it top the charts in the U.S. and Australia. At the 1996 Grammy Awards, it won awards for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.[1]

Apparently, not original music for the soundtrack but being re released on the OST for Batman Forever gave it its fame. </TEXT>
