	<TEXT> Can you comment on whether SS works better in SPMC than Kodi? I run Kodi on an Android box and SPMC on a tablet. Maybe it's my imagination but it seems to work better at times on SPMC.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's dangerous to lump a whole workforce into one category. Can some jobs be automated? Maybe. But saying a majority can be is a bit of a stretch. Many different jobs compose the ON govt.

Edit: P.S. I admire the work that you do. I've been the author of some office docs and have enjoyed it, but obviously no where near the level you work at. </TEXT>
