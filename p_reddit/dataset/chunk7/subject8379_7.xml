	<TITLE> Are SRECs taxable income? My CPA wants to know. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-03 20:35:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after a full year of production now, my household has minted our SRECs and in 2016 we were paid for 5 of them (with 6 more in the hopper that will pay out over 2017).

I am struggling to explain the difference between the utility credits (which are one path, but don't generate income per se) and the SRECs that are like green coupons issues for contributing to green energy production--that we get paid to do. We get checks for this.

So, 3-ish questions.

1. Are SRECs taxable income, federal level or state level (MA in my case).

2. Does IRS for 8835 give any credits to residential solar production (I have no idea what this is, but CPA was looking for info: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8835.pdf )?

3. If we pay income on SRECs, can we depreciate the cost of the installation over some years (and what number of years)?

Any guidance on any of this would be helpful. It's worth doing right this year as this will also play out over the next few years too, so we want to wrangle it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an interesting thought. I've already had a couple of arguments with people about signs. I think attempts to micro-manage what people want to say are stupid. But if people choose to use a "tested" slogan, I have no issues with that.

Not all signs are aimed at everyone, though. Some things are done for the base. I don't have any problem with that either. I loved the slide-rule sign in Boston. But I know it made other people uncomfortable. For me it was: here are my people....

Anyway--I shall ask for #scicomm approved slogans from the scicomm pros. I'll report back on what I get.  </TEXT>

I'm writing this down because I'm going to look for it the next time I have to get a new phone.

1. Go to the Bluetooth screen with the left side radio keys. 
2. Click the Enter button on the lower right knob.
3. Click the Bluetooth item there.
4. In the next screen there will be choices to delete old phones and add new ones. Here's where it makes sense again. I had to delete the old phone.
5. Now I entered the new phone by clicking on that. It does a pairing handshake thing with a unique number. 
6. It's now set up to use the phone's google maps as my directional service (I don't have the NissanConnect maps). Audio comes out of my car speaker.

Worked fine in testing it on the way home today.  </TEXT>

I attended many sessions at AAAS this past week on fake news. It turns out that it doesn't really have broad support, it's a tiny number of users that disproportionately push the nonsense. And then it's read by people only to reinforce their existing perspectives--like those in r/conspiracy. 

But this is a question of the wider world, where we can stop the flow of Mikey's sewage into naive readers with Google. I think that's an experiment that is worth trying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my comment, in case the Guardian removes it:

It's unfortunate that Roger has missed the parts about scientists running for office, and expressing interest in that in large numbers with the 314 project.

And these #WhinyAcademic pieces about how the march won't solve everything get on my last nerve. Nobody says it will. But it's engaging a community and aligning it that will have downstream benefits. Alreadly local groups are forming with new alliances. And these folks will have the best damn science mailing list (or facebook friends, whatever the kids use today) for the next 4 years.

I attended the delightful #RallyForScience in Boston the other day. Most of the people I talked to were *not* scientists, but supportive neighbors from other realms. And I also tracked the media coverage of it. It was YUUUGE. YUUUUGE. So a small 2-hour gig in one city was seen by many others, inside and outside the US. Noise has impacts that are not just aimed at legislators. Awareness of these issues is now raised by many readers and viewers of many news outlets.

Stop whining about this. And nobody says marching precludes other activities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a tip that is useful for any issue. Somewhere in your state there is probably an organization that works on this issue. Might be an enviro group, in this case, but same is true on all political topics. 

They will help you with stuff like this. They *live* to help you with stuff like this. They often have talking points they can give you, they may help you write letters to the editor, they may connect you with a local politician who is open to the issue. They know these things, it's their job. And they love to have a citizen come up and ask for their help. 

If you can't find a suitable state one, a national one might help. And they may point you to a local one that isn't widely known. 

I had never looked on this topic, but there's this outfit: http://www.electricauto.org/

They link in their homepage to a Sierra Club item. So I'd go to a local Sierra Club and ask them for help. 

If anyone has other suggestions about helpful organizations, I would be interested in more of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a couple of decades now, I've watched politics and personal feelings drive us to bad decisions that will have repercussions for the future. I've watched stem cell research get hamstrung, I've seen vaccine-preventable disease recur, I've watched climate policies die in a constipated Congress, I've seen people try to affect family formation and reproductive choices due to religious fictions, and I've watched people stop plant science progress based on crankery. I've had it.

I've wanted to have a team of allies to call on--to write to their congresscritters, to make calls, to talk to the media, to show up at events, to talk to their communities. And some people have been doing these things. But not enough of us, and not consistently enough. This is the first time there has been any alignment at all, really.

I hope that this march does 3 things: 1) makes legislators realize that there are folks who care about evidence-based policy and that it's a good way to make decisions; 2) galvanizes a team of folks who will continue to network and to act in the future; and 3) show the public that there are many of us, and generate new conversations with people who vote.

Occupation: entrepreneur in the genomics software arena. PhD in molecular/cell/developmental biology.

March: DC, but hope to align with the local Boston folks for ongoing efforts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love data, and the whole Resistat/SomerStat system. I think it was very wise to use data (before data was hot) to evaluate the best use of resources in the city. It's trackable. It's defensible. It's pretty transparent. Few cities have that level of access to the innards of the city functions that way.

I've never lived anywhere with more access to the city folks for discussion--not just showing up in their office when you need something. But at the Resistat meetings, at other city events like all the festivals we have, 311 system, etc. 

I know people hate parking tickets. I know there is dispute about how Union Square went. But overall, I am pleased with the city functions and directions. I know we still have unmet needs--affordable housing, for example. 

I have mixed feelings about Assembly. I find it kind of sterile compared to our charming old Squares. But it brought jobs, tax revenue, and transit-oriented development, as promised. 

In times of politicians weaseling about most things, I appreciate the strong stand on Sanctuary City status. And--I'll add--the data shows we are right, not the Trumpets. 

Of course, it takes more than the Mayor. I like the Alderfolk too, mostly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Posted my comment over there, but I keep getting errors:

It's fine to look at all these different levels, and I see the value in that. But you can also look at the individual level for an even more detailed analysis. 

We know from surveys that many people with EVs have solar on their homes (at least in the US). In fact, this was my process as well: I installed more capacity than I needed with the plan to purchase an EV subsequently. And that's what I did. Also, I charge it only during sunny days. Because I can. 

EV owners don't buy these cars on a whim.  You have to understand the range issues, and in my experience owners are very conscious of their environmental impact. If they can't have solar on their own homes, many pay to have green energy support for their homes. The program I bought my car from, "Mass Energy Drive Green" even offers wind sourcing as part of their efforts. Many owners plan to charge at workplace charging stations during the day, when presumably more solar is online. 

So of the broader-brush higher-level evaluations have led to misunderstandings and misinformation about how low emission these vehicles can be. I think there's more to be considered.  </TEXT>

But all of their work is crap and based on bad feed--which we discovered when they published their evidence of corn fungus in their other recent paper.

	<TEXT> One of my favorite films, *A Man for All Seasons*, has Thomas More attempting to keep himself alive by using the protection of the law, which might have worked in normal times. It's where I learned the phrase "Qui tacet consentiret". It was a valid strategy. For a while.

However, some times are not normal. His time was not. When it was clear that his silence wouldn't save him, he let his real thoughts become known at his trial. The film uses actual transcripts of his trial. By that time he's very weak and frail. But he says his peace. Soon after, he is beheaded.

Sometimes I've thought about what else he could have done. Could earlier intervention on the King's plans have stopped that train? Who knows. Maybe not. 

But try some alt-history on that. What if he had stood, loudly, earlier. What if he had rallied others to his side with better ideas and moving rhetoric? Could things have gone differently? Maybe. Maybe not.

Now is not normal. But this is where I stand: "staying silent is to be complicit in perpetrating injustice". You can choose right now which path. You can make noise, which we have seen appears to have had some early impact. 

Maybe your silence is working for you now. Maybe you can get through this by keeping your head down. Maybe you can tell others to sit down and shut up and that will keep you safe, right? 

You may not have a choice later. Good luck living with your choice.  </TEXT>

You cannot force people to look at them. 

What you can do is force them to see a large DC protest on Fox news and their facebook feeds and in their towns on local news. 

The least helpful thing to do right now is shit on enthusiastic young and diverse scientists who are trying to build a movement. Especially if you are secure white guy who has a job in science who doesn't want to rock the boat. </TEXT>

I've seen government officials attempt to prevent in vitro fertilization because the gays used it. 

I've seen vaccine-preventable diseases return because scientists didn't get out of the labs to impress upon the public how important science-based policy is.

I've seen incredible nonsense from anti-GMO folks who go to Washington and are paid to lie about the health concerns.

I'm watching this administration install a woman who wants to used taxpayer dollars for religious schools that teach creationism.

Edit to add: I'm watching this administration muck up work in science labs right now with half-baked immigration policies that are discriminatory.
