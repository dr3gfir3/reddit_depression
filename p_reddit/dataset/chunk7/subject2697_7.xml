	<TEXT> Morally, sure. But legally, Dredd Scott makes sense. Court doesn't have the power to alter the Constitution. That's why Dredd Scott makes sense. Plessy or Korematsu are both better examples of the failure of stare decisis. But Plessy is no longer good law and Korematsu, while it technically is, would not hold up as precedent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dredd Scott was overturned by the President and Congress (to an extent) abolishing slavery. It's never been formally overturned.  

For that matter, Citizens United, but it's law. You can implement real change to shit decisions using the Court. Anyway it happens. Swift v. Tyson overruled by Erie is probably the best example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Ben, 

Have you listened to any of the Chapo Trap House podcast reading series? Specifically, have you heard them review your book, True Allegiance? If so, how would you best characterize the accuracy of their review? Specifically, do you think they understood what you were going for, your broader themes, and your general world views? 

On the topic of valor, do you think that the team at Chapo Trap House demonstrated true valor by heroically making it through your book?

Regarding your writing, can you comment on any creative writing courses you've taken and if you have, your grades and the general attitude of your professors towards your writing? 

Regarding the characters in the book, were any based on real people, and if so, which character was based on which person? 

Finally, asking on behalf of a friend, do you think there's a difference between Jews/Judaism and Israel/Zionism? 

Thank you for your time.  

Edit: Oh and one last question, are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that's not even close to true. I'm from AK. This is glacial sediment, including a lot of iron, flowing out of Copper River or other glacial river into the Gulf. The line you see is near where the two meet, and it's only temporary. The waters eventually mix, as water does. 

I mean, seriously people, there's only one ocean in the vicinity. The Arctic is way further north.

From movies, probably John Doe from Se7en or the unknown/unconfirmed antagonist/serial killer in Zodiac. They're just so unsettling. On a similar note, Lou Bloom from Nightcrawler. He's just inherently evil and corrupt, even corrupting those around him, but sees himself as a righteous or necessary force.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those who are both curious and lazy:

Egyptian authorities have hailed an "important discovery" after archaeologists unearthed several mummies, 10 colourful wooden sarcophagi and more than 1,000 funerary statues in a 3,500-year-old tomb near the city of Luxor.

The 18th Dynasty tomb, discovered in the Draa Abul Nagaa necropolis near the famed Valley of the Kings, belonged to a nobleman named Userhat who worked as the city judge, Egypt's antiquities ministry said in a statement on Tuesday.

"There are 10 coffins and eight mummies. The excavation is ongoing," Mostafa Waziri, the head of the archeological mission, told the AFP news agency.

It's a very significant find.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PNA believes that, per Oslo, their authority applies inside the settlements. In fact, the entire purpose of the settlements is to have an Israeli foothold to establish authority in Palestinian land. Furthermore, the Israeli military has, in the past, employed martial law in Palestinian territories, most notably in Gaza in 2009, though there are other examples. Again, whose law was in control then? Palestinians have the legal authority they have through Oslo and the much more powerful Israeli government not imposing their authority. Their law is imposed because Israel allows it and not because of some inherent ability to self-govern. Not because of some right, but because this is the reality of the situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the perfect opportunity to bring up my favorite moment from Planet Earth. There's a scene where a crocodile attacks wildebeest, triggering a stampede. The stampede is shown in slow motion, all while David Attenborough narrates the chaos and power of the situation. Now, while this stampede is occurring, there's a zebra, also clearly panicking, running the other way. Attenborough never comments on this and the one off zebra, while the focus of the shot, is completely ignored. I found the scene in Japanese, but it's hilarious with the original, where there's a zebra perfectly in frame running the wrong way that is completely ignored for no discernable reason. It's tragic, beautiful, poetic even, but for the zebra, which makes it unintentionally hilarious. 

I call it random zebra: https://youtu.be/19UYHiVD40Y  </TEXT>

The network asked Trump to suggest the names of some people who would defend him. One of those whom he mentioned was Jeffrey Lord.

Trump and Lord had met a couple of years earlier, in 2013. Lord was living with his elderly mother in Harrisburg, Pa., writing unpublished thrillers and screenplays. A former White House associate director for political affairs in the Reagan administration, he also dabbled in radio and TV political commentary and had written a few pieces about Trump for the right-wing magazine The American Spectator, including one headlined Never Ignore Donald Trump. The Spectator asked Lord to introduce Trump at a dinner at a hotel in Washington. Soon after that, Trump called Lord and proposed that they fly to Washington together on his plane. Lord was excited, but he hesitated; who would take care of his mother? A cousin in Binghamton, N.Y., not wanting Lord to miss the opportunity, offered to cover his caretaking duties for the night. The logistics were complex: Lord drove to Washington, parked his car near the hotel and took the train up to New York to meet Trump. He would fly down to D.C. with Trump and then drive straight home to his mother in Harrisburg when the dinner was over. I went to Trump Tower and they took me right up, and he was in there in his office, Lord says. We just hit it off. He took me up to the penthouse while he went to change his shirt.

**Lord made his CNN debut in July 2015. Two weeks later, CNN offered him a job as the networks first pro-Trump contributor. (CNN said it was already considering Lord and that Trumps suggestion had no effect on their decision to hire him.)** Today, he is one of 12 Trump partisans on CNNs payroll and perhaps the networks most reliable, if mild-mannered, provocateur; he recently defended Trumps tweet that Obama had orchestrated a Nixon/Watergate wiretapping plot against him, saying that the president was just speaking Americanese. The network sends a black town car four days a week to ferry him to Manhattan from Harrisburg and back, a three-hour drive each way. Lord has long since become a celebrity in Harrisburg  he was profiled on the front-page of the local newspaper  and now is recognized pretty much wherever he goes. The only CNN show he prefers not to do is Don Lemons, because it gets him back to his mother, who is now 97, too late. I dont get home until 1 in the morning; that gets a little difficult for Mom, he told me.

To say this is excessive is not a stretch. I hope to fuck he isn't doing this because people thought the cruise missiles firing looked cool.  

Edit: For context, the first atom bomb was equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talked to a pilot I know that works for an airline OGC. There's a couple conventions that apparently apply that go beyond the CoC and govern more broadly this entire situation. I could find them, but at this point, I don't want to become versed in airline law to figure out hypotheticals. Additionally there's a couple industry standard definitions for boarding, as you say. So it'll most likely, if it goes to a judge, be a question as to what definition governs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We can officially say that some elephants may be smarter and more self aware than the average human 2 year old. 

The new test, which was described asdeceptively simple,involved picking up a stick and handing it to a researcher.

But sometimes the stick was tied to a maton which the elephant had to stand to reach it.

This meant they had to realise their own body was preventing them from passing on the stick and get off the matin order to complete the task.

The scientists behind the study said animals capable of this kind of behaviour may also be better at empathising and be able to consider someone elses perspective.

.  .  . 

The elephants understood that their bodies were getting in the way, so they stepped aside to enable themselves to complete the task.

In a similar test, this is something that young children are unable to understand until they are about two years old.

This implies that elephants may be capable of recognising themselves as separate from objects or their environment.

This means that they may have a level of self-understanding, coupled with their passing of the mirror test, which is quite rare in the animal kingdom.

The test was an adapted version of one used on human children. In that test they are asked to push a trolley attached to a matt, which they normally stand on as they approach the trolley.

Only when they reach the age of about two do the humans realise they have to get off the matt in order for the trolley to move.
