	<TEXT> No, Trumps one time charge made his taxes forward at a rate of zero. Long after 2005.


Obviously he didn't release them in total or we could have seen where the income came from.  If he released recent returns we could have seen he lied about how much he gave vets. Eventually a complete tax form will be leaked.

The attempt was to defect from his Russian scandal, which we haven't forgotten. Nice try though. </TEXT>

I don't think I've ever seen people so terrified of their own shadow as Trump supporters. They truly are the scum of the Earth. To even think about separating parents and children at the border is deplorable and unacceptable to humanity.. Trump is nothing more than a spiteful prick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump's taxes would show the fortune he owes Russian banks. Trumps taxes would show how little he gave to vets. Trump's taxes would expose his boldface lies. That's why he won't release them.

If he wants to reach out release them. 

Even the worst businessman understands before putting a program into place you run a cost analysis.

His immigration policy is a disgrace, his own wife immigrated here and worked as a model illegally. I guess if you're beautiful and have big tits you get a pass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is unpatriotic, especially for someone who is President.  Someone who claims to represent all but doesn't contribute to the tax base.

Carried forwarded loses? I thought this guy was a wiz at business and a great deal-maker?  I'm OK with his not paying taxes as long a we can see those returns.

Those returns would give us insight into the 600 Million dollars he owes Russian banks. </TEXT>
