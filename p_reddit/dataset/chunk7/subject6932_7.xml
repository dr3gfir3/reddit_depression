The parents aren't making any questionable decision here. Dysphoria is a real thing and refusing to treat it is a terrible thing to do to a person, especially a kid. Plus, until 16 or so nothing is permanent. Puberty blockers are completely reversible. Even hormone therapy is reversible if you really want it. Surgery is the only thing that's really hard to reverse but that won't happen for at least ten years, assuming it happens at all.

Trans people have existed forever. The fad here is hating trans people. It wasn't nearly as mainstream until recently.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, look who just learned what virtue signalling means. Virtue signalling only works if it gains you admiration among your peers. The virtue signaling option for these parents in a conservative church and conservative home-school group would have been to insist loudly that Avery is a boy, because that's what the people around them wanted to hear.

Look, this kid is their daughter, she was miserable before when she was living as a boy, because that's not her. Her parents don't gain anything by letting her be her other than a loving daughter, in fact they lose quite a lot for accepting her. They were cast out of their church, out of their schooling group, her father lost business, much of her family cut ties. I've been the kid of someone who loved to use me as some accessory to actually virtue signal; trust me this isn't that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is well-accepted truth. Being trans is not a mental illness. Trans people have brains that are physically like those of the sex of the gender they identify as.

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Gooren 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

This is the basis for dysphoria. Fortunately, transition is the treatment for that. We can alter the body to match the brain, or use puberty blockers to keep the body from getting any further from the brain. That greatly reduces *internal* strain, but unfortunately we are social creatures so being cast out, harassed, bullied, etc just for existing has an effect on you; we don't live in a vacuum.

As for the second part of your comment, the family isn't treating Avery as some kind of ideological fashion accessory, they're treating her like their kid. Forcing her to live as a boy would be detrimental to her health; she was miserable when she was living as a boy before, and there's simply no reason to force her to be miserable for her entire childhood when letter her grow her hair out and wear girl's clothes is all it takes to help her. If they wanted a fashion accessory, they wouldn't pick one that gets them death threats, one that gets them kicked out of their church, one that drives away their businesses's clients. They're parents doing the right thing for their kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it was just about states rights, the Fugitive Slave Act wouldn't have been a thing. If it was about states rights, the Confederate constitution wouldn't have prohibited its member states from banning slavery. Oh, but it was about the economy... built on the backs of slaves.

Look, I'm not saying that every Confederate soldier was a bastard who woke up every morning with a hard-on for the institution of slavery. By and large they were ordinary guys who had been told their homes were under attack, good men following orders and such. To them, the Confederate Flag a symbol of their home, of freedom, whatever it needed to be that's what it meant to them. But we know better now. 

And I'm not saying the Union were saints by any means. Sherman's March to the Sea, just torching whole towns, etc, those are all kinda fucked up. But that isn't the cause of the war; that happened in the middle of it not before it. And sure, there were plenty of racists up North as well, but they didn't go to war over that.

To the North it wasn't officially about slavery until about halfway through. To the South, though, the Civil War was *always* about slavery.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically the immigrants usually pay too, just with a fake SS number or an ITIN, unless they're getting paid under the table (which citizens do too), and even then it's normally property taxes so if they're paying to live somewhere they're paying for the school.

Plus, it's illegal for schools to discriminate against someone based on their country of origin or immigration status (as well as a bunch of other stuff but that's not relevant to this), so it's not something they ask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Health insurance for transgender employees of the state is still pending litigation. At the moment the state of Wisconsin explicitly prohibits coverage for any procedure related to transition, even though the same treatments are not banned when they're for another purpose. Genital mutilation, from what I gather, is not a medical treatment, however you may be thinking of vaginoplasty or phalloplasty, which is. Breast augmentation may be covered, it may not be; I don't know the employee health plans in that level of detail but it's not unheard of for health plans to cover it in certain cases (usually as a constructive sugery when a mastectomy was previously required).

The ACLU is representing the plaintiffs, you can read more on that [here](https://www.aclu.org/news/aclu-files-suit-wisconsin-over-denial-insurance-coverage-transgender-state-employees)

That, however, isn't the matter at hand here. This is simply UW-Madison officially putting out a statement of support for the rights of their transgender staff and students. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What sort of biology? The sort that says that trans people have brains physically different, reflecting structures seen in the brains of the sex of the gender they identify as? 

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Gooren 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

Because that biology recognizes that as real, and that the mismatch has serious implications, namely [dysphoria](https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria). Fortunately that biology also allowed us to work out that you can treat dysphoria, usually by altering the body to match the brain.

That sort of biology also recognizes that multiple factors determine sex and those factors do not always indicate the same thing, which comes from to all sorts of things like [XXY](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/klinefelter-syndrome), or [XY-AIS](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome), or [Swyer syndrome](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/swyer-syndrome) or mosaicism, none of which fit into a strict male/female dichotomy.

Is that the sort of biology you meant? Or did you mean the 6th-grade biology where everything is always either XX or XY and it's never any more complicated than that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Put it to you this way: you know that scene in the Matrix where Neo goes back in after seeing the real world for the first time? Remember how he's surprised that the plugs were gone and his hair was back? That's because his self-image, the way his brain saw himself, had hair and didn't have plugs in his neck.

(Switch, incidentally, was originally intended to be played by a woman inside the matrix and a man outside, which would have been a really nice detail, and actually really made sense since it turns out the Wachowskis are both trans. Now that I see it all in one place it makes sense that the matrix analogy is so useful because that's almost certainly what that scene was meant to explain in the first place.)

It's like that, but for your whole body. I assume based on your post history that you're a man (if not just flip the words so it makes sense). If you woke up every morning knowing that you're a man, but looking and sounding like a woman, and socializing as a woman, getting called by a woman's name, etc, that would wear on you. You know deep down that you're a man, but for whatever reason your body doesn't know and the people around you don't know and that eats away at you.

And it's not a typical matter of self-acceptance because you know and accept yourself, at least on some level, to be a man. There's no amount of therapy that can shake that, because it's hardwired in your brain. But your body refuses to cooperate, and so medicine intervenes. How extensive the treatment you need is varies from person to person, but on some level getting the body to conform to the brain is the answer, because that stops the brain from constantly being told that it's something it isn't and stops that erosion of self. </TEXT>

Verifiably false. Like I said before, the brain/body disconnect often leads to mental illness, but there's a physical difference in the brain, not just a mental one. 

people like you are normalizing it

People like me? What does that even mean? And what is there to normalize? Some people are trans, that's been a thing forever.

This mismatch is what causes dysphoria, but fortunately we're able to alter the body to match the brain, and that's the accepted treatment. How much alteration is required varies from person to person, but in Minton's case it required full reassignment surgery, part of which is the removal of the uterus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Men and women have slight physical differences in their brains, as well as more obvious physical differences between the rest of the body. Sometimes, for whatever reason, someone with a brain of one sex will wind up with a body of the other (I'm simplifying a bit).

[Zhou et al 1995](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7477289)

[Kruijver et al 2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10843193)

[Gooren 2006](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16870186)

[Rametti et al 2011](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20562024)

That mismatch between body and brain causes dysphoria, a state of depression or anxiety (in this case specifically regarding one's body). The treatment for this is to alter the body to match the brain (since going the other way isn't really possible). For some people it's more severe than for others and requires different levels of treatment.

Generally transition has four big steps:

1. Social transition. Basically where you adopt new pronouns and a new name and let people know. This isn't always first, sometimes it comes partway through transition.

2. Hormones. For some, this is enough. Even without surgery, hormones have a massive impact on your body.

3. Minor affirming surgeries. Basically these are cosmetic treatments like breast reduction/augmentation or facial surgery. Not everyone has this done, even if they go on to the next step.

4. Full reassignment surgery. This is where Minton is; he had genitals surgically constructed. Part of that process requires a hysterectomy and three months of recovery time.

Hopefully that's explained it. </TEXT>

World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH). The WPATH Standards of Care
have been recognized as the authoritative standards of care by leading medical organizations, the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, and federal courts.

14.. Under the WPATH standards, treatment for gender dysphoria may require medical steps
to affirm ones gender identity and help an individual transition from living as one gender to another.
This treatment, often referred to as transition-related care, may include hormone therapy, surgery
(sometimes called sex reassignment surgery or gender affirming surgery), and other medical services that align individuals bodies with their gender identities. The exact medical treatment varies
based on the individualized needs of the person.

dysphoria. This was the professional opinion of Mr. Mintons hysterectomy surgeon and two mental

	<TEXT>  they don't think that removing a uterus is a medically necessary way to treat gender dysphoria.

And that's completely wrong. The physicians involved determined that it was necessary, following well-accepted WPATH guidelines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The professionals that declared it necessary do not have admitting privileges or any association with that Catholic hospital

That's not true at all.

In Mr. Mintons case, hysterectomy was medically necessary care to treat his diagnosis of gender
dysphoria. This was the professional opinion of Mr. Mintons hysterectomy surgeon and two mental
health professionals who counseled Mr. Minton during his transition. 

19.. After consulting further with his primary care physician and obstetrician/ gynecologist,
Dr. Lindsey Dawson, Mr. Minton scheduled his hysterectomy with Dr. Dawson at MSJMC for August
30, 2016.

20.. Dr. Dawson has been practicing as a board-certified obstetrician/gynecologist for 11
years and has had admitting privileges at MSJMC since 2010. Dr. Dawson regularly performs about 1-2
hysterectomies per month at MSJMC.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far as I'm aware, puberty blockers don't have any significant impact on bone density other than just delaying it's development. 

Hormone therapy does impact bone density; testosterone brings it up, estrogen brings it down. 

Puberty blockers are super reversible; normally it's just a case of not taking them anymore and puberty will get going on its own. Occasionally it can take a little kickstart, but occasionally puberty can take a kickstart regardless of puberty blockers.

Hormone therapy is also generally reversible, but it takes much longer; after all it's basically the same process the other way. But as far as I know there isn't much information on that because it's not something that happens very often; by the time you start on hormone therapy you've cleared a lot of hurdles.  </TEXT>
