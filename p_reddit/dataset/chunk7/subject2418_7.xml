	<TEXT> To all who so far took a "let's wait and see" approach. I did not take that approach, and already this is going far worse than I even anticipated. I can only hope that the resistance to this unfettered capitalism will grow as a result.   
  
Folks, if you want to really fight the destruction of the earth, you must overcome one piece of programming that has been ingrained into all of us: the need to buy. All our American lives we have been told that to live, is to acquire more things. But we must enter an age of realization that even if all our electricity was reusable, and all our cars electric, we would still be doomed. That is because every single purchase we make taketh from the Earth. Every single cup of coffee you buy, computer, piece of furniture, car, etc. All of it is one notch, however small. So what to do? On a large scale, it's an impossible catch 22, stop buying and the economy collapses. Yes. But I can more about Earth than I do about jobs.   
  
If you really want to resist our own destruction, the simplest thing you can do is purchase used things. I myself can make an example: I have not bought any furniture in three years. New clothes in one year. The only thing I've really bought at all is used books and groceries (and beer). Every time you decide to buy, every single damn thing, is a part of what is happening to our earth. Please know this. And know that you are making decisions that affect this, and feed this billionaire bastards. *You* **are** in control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look why shouldn't we be friends we Russia? Putin seems like a really nice guy, he's so supportive of Don, so much so that he gave him an election. Don called him first thing in the morning to thank him and confirm he was very committed to that thing they talked about before. And what is good for Donald is good for all of us! Why should we question him now? He's the president! He's *our* leader. What has questioning authority, no matter who got them put in power, done for anyone! We need stability now not these silly lesbian parades! If we're going to rebuild America we all need to stop worrying about petty things and hit the ground running on day one! Just like Donald did! I can't believe anyone let this happen, but now that it has, let's fight freedom!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Know what's cool? Yesterday was my sister's birthday and we all were gathered at a lunch, and everyone single one of them started railing against Donald. One by one everyone cited various things that had happened, even that day-- they were clearly aware and taking note. I have always been an assiduous follower of news out of Washington, but never in my life have I heard any of them discussing these matters. Later on I caught my mom reading an article on her phone about how just because he is the president doesn't mean you have to support him. People are getting woke out there. I'm not saying Donald is a good thing, but sometimes evil can inspire good people more than good people can inspire good people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who has visited here for years, has accumulated 450,000 karma for posting thoughtful insights and information, current have 9 months of gold to spare- versus yourself, a 5 month old account with less that 2,000... I am not one of your "boys." So let me breakdown your bullshit, since this is really a case study here.   
  
1. CTR is back boys. -- what does that mean? do there seem to be a surge of people not buying your bullshit? people are starting to see Trump for what he really is? I realize that in your simple, reductive logic you perhaps legitimately do think anyone who hacks at Trump is somehow.. I guess.. paid to do it. If that mindset gives you solace, please, enjoy it. However, the last few days have had a string of information that should make even the most sycophantic wonder at what is going on. There is nothing wrong with questioning your beliefs, and there is everything cowardly with using base name calling as your weapon of choice.   
2. Keep your guard up and stay strong. -- This legitimately sounds like propaganda. 
3. Pizzagate will be exposed soon. -- I have not seen this story gain any information since the emails. There is no new leads, no new intel. I would say, if anything, "Pizzagate" is about to crumble under the weight of its own lack of story to propel itself. I would say give it a month and about 10% of the people who have been talking about pizzagate will be. However, please, let me know when your incredible bombshell drops and in the mean time be sure to completely ignore all the red flags of Trump dropping all around you.

	<TEXT> You totally editoralized this headline tho my friend. They didn't day the intel was fake or fake news. Appearently the only information here is that the officials didn't leave the 2 page paper copy of the summary of the allegations, but only briefed orally. You left this out of your "gems" information. The article itself says what buzzfeed said from go, that this is unverified information. NBC did not contradict Buzzfeed here, only I suppose officials who said they gave Trump team a brief. But way to hyper editorialize your headline so as to make it seem like the whole story is bunkiss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's so easy. Just go to the_Donald and look how they parrot his every single word, his every single train of thought, and furthermore, even ape his mannerisms and attitude. Some people are desperate to have a daddy to tell them what to believe and think, and who to hate. They completely ignored his millionfold foibles because it never even occurred to them to look in the goddamn mirror. And we are all fucked for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Article changed url:** It's [here now](http://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/07/us/russia-hacking-election-trump-voters.html) thanks /u/Publius_JR for pointing this out.  
  
My understanding of this is pretty simple. Who you vote for is a *huge* part of one's identity, and so to acknowledge the Russian's acts as true would undermine their identity. They would have to admit that their guy is Russia's guy. They would have to admit that they were in part duped by the Russian trick, and that they advanced Russia's goals and interest, however unknowingly.  
  
So to be sympathetic, they are boxed in: admitting this is real means admitting they voted for a counterfeit candidate, and therefore their identity as Americans takes a big hit. They can't let it be real, because then they are less real. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah so I did some investigating. [Dude was *on*](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Froman) the transition team. This was literally his job. It wasn't some shadow banker. It was fully public that his job was to pick people for the admin, along with 11 other people. So he did his job. Also has a long history of politics, including being in the Clinton White House. So tell why a transition manager should not... pick people for the transition? Please. Answer me directly: should a guy publicly in charge of picking people for the administration.. should he do his job? Yes or no.  
  
Funny that your article did not include that information, almost as if it wanted to make you think a certain thing without discernment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For instance, Obama's entire administration, diplomats, etc were picked over his head even before he was elected.   
  
Show me something that says that.  
   
Now Trump is getting flack for taking time AFTER actually being elected to personally assemble the same. I love that Trump is not giving pay-for-play-ambassadors any leeway.  
  
Yeah usually candidates have this all sorted out before hand so when it comes time to transition they can focus on other shit. Either Trump is an irresponsible moron or really didn't think he'd win. He's not being exemplary, he is being unprepared. He should have had his list months ago.

	<TEXT> I really wish we could know just how much of the general discussion this year was fomented, steered, and distracted, even here on old Reddit, by the [Russian Troll Army](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html). One of my own personal beliefs, which again I wish could be verified beyond my impression, is that the style of disagreement we have seen here by the "pedes" is to create fake news on the individual level, or never respond to the question at hand, but distract by making up information. Take for instance the "evidence" thing here. My simple response was, if this was untrue you'd see Republican senators, who had the evidence and never one to waste a chance to frame Obama as wrong, going to the media and twitter saying it was fake. Not one did, in fact the opposite. The response was always "but where's the evidence." When asked directly, specifically, a question, they never answer, even when you press. Dodge and distract.    
  
Now, I think that these master troll tactics were brought around places like Reddit by Russian. Because we saw the same sort of tactics deployed here during the Ukraine Crisis, which preceded the election. What I find most interesting, is that because noting its effectiveness (nothing ever has to be answered for, and the method of distract and dodge can go on into perpetuity) the American "pedes" took up the same style and tactic, essentially and unwittingly becoming a proxy internet army to the Russian operation. </TEXT>

Hillary wrote none of them. She didn't write the Podesta ones either. However everyone acts like Hillary personally sicked her dogs on Bernie, when rather it was that lifelong democrats felt a bit hijacked   upended by Bernie. Imagine your sister marrying a guy, then a month later he is trying to tell your entire family how to run the family. It was unfortunate that the source material for the DNC   Podesta was emails because it meant months more of the word "emails" being repeated and people just assuming it meant more Hillary craftwork. Now on the other hand if you enjoy your elections being manipulated by an outside government, when there were very little "truths" exposed, then I have nothing further to add. </TEXT>
