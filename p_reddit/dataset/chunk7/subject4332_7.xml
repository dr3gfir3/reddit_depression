	<TEXT> EDIT - I looked through your reddit history and I see that you are into aquaponics - THAT could be part of your additional water usage if you are making large water changes, special filters ETC.

Still - see below...

I know this is old but I want to reply to it in case you are still dealing with this.  I've worked for several water companies in the past and poor customer service just pisses me off.

It is very easy to confirm if you have a leak in your home.  Locate your water meter and before you go to bed write down the reading on the odometer dial.  When you wake up in the morning take another reading.  If the reading is higher then you are using water somewhere in the house.

Many meters also have an indicator (a red triangle or similar shaped object) on the face of the meter.  It will spin even when a small amount of water is being used.  Even if it doesn't look like a toilet is leaking - it can be.  If you do see the triangle spinning or you are using water when you are sleeping then begin to turn off water to different devices in your home to eliminate the culprit.

Some things that can increase water consumption are:

RO filters - if you have one under your kitchen sink it will use additional water to filter what you get out of the tap.

Water softeners - one that is not working properly can cycle too often and use extra water it does not need to use.

Whole house humidifiers - if you have one it is possible that the needle valve that inserts water into your HVAC system is stuck open.

Many people have the drains for these devices routed to a sump pump.  Check your sump and see if any drains lead to it and if they have water flowing to them.

The average family of four people uses approximately 200-400 gallons of water a day.  Your usage is approximately 1,577 per day.

If they read your meter incorrectly initially then there will be a large correction to your bill the following cycle.

I'm assuming that WMWA is a water authority.  Unfortunately you don't have the amount of leverage you would have if your water company was regulated by the PA PUC.

One thing you can do is check and see what the prior consumption was for the prior owner.  If the meter on your property has an old style outside register (it will look like an odometer as well) the numbers on the outside should match the inside.  Sometimes they get off and when a house is sold the Authority will get an 'inside' reading.  This can cause for a large catch up bill as well.

Feel free to PM me if you need any further advice.  Hope you didn't get stuck with a big bill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We took a peek at the new requirements and filled in the gaps to run the new Tiger program this year so no robbing from wolf and bear for us.

On my last go round with this pack as a DL I came to realize that the biggest thing Cubs can offer kids is access to the outdoors in a way that no other program does.  Gone are the days where kids would roam around their neighborhood with other kids after school.  A good 80%+ are now sitting in their houses connected to an Xbox or other electronic device.  They voice chat with their friends and never see their faces.

Gone is riding your bike, climbing a tree, all of the things we did as kids.    If we can give them an opportunity to get dirty, see nature up close and personal and get some healthy physical activity in - that's a win.

So our Pack and Den activities have a real outdoor bend to them.  On top of that we've seen the cubs that have the most total outdoor camping/cooking experience tend to have the easiest transition to the Troop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my mind the Tiger program was just tacked onto the Cub Scout program and not really thought out in the same fashion as Wolf/Bear/Webelos was.  The only purpose it really serves is to get the boys in uniform a year earlier than they used to be.  It has always felt as if it was a reaction to the fact that kids were getting into soccer/tee ball/etc a year sooner so the BSA needed to ramp it up a notch to keep up.

The hard part is providing an engaging program that interests the boys.  I've had 3 boys in the Tiger program and it just doesn't have the heft that the other ranks do.  Maybe if I went through it just once it wouldn't be a big deal to me - I don't know.  Going through it three times and you start to see the weak points.

From what I've seen of the new Tiger program it appears to be much better.  Perhaps the same can be said of the Lion program.  I don't believe anyone in our district is running it yet.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pack Meetings that Get Parents Out of Their Seats </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've recently taken the position of CM again after a two year lay off from our pack.  There now seems to be an expectation at pack meetings that the DL and CM will entertain the boys while the remainder of the parents sit and talk.

I have a few ideas to counter this but I was hoping to hear what other people have to say about it as well.

What activities are guaranteed to get the parents up and involved at your pack meetings?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've had the supertimer track for almost 8 years now.  It's shot and we are looking to replace it.

It worked very well the first year we had it.  Every year after that we've had issues with electronics breaking, software issues.  We now have a box of spare parts for race day issues because we know they are coming.  The base supports is very cheap PVC and the track itself (at least our version) is held together by rubber bands.

Go with another option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard enough to provide a Tiger program, I see the Lion program as a nightmare tbh.

I understand they are trying to get boys involved earlier since sports does that too - but this might be a bit too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe try to engage in rational constructive conversations with him instead of dismissing it as crazy when he brings up a topic? 

and

If he ever confronts you about it, tell him that you did what you thought was best at the time, he has every right to feel hurt and violated about it and you should definitely not dismiss it or try to belittle him if he brings that up . It could be devastating emotionally/psychologically and will only worsen your relationship. You don't seem to have thought this issue through at all considering what you've written.

We don't dismiss it.  We never dismiss anything he says as crazy.  We try to have a rational conversation to explain why we made the decision we did.  We see his concerns and questions as valid.  I get the hot button issue that circumcision is - we both do.  We lay out the reasons for why we made the decision.  The problem is in his response what he writes what he says etc.  It's totally over the top.  I see the pattern as to how his brain works now.  Take fluoride in our water, 9/11 was a setup by the US government.  Any of those things - as soon as he googles it and clicks on the first link - THAT is what he believes.  I guess I'm asking for help in how to give him the ability to not be sucked in immediately by the first thing he reads.

I really enjoyed it when I started reading philosophy so it might just interest him to do so, it also improved my grades in all other areas because I actually started to understand why I did things.

Thanks for this - I will look into introducing this to him.

Sorry for my English, it's not my native language.

No need to apologize, it is quite good.  Thanks for taking the time to respond to me.

	<TITLE> [Advice Requested] Good Research Starting Points for a Teen w/ Aspergers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-16 21:34:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is probably going to be very long - I feel I need to give a lot of backstory in order to get the proper advice.  I'll put a TLDR at the end...

I'm a 45YO NT dad of a 14yo boy with Aspergers.  He was initially diagnosed as PDD-NOS when he was 3.  We've never hidden his diagnosis from him, have worked tirelessly to adapt our lives to him.  He has 4 NT siblings, 3 boys[16,13,7] 1 girl[4].  His mother (also NT), and I educated ourselves early on, realized that his autism is part of who he is and have never tried to 'cure' him in any way.  All of our efforts have been to help him learn his way through life so he can become a self sufficient functioning member of society - pretty much what anyone would want for any of their kids.  We both really love this kid and just want him to have the independent life he says he wants.

He has never been an easy going kid.  Very rigid, very black and white - the usual AS stuff.  He's gifted in mathematics, music and is also a very impressive writer.  Social skills he scores a big fat zero on.

Now that he has hit the teen years the tension level has climbed through the roof in our house.  I'll break it down into his homelife and school life:

Home life:

Relationships with siblings - If I had to guess, I would say that he has the emotional development of a 7-8 year old boy despite having the vocabulary and mental ability of someone in their early 20's (at least).  He is perfectly content to spend hours laying on the carpet playing make believe with Pokemon and his 4yo sisters dolls.  His 7yo brother and the 4yo sister love doing this with him.  Unfortunately he doesn't seem to be able to differentiate between what is appropriate to say to a 4yo/7yo and what is not.  This results in the 4yo getting distraught when her older brother starts to describe how the Pokemon are being gutted and killed etc.  I've spoken with him repeatedly about this, he assures me he understands that he can't talk like that around them - I have the exact same conversation with him the next day or so repeat repeat repeat....

He doesn't have much of a relationship with his siblings that are closer in age to him.  He won't invest the time necessary to learn or get into the stuff they are into.  I worry about what he is going to do when the younger 2 grow out of the toys he enjoys.

Relationships with parents - he does a lot of the typical teenage stuff - gets angry with us for controlling him etc.  However, now he gets stuck on topics that he stumbles upon/hears about and we can't rationalize with him like we can his brothers.  For example, and bear with me cause I know this can be a hot button issue - circumcision.  He was having issues with spontaneous erections which are normal for a 14yo boy.  He Googles it and learns about the anti-circ movement.  He becomes almost violently anti-circ.  He tells us we've raped him and taken away his precious foreskin.  I really thought a few times he was going to come across the table at me about it.  I'm fairly certain that if he was uncut he'd be demanding to be cut.  **It's almost like whatever he reads first on any controversial issue - THAT is what he becomes a proponent of.** He came downstairs one day and said to me 'Why do people hate the jews so much?' All I could think was if he read the right pages on the web I'd now be living with an anti-Israeli zealot.  He is a conspiracy theorists wet dream.

His mother in particular puts so much time, energy   love into trying to help him.  He really treats her like crap a lot of the time.  After a blow up he will come back and apologize but his whole mode of operation is really wearing her down.  She worries about what is going to happen to him when he turns 18, walks out the door and never looks back because frankly if something doesn't change for him - he is in big trouble.

I find him frustrating because he has a lot of potential but he gets so hung up with his way of thinking that he refuses to see the other side of the argument most of the time.


School:

He's had a classroom aide from the start and has fought tooth and nail since Jr. High to do eliminate the aide from his IEP.  He absolutely does not want his classmates to know that he is 'different'.  We've tried explaining that lots of people have aides, everyone is different, everyone has struggles.  He can't see that.

At the end of the last school year the teachers on his IEP team came to us and made a recommendation that he be moved to a different building.  He was in a school that had an emotional support program.  The other building has an autism support program.  They suggested this because he was being very negative to the members of his team and his grades were suffering significantly.  Based on their recommendation we agreed.

Unfortunately he hasn't taken to this level of support either.  All he wants is to be left without any aide or program.  The primary purpose of the aide is to help him focus and stay on task.  In classes where the aide is not present he forgets to turn in homework that is due, doesn't write down assignments, doesn't take good notes.  We spend hours and hours of extra time on him each week helping him study, looking over his work to see what he missed.  All we can think is he needs to learn to do this on his own

What caused me to write this today:

He's been writing us letters threatening us to make 'adult decisions' on his own if we don't move him back to the old school - we can't.  He writes horrible things to his mother and I in his room, absolutely hate filled screeds that no one that has given as much as we have of ourselves should have to see.  Then he will come downstairs and play with his younger siblings like nothing has happened.  Perhaps he is just blowing off steam but we don't believe we should just ignore these as that.

He demands to be left to handle his life/school/etc on his own.  His follow up to that sucks - it doesn't exist.  He wants to be able to just go on the internet and search for stuff on his own - anytime he does that we end up having another week or two of him ranting at us about some crazy half nuts website he found.

He's begun asking about searching for information about autism (what causes it, etc.) online.  I see this as a nightmare if we don't handle it right.  Seriously, god help me if he reads an anti-vaccination web page.  No, I don't believe it causes autism.

My questions:

Can anyone recommend some good websites/books/forums that would be a good jumping off point for him to look into?

Can anyone see anything that we are currently doing that if we changed how we handled it would perhaps help him have less of the teenage angst/rage we are seeing?

TLDR:

Love my son, having a lot of issues with him now that he is a teenager looking for advice and resources for both him and me that can help us out.  I'm sure I left some stuff out and will be happy to clarify.

	<TEXT> One bit of advice I can give that worked on me when I was recruited and I have since used several times to recruit others is to do the following:

1. Identify your candidate - like others suggested ask your committee chair or other people in the pack for suggestions.

2. Meet with your candidate and the person that suggested them preferably outside of a normal cub scout setting. Two on one is ganging up but it works.

3.  Ask them to commit and layout exactly what you are expecting them to do.

4.  After you ask be quiet.  Wait to hear what they have to say.  A lot of times they will slowly talk themselves into it.

That's exactly how I became CM my first go round, how we found our last 3 CM before I took the job back over again.

With the den program laid out so well anymore it is easier to get people to commit.

With regards to your son's den, you have extra vested interest in that.  If your current DL can't schedule out maybe if you sit down with the other parents and plan you can run the den by committee - each parent takes one meeting a month in rotation.  Your current DL will do one meeting a month - you have approx. 18 meetings from September to May he will cover 9 so you need to cover 9.  How many other boys are in the den? Each parent can commit to running a meeting a month.  You will be there as the trained leader so you have that covered.  I wouldn't include you in running any of these meetings as you already have a position in the pack.

Good luck.  </TEXT>
