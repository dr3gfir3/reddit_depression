	<TEXT> I'm not blaming anyone.  I have sought out therapists numerous times, but they are always changing practices, insurance, etc.

I am well aware that my problems are my own due to faulty wiring and circumstances beyond my control.  But thanks for rape shaming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know.  That's the only thing that stops me, causing hurt to friends who I know truly care for me.

The kid thing...every time I start feeling better about not having a family, somebody always asks me why I don't have one, why don't I adopt, why don't I go to the doctor.

I don't know if you watch House of Cards, but the female lead is constantly barraged by questions like this.  Her stock response: Do you ever regret having them?  I'm at the point where I want to say that to people who are rude enough to ask.

Thank you for your reply! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm turning 40 this weekend, and honestly I didn't know if life is living anymore </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-23 03:14:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At age 40, I've accomplished nothing.  I'm infertile, have had multiple miscarriages.  Children were the one thing I've always wanted.  My husband is not supportive of assisted reproductive procedures or adoption.  Case closed.  I also no longer have a sex life.  My husband is a good friend and provider, but we're not really in a marriage.

I used to have a career until I cracked up over the 80 hour week.  Now I just have a job that pays the bills. 

At age 30, I was carjacked, robbed and raped.  My family still refuses to talk about it.  I've moved on the best I can, and time has helped.

A few years later, there was a serial rapist that matched my perps MO and description.  After a few drinks, I went looking for him.  No property was damaged and no one was hurt, but I paid my debt to society.  Believe me, I wanted to be punished. Family was predictably not supportive (which I understand, I broke the law.). But it was a difficult time for me to say the least.

My husband decided to throw a surprise party for me this Friday.  None of my blood relatives are attending.  We don't live that far away, but yet my mother told my husband via text that she felt "I was pulling away and they couldn't come because my dad is tired."  They also refused to watch my brother's kids, so my brother and sister in law are not coming.  Never mind the fact that I am constantly running up there for all their parties and created an education trust so that my nephew will have options when he turns 18.  I gave him my old car when they got "accidentally" pregnant with their second child.

This is long, but I'm at the end of my rope. I've been actively suicidal before, and I feel it creeping up on me again.  I've been through 10 therapists through no fault of my own, they're always changing practices.  My p-doc diagnosis of me is major depression and anxiety.  I disagree.  I believe I may have bi-polar, possibly borderline, and for sure PTSD.

All of this is just to say, what's the point?  No kids, job I hate, family who is only interested in what they can get out of me and this pseudo-marriage.  

ETA:  Wow!  So many responses!  Thank you everyone, I'll try to get to all of them today (despite crappy job :) </TEXT>
