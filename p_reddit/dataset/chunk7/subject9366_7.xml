Good luck to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> North India will be fucking hot in June, unless you go (somewhat) deep into the mountains, and rainy in July. What kind of things do you have in mind? I'll try to suggest something on those lines.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As already mentioned, 2FA is a good habit that you should enable wherever you have an option. Try Authy, which is a better alternative to Google Authenticator and works/syncs on multiple devices.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has to be Pulp Fiction. I have watched the entire movie more than couple of dozen times, literally, and *revised* random scenes from it even more. There was a time when I remembered each dialog from it.

Other than that, The Dark Knight, Rush and Whiplash are close. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Larson's Character only standout was that she was a photographer.

I think they just wanted a woman in the cast. I was also glad they didn't go long with her relationship with Kong, like they did in King Kong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too did that about a year ago. In an attempt to go minimalist, I sold my hard drive off. Before that, I either uploaded my photos to Google Photos or saved critical data to Dropbox. And I haven't even exhausted 6 GB of my Dropbox space yet.

Hard drives aren't that important nowadays- store important content in the cloud and download the rest as needed.  </TEXT>
