	<TEXT> Our results with diabetes are early but we hope that as we measure more people we can get a strong correlation between heart (and other physiological parameters) and diabetes and how well folks respond to treatment.

It think CGMs will be very powerful for T2D because people can see what foods cause what glucose spikes in individuals ad people can avoid those foods and stay with those that do not cause spikes.

For T1D is is not clear how this will affect treatment beyond what you are currently doing, but for other it could lead to early early detection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Mike Snyder, and I am the director of the [Stanford Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine](http://snyderlab.stanford.edu/). I recently published an article titled: [Digital Health: Tracking Physiomes and Activity Using Wearable Biosensors Reveals Useful Health-Related Information]( http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2001402 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0301) in [PLOS Biology](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology). The study explored the use of wearables device to help manage health. We found that heart rate, skin temperature and blood oxygen measured by portable devices can be used to identify inflammatory disease such as colds and Lyme disease and also distinguish insulin resistance (associated with progression to Type 2 diabetes) from insulin sensitivity. Portable device also revealed reduced oxygen on airline flights is associated with fatigue.

	<TEXT> On the biological side though there is still ongoing research between if pervious dengue infection can make zika infection worse and vice versa. This process, known as antibody dependent enhancement, is known mostly for its role in dengue hemorrhagic fever but since zika has a similar fusion loop to dengue some researchers are looking into whether antibodies of those that have had dengue in the past partially attack zika but then not completely neutralize it and actually making it more virulent. Here is an interesting article about it http://www.nature.com/ni/journal/v17/n9/full/ni.3515.html </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chris: Great question jemadoo.  There is a great amount of overlap between dengue and zika, as they are transmitted by the same type of mosquito. Many of the people in the country have been exposed to dengue in the past and I have not seen any study asking residents about their perception of healthcare after zika infection. 

This is more likely a problem of poverty and access to healthcare than the perception of healthcare. People of lower SES most often have poorer healthcare coverage and so if someone gets a low grade fever like what zika causes they would be less likely to go receive proper medical care for it.  </TEXT>

The factors discussed in our paper were targeted towards zikas two primary vectors, A aegypti and A albopictus. As you mentioned these two mosquitoes are also the primary vector species for other viruses such as Chikungunya, so the factors described in our paper could very well apply to the spread of Chikungunya.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of spreading public awareness regarding the spread of disease it is disappointing that people would find the links between Zika and microcephaly unfounded. The CDC and other scientific agencies are very careful and conservative when they make a claim of causation between a disease and effect like they did with zika. https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2016/s0413-zika-microcephaly.html
       However I think that this is not just a problem with this topic alone but of current public distrust of science as a whole whether it be about climate change, vaccines, or birth defects related to zika. 
        The connection of zika as a teratogen is why much more of the United States knows what Zika is compared to Chickungunya or many other emerging infectious diseases. If there were more mild cases of the disease ie fever, joint pain,  rash most people and doctors would probably be unable to distinguish the disease from chickungunya or dengue. 
      From the zika outbreak we learned how necessary it is is to have funding for emerging diseases as in the funding needed to quickly do the research and develop vaccines for zika was debated in congress and then never passed While zika as an emerging disease is not that deadly, we should be ready and have funding available to research possibly more deadly emerging diseases in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erin: Right now we have high densities of Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus (the two main vectors of Zika) in much of the Southeast US, as well as parts of California and going up the East Coast. Climate change could make the mosquito season longer and potentially allow the mosquitoes to spread further north. Warmer winters could allow the mosquito eggs to survive at higher rates. However, our risk in the US is to some degree mitigated by the generally decent housing conditions (air conditioning, window screens) and vector control services we have. That being said, there were a lot of Zika cases in south Florida when that local epidemic started, so I wouldn't rule out local transmission in the US. </TEXT>

These include dengue and chikungunya viruses, among others. Right now in Brazil there is a sylvatic (transmitted by forest mosquitoes) outbreak of yellow fever going on. If this ends up spilling into the urban Aedes aegypti mosquitoes we will have a huge problem on our hands. </TEXT>

There is most definitely a correlation between socioeconomic status and vulnerability to disease. Those who live in poverty are often surrounded by more risk factors for diseases, such as crowded living conditions, poor sanitation, and the lack of a reliable sewage system. For mosquito borne diseases such as zika, these conditions are often optimal for their growth and reproduction. This does suggest that one way to combat vector borne disease would be to combat the structural issues related to poverty, therefore eliminating the conditions that are allowing the mosquitoes to breed and spread disease. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erin: It was a great experiment for me. The students in my class were incredibly smart and insightful when it came to formulating hypotheses. They were able to quickly learn to read scientific articles and get the main points. It was a great experience co-authoring a paper with them, in part because they were good writers and generated lots of interesting discussion and ideas that I didn't have on my own. I am definitely planning to do student projects with the goal of publications again in the future. This year's class will explore temperature-dependence of vector-borne disease by collecting data from the scientific literature, as a way of understanding what may happen to disease under climate change. I would recommend trying this approach with a group of high-level, very motivated students (this was a class that students had to apply and write a short essay to get into, and was not a required class). Break your project down into small, manageable tasks with weekly milestones to help them succeed. Another helpful approach was to have the class read papers at home and do a short online quiz that asked them to summarize main points, then during class I knew which concepts people were grasping and which we needed to go over together. Finally, normalizing the activity by letting the students know that this exercise was challenging for everyone was important for making sure students felt confident to explore literature that they didn't understand 100% right off the bat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erin here. It was a total experiment! Since the Zika epidemic was so new, there wasn't much scientific literature on it at the time. I thought that it might be possible for undergraduates to read most of what had been done on Zika relatively quickly. That made them relative experts in just a few weeks. We brainstormed together to come up with hypotheses for drivers and consequences of the epidemic, grouping them into three categories: environmental drivers, social drivers, and social consequences. The students then researched by reading papers on their own and wrote individual papers on topics of choice. They then wrote three group papers on the three major categories of hypotheses. Then our first author, Sofia, combined the group papers into a single collaborative paper. Over the course of the summer after the course, she whittled the big class paper down into a publishable review, which we submitted to PLoS NTD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,



My name is Erin Mordecai and I am an Assistant Professor of Biology at Stanford University. My research focuses on the complex ways in which global change (including climate, land use, species invasions, etc.) influences infectious disease. I am joined by coauthors Jamieson O'Marr and Chris LeBoa. Jameison is a junior undergraduate majoring in biology at Stanford University, whose research interests involve using ecological methods to study and predict the spread of infectious disease. Chris is an undergraduate human biology major at Stanford University concentrating in disease ecology. His research focuses on using preventative strategies to reduce infectious disease risk.



We recently published a review paper titled ["Environmental and Social Change Drive the Explosive Emergence of Zika Virus in the Americas"](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005135 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0222) in [PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds). This study was unusual in that it was written as a class project in my Stanford undergraduate seminar course, Bio 2N: Global Change and the Ecology and Evolution of Infectious Disease.



We set out to explore all the ways in which global change may have fueled the emergence and spread of Zika virus in the Americas in the last two years. We found evidence for many factors at play, including poor housing and infrastructure, suitable climate, abundant mosquitoes that are well adapted to live and breed near humans, lapsed mosquito control, and global travel. For example, we found that Zika cases shot up in a province in Ecuador following a massive earthquake that destroyed housing and infrastructure. We also found that deforestation and low GDP both correlated with the number of Zika-linked microcephaly cases in Brazil. Because of the high suitability for mosquito transmission throughout much of the Americas (including parts of the southern US), we need to be much more vigilant about vector control and rapid public health responses to new emerging diseases.

	<TEXT> **Konrad** None of our theories are any good at predicting how the brain learns. Seriously. The best we have for describing actual learning are probably theories that do not even allude to brains, Bayesian theories that simply assume that people are good at solving their problems are pretty good. But when it comes to learning in the brain, I recently got very excited about using ideas for deep learning as components for a model of neural learning. We recently wrote a little [paper](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncom.2016.00094/full) about that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Konrad** I just wanted to add that looking at Behavior only is not going to be good if what we want to explain is how the brain processes information on the inside. So I think that John Krakauer is a bit overly on the Behavior Chauvinism side. That being said, the neglect that neuroscience shows towards careful behavioral control is a huge problem. Our microprocessor lesioning studies would have been far more meaningful if we had the microprocessor spam the same command over and over, which would be more analogous to a well controlled behavior. One caveat may be that we simply do not know how to behaviorally produce the equivalent of spamming a single instruction with human beings. How can I prevent subjects from having any other thoughts in their heads? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Eric:** I think that the rate of improvement in computational power is slowing (RIP Moore's law) and I think a lot of contemporary "advances in AI" are actually really overhyped -- we're getting much better at visual processing for some tasks, but in other areas things are much slower-going (I work in a ML group at Berkeley). 

I think connectomics is incredibly important because we really need authoritative neuroanatomy. I think there may be many early systems (sensory, motor) where we have many decades of theories and we just need the anatomy to help us pick which ones are right. But so many of the challenges with FiB-SEM actually boil down to data postprocessing -- how are we going to turn these petabytes of voxels into actual connectivity graphs without millions of man-years of human annotation? There I hope that advances in both compute and ML will make things better. 

I'm actually most enthusiastic about techniques that let you test specific behavioral hypotheses with cell-type specific targeting, like fiber photametry, in short periods of time (experiments that take hours, not weeks).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Konrad** the description is a bit cartoonish. But when it comes to the novel I would argue that [tDCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_direct-current_stimulation) has often been shown to accelerate learning. Also, companies like [Kernel](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2016/08/15/putting-a-computer-in-your-brain-is-no-longer-science-fiction/?utm_term=.698c5c4032e1) and [Paradromics](https://paradromics.com/) are working towards interfacing with brains. Which could enable fast learning. Full disclosure, I consult for both of them. However, if there was a way of just speeding up learning with no downside, the brain would for sure have evolved that. Incidentally, we show that learning slowly may be optimal in many cases [here](http://web.mit.edu/cocosci/Papers/Kording-Tenenbaum-Shadmehr-07.pdf). So if there are ways of letting humans learn faster, there is probably a price to be paid (e.g. very slow forgetting of everything you ever learned in your life). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Eric:** I started off in a tetrode electrophysiology lab where, at the time, we were getting 100 simultaneous cells in the hippocampus -- this seemed like an incredible number! Now, with two photon, light sheet, and other technologies, it _feels_ like we can do much better. But can we? Deep structures in the brain, which might be more amenable to computational analysis, are still hard to record from. Many of these imaging techniques can only pull out superficial cortical layers, although that's improving as well. And of course, most of our optical techniques are looking at calcium signals, not actual membrane voltage. I think we need to go deeper, both in terms of deeper structures and in terms of even cortical acquisition. Some of [our recent microscopy work](http://ericjonas.com/pages/phase_scattering.html) tries to move in this direction, but it's difficult! 

Conceptually, I think a big problem is thinking of these things as an encoding problem -- from stimulus to response, without algorithmic models of the underlying behavioral task. You say that a microprocessor has a limited range of behavior, but they are Turing complete, so they could do anything! It's true that the tiny microprocessor we examined had limited complexity and a limited set of behaviors -- in that sense, it may have been much more like _C. elegans_ than a mouse or a human. I think the biggest problem in lesioning more complex organisms is the incredible plasticity and functional recovery we see in neural systems -- for which there is no known analog in the microprocessor.  </TEXT>

(1) We are very advanced at understanding how the brain works.
(2) Attaching the allusion to neuroscientific ideas strengthens a behavioral finding
(3) Functional connectivity/ granger causality/ DCM/ measure something of causal meaning, e.g. actual interactions
(4) Having a list of all the brain areas and what leads to activity is a big step towards understanding the brain (it is enabling other things but not directly an understanding)
(5) It is simple.

	<TEXT> **Eric**: I think behavior is absolutely crucial, and love the  Krakauer paper. In our paper we make reference to [David Marr's levels of analysis ](http://blog.shakirm.com/2013/04/marrs-levels-of-analysis/) for understanding the brain: 

* **computational** : At this level we describe and specify the problems we are faced with in a generic manner, but do not say how these problems are to be solved. Do we aim to learn a function? Do we wish to estimate uncertainty?
* **Algorithmic** : This level forms a bridge between the computational and implementational levels, describing how  the identified computational problems can be solved. It is here that Bayesian and machine learning methods find their place.
* **Implementaitonal** : The physical substrate or mechanism, and its organisation, in which computation is performed. This could be biological in the case of neurons and synapses, or in silicon using transistors, etc.

(Text from the linked to blog) 

I think understanding the computational level -- that is, formal descriptions of behavior and the underlying computation that the behavior is performing -- is too often made a second-class citizen in neuroscience. For primary sensory physiology (early audition and vision) this might be ok, but for more complex behavioral processes it's quite problematic. But I think the computational cognitive science approaches of Josh Tenenbaum (MIT) and Tom Griffiths (Berkeley) might point us in the right direction.

I am now trying to put all my research immediately onto a server (biorxiv or arxiv). Personally I am not sure if we need more software. We might need a system to help us discover what we should read. What do you think the virtual research environment could improve? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Eric**: The feedback has ranged from I thought about doing this experiment years ago! (high praise) to this paper has simply shown you are a bad experimentalist (Sad!) . Many of the members of the community I have talked to agree with our criticism of methods A, B, and D, but think we are unfair to method C -- where C happens to be the method they use. That always makes me laugh! 

Neuroscientists study neural systems at different levels. Some study individual molecules inside cells, some study whole cells, some study small networks of cells, some study brain regions, and some study the entire brain. Often, we pick a level to study because we think the details below are less important, and everything above is too hand-waiving or uninterpretable with current methods and knowledge. So there is a lot of internal criticism in the field to start.

	<TEXT> **Eric**: We come from similar backgrounds, this has basically been my reaction as well. One thing that the paper really made clear to me is that, while the acquire all the data and hope the algorithms can figure it out approach seems doomed to failure, we really do need to step up our acquisition technology. These days I spend a lot of my time working on computational imaging for neural data, and Konrad similarly has various high-throughput acquisition projects. So we still need big, authoritative data -- its surprising how much disagreement there still is about fundamental neuroanatomy! 

I think we also need to try and tighten the experimental loop so we can more quickly ask questions and reject erroneous hypotheses. Techniques like [fiber photometry](http://clarityresourcecenter.com/fiberphotometry.html) are not big data but they do let you very rapidly ask very specific questions of neural systems, especially of deeper structures which might be easier to understand. 

And I think that anyone doing systems neuroscience and above should study some computer science, especially theory of computation. I had one neuroscientist ask in a talk how I could possibly make the comparison to a microprocessor, considering the brain did fundamentally different things like emotion and affect. He did not have any patience for my arguments that those also were a form of computation. 

**Konrad**: I think it could help to focus more on ideas than about their endless replication. Measuring tuning curves is great. Even calculating granger causality is great. But scaling them up (thousands of labs doing basically the same thing in slightly different settings) before we understand what they mean is a problem. Same thing for neurotechnology. Develop methods that acquire large datasets about anatomy or physiology is great. Applying one of them to the whole brain is less interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Konrad**: When people say connectomics, it feels causal. A connection after all is a wire from one place to another (and arguably EM connectomics gets at that http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8923?WT.ec_id=NCOMMS-20150805 spMailingID=49252352 spUserID=NDkwMjM5MzE2MwS2 spJobID=740779497 spReportId=NzQwNzc5NDk3S0). Anyone speaking plain English thinks of connectomics in causal terms.

However, as we know, it is very hard to get at causality from observational data. I.e. it is crazy hard to understand causality in the brain if you just record. In fact, the problem is so bad that economists write amazing papers about it. And they did work at better methods (see Taking the con out of Economics discussed in http://www.nber.org/papers/w15794). 

So, statisticians using connectomics on typical fMRI, LFP, MEG, or spike data are not even pretending. Connections are *defined* as certain kinds of statistical regularities. However, this does not need to mean anything about the actual causality in the system. From my own work we have some evidence:
The problem is complicated and we wrote a review about those problems:
[review of functional connectivity methods] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2706692/). I want to note that back then I still loved the idea. Maybe too much.
Granger causality should not work for slow signals: [this](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0009206)
Functional connectivity on spikes from simulated neurons fails:
[here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2936935/)
And obviously we fail at understanding the microprocessor.

So I think we have a serious social problem there. Everyone working on statistics (functional connectivity) knows that they are not talking about causal connections and is happy about the popularity of the field. Everyone outside the field, in particular the experimentalists, are very happy interpreting the results as causality. In fact, I believe that every single experimentalist I ever talked functional connectomics with wants to interpret the results as causal. I am planning to write a review paper soon addressing this mismatch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Eric**: Hi Memming! I think its an interesting question if randomness and noise would make a system easier or harder to understand. You are correct that the processor looks much more deterministic than a brain, but for many of the techniques we applied (spectral analysis, dimensionality reduction, lesioning) there is no reason to assume that stochasticity make them work better or worse. Its entirely true that some methods which assume a large degree of underlying stochasticity wouldnt work terribly well, but we mostly avoided those. 

We need to remember that many of the techniques we use in neuroscience, ranging from Fourier transforms and spectral analysis to generalized linear models, were not invented _for_ neuroscience. While many of the techniques currently used to understand digital computers assume a certain level of determinism, it may be the case that stochastic relaxations are applicable. 

**Konrad**: Who says that the brain is noisy? A system that you do not understand will always look noisy because everything that you can not explain is by definition called noise.

	<TEXT> **Konrad**: Outstanding question. Neuroscience, just like psychology and other disciplines is having a statistical crisis where papers often do not replicate (see the [open science project] (https://osf.io/ezcuj/wiki/home/) ). But isnt it amazing that we have such a strong push now towards fixing these problems? On the other hand, it is hard to do science if you believe that about half of the research may not replicate. What do you believe then? We used to believe that conceptual replication could save us. Kahneman describes it best at: https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2017/02/02/reconstruction-of-a-train-wreck-how-priming-research-went-of-the-rails/comment-page-1/#comment-1454

	<TEXT> **Eric**: Ok, this is a great question. I think there are a few important points to consider: 


First, what does understanding one type of neural system let us conclude about other neural systems? You are correct that, in many ways, starting with a simpler organism like c. elegans seems more tractable. And indeed, the history of all of neuroscience is full of exciting discoveries from model systems, including how nerve impulses are conducted (work in the 50s on the squid giant axon), the nature of early visual processing (Hubel / Weisel, 60s), and on. We have elucidated a lot of basics about how neural systems seem to work from model organisms, which apply to more complex animals, and ultimately humans. 

Plus, a lot of human neuroscience isnt studying a whole human brain -- most of the technologies we have to acquire neural data dont work on humans, often because they damage the organism, and obviously thats suboptimal for human research. 

Secondly, though, is the question of why are we funding science? The NIHs budget is ~$32B/year, and the NSFs budget is $8B/year. I often think of that $24B gap as the amount society is willing to pay for research that will potentially have clinical impact. And as I say often when I give a talk about this work, it may not be the case that any real level of computational understanding is necessary to have clinically meaningful impact. A large number of neuropsychiatric drugs are tremendously effective, and thats in spite of us not really understanding any circuit-level mechanisms of action. As a result, it may be that more macro, human-focused research might yield clinical impact. 

That said, we also know that often animal models dont generalize terribly well for clinical evaluation. Medical chemist Derek Lowe often writes about [just how wrong many animal models can be](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2016/09/23/just-how-worthless-are-the-standard-alzheimers-models)  for evaluating whether or not a given treatment will work in human populations. . This may suggest that, from a clinical perspective, studying simpler organisms might not help as much as wed like. 


**Konrad**: great question. We do not currently understand the worm. And we have learned that it is crazy hard to understand. If the mammalian brain is that complicated then we can expect a hard time ahead. Many neuroscientists implicitly assume that the mammalian brain is *way* easier than the worm nervous system. Some people  say that the mammalian nervous system solves general purpose computing (which they believe to be simple). And that the worm is specialized and hence complex. Other people may say that this believe is primarily held to avoid having to confront the hard questions.

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit!

We are Eric Jonas (a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) and Konrad Kording (Professor at Northwestern and RIC). Our research focuses on trying to understand how the neurons in the brain compute and give rise to behavior. A lot of what we do is come up with mathematical techniques to understand neural data and work on new methods to acquire this data.

We recently published a paper titled [Could a neuroscientist understand a microprocessor?](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005268 utm_source=reddit utm_medium=ama utm_campaign=redditama-0215) that tried to address if the analysis methods we frequently use in neuroscience are likely to provide the level of understanding we seek. One of the biggest challenges facing neuroscience is that we dont actually know ahead of time how neural systems work, so validating analysis techniques can be a catch-22. We attempted to use these techniques on a microprocessor -- a system we understand really well -- to see if we could make sense of how it works. This ended up being quite difficult, and we suggest ways that we might move forward as a community to make sure our analysis methods really do what we hope they will.

Our study  has also been written up in the popular press. Read the articles in [Arstechnica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2017/01/can-modern-neuroscience-understand-donkey-kong/) and [The Economist](http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21714978-cautionary-tale-about-promises-modern-brain-science-tests-suggest)) to learn more.

These data cannot be shared with law enforcement, etc. Even with this protection, many people still refuse to interact with the Department of Health for various reasons (including that of privacy).

Outside of New York, this issue becomes much thornier, since unintentional HIV transmission is still a crime in many jurisdictions. It is great concern among many researchers in this field that our work could be used to prosecute individuals. That being said, the type of data analyzed here are NOT sufficient to establish transmission between two people. All we can say using these genetic sequence data is that two people are infected with viruses that are similar enough to suggest a direct or indirect epidemiological connection. There could be intermediate or shared sources of infection that we cannot rule out using surveillance data.  </TEXT>

Here in the US, we are already incorporating the findings from this study in public health practice: monitoring cluster growth and directing public health services to genetically linked people in clusters.  

The questions I want to address next is can we use HIV genetic sequences to identify transmission clusters of greatest public concern? And can we direct resources (linkage to care, antiretroviral treatment support, partner notification services) towards these clusters to slow (stop) their growth?

My group is currently working on addressing both of these questions. </TEXT>

There have been many theories as to why CCR5-delta32 exists at such high frequency in humans (particularly Northern Europeans): plague, smallpox, etc. I'm not convinced by any one theory yet. The timing and geography just doesn't fit.

	<TEXT> There is an extraordinary amount of variation in the HIV genome. In fact, within a single person infected with HIV, there is typically more genetic variation than is found in influenza circulating the globe in a given year. This variation occurs across the entire genome, and is greatest in the envelope proteins, which evolve to avoid detection by the host's immune system. 

There is quite a lively debate in the HIV research community right now about much this genetic variation affects infectivity potential (i.e. the concentration of virus in blood). It seems as if there is a relationship. However, it is an complicated relationship. And there aren't clear mutation-phenotype relationships when it comes to infectivity.

Other viral genetic features such as cell-tropism (which cells can HIV bind to and infect) and drug resistance have much clearer genetic underpinnings. And these types of mutations are often monitored quite closely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent question! The region of the HIV genome that we used here is about 1200 nucleotides long. And there are four possible states at each site (A,C,U,G)  U instead of T because HIV is an RNA virus. That means that HIV evolution doesn't occur in a linear fashion, but rather like a (multidimensional) tree. The same mutation can occur along different branches in a tree, but there are often so many other mutations that even with this occasional convergence, the sequences will never look identical again.

That being said, HIV is a peculiar virus, and there is some work suggesting that this convergent evolution is happening more often that we would otherwise expect. But once sequences are diverged, they won't look the same again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This study was conducted on existing public health data collected by the NYC-Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH). So my group was not involved in the elicitation of sexual/drug-using partner names. That being said, when people are asked for these names, they provide on average only 0.5 partners. Partner elicitation is certainly a sensitive topic, and based on that average, most people do not name any partners. 

One important finding of our study is that, even in the absence of partner naming, we can use these genetic sequences to better understand transmission dynamics. And we can query someone's HIV genetic sequence against all other people in the database, looking for evidence of an epidemiological connection.

To answer your second question, NYC and primary care provides use drug resistance profiles (captured in these genetic sequences) to modify treatment regimes. This was (and still is) the primary purpose of collecting these genotypes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,
 

My name is Joel Wertheim and I am an Assistant Professor of Medicine at the University of California, San Diego. My research focuses on the molecular evolution of RNA viruses, like HIV. In my [lab](http://id.ucsd.edu/faculty/wertheim.shtml), I am particularly interested in figuring out how to translate insights from HIV evolutionary biology into practical public health action.
 

We recently published a study [Social and Genetic Networks of HIV-1 Transmission in New York City]( http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006000 utm_source=ama utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=amareddit-0208) in PLOS Pathogens. In this [study](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1006000 utm_source=ama utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=amareddit-0208) we asked HIV-infected individuals to name their sexual partners and injection drug-using partners. When these partners were also infected with HIV, we investigated whether their viruses were genetically similar enough to support a shared transmission history. Our findings suggest that incorporating HIV genetic sequence data can improve public health activities.

	<TEXT> The retrospective symptom interviews were a limitation of the study. The DERC records did not include notes on symptoms in quarantined individuals; however, I was the clinical lead for Partners In Healths Ebola response in that district at the time, lived 10 km from that particular village, and attended the nightly DERC meetings, so I have a reasonable sense of how effective surveillance was at the time. As we have been expanding the study, were realizing there are many more undocumented survivors (and minimally symptomatic infections) in less "well-surveilled" villages. </TEXT>

I do think there was excessive focus on funerary ritual as an amplifier of infection, when, in the final analysis, Ebola is a caregivers disease. The large majority of the survivors I interviewed said they knew about how Ebola was transmitted, and they knew their loved ones had EVD, but they couldnt leave them to suffer without care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont think strain variation played a part in whether one is symptomatic or not, but rather host defenses. The mortality rate for EVD cases wasnt inflated, but the rate for all infected individuals was. 

Even so, my sense is the total number of deaths is much higher than the 11,000+ currently reported due to poor surveillance (especially early in the outbreak). We are beginning collaborations with other investigators to explore whether we can isolate effective neutralizing antibodies from previously infected individuals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting ideas, but the mortality rate in West Africa was 40-70% because of a lack of ICU level care. Remember, 100% of American clinicians flown back to the US survived, making me conjecture that the mortality rate for Ebola Virus Disease (Zaire species) could be below 5% with ideal supportive care. So while we must invest in vaccines and therapeutics, we shouldnt let that distract us from the top priority for future outbreaks in West Africa: health systems strengthening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was not a statistically significant difference in titers between survivors and minimally symptomatic individuals in our cohort, but we had a small sample size.

https://academic.oup.com/cid/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cid/ciw793/2666520/Ebola-Virus-Persistence-in-Breast-Milk-After-No
Given there have only been a few flare-ups (mini-outbreaks) due to sexual transmission from survivors (after they convalesced), my sense is that minimally symptomatic individuals pose little concern for future transmission of virus. But more research needs to be done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


My name is Gene Richardson and I am and infectious disease physician and anthropologist at [Brigham and Womens Hospital](http://www.brighamandwomens.org/) and [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/). I use biosocial approaches to conduct research on infectious disease epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa.



I recently published an article titled [Minimally Symptomatic Infection in an Ebola Hotspot: A Cross-Sectional Serosurvey](http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005087 utm_source=ama utm_medium=reddit utm_campaign=amareddit-0201) in PLOS Neglected Tropical Diseases. The study provides further evidence that Ebola, like many other viral infections, presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations, including minimally symptomatic infection. The findings also suggest that a significant portion of Ebola transmission events may have gone undetected during the recent outbreak in West Africa.


I will be answering your questions at 1pm ET -- Ask Me Anything! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most bumblebee queens mate only once, so all workers in the colony have the same father, and so in line with the classic haplodiploidy scenario, workers will be 75% related on average (so highly related but not genetically identical). In honeybees, queens mate multiple times, and so average, relatedness is lower. The genetic factors underpinning individual cognitive differences in bees have not yet been identified to my knowledge.  </TEXT>

In terms of sugar solution, in general, the more concentrated it is, the better - until above 50 or 60%, it becomes so viscose that bees have difficulties imbibing it... they also prefer large over small volumes of sucrose solution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually there weren't too many experimental difficulties... the nice thing about such behavioural work is that it's easy to see what works and what doesn't, so the feedback loops are quick: if a technique doesn't work, you see it right away. That leaves lots of room for creativity. Anyone can do such experiments - you just need ideas. In terms of technology, these experiments could have been done 100 years ago. I'm happy that in this post-genomic age, where fancy and expensive technology is often fetishized, we can still do our work with a bit of plywood, cardboard, glass and some live animals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had been thinking about human cultural processes for a number of years, and wondering whether they really are as unique as they're made out to be. I remember sending an email message, some years ago, to the 1st author Sylvain Alem, saying if we can demonstrate  something as unusual as string-pulling in the bumblebee, and find that it spreads by social learning, well have something really interesting. I also said that its very unlikely to work But fortunately Sylvain was happy to take that risk, and in collaboration with Clint Perry, they designed the paradigm and found quite quickly that indeed bees could be trained to solve the string-pulling task.  That was by all means a big surprise, even though we must all have had an inkling that it wasnt entirely hopeless  otherwise we wouldnt have tried. But it was even more of a surprise that not only could bees be trained to solve this task in a step-by-step manner  but a small minority of bees actually solved the task by themselves, without gradual training or observing a skilled bee. 110 nave individuals were given the opportunity to solve the task of their own accord; each of them were given 2 trials. Two of the 110 bees managed the task on their second attempt. While these two were clumsy and inefficient at solving the task, it showed that through persistent exploration and trial and error, some individual bees could actually solve the task by themselves. The final big surprise came in the context of social learning: we discovered that nave individuals that would observe, from a distance, a skilled string-pulling bee, could subsequently solve the task by themselves. But we really didn't know that any of this would work when we started... </TEXT>
