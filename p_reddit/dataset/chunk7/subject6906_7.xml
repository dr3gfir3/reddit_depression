	<TEXT> The Board of Governors is part of the reason why Julie Hermann was hired. There was a search committee that had several of the members on it. Keep that in mind. Although the admins would never allow it, the push for a student BOG vote is honorable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Student funded....which means their parents were most likely paying for it IF their parents were helping them with tuition/fees. I remember when this happened. The money to pay Snooki was allocated from the student activity fee on the term bill. This is the same fee that is associated with RUPA events and other events held for students (Beats on the Banks, concerts, comedian appearances, Carnival etc.. AND funding for athletic subsidization)  </TEXT>
