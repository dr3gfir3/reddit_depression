	<TEXT> I know that it's been reported that the superstars get a nice bonus for Mania. So I'm wondering how much each type of guy guys

- Brock, Taker, Cena, etc.

- Chris Jericho

- Kevin Owens, Cesaro, Sheamus, etc.

- Charlotte, Sasha, Bayley, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But if he only wrestles in **high profile** matches at this point in his career than he needs a few wins. His character is the ultimate corporate power hungry bad guy. How does anyone take him seriously if he loses a lot. Beating him will only mean something if people can believe he could win. If he loses enough to the point that there's not an ounce of unpredictability in the match than it tarnishes him </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Triple H beating Sting serves a far greater purpose because Hunter is basically WWE's resident bad guy. And he needs to get a substantial win every now and then to make him such. Like I said, I will take him beating a 58 year-old guy who doesn't need a win in order to add to his longevity so he can put over younger full time talent. Which he has done (Bryan, Roman, Rollins) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Goldberg and Lesnar was awesome for what it was. Hunter and Seth was good, a little long, put really picked up at the end. The Hardys return was fun. Owens and Jericho was a great midcard match. Cena proposing was a memorable moment. Taker and Roman stuck but Taker retiring was something that will never be forgotten.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For me it's Wrestlemania 23. I think it has a great main event (Cena/HBK), but that's all the card really does for me. It's biggest praise is Taker vs Batista which many say stole the show but I disagree. Taker has had far better matches than that and Batista and him definitley had way better matches than the one in Detroit.

I also don't think the undercard is very good. The Money in the Bank match was fun and stacked with Main Event talent that deserved more for Mania than the Money in the Bank. Kane/Khali was a bore fest. Benoit and MVP had a good match but they had even better matches down the line. The ECW snooze fest

They had to take 40 minutes of the show to devote it to Trump/McMahon which was fine and all but so much more could be been done with other wrestlers (about 80% of the guys in Money in the Bank).

It just doesn't hold up to me. Not that good of a Mania </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not arguing the booking of the match. Or the match's purpose. It's piss poor, but I do believe what I've stated. Hunter needed the win more than Sting. And in today's day and age I need a better reason for a part timer to go over than "not lose his only WM match" as shitty as that sounds. It's a business, not a fairy tale. At least Hunter and Brock's wins seem to have purpose that serves the future

And I thought that the handshake was done purely so they could brag about a Wrestlemania moment. As in look as these two legends break kayfabe so they can put the past in the past. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because a match featuring two part time guys does nothing to establish future stars. All it does is cement two part-timers legacy. Making their appeal greater when facing younger guys so when they do and the younger guy goes over the younger guy also looks better. Hunter is on TV more and he's basically the WWE's number one bad guy. A win services him more because he can use it to look better and put over the younger talent </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bobby is a nice guy. That's all I can say about it and defend what he does. He doesn't want to join in and gang up on someone he is friendly with despite what they're doing is shitty. Look at it like this, Bobby is the type of person who if you were his friend and were accused of something shitty he would be the only one defending you even if the verdict was pretty damning. He's a good dude. Don't judge him by this clip, because there's been countless other times that he's gone out on a limb to speak his mind on what everyone has been thinking but no one is saying. He's gone on Hillary rants, he's gone off on the female comic Facebook group, he was one of the first people who came forward and defended Anthony even though he had shit on the line with his pilot. He's a good guy and I'll always defend him. Fuck, he even had some asshole from here on the podcast so they could talk about what's wrong with the show and why people criticize it and he made sure that comics on the show didn't gang up on him. Who does that? Bobby's one of the most likable people associated with the show and I'll always defend him.

This blows me away about Christi. I liked her, but I never thought she was this malicious. The entitlement is insane

	<TEXT> No, but Bobby is a nice guy. That's all I can say about it. He doesn't want to join in and gang up on someone he is friendly with despite what they're doing is shitty. This blows me away about Christi. I liked her, but I never thought she was this malicious. The entitlement is insane </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look I try to defend this show as much as I can because I do enjoy it, but this past month has been unbearable with that shit. **EVERY FUCKING WEEK** we've gotten some MMA bore or some WWE star. Fighters are the most boring egotistical listens ever. It's the same shit. They can't laugh at themselves. They have no sense of humor. They stink. A good example is I can't stand Mickey Gall when he's on LOS. They basically lick his ass the whole hour and a half and he stinks for the same reasons I listed above.

WWE wrestlers could be interesting in some regards because they can be entertaining, but everyone in that fucking company is so beaten to death with media training and everything they say publicly is so managed and contrived that it's just all terrible. I don't get it.

They're being dishonest when they say they aren't trying to appeal to a niche with their respective podcasts. I wish they would just own up to that. I respect that they took the call and they (especially Jim) didn't talk over him. Good caller, too

Edit: Changed day to week because I'm an over-exaggerating coward </TEXT>

2010 had a good feud with Batista/Cena, Orton was on fire as a babyface, The Nexus Angle, The Taker/HBK match

	<TEXT> That's called pacing a match. When you get to the climax it's spot after spot. That's how a lot of AJ's matches go. It's what people praise his matches with Cena. 

He squashed Ellsworth because Ellsworth is booked as a joke who got lucky for 2 months against AJ. It was how you vehemently put a period on the end of that feud. It maintained AJ's credibilty. He hasn't been booked as someone who fucks people up. He's booked as a fantastic performer. The only thing that could back up your claim would be him attacking Shane in the parking lot but in that he was made to look like a coward who had to jump Shane from behind </TEXT>
