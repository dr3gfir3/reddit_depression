	<TEXT> Thanks a bunch for the reply! I've already jumped ship from Motorola's offerings t'use 12.1, so I know what I'm missing out on, more or less, and I'm prepared to do without. I don't mind the occasional random reboot, but the battery impact is a cause for concern, as is the flashlight issue...

	<TEXT> I was quite excited by [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4aiqws/original_moto_x_2013_ghost_is_ready_for_official/) thread over at /r/Android a while back, and I know that Megatron007's been hard at work on an unofficial build as discussed [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/4aiqws/original_moto_x_2013_ghost_is_ready_for_official/), but I'm wondering what the status of the official build is. Assuming it's still happening, of course...

I'm getting a little antsy, and have been strongly considering the unofficial this week. What's been the general experience? Go ahead, or hold off?

Many thanks! </TEXT>

In terms of actually protecting a device, sure, skins are a terrible option, but if they can mitigate the occasional scratch in order to preserve resale value them it's definitely a worthwhile investment, I should think.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I admit that budgetary and time constraints have prevented me from actually playing the game myself, but I've gotten the gist of the story through visiting friends and watching Let's Plays courtesy of YouTube, but it's occurred to me that the titular Arkham Knight doesn't actually get a whole lot of screen time. For a game named after him, his appearances seem pretty sparse.

I'm wondering if anybody else felt this way, or would you folks contend that my opinion is unjustified? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to volunteer at a nursing home, and part of the work I did there involved feeding certain residents.

One resident in particular could never seem to understand how it had gotten so dark so quickly, which isn't unusual in the middle of winter. When similar "observations" arose during the long summer days, and her questions became more specific t'the room around her, I started to wonder if she might be suffering from Alzheimer's; that said, she seemed oddly lucid outside of this issue with how "dark" it was.

It turned out that the woman was actually blind. For whatever reason, it simply wasn't something she could accept. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's amazing; I knew about this format war, of course, and Microsoft's (albeit thinly) veiled support for HD DVD, but I'd never heard the rumour of their delay strategy.

What was the suggested purpose of their play? Were they believed to be investing early into their next system? Did they deliberately want streaming to become the *de facto* "format?" That'd stand to reason, IMHO -the 360 was, after all, among the first devices to support Netflix streaming via a native application, right? </TEXT>
