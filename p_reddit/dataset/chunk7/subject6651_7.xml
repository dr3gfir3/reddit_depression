	<TEXT> Every minute that Young spends at the 3 with two guards is another minute with Ingram either at the 4 or on the bench; two things I don't like at all.

If we manage to keep our pick, that's another young guard to add to the core. And above all else, I want players who value defense and unselfish play; Young values neither and his shot selection is atrocious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. I don't think it's just enough to say "I would have made $XM instead" and be done with it. Where's the reflection? Where's the risk-taking? I prefer the responses where people are specific and adventurous:

"I would have taken a chance and asked out Cynthia from sophomore year."

There's no guarantee she says yes. Maybe she turns you down and you suffer embarrassingly at the hands of your peers. But at least you took a chance and probably learned a valuable lesson. Maybe she actually was a self-centered wench and you would still be worshiping the memory of her if not for the truth of experience.

And above all else, get-rich-quick just seems like a lazy answer. There is so much more to be gained if I went back 10-15 years than just through economic ventures.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coming off the bench successfully showed that Hondo could accept a specific role with humility. In his twilight years Pierce has not shown the same ability to adjust his game to benefit the team (which is why he isn't a part of the rotation).

	<TEXT> No this is cute because I (a Laker fan) am giving props to a guy with more historical significance to your team, and you're taking offense to it either way. Nice straw man though, Russell is too controversial for me to start down that road. 

I watched Pierce his entire career. He was a great player, no doubt, but Hondo was better. But moreover, why does my age matter? I've watched hundreds of YouTube videos which are the only living remnants of a long-gone era. The 1976 NBA Finals was one of my favorite to rewatch (at least, what you can find of it). 

But you're also conveniently ignoring where I said "come off the bench" and "hit one of the craziest shots in Finals history." Pierce never did either of those things. Is that the epitome of deciding who is better? No, but you've made it your prerogative to say Pierce did everything Hondo did.

This isn't a matter of debate. Hondo is unanimously considered top-25 all-time. I could name 30 guys better than Pierce without breaking a sweat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More like his adaptability to doing whatever the Celtics needed of him. Lead the team in scoring? Check. Facilitate the offense? Check. Guard the opposing team's best wing scorer? Check. Come off the bench? Check. Hit one of the craziest shots in NBA Finals history? [Check](https://youtu.be/hmtlU_HhzHE?t=2m42s).

EDIT: Looks like I may need more to persuade the youngins here. Havlicek and Pierce both averaged 20ppg 8 times in their careers, and Havlicek never averaged fewer than 14. Pierce has averaged less than 14 each of the last four years, so taking off those years...he doesn't pass Hondo in total points. Let's tack on the fact that Hondo has a higher career average in points, rebounds, assists, FT%, and only trails Paul by 0.06% in FG%. Statistics out of the way, Havlicek was largely considered the greatest wing of all-time until the '80s. The Truth was a great player, no lie, but Havlicek is up there as top-25 all-time. Pierce *might* be top-40. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, it's a grand idea but it would be akin to awarding someone with something he hasn't earned. Besides, I think being considered the best player year-in and year-out is a greater honor. We certainly don't recognize Nash as being  Shaq just because he won the award twice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And you're refusing to acknowledge that making that an interpretation means that there's no point in even playing the season. Who cares who the "best player in the world" is when this is a **single-season award** recognizing the best player **in 2016-17**? 

Take last year, for example. Steph by far and away deserved the award because he was the best player in the world from November-May. Once the playoffs rolled around, however, LeBron turned up the heat and reestablished himself. Curry was adequately awarded with the regular season MVP; LeBron was adequately awarded by winning the title and Finals MVP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It absolutely is outrageous when his team is falling apart at the seams and there are other guys who do more in fewer minutes. You didn't have to say career achievement, my assertion is that the HoF is an adequate honor for someone who is supposedly the best in the world but passed up for worthier MVPs.

Moreover, best player according to what? Numbers? He's beat. Wins? He's beat. Reputation? Sure, but the season still has to play out, and it's not played on paper. If reputation were everything the Warriors would be 74-8, and the MVP would be handed out in October every year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a historical precedent for not awarding the best player in the world when there is a worthier candidate. The HoF is the lifetime achievement award waiting for them. If you're gonna turn MVP into a career-based award, you might as well stop making it yearly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LeBron's team is collapsing around him as we speak, and there are three other teams with better records than his, and two other guys with better stats than him. The MVP award is not based on career accomplishments, natural ability, or labeling someone as "best in the world." He has not accomplished what Russ and Harden have this year, and you can't keep referring to his status as being deserving of an award that is entirely single-season based. He's accomplished enough, and he doesn't need this "lifetime achievement MVP award" to boost his legacy. Tip your cap to him, put him on the All-NBA First Team, but stop trying to argue that he deserves special treatment for being best in the world; your 2017 MVP is either Harden/Russ/Kawhi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was with them on their own with literally no help on trash teams. The Pelicans this year are still winning 30+ games with basically just Davis most of the year. Kyrie/Love as a one-two punch may not be contenders, but they would still find a way to squeeze out 40 wins, and it's an insult to these guys as players to say otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's literally my point. Without LBJ there is no Kyrie + Love. You can't tell me a team built around those two is going to be 3-20 when it most certainly would look different in theory. More cap space, different role players, probably coached by someone more competent than Lue. </TEXT>

Longevity is surely a factor in the GOAT convo, but as unrealized accolades become fewer and far between, the deciding factor -- to me at least -- becomes "did you make it a point to be the greatest player on the floor when it mattered the most?" For MJ, this was never a question. You give him 19 years and I doubt that ever changes. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just bought my first PS4 with 2K17, was able to play it a few times without connecting to Network play, and I have some questions regarding the MyPlayer account and set-up:

-The game allows you to "Start Application Without Updating," right now it's looking like a 3-hour update...but I won't be able to connect the MyPlayer with the app to scan my face without the network features right?

-when I go to log-in to the MyPlayer app on my phone, it says "A valid NBA 2K17 save was not found," but I already played through the Midnight Madness after making my guy go to Kansas...did I not properly save 2K on my PS4 yet?

-I'm assuming I need the network features enabled in order to download current rosters?

All in all I'm just really confused about all this...I haven't had my own game console since GameCube so all the networks/downloads/updates are pretty difficult to keep track of. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>
