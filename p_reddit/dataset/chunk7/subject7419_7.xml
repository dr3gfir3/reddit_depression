	<TEXT> This technique was actually used in logging. Large tree trunks were spread wide at the ground, and were dripping with pitch.  It would have been difficult to saw through a tree at ground level.  Instead, the lumberjacks built a scaffold, a framework of poles and planks, around the tree.  They climbed ten to twenty feet above the ground on the scaffold and cut notches into the trees trunk. Then they inserted a platform called a springboard into the notches.  Up there the wood was soft and the pitch was only in pockets. [Here is a video from the same time period as the photo of lumberjacks using this technique.](https://youtu.be/3MDgxNLDR64?t=2m34s) Skip to 2 minutes and 34 seconds if the video does not start there. I am not sure if they still do this in competition but [here is a video of a recent springboard chop race](https://youtu.be/CUG-LJ6UNN4) which is a similar competition. </TEXT>
