	<TEXT> For those who don't know, Ciri has similiar encounter in the books with a con artist trying to pass off a wyvern (or a forktail?) as a basilisk. That was pretty good scene in the book and I really liked when I walked past this spot and noticed that guy calling that wyvern a basilisk.

Hats off to CDPR again. As a someone who really likes the books, things like this are very nice to see in this game.

	<TEXT> I prefered Witchers combat to Skyrims. Mostly because on higher difficulties on Witcher you actually could play it more strategically using proper signs, oils, potions and dodging and altering between heavy and light attacks. 

While in Skyrim on Legendary difficulty you fight the enemies just the same way, except enemies have tons of health and hit harder. Mage? You backup and throw spells. Warrior? Bash, hit, block, bash, hit, repeat. Thief? One shot everything from distance with bow or sneak up and one shot them with 2 daggers that oneshot everything. 

But I must say I *love* both games. They both are great games that I play depending on what I want to play.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree, I don't think the comparison is fair since since Witcher games are based on books series of 7 novels. I'd imagine this help the game writers alot to write quests fit for the already existing world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did that too! even thought the books werent translated until 2010-2016 here but I didn't play any of the games until I had already read them from Last Wish to Tower of Swallow. Played witcher 2 before I had read Lady of the Lake since it got translated bit late. Still wating for the Season of Storm to arrive to my local library

I think I enjoyed the games much more because I read the books first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is supposed to say "Seduce monsters, Slay ladies"

It's a joke about the main character is monsterslayer and huge ladies man. Not so much on the books that the games are based on but in the first game there are tons of women who you can sleep with. There are also opportunities to sleep with monsters (succubies, nymph) in the games IIRC. There is also scene in Witcher 3 where Geralt and other Witchers talk about banging a succubus 

EDIT: *Also* it is signed "Dandelion" who is a bard and Geralts best friend and always making jokes about him. Especially in the books </TEXT>

Also the justification makes it pretty clear they are not supposed to be read back to back (first is right justified and second is left justified).

	<TEXT> Lockpicking is similiar to Oblivion  (but better) and there are lots of locked chests in the world and also you can break into peoples houses and lockboxes merchants and guilds have. I like breaking into those lockboxes because you need to time it right so that you don't get caught and get bounty.

Pickpocketing is very simple. You sneak behind npc and you have % chance of pickpocketing random item. For example low class npc's (simple fishermen, beggars, etc.) have higher chance of pickpocketing them but they have worse items than higher class people like nobles. There is also a brief time window when you are sneaking behind a npc when your chance goes up 20%. The chance can be increased with passive skills.

I think the justice system is lot of fun, I sometimes spend hours sneaking in towns pickpocketing people and breaking into lockboxes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sauron was a Maiar spirit called Mairon. Maiar are spirits that descended into middle-earth to help Valar (the "gods") to shape the world. Mairon was one of the most powerfull Maia before he was corrupted. He was learning the ways of forging to become great craftsman under study of Aul the Smith. The Dark Lord Morgoth corrupted him into Sauron and he left the Blessed Realms and stayed on middle-earth. 

Why I'm telling you this is that you need to understand that he was not a being of middle-earth, so his powers were many. For example the Maiar could change their form freely instead of having fixed form. Other Maiar in Middle-Earth were the *Istari*, or the Five Wizards. Saurons powers could be compared to the other Maiar on Middle-Earth, Sauron, Radagast and Gandalf for example. But ofc all had their own powers apart from power of Maiar. For example Gandalf was especially skilled in sorcery related to fire because he had the Ring of Power Narya in his possession that he received from Cirdan the Shipwright and Saruman had powers to persuate others to do his will. Saurons sorcery was darker. Also he was skilled in combat and smithing powerfull weapons.

The reason he lost the ring was basicly that he got cocky. After the Last Alliance of Elves and Men had beaten Saurons armies and laid siege on Barad-dr for seven years, he came down to face Elendil and Gil-Galad in duel. But after he had defeated both of them Isildur, son of Elendil, step up and took his fathers sword and cut off the ring from Saurons finger. His physical body was destroyed because nearly all his power was stored in the ring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, the ring of power doesn't work like that. It doesn't give Sauron some kind of forcefield that protects him. The ring enhanced Sauron own power as a Maia but since he didn't have any kind of force field already, the ring didn't give that to him. The main goal when forging The One Ring was exercise control over the other Rings of Power forged by Celebrimbor. 

When forging The One Ring, Sauron concentrated part of his fa, his soul, into it and so he was bound to it. ~~Ofc Sauron was able to take it off himself and he wouldn't die or anything, but Isildur cut off his finger and his power was reduced, allowing the elves and men kill Saurons body.~~ His body was destryed after the ring was lost because most of his force was bound to it. Remembered this wrong.

It is said that the ring enhances persons natural powers. For example it only made Bilbo, Frodo and Smeagol invisible and Hobbits (and Stoor) were naturally sneaky and good at hiding from plain sight. But they couldn't wield its full power. Gandalf refused to even touch it because as Maia, he could have used the ring to it's full potential and it would have corrupted him. Way I understand it, the ring actually doesn't give you any magical powers. 

But I must add that I am no expert on this subject. I have read LOTR trilogy, The Hobbit and Silmarillion,  but there is alot I don't know about middle-earth </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been playing for 2 years and I really like. Don't expect it to be a "skyrim with friends" type of game like most people thought it would be. It is still a mmo. Reason I like it is that it is a lot of fun and to me it still feels like a elder scrolls game. It is fairly true to the lore, has lot of interesting npc's and areas and tries to bring that exploration style gameplay from elder scrolls games. 

You will enjoy it the most if you keep in mind that it is a mmorpg so it plays different than single player rpg's </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To get more AoE you could equip Steel Tornado from DW skill tree and Barrage from bow skill tree. You will become more powerfull in PvP once you level more and get more skills and passives and better gearset. I've seen Nightblade take down 8 people in 4 seconds in PvP.

In terms of survivability most of your healing skills from siphoning skill tree are heal over time, which kinda sucks. One skill you must run is siphoning attacks, that way you never have problems with recources.

Check out GilliamTheRogue on youtube and forums, he has the most amazing nightblade builds </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me Gwent seems much more strategic while Hearthstone was RNG and Pay-to-win. Got sick of that game in a day, same with ES: Legends. But Gwent is great </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will be moving to the dlc's next! Just finished the main game and will buy HoS next. I didn't think I would need at least the lesser glyphs for anything (plus they are really easy to find)

Also I have been selling my crafting mats just the way you said, saving at least 15 of everything. I also have the sword collection if I ever need money. I save them just for sake of saving and I doubt I will never need that lvl 10 unique sword but I'm a hoarder! Most of them are worth 200-1000 so if I ever need money I can easily sell them (once I get B W and start crafting grandmaster gear..) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished crafting my master armor (mix of Wolf and Feline) and was broke. I had 50 gold on my character once I finished up crafting my swords and was thinking about selling my unique weapons from my stash (I got like 50 of them because I'm you classical rpg hoarder) but then I realized that I will never need my lesser glyphs. I already have all my armor and weapons enchanted with greater glyphs so what the hell. I sold all.

Went from 50g to 12,000g. 100 hours to the game I had picked up few glyphs on my travels. This is really easy way to make some extra money. You can also sell normal glyphs if you don't think you'll need them anymore. I saved those, just in case... </TEXT>

My friend recently played trough witcher 3 and it was her first Witcher game and she hadn't read the books and after she said that she should have at least played the second game. She felt a bit lost. But if you already have read the books and are familiar with the world then its not so big issue </TEXT>

If they did put value on gold and silver, did they refine them into coins? Or only jewlery, cups, candelbars and items like that
