	<TEXT> I dunno.  I don't trust statistics from the Bureau of Labor and Statistics.  They say great things about physicists, yet I know from personal experience of unemployed physicists.  Government statistics tend to be delayed compared to word of mouth. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Calorie Restriction Diet and Daily Routine </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-06 17:45:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm on a calorie restriction diet, main goal is to lose a lbs a week and go from 165 to 150 before the end of the year, I'm 5'7" btw.  So far I think it's working, I lost two lbs over the last 10 days with the help of a fitness app.  It's kinda weird, I'm feeling losing weight is mostly mental.  I'm starting to separate the difference between actual hunger, mental stress, and physical stress.  For me physical stress makes me lose my appetite, while mental stress from work is triggering my increased appetite.  

Haven't established an boxing routine though.  It's kinda random, I just shadow box or do sit ups when I feel like it.  Any tips?  Would you guys be interested on weekly updates?  Or should I go under a different reddit thread? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Math PhD Glut? Math degrees and the job market </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-06 17:38:36 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow mathematicians?  I know that immediately after the 2008 recession, graduate degrees of all stripes began to question whether the damage was permanent.  Now that it's 2016, has there been new optimism?  I know getting a professorship is still near impossible, and actuaries are in a glut, too.   But what other industries require math PhD's/masters?  What skills from the math department are most valuable to the job market?  

What jobs are out there for a mathematician?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've realized that there's a limit to human connection.  Even the LGBT community needs letters to discriminate against each other.  Even though I've tried to connect with people on an emotional level, I realized everyone has their limits, even my closest friends.  The online community is just words that pop onto my laptop.  There's no human connection.  So I accept that I'll be lonely.  Love is conditional. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm bisexual.  I've tried dating for 2 years, but got rejected by everyone and haven't gotten a date.  It's damaged my self esteem and confidence a lot.  Now I've decided to concentrate on myself.  I've decided to stop watching porn, change my appearance, and work out.  I feel like I'm not manly enough.  I'm a nerdy bookworm that's very quiet.  I have issues with expressing anger.  I can't find the energy to do anything anymore.  My passion for life has disappeared.  

I thought I was getting better with therapy, but I've regressed.   I've started doing what I wanted, like reading, writing my book, but it hasn't helped.  The next difficult habit i need to maintain is exercise, but I can't even do that.

In fact, I don't think anything I'm doing is helping.  I just want the pain to stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not white.  I live in the middle of the suburbs where LGBT are mostly in the closet.   Heck, even if I removed LGBT people from the equation, my community is not friendly to begin with.  I tried looking at LGBT clubs at my school.  They didn't accept me because I didn't follow the conventional mold.  Other than gay bars, I just don't see finding other LGBT people in my community as realistic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been looking at all these cool tea houses on Youtube.  Sorry, I'm afraid to post the URL because reddit keeps deleting them.  How does one own a tea house or become a tea master?  Is there certification?  How does one find a tea master?  Are there any tea houses in Taiwan that are particularly famous?

Feel free to leave Mandarin English URLs, I can read both. </TEXT>
