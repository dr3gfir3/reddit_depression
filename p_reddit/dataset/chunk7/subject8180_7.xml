	<TEXT> Thats the thing, I only noticed because I started watching a certain kind of video just the day before and since then I have been getting relevant and new videos related to my new interest in content, which is how I realized the recommendation system is not COLLOSSALY fucked up for once

Seriously like I think I watched a video about some dude with tumours on his face from Vice and all I used to get was videos that are supposed to help me deal with cancer </TEXT>
