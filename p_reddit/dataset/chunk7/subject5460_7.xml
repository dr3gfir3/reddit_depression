	<TEXT> I believe a recovery day/day off is essential in a workout especially if you're doing HIIT. I heard in one of Tim Ferris's podcast episodes, about the one minute workout, Martin Gibala was suprised when he saw more progress in the group that gets recovery days (in his study). Here is the link of the [podcast](http://tim.blog/2017/01/23/the-one-minute-workout-designed-by-scientists-dr-martin-gibala/) listen at 27:44.  
  
Note: Sorry if my english is bad and can't explain myself properly. Im still trying to improve my writing and conversation skills, but I hope my answer helps </TEXT>
