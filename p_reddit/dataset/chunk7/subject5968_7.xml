	<TEXT> Consensus?
I know I'm going to finish top 1,500 at least. 
Do I really need to put the effort in the next couple days to get well into the top 1000 to get the Blaze 'Cat?

	<TEXT> agree to disagree. Even in Army training scenarios we don't go anywhere alone. If we are going solo, we have to have that contingency plan like I talked about. 

Same deal with flying; flight plans have to be filed to let people know where you're going, who's going with, when you're leaving, and what time you're arriving. 

Doing anything alone these days is asking for weird/horrific shit to happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a new aviation documentary on Netflix about the origins of the Israeli Air Force.
Flying American made transport aircraft illegally smuggled out of the U.S.A. and second-hand, "spare parts" Czechoslovakian Me109's, about 100 men and women helped save the infant Israeli state from utter destruction in 1948. 
Some great stories in the film and absolutely heroic efforts from ordinary men and women.
Worth watching.

	<TEXT> thank goodness; another musically inclined person! I have a bachelor's in music so I actually understood everything! 

I can vouch for dark churches being extremely unsettling places. I used to be the worship leader at a small baptist church in Arkansas while I was in college. I routinely got to the church early on Sunday mornings and stayed late on Wednesday nights to be able to get my worship set lists together and to set up the stage in the right configuration for however many instrumentalists/vocalists I would be using that week. 

Our sanctuary was probably only about 20 pews deep with a single aisle up the middle, but even though it was a small room, it got absolutely pitch dark at night. Dark to the point that you couldn't see the sound booth in the back left corner of the room when you looked out from the stage. 

One night I'm finishing up coiling cables and moving the drum set and guitar amps and I hear the sound system kick on with a sizzle and hissing noise. Were it not for the fact that I had just turned *off* that system about 10 minutes prior, I would have thought nothing of it. The power switches are in two different locations in the room; one in the storage area behind the stage where the actual amps are, and one in the sound booth completely opposite the stage on the other side of the room. At least 100 yards difference between the two locations. 

So the whole thing hisses to life and I'm standing on the stage like "uhm, what?"

I go back to the sound booth and the whole sound board is lit up with its various LED indicators and as I go to switch it off, this roaring feedback comes blasting out of the house speakers. I mean it really sounded like a freight train mixed with this humming scream behind it. As best I can describe, it was like the "smoke monster" noise from the TV series *Lost* but with a ton more weight behind it.

I flipped the power off in the sound booth and it cut off as quickly as it began. I immediately left through the front doors of the sanctuary and didn't even bother to go back and turn the amps off behind the stage. 

No sir.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ACI since first beta and then a long hiatus until this last month. Currently at Captain #34 I think?

Series wise, I've been playing since the original release of AC2, skipped Electrosphere, and then played the shit out of 4, 5, 0, 6, before giving up on Ass Horizon and it's horse-shittery.  </TEXT>
