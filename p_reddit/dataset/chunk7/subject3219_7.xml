	<TEXT> I firmly believe it can stand on it own against films like, Saving Private Ryan, Enemy at the Gates, Full Metal Jacket, We Were Soldiers, Inglourious Basterds, Platoon, and Black Hawk Down. Not saying it's better than any of those necessarily, however it's just below these choices; clearly making my top 10 favorite war films.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. I had very little interest when the trailer dropped, the "Help me get one more" line is nowhere near as cheesy as it is in the trailer.  </TEXT>
