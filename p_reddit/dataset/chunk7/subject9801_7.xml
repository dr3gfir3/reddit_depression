	<TITLE> Have you or anyone you guys know been denied baptism, denied a temple recommend or excommunicated for confessing to being an illegal immigrant? The interview question about "have you ever committed a crime" makes me wonder. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In the baptism interview, one is asked: "Have you ever committed a crime?" 

For many Hispanic investigators or church members, they are faced with an impossible decision: lie to their church, or be honest and possibly face consequences for the victim-less crime of immigrating illegally. 

If this has happened to you or anyone you'd know, I'd love to hear your story. 


The interview question I'm referring to is most common in baptism interviews, and can be found [here.](http://www.lds4u.com/Discussions/Interview.htm) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No doubt! We got some massive changes into the platform --- however, on other issues, we were ignored. 

There were some things we didn't get massive concessions on --- such as moving towards a system where every state's primary is open (meaning you don't have to be a registered Dem to vote in the primary) and we certainly haven't gained much ground when it comes to getting rid of superdelegates entirely. 

Also, the whole DNC working behind the scenes for Hillary was kind of a massive "fuck you!"  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm here to share what is most likely an unpopular opinion, but hear me out. I've heard so much about "punishing the Dems" and "teaching them a lesson." We need to focus on building bridges and strengthening the resistance, not burning bridges. That doesn't mean foregoing our ideals. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Here is the simple truth: If we do nothing for the next 4 years but focus on punishing the dems for the 2016 primary and teaching them a lesson, Trump will get 8 years instead of 4. 


The Democratic party isn't perfect, not by a long shot, but **change will happen from WITHIN.** Build bridges with your local democrats. Fight where a fight is warranted, but WORK TOGETHER to build a strong resistance. 

Building bridges with the Democrats does not mean giving up our ideals. We still want single payer! We still want tuition free college! We still want Citizens United GONE. 

But we will never accomplish any of those goals if we burn bridges with the democrats and do nothing but alienate and "punish" them for the next 4 years. 

**TL;DR:** The Democrats alienated Bernie supporters. Is that infuriating? **Yes.** In turn, because the Democrats alienated Bernie supporters, they got fucked in the election. If we turn around and alienate them, does that hurt our cause? **Yes!** Work together. Change the party from within. Do not give up on what we're fighting for! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I, unfortunately, am experiencing the slow death of a beloved family member. Hospice has been called in. 

First text I get? Filled with bullshit about how I can be with my family for eternity and that we'll be reunited once again, blah blah fucking blah. 

Death is not an opportunity to emotionally manipulate people into coming back into your fucking cult.

How dare you try to use such a tragic event to your goddamn advantage like that. 


UGH

sorry. I needed a rant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm no advocate for gun control. My point here is the blatant hypocrisy of those on the right. 

"We can't ban guns when 11,000 Americans die every year." 

then...

"But we can totally ban Muslims because 3,000 Americans have died in terrorist attacks since 2001!" 

Like, seriously? We can't ban guns, but we can ban PEOPLE? Are they fucking deranged? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Let me get this straight: 15k Americans died in 2015 due to gun violence, and Trump supporters tell us we can't do anything. But when ~3,000 Americans die due to terrorism in 16 years, they tell us we have to ban Muslims. If we can't ban guns, we sure as hell can't ban PEOPLE. #ICallBullShit </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 15,000 Americans died due to gun violence in 2015. [link.](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34996604)

After sandy hook, Trump supporters told us we couldn't do anything about it. 

After Virginia Tech, Trump supporters told us there was nothing we could do. "Banning guns won't do anything!"

Between 9/11 and now, there have only been around ~3,000 deaths on American soil due to terrorism. [link.](https://www.start.umd.edu/pubs/START_AmericanTerrorismDeaths_FactSheet_Oct2015.pdf) That's 3,000 in 16 years compared to 15,000 gun deaths EVERY YEAR.

They want to tell us that banning PEOPLE is ok, but banning guns isn't? HELL NO.
