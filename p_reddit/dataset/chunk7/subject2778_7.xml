	<TEXT> This is the second emblem I made. I have to say, I really love the emblems idea, and I hope they make improvements to the system as the game progresses. I'd love to see more layers and a few more tools to edit with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys

Does anyone have any more information about how you unlock battlepacks besides levelling up? I would hope that there are alternative ways of earning them besides this, but not disappointed. I'm asking since I just unlocked my first one and wanted to know how the different types are unlocked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you using the airburst right? You're supposed to lock a range (in ADS mode) then fire above it so the grenade explodes behind the range of the locked object (so locking 150m would make it explode at 153m) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd counter the top roof thing with helicopters. You're so exposed on the top roof, so a chopper will wipe you out if you try to camp up there. Never the less, I do agree with it maybe not being a capture area. Makes it difficult to keep. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty excited for Battlefield 4. A lot of that is because of the attention to feedback that the developers have worked on, and it's just making the game look so much better than I expected.  

Second is probably SUPER.HOT. which I played a demo of yesterday and thought the Braid-like elements worked really well. I think it's a fantastic concept that could turn into a great game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys. I recently bought a new bike because my old one would've cost too much to repair. I went with [this](http://www.cycleking.co.uk/AMMACO-MTX-600-ALLOY-FRONT-SUSPENSION-MTB-DISC-BRAKE--21-RAPID-FIRE-8-16-product-300.html) bike. It's mainly for a daily commute which has me on potholed roads for about a mile, and offroad for the rest. Do you guys think I made a good choice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spend about 20-30 a week (roughly $30-40). This is about 80-100 a month. I am single, and I cook one big meal at the start of a week and eat it throughout. I prepare my own lunch for work, and even have money left in that budget for snack things as well. I don't eat poorly, I manage a healthy portion every night with some vegetables. It can be done (though I might be a bit on the cheap side!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Weirdly it had all the downloaded data in the downloading folder, ready to be moved, but wouldn't move it over to the common\Burnout(TM) Paradise The Ultimate Box folder. When it finds all the files on the disk, it re-downloads about 100mb and stops updating. All the folders in the 'common\Burnout(TM) Paradise The Ultimate Box' folder are empty. I tried manually moving it, but it did nothing. </TEXT>
