	<TEXT> Jesus. Pretty pissed off at this point. I ordered two black xl shirts during the wdi sale last year in november i think? Anyway. I look at the tracking one day and see that it had made it to my country (australia), but the most recent update was that it was making its way back to america?! 

I email wedidit and they respond by saying they just got it back and that they will send it out. And here i am. Still waiting for it. Tried tweeting at nick but no response. Also tried emailing again but no response. 

I know they recently got a whole new merch team but there seems to be no difference. Get your fucking shit together!!! So at this point i have sent you guys 60 bucks for what seems to be jack shit. Now i am contemplating whether or not to buy stuff in the next drop.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When you stab an npc and the knife goes into their shirt and no wound appears, just their clothes texture that was there in the first place with maybe a little bit of blood. The wound wont be there at all. Its like shooting a wall, too. In most games, a bullet shot will show up on the wall. How is this any different to a body and a wound or any other interactions? 

Is this technically difficult to overcome? Is something developers/designers think about much? 

Hopefully ive explained it well enough to bring out a discussion. Are there any games that handle this situation well?  </TEXT>

Cant confirm its an official shlohmo remix, probs a little screw from the wdi team that they just play at shows. My guess is that it will never see the light of 320 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, basically just looking for a nice and cheap internet plan that will be used just by me (living downstairs, I dont reach the router very well). iiNet seems to be the leading option with 50gb at $39.95 a month, but, you have to be in a contract for that one. Any other advice/recommendations?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. To an extent, yes. The media must have some idea about this current conception and act upon it. Whether it be through news, advertisements, even television shows. That being said, I do think people are becoming aware of this and doing something about it. Probably the most notable shift is the change to Netflix! Consumers love choice, and Netflix are all about that. 

I agree with you. Now that I have spent some time with the topic itself, I am aware of what information I read and whats garbage and what not.

Definitely tricky putting it into essay format. There is heaps of information about it, though.  </TEXT>
