Right now, only the poor are being slaughtered (the well-off gets a pamphlet describing the perils and punishment for drug use) - what happens then when they start coming for middle-income "drug users and pushers"? (without evidence mind you)

What happens then when they come for one of your wife's kin? Would she still support this lunatic? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obama's administration got a lot done and started. Would have done more if the Republican's weren't hell-bent on obstruction every step of the way.

Progress on various fronts: healthcare, marriage equality, weed legalization, rebooting relationships with Cuba, destabilization of ISIS - just to name a few. We could have thrown in shutting down Guantanamo as well, but it was cockblocked each time it was on the table...

There are some issues that his administration fucked up to: NSA v Snowden is one of the biggest IMO... however all or most of the issues tackled and their approach was progressive and meant to help the country.

Trump's administration on the other hand, just from the looks of his appointments we can easily argue or point as either regressive, self-serving, or both.  </TEXT>
