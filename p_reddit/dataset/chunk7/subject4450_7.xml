	<TEXT> Hello sweet gamers =)
Beside my full time job as a developer,i have crearted my first MMO game on my sparetime.
The game is called Anty and it is a MMO game(in real life) inspired by Tibla and PokemonGo.
its played in real world using geolocation to move around a character with real time collaboration between the players,Monsters and NPCS.
The game is in early alpha,and i would really appreciate feedback from you guys!
