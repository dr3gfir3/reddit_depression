	<TEXT> Fun fact head gear isn't meant to prevent trauma from strikes, its actual purpose is closer to that of a helmet, something to cushion the impact to your head in case you get knocked down or out and hit your head on the floor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> mostly they're referring to Condit's first kick where he doesn't turn his foot at all nor uses his hip to generate the power. 
though it's important to remember as awkward and shit as the kick looks - and it looks awkward af - from memory his game plan was to throw unorthodox strikes, namely kicks, so the shitty kick is kinda forgivable given his intentions. though it is a dreadful kick indeed, 100% :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's sad that a single win can earn a title shot. Granted he has the most recent victory over the champ, its still pretty shitty when short term fun is chosen over long term legitimacy (for the titles*) </TEXT>
