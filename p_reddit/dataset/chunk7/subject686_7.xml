	<TEXT> i noticed that if you sit next to him, he will always get out and run to another car. But he will never enter the same car as before. 
20 minutes later: got bored chasing him on the highway and always pushing him out of every car he sits in :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my bad :D

but yeah, its not that hard if you know what you're getting in-to and prepare a bit. The "humvee" with the minigun is located at the base the lieutenant starts running. If he gets in the "humvee", just sit next to him and he will go out and run to another vehicle  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have played quite a lot and I haven't even touched the surface of the actual missions yet. The game is beautiful, the game is huge, it has diversity on some degree. But when you add co-op in the equation, its fucking awesome. This will bring me and my friends many hours of fun. I couldn't care less about helicopter controls or random bugs at this point. Hat off to you UBI. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi mr Theroux, thank you for taking the time for this AMA.
Are you satisfied how documentary turned out? Would you do anything different. I imagine it was scary making it and its even scarier now, since it got wide audience.

	<TEXT> A young thug was trying to be funny and went on a bus without paying for the ticket (public bus). He sits on the back of the bus, laughing like an idiot. 
But bus driver refused to leave the station without the dumfuck leaving the bus. 
People on the bus got annoyed and the thug went to the bus driver, started to give him shit and telling him to drive. 
Driver doesnt give a shit, stands up. Opens the door, punches the guy in the face and i shit you know, does the "this is sparta kick" and kicks him out of the door.
