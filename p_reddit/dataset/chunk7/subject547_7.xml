I like the opisite sex for reasons..but i don't think that it seems gross to like the same gender, i can tell when someone of the same sex is attractive because i find them attractive but i still think that there's just something about where i fit in that tells me that i do much prefer the opisite sex from myself. Maybe the fact of who you like or identify as has to do with the level of pasionate intentions comimg from your brain and sending to your heart </TEXT>
