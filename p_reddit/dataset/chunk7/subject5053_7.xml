	<TEXT> I was very young so I only can remember one episode..
It was an animated series about a boy and his dog and in one Episode he had a spaceship in wich they would travel to an alternate dimension, where reality was twisted and absurd. The boy loses his dog and finds him later on as he gets arrested for not being weird as all the other creatures, as an officer who should decide over his fate. The parents dont know anything about his space travels </TEXT>
