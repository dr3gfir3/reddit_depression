	<TEXT> This is the same guy that was arrested about a month ago.

An Israeli teenager charged this week with making more than 2,000 hoax bomb threats to schools, Jewish centres, hospitals and airlines in five countries is alleged to have been behind 591 bomb threats against schools in Australia, Victoria police have confirmed.

So it is not another one, it's the same guy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the comments:

On the whole a great video. But you missed some very crucial and important facts.

 You forgot the Transjordan part of the map that WAS included in the land allocation and that many Arabs sold land to Jews before a state was set up.

 You also forgot to mention that Jordan's Occupation of Jerusalem didnt allow any Jews to live in Jerusalem.

 You also forgot to mention the Palestinians have to date had 5 chances to have their own state and declined while the Israelis have always wanted to live in peace and more recently welcomed the two state solution.

 You also forgot to mention what Jordanian army and occupiers did to the holy Jewish sites, graves and synagogues, churches and holy Christian sites. 

 You also forgot to mention that when Israel reoccupied Jerusalem in 67 they wanted to unify it and allowed all people of all faiths to practice and worship there. This still is applied today

 You also forgot to mention that the Palestinians were not just Arabs and many of the Jews and Muslims and Christians who lived there were Palestinian. The currency was the Palestinian pound and Jordanian Dinar. They also had a British flag, Egyptian flag and a Jordanian flag based on the occupiers.

 You forgot to mention that the many of Arabs who lived in Palestine were not originally from Palestine but neighbouring Arab states or original occupiers.

 You forgot to mention the Arab countries view on the PLO, Arafat and the acts of terrorism in Lebanon, Egypt and Jordan resulting in the Shatilla massacre of hundreds of Palestinians from the Lebanese Christian phalangists 

 You also forgot to mention the flourishment of the Muslims and Christians who lived under Zionism/Israel and still are living longer, and have an increasing population in their territories.

 You also forgot to mention that many Palestinians in 1948 left due to advice, pressure and a promise that they could come back after the likes of Jordan, Syria and Egypts leaders waged the war and cleansed the land of Jews. The exact number of Jews forced out, killed and had property stolen from Arab land was around 850,000 and is known as the Jewish Nakba. 

 You forgot to mention many Palestinians who didnt leave of their own accord stayed to fight alongside the Jews and the Jews asked them NOT to leave in 1948. Many who did stay now number over 1,000,000 and are integrated into mainstream society and have the same freedoms as Jews.

 You forgot to mention that the west bank is shared jurisdiction. With Israel not allowing access to many roads or areas and enforcing unfair blockades and checkpoints. 

 You also forgot to mention what Israel does to minimise civilian deaths and what Hamas does to maximise it.

 You also forgot to mention why the security wall and checkpoints were a necessity when the Palestinian government failed to stop or condemn Palestinians running into Israel and murdering its citizens with bombs, shootings and stabbings. Since then there have been no suicide bombings as security had to be increased because of this. (it makes it very difficult for Palestinians to travel freely into Israel but the failure is not on Israels side) the economy of the west bank has been hit by this

 You forgot to mention Egypts part on the blockade (entry, flight and sea) and this is because Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation and has so far shown no interest in working with Israel or Egypt. The unemployment rate cant be solely blamed on Israel or Egypt when Hamas controls all money in and out of Gaza, doesnt build infrastructure or factories for people to work in. Has no sustainable healthcare and doesnt distribute its wealth it gets from donations and fraud. Hamas has created one big concentration camp within the blockade where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer

 You also forgot to mention that more and more Palestinians are getting disillusioned by Hamas and want peace with the Israelis and more and more over the years have moved into Israel and studies show the nearly 2 million Muslims/Palestinians within Israel wouldn't live anywhere else.

 You forgot to mention the Palestinians that work in Israel from the west bank or Gaza numbering around 100,000 are paid and given the same benefits as any Israeli citizen and require this work as Hamas has failed to build a sustainable economy or allow Israelis to travel there freely.

 You forgot to mention that many Israelis are NOT apathetic and do more to encourage peace, build bridges, promote solidarity and coexistence than any of the Palestinians or the Arab countries. 

 You also forgot to mention the lack of the Palestinian peace attempts or their lack of acknowledgement of Israel even in its 1967 borders.

 You also forgot to mention the treatment and lack of rights of Palestinians in Arab countries and the treatment of them over the last 60 years </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a world where it is justified to make 20 resolution and only 2 against syria where there are over 400,000 deaths and over 1 million displaced in just 6 years. This is 10 times more than the entire Israeli-arab conflict and this is a 70 years old conflict. 

There isn't justification or any reason to consider giving 20 anti-Israel resolution while just giving 1 to North Korea, a country that literally has concentration camps and people are facing almost famine. 

Sure, I'm not saying that they can't make resolution against Israel but they need to do it proportionally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can  hate or love Israel but you have to agree that the UN has a absurd anti-Israel bias.

Just like at the numbers of resolutions made in 2016.

	<TEXT> Because is completely arbitrary,  unjustified, biased, and doesn't make any sense.

How is it possible that Israel receives 20 resolution while the Syria civil war only 3 when it has caused over 400,000 deaths and over a million displaced in just 6 years? This is like 10 times more than the entire Israel-arab conflict that has lasted for 70 years. 

Or North Korea? A country that has literal concentration camp and the population is facing famine.

The UN is a joke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Everyone knows Israel is an apartheid regime except the U.S.

No, this is not true. The only people that believes that are people that doesn't know anything about Israel's policies or doens't know what apartheid is.  

[Head of the ICRC delegation to Israel and the Palestinian: Israel Not an Apartheid State ](https://www.algemeiner.com/2017/04/26/red-cross-official-israel-not-an-apartheid-state/)

Similarly, in 2004, Jean-Christophe Rufin, former vice-president of Mdecins Sans Frontires and president of Action Against Hunger, recommended in a report about anti-Semitism commissioned by French Interior Minister Dominique de Villepin[286] that charges of apartheid and racism against Israel be criminalized in France, to the extent they're unjustified.[287][288][289] He wrote that the "perverse" and "defamatory" use of the charge of racism against the very people who were victims of racism "to an unparalleled degree" should be penalized. In his view, the accusations of racism, of apartheid, of Nazism carry grave moral implications and can put in danger the lives of French Jewish citizens.

South African academics Julia I. Bertelsmann and Rhoda Kadalie disagree with the analogy, and believe it is motivated by politics. They say that Israel has been ranked "free" consistently in Freedom House's Freedom in the World rankings, unlike South Africa was during apartheid.[272][318]
