	<TEXT> I think it's worth noting that there are very few wrestlers over 400 lbs. And most male athletes in good shape, especially those over 6ft, can easily squat and deadlift 400 lbs. So any time John Cena "struggles" to life Big Show or Henry or someone like that, it's pretty much total bullshit. Practically every guy on the roster can lift every other guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree entirely. Anyone who dedicated their life to pro wrestling should understand the value of using a real life death in an angle. Do you think Paul Bearer would have objected to the way his death was handled to fuel the Punk and Undertaker feud? He would've loved it. Wrestling is not real life, and no one's feelings should be hurt by a storyline ESPECIALLY when a close family member signs off on it.  </TEXT>

Overall I thought the game was pretty mediocre even back then. The graphics were awesome, the cover mechanic was well done, and I liked the few sections where you could pick whether to take the left path or right path and your partner would take the other one. Beyond that I never really played it again and didn't get any of the sequels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all. This is my first time building a PC. I am switching over from Mac after realizing they are really underpowered for graphic-intensive work. I'm not much of a gamer, but photo and video work is my bread and butter and I am getting into 3D rendering (blender) and motion graphics (after effects) as well. I'm not *completely* sure what I'm doing when picking parts, so I'm hoping you can advise if the below build makes sense or if there are any problems you can see that I will run into. Wouldn't mind knocking a few bucks off the price as well if you see an opportunity. Thanks!

###Build Help/Ready: Help

**Have you read the sidebar and [rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/rules)? (Please do)**

Yes

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

Photo and video editing, along with motion graphics and light 3D rendering (I'm new to it). Gaming is nice but not a big priority.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, framerate, game settings)**

Medium or low settings are fine with me. I mostly play older games anyway.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Around $1200

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**EDIT:** After receiving some advice and doing more research, here is a revised build using a Ryzen CPU and a lower-end GPU. This allowed me to up the internal storage while still staying under $1200. Please give me your thoughts on it!
