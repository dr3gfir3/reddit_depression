I sent it in and they did some "upgrades" no receipt or copy of a target to show they shot it like I get with other companies. Installed a new trigger and spring set. Still off. So I took the trigger and springs out just in case. Still off. I haven't bothered contacting them again yet since I've been busy with other stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which bathroom to use isn't a rights issue. And since it wasn't an issue until Democrats brought it up they weren't fighting for anyone's rights lol.  
  
It was always about the work marriage. Maybe you're too young to remember what was going on at the time.  
  
The plan sucks. My rates have gone up sense it's creation. All it really did was offset people having to get their own insurance, specifically kids out of school up to 26. Fuck them. Stop buying stupid shit and get healthcare.  
  
It's all about costs currently. And the only thing done about it was a symbolic gesture by Obama to stop federal private prisons. Democrats still don't give actual shit about it private prisons since we still have tons.  
  
I'm only talking about politicians. I haven't talked about constituents once. As I stated you don't even know about the reality of the situation. Talking about Congressional Republicans. Go read the hill. Even they point that out. Geez you really are politically illiterate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't be such a fallacy creator. But those politicians either wanted this to be an issue or were too dumb to know it would become one. Either way they are shitting on people that just want to use whatever bathroom they wanted.   
  
I can solve the marriage one. Stop calling it that. Marriage can be reserved for religion but just call all "marriages" civil unions as a legal term and then it's done. That's all they had to do.  
  
Republicans are for healthcare. Just not a federal one since the 90s. You do know that ACA is a shitty version of Nixoncare right?  
  
Plenty of Democrats were for private prisons. Only recently have a mass number of people given a shit. No one paid attention for decades even though quite a few documentaries have been made about it. I think the one by Michael Moore if I'm not mistaken was one that really made it a popular issue.  
  
You know that most republicans opose the white house hint at a doj crackdown of recreational marijuana right? Oh no? That's because you clearly don't actually follow any of these issues and instead seem like a regressive liberal. Worst than the tea party.  </TEXT>

I didn't even make that "assertion" as you like to say. Your ABC diagrams you've tried to make are a little off as well because of wording as well. If you're asking me to debate the position that modern people aren't to be blamed for their ancestors from over 150 years ago sure, they weren't alive then and could not affect the outcome one way or the other even through household debate or voting. If you're asking about moral superiority then you can argue that people against slavery at the time were superior to those that advocate slavery. So in effect modern Americans who are against slavery hold the hire moral ground of their ancestors and are therefore morally superior. Work on your writing. Laters! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the downvote but your comment above seemed intelligent. My point is most people do not still consider the Germans Nazis.   
  
Side note I have met people from places like Denmark which refuse to buy anything German or spend money there and won't even stop for gas there, the lingering anger is there still.
  
But the Nazis were worse and way closer, but when Germans talk about human rights no one goes, "you killed so many people with so little activity against it that clearly you're all as guilty and will be for a millennia."  So to bash America for having slaves well before any of us was born, after having relatives fight and die in the civil war, or even back further when there were small battles like in Kansas and Missouri is ignorant of the fact we had free blacks for a long time as well. Not saying that makes it ok. But you can't blame modern people for the decisions that were made before even most of their great grandparents were born. How far back do we need to go for forgiveness?  
  
Like Japan, most of the world doesn't hold their WW2 and earlier evils as their main thing. Well the Chinese do.  </TEXT>

Also the ACA and Mass' healthcare law come from Nixons healthcare act he suggested. Hillary is a neo con. So a bunch of authoritarians would vote for her. She's not a liberal either.

	<TEXT> Lol yea it is. Read they're comments. They're morons. If they had any sense they wouldn't have disagreed that the president is on call and they wouldn't disagree he can handle any situation from air force one. They disagreed that weekend people working would decide to contact someone like the chief of staff and then the president. They have no fucking idea how the white house functions. Same people called hiring a new staff a coup when every president does it. They're ignorant of the real world and politics. You don't have to like Trump, lots of people hated Bush especially during the second term. Lots hated Obama. But not once do I recall hiring your staff being called a coup from the top. They think Trump can't tell a joke in a room. Everything he says is literal. Same mindset slammed Hillary for saying America is great because America is good. I heard it and went ah, Americans are good and that's what makes America great. I wasn't like oh what a retard! People are shitting these extreme viewpoints that logic can't beat since they don't care for the truth. Welcome to reddit son.  </TEXT>

It's ridiculous that people on here actually believe the president needs to be at the white house. He doesn't have to be present.
