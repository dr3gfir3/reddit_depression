	<TEXT> To address this first we must see and accept that not all pizza is alike. There are at least four different varieties within walking distance of me as I write this. The two big styles are New York and Chicago. New York (as I have been lead to believe) focuses on larger slices with a varying style of sauce. Chicago Style or Deep Dish has many layers to its chasm crust. But one can not simply say there are only two types of pizza, for in New York there are many styles of pizza that do not fall under the New York design. In Chicago there are Pizza Huts and other non-deep dish establishments. Which brings it to another style: American Take Out Style Pizza. This includes (but is not limited to) Papa John's, Pizza Hut, Domino's, Little Ceaser's and several various chained and non-chained stores, most offering delivery. In American Style Take Out Pizza there are varying styles of Deep Dish, New York, and of course, thin crust. Thin Crust pizza can be excluded from this debate of sandwiches and pies since, with its crunch, could hardly be considered either and more resembles a chip. I will, however, include Frozen Service Pizza, as its malleable crust (dependent on how the cooled treat is heated) can add a small puncture to one side of the argument of sandwich and pies. There is also the dread-devil franchise known as Cici's which offers something that resembles pizza for mass consumption from renegade feasters, alas, this is not pizza, but heaps of nightmare inducing, pizza flavored rubbish.
We must take a second to look at the definitions of: sandwich, pie, pizza and pragmatic (because I don't know what this word means. The amazing wizards of the world web have brought me an astute declaration of what defines a pizza: "a dish of Italian origin consisting of a flat, round base of dough baked with a topping of tomato sauce and cheese, typically with added meat or vegetables." I will tell you as my father told me on his death bed, "Remember the tomatoes." Unlike me, you will get closure; thusly like me, you will feel relieved to not be in the presence of such arrogance when the time you've been praying for finally comes. A pie is considered to be, "a baked dish of fruit, or meat and vegetables, typically with a top and base of pastry." Well, well well, what do we have here? An amazing discovery! It's almost as if I'm 9 years again and have just discovered you can do more than scratch your crotch! Meat! Meat can be used in pies; though this may not be quite a discovery to some, I've sailed through the aisles of grocers and wondered why someone would label a filled meat discus as "Pot Pie" when surely they did not come in a pot! Nor can I relinquish the thought that a grilled bread with cheese sandwich is commonly referred to as "Grilled Cheese" HA! More like a melt cheese sandwich! What is a sandwich? "An item of food consisting of two pieces of bread with meat, cheese, or other filling between them, eaten as a light meal." The plot thickens as we see that the same fillings for sandwiches are also used in both pizzas AND pies! Unfathomable! Yet, there it is, nano details in a sea of google.
And so u/gregbard as you sing your final tune of infuriating joy, you are wondering, no doubt, as to whether pizza is a sandwich or pie. Let us take a look at Deep Dish first: Pastry top, yes, meat and vegetables, yes, now if you stretch the truth (as I know you bards love to do) then you can see the similarities between Deep Dish and pie; for they are both deep and full of meat; as I would often find my ex lover; though I suppose such is the life when you love a sausage enthusiast. Now let us turn our attention towards the less pragmatic view. A sandwich must be between two pieces of bread; there you have it, pizza can never be a sandwich unless it is bread pizza which makes the argument pro sandwich invalid because bread pizza is bread with pizza; or pizza with bread, HA! Can you imagine putting small bits of bread on to a pizza!? To make pizza in to a sandwich you must put bread on both sides of it. Hardly an appetizing meal, though I have not partaken in the herbs, so this may prove to be tasteful in an altered state of mind. The argument that you may fold the pizza, as most New Yorkers do, and call it a sandwich is plain ludicrous! I can not fold a burrito and call it a sandwich; I can not fold a taquito and refer to my new broken taquito as a sandwich; I can not even fold a piece of bread and call it a sandwich, I may only call it a pathetic attempt at master snadwichery. For, as stated before, there is no further defining feature of a sandwich then being between two pieces of bread. But there is a spot of light at the end of this debate! It is a bit pragmatic, Greg, but perhaps, not too pragmatic for you, a master of the oral tradition!
For you see, there is a second definition of sandwich! I have hidden it from you in order to reduce confusion. The second definition reads: "insert or squeeze (someone or something) between two other people or things, typically in a restricted space or so as to be uncomfortable." Well hello license to vernacular! Since this particular definition of the word is a verb (action word) you may not properly call anything that is not between two pieces of bread a sandwich, but in reference you may say that you "sandwiched" something. You may sandwich cheese between two tortillas and call it a cheese sandwiched between two tortillas (the locals of Mexico call this a quesadilla in their vernacular); you may sandwich a cookie between two other cookies and you may excitedly observe, "A sandwiched cookie," but in no way is it a cookie sandwich; you may even place meat and vegetables between two pieces of bread and say that you have sandwiched a snack for yourself in the form of a sandwich! I'm sure you understand that language changes from day to day, iirc. The verb "sandwich" replaced the noun "sandwich" in our vernacular. Just as pizza, pie (and although I've never heard it used) sandwich, can be considered all the same thing from one region to another. It's most likely a store or person started calling pizza "pie" at one point and language scholars said, "Sick! This sounds like a radical new phenomenon, calling pizza, pies! We shall inc. this in our talking skills since it's a hot subject that seems cool!"
And they did, Greg, and they did.

You have such a well written and thoughtful response. The mods over at askculinary locked commenting on it. So I deleted it and reposted it over at /r/cooking . I think you should post this response over there.
I don't think you've totally nailed the analysis, as there is such a thing as an open-faced sandwich. A better counter-example would be the existence of calzones to disprove the sandwich hypothesis.
I hadn't considered the practice of folding pizza. They call it the "Brooklyn Bend" and it didn't used to be popular outside of the East Coast. But it definitely supports the sandwich view.
The verb "sandwich" replaced the noun "sandwich" in our vernacular.
People who verb their nouns just floor me.  

To add further dispute there is the argument of an open-faced sandwich and the alluring calzone. An open faced sandwich is still between two pieces of bread, there is simply one removed piece of bread. It would be highly silly to refer to the afore'd cookie creation as an open sandwiched cookie, it simply two cookies stacked on top of each other. Now the calzone! There is a creation that seems as though you are eating the creating life force itself! Just as we are thrust upon this earth kicking and screaming into the face of danger, cheese, sauce and meat or vegetables are thrust into the one's mouth at dangerous temperatures, all pleasurable. Is a calzone a sandwich? Or in this case, a sandwich? Neigh, I say! For there is not any way for the insides to escape before providing a hole with your organic chewing devices. Can a burrito be a sandwich? No! Therefore a calzone can not be a sandwich; but if you sandwiched a calzone between two pizzas it would be a sandwich'.  

Hereto goo sir! What a lovely query! I grew gayer by the minute in attempting to answer you, oh singing one.  

In an attempt to hide my faults, I have edited a word! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work out at home and noticed that I needed to bring my body weight workouts to the next level. My weight was decreasing but my muscles had plateaued. I read about how water is great for working out. The beach is near me, but it's stupid to swim without a buddy. So what's the best way to get to the water with minimal chances of dying? A pool! FUCK! I thought to myself. I have no access to a free pool, nor do I wish to pay money to go to a large public restroom pool. I looked around my apartment, a gallon of water was there. Quickly I began to research if using water jugs would help or hinder my goal of building muscles. There were water weights you can use in the pool:  

http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/fitness/strength-training/6-upper-body-exercises-with-water-weights.html  

"...your movements are both assisted by the waters buoyancy and resisted by the waters drag. Some muscles pull against the water as you move in one direction and different muscles push against it to move the opposite direction." is heard in this article:  http://healthyliving.azcentral.com/water-aerobics-good-weight-lifting-19735.html  

Okay, that's great! So lifting weights IN water helps. But what about lifting WATER itself?  

As you can see by the [amount of water lifting weights] (https://www.swimoutlet.com/resistance-dumbbells-c10930/) there IS a way to use water to gain a bit of muscle and a lot of definition. The use of gallon jugs eliminates the need for a pool and expensive equipment. You are still getting the water resistance but you are able to stay dry (except for sweat!). You shouldn't be convinced by my anecdotal evidence. I'll provide a link below that I came across in my research to use water as weights:  

http://www.livestrong.com/article/455265-can-i-use-water-bottles-as-dumbbells/  

From the article we read: "Gallon Jug  

Lift gallon-sized water bottles for greater resistance during strength-training exercises. A gallon container may weigh approximately 8 pounds when full of water. If you fill the bottle with dirt or sand, you increase the weight to approximately 13 pounds. The weight of a gallon jug is not equally distributed when you use it for exercises such as arm curls, chest presses or back pull-ins. This uneven weight brings the added benefit of strengthening your smaller, stabilizing muscles, which are engaged to maintain control of the bottle."  

[This wikihow article comes to mind as well](http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Homemade-Weight-Set) when discussing homemade weights. A lot of the weights are made using water. [Better Homes and Garden has an article for smaller weights] (http://www.bhg.com/health-family/fitness/workouts-programs/simple-water-bottle-workout/) [There are actually many other things you can use.](http://hbfit.com/no-weights-no-problem-8-household-items-you-can-use-for-your-next-workout/) I was just relaying what I've actually seen results with in order to help OP. There are also several workout videos on YouTube that help guide you how to workout using water bottles as weight:  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6bB0U12KSA  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0iBAgIDvXk  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FAHURkgFRTg  

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NuL0b4rQ5E  

If you don't understand after this then I'm concerned for your future and baffled as to how you learned how to get here on your own =D

	<TEXT> I want to see Goldberg carry a jackhammer over one shoulder and a spear over the other, when he gets to the ring he raises them and they shoot fire!!!   

I want to see New Day tossing ice cream trucks into the crowd!!!  

I want to see Bray Wyatt climb out of the ashes of his burned down house and run to the ring with an intense dislike for Orton.  

I want to see Randy Orton come out in a straight jacket and a wheelchair.  

I want Becky Lynch to fly in on her wings.  

I want Roman Reigns to break through a fist that is breaking a wall shaped like his fist!!! Super Duper Punch! Style!!!  

I want Bayley to walk in from the discount aisle.  

I want The Miz to walk in from the Hollywood sign and say all the lines from his movies and talk shows!!!  

I want John Cena to fly in on a Bald Eagle, carrying Nikki Bella under one arm, his shirt torn and his shorts in tatters because he's been defending America, he should climb on the announcers table and shoot blanks to get attention, ten hut! And he also finds the courage to marry Nikki!!!  

I want Seth Rollins to carry blueprints of a cross on his back like a cape and juggle three cans of pedigree dog food that he uses later in the match to slam that wicked Hunter (or should I say Paul's) face in and bellow out his catchphrase!!! He IS NOT the game!!!  

I want Triple H to have a video package of him walking through the catacombs and he's not lost but searching, then he finds a skull that looks like Seth and he laughs and crushes it as Stephanie energises on the ramp and somehow the sand from the skull is there with her and she throws it then...Now down to the bow down to the King!!! And Triple H slides from the giant skull and cross hammers he's erected just in time for His other music, and Stephanie is carried on his shoulders and they both spit water doing the stretchy arm pose!!!  

I want Jericho to have walls in front of him, then he breaks them down with his list and walks out with his original list of 1001 holds taped to the back of the United States title and he goes to read it!!!! But....  

Kevin Owens (KO) comes out and he has his list of 1002 names and they all say Jericho!!!! And they wave their list in the air and read them intensely at each other!!!  

I want AJ Styles to come from the tailor, but he didn't get a full suit! Just a tuxedo for his forearm!!!! But in the same complex....  

I want Shane O Mac to be lacing up his Jordans and see Styles and smirk! That will show him!!! Then ALL of Shane McMahon sneakers are lined on the ramp and he walks down and admires them all but AJ Styles hits him with his WM forearm! And Shane falls 30 feet!!!!  

I want Undertaker to come out under water to Caribbean music! He will start his new Legends gimmick that night as he steals sodas, drinks and parents from children and he is now known as Under the Sea Taker!!!  

TL;DR: The Usos! They should have something special to cement their first heel title reign!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WWE missed the ball on this one. Instead of a classic for the Universal Title; we get two guys who've shown their ass on the biggest stage of them all. They could have had Goldberg work mid-card level, do the EXACT same thing with Jericho and the US title and have the two guys that charisma forgot feud over the mid-card title; while the two workhorses feud over the big one and take the main event to the moon and back. Instead we're going to get big guy spear or big guy suplex. I'm still going to be hyped for both matches, just saying they could be a little nicer to their full time employees. </TEXT>
