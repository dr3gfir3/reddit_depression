	<TEXT> When speaking English, I use their first name with no honorific. Regardless of seniority or any other factor. Just because that's how it is done in English.

When speaking Japanese, I always use their surname+san. With close friends, I just use their first name or whatever nickname they may have. 

Although of course, even with friends, if you are in a work or formal situation, it is best to revert back to surname+san. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> "Had been" grammar question. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, blow in here, first time poster looking for some help as I've recently began learning French again.

I'm aware of using "have been" in French. E.g.
"a fait 5 ans que je parle franais." (I have been speaking French for 5 years.)

Using the above structure, if I'm referring to a past event, do I conjugate "a fait" or the present tense verb? 

E.g.
"I had been studying French for 5 years at that time".
" ce moment, a a fait 5 ans que je parle franais"?
Or
" ce moment, a fait 5 ans que j'ai parl franais."?

Apologies if both  my examples are incorrect and this is a basic question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its the same as Koube  (Kobe) and Oosaka  (Osaka). Like mentioned already, using the extra vowel length is redundant in English. 

It's  simply because that's how it's spelt in Japanese! 

It's quite common really with Japanese words used in English.  Take Judo and Jyuudou as an extreme example.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am familiar with the term (to mean century. For example 4 is the 4th century. However, when it comes to BC, how is this expressed in Japanese? For example if I want to say 5th century BC; or 2000 years BC?  </TEXT>

Thank you for the information regarding  and other words. I'll try track down a native speaker through my circle of friends, explain the situation, and see can they give a more specific wording. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply. The business card will look as such:

NAME
Director   (Japanese)   (I'm guessing). 

He deals with Japanese and Chinese clients so we need both Japanese and mandarin. 
As for  being vague, the company name will be also featured on the card, so this might make it ok? 

A friend told me to use  Gngs dngsh. The internet says different, and reddit also says even more differentererer. What do you think? </TEXT>
