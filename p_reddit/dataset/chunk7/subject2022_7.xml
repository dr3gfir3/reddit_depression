	<TEXT> So, I don't know much about DD other than the 2003 movie and the show. That said, it's pretty clear that he won't kill in the show no matter what. Which brings up the question...what will he do once Wilson Fisk is out of prison? Surely he can't beat him up again and send him back, it's obvious that won't work. The only way for DD to deal with Kingpin this time would to either a) kill him or b) beat the fuck outta  him and send him far away, out of NYC, somehow

Thoughts? </TEXT>
