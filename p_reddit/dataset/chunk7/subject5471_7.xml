	<TEXT> I would jump into GR but the way I like reading author's work is more like hanging out in the shallow end and then progressively getting into the deep end of a pool. I like picking up a gradual rhythm.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love HST too and have read almost all of his published work. However, I found Hell's Angels a lot different than all his other work. It shows pre-living fast HST's writing which is kinda boring imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a beautiful story. "Consider the Lobster and Other Essays" was the book I read during the week preceding and following my Grandfather's funeral. It kept me mildly upbeat the whole time.
I have also talked to a few authors such as Matthew Thomas (We are Not Ourselves), James McBride (The Color of Water), and Lord Matthew Riddley (he has his own books but Richard Dawkins and Hitchens shout him out a lot). They all are genuinely nice people. I thought they'd be pretentious but I was proven wrong.

	<TEXT> I have been running around forums and discussions for the last hour trying to find advice on what order to read Pynchon following Lot 49. I am almost done with L49 and love it. I have heard that Vineland, and Inherent Vice are good next stops. But I am interested also in V and Mason Dixon. So Where should I go next? Thanks ahead of time!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice for reading Pynchon post-Lot 49 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I am almost finished with The Crying of Lot 49 and I love it. Now I need help with my course of action following my finishing of Lot 49. I had read so many different forums and subreddit discussions about what order to read Pynchon. Most of them offer 2 paths: 1. Pre-GR, GR, then post GR 2. Post-GR then V then GR. I am so confused. So I am asking you wonderful people where I should go next (side note: my copy of Inherit Vice is at my other place so I can't read it right away; so please not recommendations of that one). Thanks ahead of time!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Crying of Lot 49, by Thomas Pynchon** 

**Purgatorio, by Dante Alighieri** 

Decided to dive into postmodernist literature.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I resorted to ordering them (I choose the Penguin Classics Deluxe Editions and for the final 2 books I did the Modern Library editions) online. But then a week after they arrived my local Barnes and Noble had a complete set. And then I went to another local used bookstore and they had most of the volumes. I also would say that since they are huge volumes that many people choose not to read because of their length and "drollness" they aren't exactly the best money makers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recommend the 5% or 10% a day method. I follow it until I get absorbed enough in the book to where I want to read more than just 5-10%. If the book becomes boring you can go back to the original method. You feel like you are accomplishing something everyday.  </TEXT>
