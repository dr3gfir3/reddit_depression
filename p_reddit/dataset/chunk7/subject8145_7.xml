	<TEXT> In these stories, black women get to be more than just platonic friends and trusted advisers. They are more than just cogs in the wheel to keep the story moving, and they get to sin and come back from it, with rich and complex redemption arcs. They also get to be playful and fun, and flawed. 

Also, shout out to Walking Dead! 

Here's the story the writer gives a shout out to in the article: [Lemonade](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/11948791/1/Lemonade) - "a Richonne drama loosely based on the 2016 Beyonc album of the same name" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I solely listen to audiobooks during my commute. I just got a Bose speaker, so I have been known to listen to audiobooks while I'm showering. The other time is right before I go to bed, but I never move forward in the book listening before bed, because I fall asleep so quickly that way. 

So a side tip would be to listen to an audiobook if you have trouble falling asleep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Anyways". 

I really liked Amy Schumer's book but she would talk about something and then transition to another thing by saying "Anyways, ... " 

And sometimes it wasnt even a transition between thoughts! She just threw in an "Anyways, ... " at the start of a sentence that was continuing the thought of the previous sentence before it. 


This other book I'm listening to (Haunting of the Moor, an Irish Ghost Story) does the same thing. Except it's not written by a early 30's blonde female. It's set in the 19th century and I still hear "Anyways ... " in the middle of the Irish folklore. Anyways, it's like literary nails on the chalkboard  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Spoilers] Finished The Vegetarian by Han Kang. Can someone help me tie it all together? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-14 16:52:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just finished The Vegetarian by Han Kang. And I get the basic plot points of what happened. But I was curious if someone had a good link to a blog that could tie it all together. Particularly the last chapter ... 

- Did In Hye abandon her child? 
- Was it to show that In Hye was almost as damaged as her sister? 
- Was In Hye meant to be symbolized by the bird or am I grasping too much? If so, what does it mean when Heong yi (? I forgot her name) was in the fountain eating the bird? 
- Why did she want to be a tree so much? Was it all "just" a reaction to her abuse as a child? 

I feel like such an idiot right now 

Is there a post or Cliffs Notes about The Vegetarian somewhere? halp.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was probably one of my favorite scenes from last night. Sometimes I feel like Rick and Michonne are like that kind of couple who likes to pay bills together and just go through the motions of life together. But last night Rick opened up to her and that made it seem like they had a good connection. 

I do have one question, what was Rick's reasoning for bringing up Shane to talk about why he's rolling over for the Saviors? I deleted it off my DVR and I cant remember how he jumped from the Saviors to Shane!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IIRC yoga is male dominated in the east. To really even start in the yoga asana, most people have to "master" the breathing and meditation. 

In the west, yoga (in practice) is mainly the postures with very little meditation. I think women being naturally more flexible are more apt to practice yoga than, say, rugby. And men really aren't used to being in "the back of the class" so to speak. 

And it's weird bc there was a time where ppl like shiva rae went back to the east and led classes on the new western style of yoga.

	<TEXT> I read so many dry, technical books for my chemistry major during college that I was just burned out from reading. And the idea of reading for pleasure had not crossed my mind as a "proper" adult because the last time I had read books for pleasure I was reading Fear Street and Sweet Valley High. 

So I know it sounds like a silly thing ... but picking up "reading for pleasure" was a distinct moment for me too thanks to college.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just keep thinking of GoT and Reek/Bolton dynamic with Daryl and Negan. I dont think Daryl will EVER get to Reek level bc, for one, I just dont think TWD has the balls (heh) to do that to the "hero" that always does "badass" things with his badass friends. I would hate to see Daryl pull a Carol and do something COMPLETELY badass bc I think that brings the show to the hokey side a little bit and brings me out of the immersion experience of watching a tv show bc things are just a little TOO unreal. Walkers and rotters? Yeah, I believe that. Having someone lose their friends and locked up in a cell for a few days eating dog food and executing a perfect asskicking an episode or two later? Nooooo that cant happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Coldest Girl in Coldtown, by: Holly Black, narrated by: Christine Lakin**

This has music in it every now and then, which is odd. But not completely offputting. 

I really like the narrator. She reminds me of Nina Dobrev's voice. 

And this is some type of YA vampire book. Tana is the main character and she meets up with a seemingly powerful vampire, her boyfriend that might be changing into a vampire, and 2 "edgy" bloggers who really want to be vampires. They are heading to this place that's like the Las Vegas for vampires and vampire-lovers called Coldtown. But once you go in, it's very difficult to legally leave. 

It's fun.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Vampires in the Lemon Grove, by Karen Russell**

Short stories by the woman who wrote Swamplandia. The first story was about vampires who quench their bloodlust by biting lemons. This is my book.

**The Vegetarian, by Han Kang**

I just finished the first portion. A woman becomes vegetarian and it *really* frustrates her husband. Now I'm into the 2nd portion and we've moved onto her brother in law who works for a k-pop group and he's got a great idea for a new art project. Reading this one on my iPhone which is a completely different reading experience! I feel like I'm always trying to look around the corner bc the "page flips" are so short. 

**Coldest Girl in Coldtown, by by Holly Black**

A teenager thinks she's been infected by vampirism. It's a fun ride so far. Im listening to it on audiobook from the library.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Vegetarian, by Han Kang**

My library had this one as an ebook. My Kindle is missing at the moment so I'm reading it off my iPhone bc it's a fairly short book it seems. Reading off a phone is different bc the page turns are so short! I'm already swiping and I've yet to read the last line or so from the previous screen. But I finished The Vegetarian and am starting Mongolian Mark so I'm about a third of the way through. 

**Thirteen Reasons Why, by Jay Asher**

Finished this on audiobook. I'm on the fence about this one. I dont think it accurately portrays suicide among teens. Clay, the main kid, is unrealistically nice. And I got annoyed that Clay would stop the tapes all the time and interrupt Hannah (this was probably because I was on audiobook since there were two narrators). But it seemed like he'd be like "I stopped the tapes. I remember Billy Bob walking down the halls. I start the tape. [Hannah resumes talking]" COOL STORY CLAY TELL ME MORE

**Coldest Girl in Coldtown, by Holly Black**

I just downloaded this. Audiobook. So I have no clue yet but let me know if you've read it and what you thought! </TEXT>

I feel like 3 stars dont really say anything. 5 stars are either too long, the reviewer got the book for free, and/or they don't really say anything. And 1 stars are the type of reviewers (like on amazon) where a person complains about a product for something completely unrelated - i.e. "UPS never delivered the package!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished Thirteen Reasons Why on audiobook. I have a few issues with the book but i dont regret reading it. I dont think it accurately portrays suicide in teens and I think the main character is a little bit too good to be true - so it pulls me out of the story. plus, he's always interrupting the flow of the tapes to be like "I stop the tape. I remember seeing billy bob in the hall one time. I start the tape." But again, I was on audiobook, so they had to switch narrators every time he stopped the tape and interrupted the Hannah narrator.  </TEXT>

It seems so silly to discount 90% of a book based on an ending. i thought the ending was fine anyways. I hate when books put out a big mystery and don't tell you what happened. But this book did that. I would definitely check this movie out if it happens!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you feel about Chandler Riggs? I feel like with the younger actors, we don't really know how they'll flesh out (heh) as an older actor. When you're an adult, you're pretty stable in your abilities. But Chandler started the show so young. And it seems as if the show is just stuck with him. 

Do you think Chandler Riggs can handle the weight of his role? Does he pull you out of the immersive experience of watching a tv show? Do you like what we have? Or would you be okay with an actor switch to push the acting abilities to another level for the Carl character?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have access to a regular gym, so I have been going there and doing leg curls, back extensions and a low row machine they have. And I generally find I dont wake up with a sore tight back in the morning. 

When they have KBS in the workout, I basically follow similar logic. If it's a high rep swing (like 100+), I will go light and/or reduce the reps (our gym has a novice version of workouts with less reps typically). I would have times during the swings where it felt like just my back was gassed. Very weak and tired feeling. 

Ive gone light with no issue, so I wanted to start going up again since I've been working on my posterior with the strength training and I havent felt any tiredness in my back with KBS recently. 

One chiro told me I was quad dominant (and he was like, it's the curse of the crossfitter, keeps him in business, yada yada). And my current guy has given me workouts with bands to strengthen certain parts of my core. Initially, I feel like the posterior work has been helping a lot with tightness in my back in the morning, and I don't know why. So I'm continuing to do the posterior work even though the new guy isnt really telling me to do so. It cant hurt, right? 

So when my gym programs squats, I might do good mornings or hip thrusts. When they do deadlifts, I'll do RDLs. I'll do hip thrusts ... And then I'll go to the other gym for the back ext and leg curls (I'm already there teaching a group fitness class anyways and it takes like 15 minutes). 

edit: And I have been focusing on squeezing the right stuff when I do swings. I think that's the whole point of the posterior work ... to maybe turn those "on" so I'm not so reliant on my quads doing cleans, snatches, squats, et?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Thirteen Reasons Why, by Jay Asher, Narrated by Debra Wiseman and Joel Johnstone**

This is a YA novel. A boy receives some cassette tapes in the mail. He starts listening to them and finds out they originate from a classmate who committed suicide. If you receive the tapes, you were one of the reasons why she committed suicide. 

It's a library book. I'm not wow'ed by the book so I'm glad I didn't pay for it! But I'm also not the target demographic either. And I'm about 50% of the way through.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FUN AND NOT SERIOUS RECOMMEND: If you like thrillers, I like You by Caroline Kepnes. It's fresh and fun. This stalker guy works at a bookstore and finds his next "target". It's told from his viewpoint and he's an acidic, but kind of intelligent, guy. And then towards the end you're like ... why do I kind of like this stalker guy? bc he tends to have more personality than the girls that he's after ... 

Movies that are from books might be fun bc you can do dinner and a movie afterwards - Gone Girl, Girl on the Train ... 

I'm sure other people have serious recommendations. I just think a fun book is easier to get most of your group to read it! 

But you can also search for books that have questions to go along with the book. I feel like a lot of Jodi Picoult books have questions at the end to start discussions for book clubs. 

edit: Also Big Little Lies by Lianne Moriarty! Reese Witherspoon is starting an HBO miniseries based on the book.

	<TEXT> **Girl with the Lower Back Tattoo, by Amy Schumer**

This one came available from my library, so I put down what I was currently reading and started this one. I think it's funny and if you like Mindy Kaling, Tina Fey and Amy Poehler, why would you not like this? The person that had this book before me was eating chocolate (I hope) bc there are brown smudges on the first few chapters. But I don't think they finished the book bc I haven't come across another smudge since the third chapter. Amy dissects her journal entries, talks about her dad (he has MS, which means he shit his pants a few times), and reminisced about her earlier shoplifting experiences. I've laughed out loud a few times. 

**Before the Fall, by Noah Hawley**

Just finished this one. Great writing and well-paced. Super well-paced, I don't think I ever got bored reading it. If endings can piss you off, I'd stay away. But I loved the journey. Book Set-up: Private jet crashes, only survivors are a painter and a 4-year old boy/heir to bazillions of dollars.

	<TEXT> My library needs to reorganize its shelves. I feel like it goes like this

Books for sale/new releases - large print/mystery thrillers - young adult with the nonfiction in front - a large aisle - biog - the rest of nonfiction with fiction behind it - the remainder of fiction with the reference in front of it. 

i feel like they had a system that worked for awhile then they kept getting new books and they just need to reshelve and make it a little less confusing.

	<TEXT> I just updated a fic I havent updated in over a year! I feel so bad for my readers. 

But it's a walking dead rick/beth fic. And I'm GOING to finish it. 

So this chapter was Rick teaching Beth how to fight zombies. It was titled "Two Rules" and he teaches her to Run and Hide. And then he's going to take her back to Glenn and Maggie. 

But then the NEXT chapter, they're going to run across a zombie and he's going to go ahead and teach her the third rule, which is FIGHT. And she's going to be capable in killing a zombie. And THEN they're going to go back to eat with Glenn and Maggie and go to sleep. This is the calm before the storm. I'm going to have to convincingly separate Beth and Rick from Maggie and Glenn so their story can continue. 

The show airs on the 23rd so I should really try to put something out there by Friday. But I dont know if I can put something "quality" out by then.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a fan of series so much anymore. 

I don't like when the first book of three ends on a cliffhanger. I thought I was getting a complete story, not a part 1! That's how I felt about kingkiller chronicles. I just felt like I didnt get a complete story.  

With standalones, I can get a beginning, middle and end 3 times over or I can read a long epic where the writer might not be that great. I like to start what I finish, so if I read book 2 of 3, I almost feel obligated to read the last one! So when I pick up a 3-parter, I think long and hard if I want this to be my book experience for the next months. 

edit: on the flipside, a lot of these series are more likely to become the next GoT or tv show, so I start to eye them when I hear that pop buzz surrounding them. I dont know if that makes me shallow but whateverrrrr </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Audiobooks are a great option! 

I go through the library a lot and use overdrive. The app is horrible but the books are free. 

I also have an audible account. I started on the two books a month plan to build my library. But now I'm on the every other month plan bc I have such a backlog of audiobooks. Try it out free first! Audible has a very good customer service. 

If you use the library, I have a difficult time getting through anything over 11, 12 hours with my 20 minute commute. So I wouldnt get a 33 hour book on your first go! 

Check out r/audiobooks and r/audible for suggestions and the like. There are some books where the audio-version really complements the storytelling!  </TEXT>

I listen in 15-30 minute spurts during my commute. Sometimes I have to speed up the narrator if they're a little sluggish ... But I add about 5 -8 books to my read pile from audiobooks.
