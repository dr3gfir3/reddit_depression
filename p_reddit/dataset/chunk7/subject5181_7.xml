	<TEXT> I'm not sure it's possible to write an actual good frum novel - there are too many constraints on what you can say so invariably it's going to come across as stitled and unnatural. But there are two authors who I thought didn't do too badly - Rachel Pomerantz and Ruthie Pearlman. 

There are Israeli authors who might be okay, but it's impossible to tell because the translations are bad.

You should go for it! After all, you should never write a novel in the hopes that it will be published. I see this a lot in /r/writing. People coming in and saying, I have an idea for a novel, where do I get it published? People often answer, but I'm always like, stop putting the cart before the horse. </TEXT>

Never heard of these authors.

Catch-22 is highly emotional despite its satirical tone. Most good war novels are. Maybe you don't find too many male authors who write about emotion in the same *way* that women do, but it's still there. 

And of course it doesn't make sense to compare, say, a hard-boiled detective novel with a romance novel. Naturally the expectations for emotional levels will be different.

ETA: I have Regeneration by Pat Barker on my to-read list. It's clearly meant to be emotional as it's about "confronting the psychological effects of World War I" but I wish I'd read it already to see if it feels so very different than something a man would have written. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The vast majority of American Jews are non-Orthodox (90%).

From the article. This is the reason why:

For the Israelis, Lev Ari explains, the local Jewish communities are perceived as different in their customs and in their activities, and there are many cultural differences. When the Israelis were asked whom they felt more similar to, the answer was local Americans, not Jews. The Israelis felt this was the Diaspora Jewry, and they were unfamiliar with all the feelings of Jewish communities in the Diaspora, like the feeling of a minority and dealing with anti-Semitism. They were not used to being a minority or labeled Jews. </TEXT>
