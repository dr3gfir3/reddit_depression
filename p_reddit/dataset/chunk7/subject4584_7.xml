	<TEXT> Been there, done that. ICE doesn't care about some little burg in S. Florida. They say they don't have the resources to do those kinds of raids. They are concentrating their efforts on employers who hire illegals. And this was 10 years ago, so yeah -- nothing ever changes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I'll fight for legal immigrants all day long. People who come over here just to have kids and think that will give them the right to stay -- not so much. People who come over on special visas so big business can get cheaper labor -- not at all. People who come over on educational visas and take financial aid away from natural or naturalized citizens -- nuh-uh, never. Families who come over on visitor visas and never leave while working under the table for low wages -- not those either.

Legal immigrants -- sure, come on in, make yourself at home, but don't start dealing drugs and working under the table for lower wages to cheat our citizens out of jobs. Not all of them do, mind you, but if even ONE does, they and their employers should be punished. Obey our laws, or get the fuck out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I guess the solution would actually be to cut off all financial aid to non-citizens. I've never understood why we give it to them anyway. I understand giving WIC and food stamps to children, because they are helpless, but there should be no aid given to anyone who is not either a natural or naturalized citizen over the age of 18, and then only if they are still in high school. 

I know that makes me sound like a Republican, but I'm really sort of fiscally conservative, and do believe in taking care of our own first. I just don't go as batshit crazy about it as the Trumpites do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As all illegals should, especially the Caribbeean (mostly Jamaican) drug gangs in S. Florida. I'm all for legal immigration, but getting one person over here, then bringing in family on visitor visas who never leave has to stop. This is actually how most illegals get here, not running across the border from Mexico. They fly into airports every day. I don't know the solution that wouldn't cost billions of dollars to make it work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And what is wrong with giving our own citizens a larger piece of the educational pie? That's a huge part of the H1B argument, that we don't have enough educated and skilled people here. I agree with giving American citizens preference in college admissions. Don't they have any decent colleges overseas these people can go to? I'm honestly with Trump on this one. Give those slots to OUR best and brightest. My son lost out on a full-ride scholarship to college because it was given to an Asian girl. They even told him that they had to give it to her because of minority quotas. He got another one, but he had to reapply every year. Luckily, he's pretty smart, so he got it renewed every year and got through college. You know what that Asian girl did with HER education? Went into an arranged marriage and moved back to her country, so the U.S. got no benefit from that. 

We have too many kids who cannot go to college now, or end up in debt for the rest of their lives. They deserve priority in admissions at least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived in a town that was literally overrun by eastern Europeans, most of them illegal. They'd get one person into the country, then bring over the entire family on visitor visas. They would go to work under the table as housekeepers, yard men, and the wealthier of them ran drugs and gambling rings. There is one large neighborhood they call "Little Ukraine" and the part of town with the most drugs was called "Little Russia." They took over whole neighborhoods, and ran them into the ground. That's just one place. Russian gangs and the Russian mafia are known to be the most vicious and brutal of all. </TEXT>

I remember one Christmas there was a report that Irish mothers were telling their kids that Santa was killed in the war because they had no money to give them gifts. And you think the Irish love the British? No fucking way. They don't even like the Scottish too much, who also tried to steal their country, or the Nordic states who also tried to steal their country. Shit, everyone wanted Ireland. Now it's a divided country like Germany was after WWII.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember that this country was largely settled by the British who have always hated the Irish to some extent or another, for some odd reason. They didn't want the Micks coming in ruining the good thing they had going. I think it's because the British have no sense of humor and the Irish are fun-loving. You didn't see England stepping in to save the starving Irish during the potato famine, did you? No. They would have let them all starve and laughed about it. ETA: Admittedly, I'm not studied in the politics of that era, or any really.

Our British allies are not so innocent of racism either. What do you think Brexit is about? It started as a protest against the huge influx of Indians (since India used to be a British colony), now it's any other European that isn't English who has crossed borders during the EU days to take their jobs. Hell, they even hate the Welsh and the Cornish. 

Point being, they brought all that prejudice over here with them, and passed it down to future generations. 

The world is full of hatred, but mostly full of fear. We fear what we don't know. Even I, one of the least racist people you will ever know, feel uncomfortable when I'm around people speaking another language, but that's my problem. Doesn't mean I hate them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe you're too young to remember, but back when the lottery was first instituted, it was found that the government was running a scam by saying that the proceeds went to "supplement" education funds, when in fact, instead of supplementing those funds, they were taking away education money from General funds and supplanting it with lottery money. Where was that money going? To pay for legislators' earmarked special projects. It was a national scandal, and the reason my home state of SC did not get the lottery passed the first time. Nobody trusted those crooks in the SC legislature not to do the same thing to them, which they did when it finally did get passed.

Remember that although we don't have personal income tax, our gas tax is around $.55 per gallon (one of the top 10 in the nation), so they are getting their money somehow. There are more people with DLs than there are who own cars, so I'm thinking the increased renewal fee is making up for a bit of the registration decrease. 

I guess the whole state isn't a scam, but overall, it's a pretty scammy state. I love the weather, though, so I'll just pay that sunshine tax and keep on truckin'.  </TEXT>

My lease here says 3 days, but they give permission for visiting relatives to stay longer, but not forever. My son came and stayed for a week, no problem. On the other hand, someone here got permission for 4 related adults, a child an 3 dogs to live in a 2BR apartment, but I think it was supposed to be temporary until one of the adults could find a job.

	<TEXT> Exactly. I think she hates him, and who can blame her. I wonder what he has on her that keeps her there? Well, other than the money, and probably the threat of taking her son. At this point, I don't think any court would give Barron to him, because it's obvious he's mentally unbalanced. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SERIOUSLY? Any group of people who control both the financial industry and the media industry have the President under their thumbs. They can collapse the economy at any time they want. 

Trump was on Palestine's side until the Israelis took him aside and made it clear whose side he would be on. Does no one remember that? 

When Iraq invaded Kuwait, we bombed the shit out of them, but Israel is CONTINUALLY invading Palestine, and the world does nothing. WHY? Because "he who controls the money, controls the world," that's why.

Israel is one of the most criminal states in the entire world, yet they have us by the purse strings, so we don't care at all. No wonder the entire middle east hates them so much. It's not anti-semitism. It's because they are bullies who have the U.S. by the balls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My younger son was born in 1985, and he was raised largely without internet and certainly without cell phones. He was raised on OTA t.v., Blockbuster and going to the library. He honestly wasn't even interested in my computer (I'd had one since he was two). He didn't go right to college, choosing to "find" himself first, which took awhile. He took I think 6 years to get his degree, having to drop out a few times to earn money. He chose to be a tech engineer because he could make the most money doing that, but ended up loving it. He isn't on IG or snapchat, but he is glad I now have a smartphone and can text him. He doesn't hang out a lot on FB, isn't on Twitter and prefers to go to LinkedIn to make business and social connections. 

I guess you could say he's sort of a Millenial/Gen-X hybrid, since he grew up in the 90s. People who came of age in the 90s are just different, that's all there is to it. They are nothing like the young millenials. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Truest words spoken in a long time. I don't hate Indians, but I'm all for reigning in H1B visas. It has nothing to do with race, it has to do with fairness to American workers. 

Of course, the Mexican thing is different, because very few Americans want the jobs they have, so I don't know why we don't just give them work permits and let them come on over.  </TEXT>
