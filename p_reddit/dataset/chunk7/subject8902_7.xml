	<TEXT> Horford just played the free agent game like a master. The two teams that stayed in contention the longest were two teams Atlanta is very concerned about staying ahead of. We faced Boston these last playoffs and it was close as well as the Wizards in the previous playoffs. 

Bravo.  </TEXT>
