	<TEXT> My condolences, man. I have a good idea of what it must have been like.

My grandfather had it too. He got lost in the neighborhood a couple of times. He eventually forgot every one. He once smashed the sink into pieces with a hammer. He ultimately even forgot how to eat. When he was being fed through a tube, some of the food got into his lungs, and that was it. 

Before dementia, my grandfather was like the father to me that his son wasn't. He used to take me to work with him. He bought me my first computer, a Commodore 64. I wish he would have been able to see me now as a responsible adult, for I gave him a lot of headaches being a knucklehead when I was in high school. 

He was the kind of guy who visited as many members of his family that he could. He helped his daughters buy their first house. A great guy that got along with everybody. 

Take care; thanks for sharing.  </TEXT>

As you noted, he has no power to determine what is legal. Further, with most states having legalized marijuana in some form, and the billions of dollars and over 100K jobs that the marijuana industry is pumping into the economy, he *is* indeed powerless. Regardless of how he feels about marijuana, he understands he is unable to stand adamantly in opposition to popular opinion and the citizenry's liberty if he wants to lead a successful career working in government.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes; looking at it that way, I probably judged too soon. Having been in a flood, I know how quick you may have to react if you don't want to end up waving rags on top of your roof so the rescue choppers could see you. 

I probably just reflected on the fact that although I love dogs (I was raised with one), I do not own one because my kids already consume so much of my free time.  Hence I prefer not to own one for I wouldn't have the time to walk it and play with it as much I should. That said I figured that if you can't care enough to save a dog that you should treat as part of the family, then you should not own one.

However, as you wrote, there are situations where human life must be prioritized at a moment's notice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My older boy, 9, especially, is like that, and my 6-year-old is following suit. They're heavy into games and web stuff. The older one has always been narrowly focused on vehicles, mainly cars. He looks at them real closely and analyzes every feature of his Hot Wheels and Cars Movie characters. If he saw a phone or a car-shaped object, he would lean pennies against it to make it look like a car. 

Until now, people are very impressed with both of my boys' knowledge of cars and topics in which they're are really interested. They can articulate topics that I only know a little bit about. Perhaps your toddler is going be the same way. 

The bad side is that they don't want to go outside. I want them to also be at least partially athletic, so they can be healthy humans. But with the information that they consume on how bad food and sedentary habits hurt humans, I think they'll eventually come around to being more active. I made them watch Super Size Me yesterday, and my older one wants to eat salad.

As long as your toddler is safe in his room, I would let him focus on what he wants. You'll be amazed at what he will come up with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The photographing and mirror tip resonates with me. I just came back from a trip overseas where I was taking video selfies each time I ate something. I typically eat whatever I want when on vacation, for my meals mainly consist of meat, fruit, and veggies for health issues. I got more concerned with looking at myself to ensure that I didn't have food in my teeth when I smiled and filming the next shot, nonetheless, that I didn't eat as much as I do when I go off of my regular diet. 

I don't think the red plate tactic works for me though. My wife typically serves my food on a red plate that is mostly reserved for me, and I still feel hungry sometimes when I empty it. I do work out though and am generally an active person, so that probably explains my increased appetite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a little ["internet battle scenario"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJbeHslFiKk). I am sure these lions have seen this happen more than a few times. I am unable to find the video; but I did see where some zoologists were scolding the tribes people for killing off too many lions. 

Humans are the most lethal creature on the planet because of our use of tools. If you're like me from a city, we may not be much of a match for these lions; however, these hunter gatherers are accustomed to having to deal with these animals like people in New York City have to kill mice. If they have to work at it every day for decades, they're going to be pretty efficient lion hunters, and the lions must know that. Why else would they go in armed if it was solely walking upright that made them jet? 

Edit: Further if they have been convinced that killing lions does not benefit the overall environment (perhaps to prevent over population of animals that are prey), they probably just steal food non-violently to avoid killing them.  </TEXT>
