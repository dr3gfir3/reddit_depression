	<TEXT> The most pressing business is government funding: The House and Senate have until midnight Friday to cut a trillion-dollar spending deal to prevent a partial government shutdown on President Trump's 100th day in office.

While bipartisan negotiations continue on Capitol Hill, Trump is driving a hard bargain, insisting on money to begin construction on a border wall and boost defense spending.

Democrats insist they won't support a downpayment on the Southwest border wall, and are pushing back against Trump's threat of stopping key federal subsidy payments to health insurers under Obamacare. </TEXT>

Xavier Jugel, 37, was one of hundreds of officers deployed to the Bataclan as militants massacred 90 people with guns and suicide vests.

	<TEXT> A specter is haunting Republican candidates: The specter of Nancy Pelosi. Six-and-a-half years after the party wiped out the Democrats House majority, the 77-year old Californian has become the only constant in Republican campaign ads. Last week, in Kansas, Democrats fell seven points short of an upset in a House race; this week, in Georgia, Democrats won the first round of a congressional race that they hoped to win outright.

In both cases, Republican voters were woken up with images of Pelosi the way a hero in a B-movie is woken up by a bucket of water being thrown at his face. The National Republican Congressional Committees ads in Kansas tied Democrat James Thompson to Pelosis agenda of higher taxes and Obamacare. The Congressional Leadership Funds ads in Georgia painted Democrat Jon Ossoff as a Pelosi enabler, too. </TEXT>

Now, they are all Democratic targets next year because of the suburban makeup of their districts. Previously they ran as independent checks against a Democratic president whose popularity wavered in those regions, but now they must choose sides: defend  or distance themselves from  Trump. </TEXT>

The House of Commons backed the PM by a margin of 522 votes to 13, above the two-thirds majority needed, as Labour and the Lib Dems supported the move.

	<TEXT> Sure, they avoided the calamity of an outright loss in Tuesdays special election in Georgia, advancing to a runoff race in two months to replace the new health secretary, Tom Price. And when lawmakers return next week, House Speaker Paul D. Ryans first order of business will be to swear in the newest House Republican, Ron Estes, after his special election win in Kansas last week.

But both races gave Republicans a scare they never would have anticipated six months ago  and demonstrated that Democrats have galvanized the anti-Trump activism of the past three months into votes at the ballot box. Even though Democrats came up short in each race, these were seats way down the list of top Democratic targets. This was particularly true of the Estes race, in a district where Trump won by an overwhelming margin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One source may be the statistic popularized a few years ago, most prominently by GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney, that 47 percent of tax-filing households have no net federal income tax liability. While accurate, this is often misremembered as applying to taxes in general, implying that there is a substantial non-taxpaying class.

In my survey research, I have found that Republicans are much more likely than Democrats to estimate the taxpaying population at around 50 percent. A third of Republicans pick an estimate between 40 and 60 percent, compared to only a fifth of Democrats. On average, Republicans thought about 62 percent of the U.S. adult population pays taxes  but even among Democratic respondents, the average estimate of the taxpaying population was 71 percent of U.S. adults. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Russia arrests two suspected 'terrorist' recruiters
Two suspected recruiters of "terrorists" from Central Asia were arrested in Saint Petersburg, justice authorities said on Saturday, in connection with a deadly bomb attack on the Russian city's metro. One suspect, aged 32, is accused of recruiting for the Islamic State group, while the other, aged 39, faces allegations of being a recruiter for "terrorist organisations in Syria". One of the two is from the Osh region of Kyrgyzstan, an area known for the number of recruits it has provided for Islamic State in Syria and Iraq. Fourteen people died and dozens were injured in the April 3 blast which has been blamed on 22-year-old Akbarjon Djalilov, thought to be a Russian national born in Kyrgyzstan, who died in the blast. There has been no claim of responsibility for the attack but investigators say they are probing possible links to Islamic State jihadists. Eight people -- all from mainly Muslim Central Asia -- have been detained in Moscow and Saint Petersburg over alleged involvement in the attack. As of the beginning of April, police in St Petersburg had arrested seven nationals of Central Asian countries on suspicion of being "terrorist" recruiters. (AFP) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Guardian has been told the FBI and the CIA were slow to appreciate the extensive nature of contacts between Trumps team and Moscow ahead of the US election. This was in part due to US law that prohibits US agencies from examining the private communications of American citizens without warrants. They are trained not to do this, the source stressed.

It looks like the [US] agencies were asleep, the source added. They [the European agencies] were saying: There are contacts going on between people close to Mr Trump and people we believe are Russian intelligence agents. You should be wary of this.

The message was: Watch out. Theres something not right here.

According to one account, GCHQs then head, Robert Hannigan, passed material in summer 2016 to the CIA chief, John Brennan. The matter was deemed so sensitive it was handled at director level. After an initially slow start, Brennan used GCHQ information and intelligence from other partners to launch a major inter-agency investigation.

In late August and September Brennan gave a series of classified briefings to the Gang of Eight, the top-ranking Democratic and Republican leaders in the House and Senate. He told them the agency had evidence the Kremlin might be trying to help Trump to win the presidency, the New York Times reported.

One person familiar with the matter said Brennan did not reveal sources but made reference to the fact that Americas intelligence allies had provided information. Trump subsequently learned of GCHQs role, the person said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Later, Trump said he asked Stoltenberg to look into collecting back-dues from countries, something that Stoltenberg did not verbally agree to do. Trump has consistently misrepresented the financial obligations of NATO members, saying they owe vast sums in dues and the situation is unfair to the United States. NATO members do not owe dues or back payments.

Trump also thanked NATO members for condemning Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons and the barbaric killing of small and helpless children and babies. At one point, Trump referred to the Syrian leader as a butcher.

On Wednesday, Trump backed away from several other firm positions that he had held for months on the campaign trail. Early in the day, the government ended a federal government hiring freeze that Trump had promised to institute, although departments have been told to find other ways to shrink staff sizes. Then, in an interview with the Wall Street Journal, the president announced he no longer considers China a currency manipulator, he now supports lower interest rates and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, and he would consider renominating Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen when her tenure is up next year, despite saying on the campaign trail he would most likely not reappoint her.

Last week, Trump abandoned his longtime stance that the United States should not get involved with Syria when he approved a strike on an airbase there.

I felt we had to do something about it, Trump said Wednesday of the Syria bombing. I have absolutely no doubt we did the right thing. And it was very, very successfully done, as you well know. </TEXT>

He backed down a threat to brand China a currency manipulator.
How Trump came to love NATO
In another reversal, Trump praised Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whom he had previously pledged to replace when her term expires, and once accused of holding interest rates low as a political boost for former President Barack Obama.
It was not clear whether Trump's sudden policy flips were the product of a new outlook and worldview. But previous presidents have often remarked that the world looks a lot different from the Oval Office than from a campaign rally. </TEXT>
