I see alot of low levels non prestiged players with less than 100 kills, a few plants and next to none defuses, WAY higher than me on leader boards. Also, under position, why TF, do I only see %? I hate that. Tell me my position #. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My gripe with " kicked for inactivity " in zombies. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-26 20:48:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before anyone gets on my case and says " it's perfect now, because it deters key farming ", here me out. I think the algorithm/code is TOO sensitive. Sometimes my little brother as well as cousins, come over and the only form of entertainment they enjoy is zombies because they think it's " cool " AND IT IS. but they just want to run around and have fun. Granted they can't kill a zombie if their life depend on it and they enjoy talking on mic. ( they're not the type to use profanity), however the game thinks they're key farming and kicks them out because they're not " involved enough in the game ". People here might say it's fine the way it is because they'd rather not shitty players as a teammate and I strongly agree, but I'm just here to voice my opinion and let IW know that I think they kind of went overboard on the sensitivity. Thanks for reading.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I " heard " that completing all mission teams grants around 8k or so in salvage. I'm aware every MS around certain levels grants 150 to 300. Adding up all 4 mission teams does NOT add up to around 8k in salvage. However, im like 2000xp away from completing my final mission team. After I completed my final and reach level 50....does the game award me any salvage for completion of all 4 teams or just what was received from grinding out all? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> LPT - How to RANK UP FAST in DROPZONE! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-20 22:50:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With the introduction of drop zone, comes many opportunities for ranking up tremendously. First thing you need to do is create a class, I use ghost+blind eye, along with cold-blooded. Use any other perks you want. The reason for this is to keep you protected from air and ground scorestreaks. Secondly, by now, most of you will have a variation of a mark2 weapon. Of course, this grants an extra 15% or xp per kill. If you don't have any mark2, use the Volk-greed or if possible the Volk variant with the mo money perk. Thirdly, use the spartan launcher. With your class protecting you from air and ground streaks, you shouldn't have any issues taking out streaks. This game mode will almost have streaks up 80% of the time. ( it's the whole point of dropzone ) . If you have a point left over, equip a lethal grenade. This will clear out dropzones. And lastly, use Warfighter rig with the combat focus payload, this grants extra score while getting your streaks faster as well. You can use uav   cuav only. With only 2 streaks, you get em faster and you'll always have uav and cuav countering enemies that might get an AUAV in a care package. I hope this thread helps many of you rank up quicker. Enjoy everyone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no coding for bad players. If i tie a rubber band around my controller,  the game thinks I'm moving and assume I'm a shitty 5 yrs old kid. How can coding stop this. And besides , what about the genuine players that just wants to spin around like a headless chicken,  IW can't BAN them because they think they're manipulating the game with rubber bands just because they're spinning around shooting because they would be loosing players. 
People paid for the game and are entitled to player however they want privately or publicly. Hence , nothing can be done about this. This also irritates me because I encounter this all the time, but I've made my peace with it and just find new lobbies.  </TEXT>

We should get one!! Or screw make it a 30 GS and have us call in a MOAB. Lol jk. Just give us the non de-atomizer fancy animated calling card. We want to be cool too.  </TEXT>

Thats all i need in a gun. And i mostly use smgs. Any gun is great in the hands of a skilled player though.. Nothing needs to be done about the nv4. I slay good players that use them. I even have the ebr800 bomber, its a 1 shot kill. I dont even use it. People hate when i use it, in fact... Ive seen many posts here about it being a beast of a weapon, no one has mentioned to nerf it though. Get over it. Girls are funny. 

Stop crying, grow a pair... Equip an nv4 and go kill some motherfuckers.  </TEXT>

* aw - greenband, comeback, solar
* bo3 - combine, evac, fringe 

Note: they had the right idea in ghosts to being back the original favela as a dlc, but they already messed up because no one wanted to play that game to begin with much less buy a dlc for 1 map. 

Note 2: why do this when they already reimagine fan fav maps? Because they suck at reimagining maps. No reimagine map has ever had the same nostalgic feeling. Perfect example, terminal in IW, EVERY TIME I RESPAWN, I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THE **** I AM. Secondly, they come as dlc, people hardly buys dlc nowadays.

Note 3: why should activision waste money on bringing back old maps in a playlist form instead of dlc and probably no one will play the shipped maps. First, who cares if people play shipped maps or not, if the crossover playlist is heavly populated and the game sells, thats all that matters. Secondly, give the people this playlist and dlc will sell. 


If guns can come in the form of dlc, i dont see why a crossover playlist cant be implemented. People will say it wont work because its different studios and different codes, colors ect.... Oh please, you better believe if activision wants this to happen, itl happen. All these studios are puppets and activision holds the string.

	<TEXT> This dude thunder is a big hypocrite because he complains about sweats day in and day out and yet his gameplays are sweaty AF. 360 C4 N SHIT. Problem is, he wants to be the ONLY tryhard in his lobby. If he sees someone else play like him, he lables them as a try hard, sweaty, gfuel mlg no life. Look at his gameplays, this guy sweats so bad, wingsofredemption probably smelled better than him when he was 1v1ing syndicate on bog.  </TEXT>
