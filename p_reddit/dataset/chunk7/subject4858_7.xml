	<TEXT> Authoritarianism can be the opposite of fascist. If I was hard left I could say prostitution and porn are forms of oppression because it is impossible to volunteer because those involved are oppressed and unable to make free choices, like the poor. In fact the only way will be to liberate the masses from the paradigm of enforced exchange of labour ie capitalism etc etc. But you have your view, your buzzwords and no doubt a community of like minded people to reflect your opinions back to you. You clearly have no real knowledge of the UK if you think it is in danger of becoming a nazi country. It would be like me watching the trump election and the red states and declaring the USA about to become a fascist christian theocracy and women are about to become the chattals of men and homemakers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has nothing to do with right wing fascism. It is just authoritarianism and can be equally left wing. Not mentioned is that much of the antiporn stuff has come from the left and womens rights groups opposed to "odd" porn like extreme penetration etc in fact there is a whole viewpoint within feminism that porn is exploitation and the objectification of women. But this view is simultaneously held with the opposing view that porn is good, own your sexuality etc because unlike the view of facebook, feminism is a fairly broad philosophy and when you get into details there is substantial variation. A lot of this came about from growing anti porn pressure during the Blair years and politicians like Harriet Harman, who is arguably not left wing is certainly not right wing fascist. </TEXT>

Nigeria is a rich country and many many people have more money than you could dream of. You seem to just view it as "Africa" the poor oppressed etc etc NO wonder Africans get pissed of with the world view of their multi-country continent.
Nigeria is a regional superpower has a developed economy and they are not just the corporate puppet slaves of evil western overlords. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Murder in Scotland gets you a life sentence which is usually around 8-12 years in jail if no crazy circumstances like sex or torture, then you are subject to control by the govt for the rest of your life. Culpable homicide gets you an 8 - 12 year sentence which in some cases means 3 years in jail then out on probation till sentence ends. It is not a life sentence. But the key thing is it is very much cheaper for the govt. Most people will take the plea so no expensive trial costs, much shorter jail costs and a big tick in the win column for the state. All good except there are suspicions that some cases are being plead out when they should be tried for murder and the killers are out in 3 or 4 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A panel of random people selected by lottery who run the companies for a maximum of 1 year then new randoms come in. They don't get paid, only expenses and are happy to do it as their duty to society. Plus before the panels of random people take over you spend a year breaking up the corporations into more local smaller entities owned by the local councils. Workers would move to areas that need workers because of their civic duties. Local councils would be elected. Elections would be approved by a local representative who has proved his civic reliability. The local representative would make sure the capitalist oppressors do not sneak back in and the people remain free. Local reps would report up a chain of regional reps. Obviously everyone who loves America will do this happily for the good of the nation. If you don't, you hate America, freedom and the future of our children. Those are not the best kind of people but regional reps will convince them to help the real Americans. I will obviously oversee all this and help secure happiness and purpose for all Americans. I will wait for the buzzfeed poll to decide if Fatherland or Motherland sounds better. Future policies will fallout from that decision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened during the Blair years in the UK. White working class areas that had always voted Labour began to have more and more immigrants arrive and settle in the areas. The government lied again and again about the numbers of immigrants coming in. The locals could see the govt was lying but if they said anything they were called bigots/racist which immediately shut down their right to have an opinion and the debate. The problem was it was the truth on the ground and when the Govt gave the locals the brush off they turned to anti immigrant groups. Immigrants numbers did cause problems and did make local services worse because the national government was not funding the councils for the newly arrived populations. It wasn't until local labour councils began saying openly there were too many migrants for their services that the problem was addressed. Margret Hodge (local Labour MP) went door to door and fought the far right candidates in elections and when the working class locals were spoken to as humans and their concerns taken seriously the support for the far right evaporated. 

In Scotland there is far far less immigration and pressure on local services is for different reasons but still the local working class areas were taken for granted by the Labour machine in power for decades, there was real shock when overnight the SNP gutted Labour Scotland. 

People don't like being taken for granted and even if they work in a warehouse or shop they can tell when they are being patronised or spoken to condescendingly. Left wing or right wing, much of the voting is anti-establishment and should be a wake up call to the political class to reengage and listen to all voters not just each other and people like themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No context to larger Sunni (Saudi, Gulf states etc) vs Shia (Iran) struggle for regional dominance. See how the Syrian conflict fits into Lebanon, Hamas, Hezbollah, Yeman and the ongoing issues in Iraq. One of the interesting reports from the conflict showing how deep and long this has been going on for in the region was when ISIS attacked and fought with armed Palestinians aligned to Assad because it was the remnants of the left wing socialist terror/freedom groups in the 70s and 80s think Black september/PFLP, refugees from Islamist takeover of the Palestinian struggle. </TEXT>
