	<TEXT> We know it was more heavily focussed on family, and likely followed younger children (luke/leias children or grandchildren, preteen aged probably).  He said that, conceptually, that the first trilogy (1-3) is political in nature, the second is personal, and the third is spiritual.  His earliest notes from the 70s would have featured Luke as an Obi Wan type figure.

Kathleen Kennedy says that his stories were a jumping off point for development of the sequel trilogy, and all of the films in development (except for rogue one) are based on his basic treatments. Lucas was invited to be a member of the production team, writing the story and being on the story team, but was uncomfortable with the lack of total control over the end product (he would have been a prominent voice, but still just 1 voice among several). 

So basically, we don't know for sure, but it likely had Luke introduced much earlier (much like the the early drafts for episode 7) and featured younger characters as the leads (potentially characters that became rey and finn, but skywalkers) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Grades are a big indicator is success in college, and college helps you to get a better job (if you want an office role of any sort, college is a good way to get into basic things)

grades you earn are mostly reliant on ass licking and how much your teacher likes you, more than on actual performance anyways

This was not my experience. Grades are normally objective, based on test performance and homework completion

Usally people will hire you on your experience+college courses and not on your grades.

maybe. Having good grades can make an impact when it comes down to securing internships, which is how you get that experience. Saying you graduated magna cum laude with 3 internships is a lot better than graduating with neither of those </TEXT>

But it was pretty cool. People were def excited, lots of advance ticket sales, even some people camping out. but not the level of hype there is now. For one, the end was obvious, NPR had a spoiler filled review playing while I was driven to the theater to see the movie, and nobody really cared. 

Hype seems to have been higher in different markets, but by the time episode 3 came around, older fans felt kind of burned </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it could be worse, but I worry that you're going to end up with some some strain on traffic if you pack that industrial area too tight.  Basically right now there is only one way for people to get to work, through that avenue, and everyone taking a left turn there is going to cause congestion very quickly. Move your industry up a bit, maybe have a major road run perpendicularly through it and the other major red road to give more transport options </TEXT>

	<TEXT> do the best cops generally not follow procedure?

the events, as I understand them were

1). starbucks complains there is a man passed out in a park
2). first cops determine it isnt a threat
3). people complain that the passed out man is still there
4). Manney arrives, decides to frisk the passed out man (not procedure)
5). the schizophrenic man freaks out, because someone is touching him. gets violent
6) Hamilton is shot

so yes, the shooting was justified, but the events leading to it were not handled correctly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I said milwaukee doesnt have stop and frisk.  Its mainly NYC that has a problem with it. lol

The punishment should fit the crime. If you're out with your friends stealing cars you should be locked up and then put on probation. Innocent people shouldn't suffer nor should all the kids in the city who are not out stealing cars. You act like it's the honor student making a mistake due to peer pressure. It's not. It's kids who did it once and will do it again if let off easy. Life has consequences and when you're young there's too much opportunity through MPS and other groups around town to be out making bad decisions like that.

Do you want the city to have worse gang problems?  Because this is how you get worse gang problems.

I dont know the solution, but I know that throwing kids in jail isnt going to help. We need more in the way of rehabbing JDs, otherwise we will have a much worse crime problem 10-15 years from now.  </TEXT>

I'm curious what your solution is.  When we have minors committing crimes, we need to find ways to get them out of the system and becoming functional adults. Throwing them in jail could make it much worse. 

stop and frisk

is blatant racial discrimination in the districts that practice it. Mostly NYC </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope C:S2 doesnt take a decade. I mean, I love C:S, but I definitly feel like the game suffers some things on a base level (the way buildings level up, for instance) that will limit its shelf life.  DLC can only add so much unless they go back and make some real base changes.

But yeah, plot sizes are too small.  No country estates will spawn, no massive (realistic) farms.

Corner buildings are inconsitant with 90 degree angles, and virtually nonexistant without them

	<TEXT> Just because they eventually lost the fighting doesn't mean their ideology was inferior

Had it been superior, it would have gained more traction outside of the Axis. Naziism has always been a minority ideology outside of nazi germany

They proved it was superior before they were attacked by the tremendous success they had and we've since seen even more evidence of the inferiority of the ideologies that were victorious.

	<TEXT> hate to burst your bubble, but most progressives are not communists. Maybe, at best, we have some socialist leanings (pro union, pro socialized healthcare, etc). Most of us acknowledge and appreciate the benefits of capitalism (even if we do not support unregulated markets). To go a step further, progressives are typically against government overreaches, even those that support the common good.  So I'm not sure HOW you get communism out of all of this 

As for cultural marxism, I dont see how a private  company choosing to have gay characters in their films, and people applauding them for it, is undermining western values. 

if you dont like it, go and watch more tim allen movies, or hell, go make a movie of your own. it is your right as an American to showcase what a shithead you are, just dont complain if no one wants to indulge it.  </TEXT>
