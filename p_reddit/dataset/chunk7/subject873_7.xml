	<TEXT> "TIL" would be a great "How It's Made" type show followed by "ELI5"

"Uplifting News" followed by "Not The Onion" (these two shows, back to back, would alone make it my favorite channel).

"AMA" would obviously make a great talk show.

"Ask Science" 

"Damn That's Interesting"

The list goes on and on. Someone should make this happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm a big fan of the classic:
multiply any number by 9 and the sum of all the digits in the answer always equals 9 (when you keep adding the digits to the point of having only 1 digit obviously). even works with decimals.
eg. 113.9486 x 9 = 1025.5374 - add that shit up and get 27 - 2+7=9
