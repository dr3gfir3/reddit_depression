Whats really annoying is that it gets no tv coverage in the uk. The bbc will quite happily show a 3 hour boat race cuz its got a british guy in it, but won't give any attention to the controversial things happening at the same time.

	<TEXT> The death of edward 2nd and all that followed until edward 3rd took the throne.  Real game of thrones stuff. 


To try and give a brief description, Ed was a a bit of a playboy, openly bi-sexual whos 'close friends' caused many revolts and was a pretty terrible king. A lot of people didn't like his boyfriend, so hunted down and killed him. Ed fought back. He also got a new 'close friend', Hugh Despenser. Between them, they executed and exiled his enemies.

 Isabella, his (french) queen had enough of his shit and on a short visit home, refused to return back to england with their child, Ed 3rd. Instead, she met up with a guy called Mortimer, (someone who was due to be executed during Eds retalitaion, but whilst in prison, managed to drug the guards and climb the walls, before escaping to france) rallied some norman barons and returned to england to claim the throne, in the name of her son. Shit went down and Ed was forced to surrender. Mortimer and isabella then went to rule as her son was too young. Obvs.

 Whilst locked up, Ed was supposedly murdered, but in fact escaped to italy to live out his days as a monk, most likely with the aid of  his son and supporters. Young Ed 3rd had enough of mortimer, executed him and took the crown back for himself.



Actually just reading that back, it mght be better as a tv series.

	<TEXT> Saw it last night, really really don't understand why the critics are going in on it. I'm not really a 'fan' of comic book films, altho there are exceptions. The whole marvel universe is way too happy happy flag waving for me. Same could be said of the superman films. 


The film was pretty close to what i expected tho. Popcorn. An enteraining action movie, simple. I thought jared leto was fine as the joker, considering its an impossible job following heath ledgers version. Plenty of cheesy jokes and action scenes, but again, as expected of this genre. 

The only problem i had with it was how dark everything was. Every scene looked like it was put through some filter to make it darker. 


Not sure what movie critics expect from this genre? Its equally as good and as terrible as 90% of all the other comic book adaptions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you think my best chances are at getting an app made. I really wouldn't know where to start with the physical part of writing code etc, but i think i have reasonable design capabilities. 


Its an AR game idea i've had for a while now, but looking at the different software to create the app, i can see i'm way out of my depth. Any thoughts on how i could move forward? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone had it where your eggs won't hatch even tho you've put the distance in? I used a lucky egg, hatched 2 out and put a couple of 2km eggs in, started walking the dog. Easily got throught he 2k in time catching more on the way, i kept checking the distance and it stopped ticking over just short of the 2km. Walked well over the distance, still wouldn't hit the 2km. Lucky egg ran out, then immediately the eggs hatched. 


Maybe because i had already hatched some out during the lucky egg?  just a coincidence?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, i'm not sure if this is a thing or there maybe a seperate sub for it, but i think it deserves its place here.


Basically the new stuff from mstrkrft reminded me of an old mstrkrft song, which in turn reminded me of another two aswesome tracks with the same title. 

So there it is, songs with the same title. (that are great)


First up **MSTRKRFT**, who if you dont know about, make pretty heavy electro-house music. This track is kind of a change from that with soulful vocals from the master that is John Legend.

[MSTRKRFT - Heartbreaker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6gHLHbYVeA)


Completely different vibes altogether from **Metronomy**, alternative indie from the 'nu rave' era. First album is still the best imo, before the line up change. Later stuff is still mazing tho. So so many feelings for me wrapped up in this track. Damn, time flies. 


[Metronomy - Heartbreaker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsduHmjQlgI) 


Again, completely different vibes, into more commercial dance pop song terrority from **Steve Aoki** and Lovefoxx. For me, this is when Aoki and the dimmak label peaked. Before he (and the rest of america) got obessed with the whole idea of EDM. Great pop song, nothing much more.


[Steve Aoki Ft. Lovefoxx - Heartbreaker] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViB4IR-7mtk)


.


So yeah, any other (good) tracks with the same title 'Heartbreaker' ?
