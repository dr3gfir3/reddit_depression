	<TEXT> It's 'They Live By Night' (1948), not 'Live by Night' (2016).

And besides, Criterion doesn't exactly choose it's films by box office performance. There are lots of films that where flops when they were first released that are now considered classics and are on Criterion.

	<TITLE> Let's discuss Bernardo Bertolucci's 1900 (Novecento) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yesterday I watched it for the first time and even though it's over 5 hours long it went by pretty fast. I am not really sure what to think about it. There is real greatness there but at the same time it's clearly flawed too.

First I have to say that [the opening shot of the film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsBo3rN6Z1M) is really stunning. Slow zoom out of the painting while Morricone's  Romanzo rises in tempo really puts you into mindset of seeing true epic.

There's gonna be some spoilers below so if you haven't yet watched the film I suggest you do so.

I really liked the first part of the film, and I was really anxious to see the rest when intermission started. If second part would have been as great 1900 would be one of the greatest films ever made. But I gotta say that second part was slight disappointment. I felt like first part of the film really laid groundwork for epic confrontation between workers and fascists/landowners, but then it really never happened. Suddenly fascist were in power and there were some random terror mainly by Sutherland's Attila and suddenly it was liberation day. It's 5 hours film but still it felt like there wasn't enough stuff in it somehow. 

And it was also really dissapointing that Stefania Sandrelli's character was killed off-screen during intermission. She was one of my favourite characters and I would have wanted to see more about her.  Or at least give her more sentimental send-off. 

I didn't really like ending either, it just felt too surreal for this type of film.

Some people criticize this film for being basically propaganda. There's some truth to that especially towards ending, but that didn't really bother me at all. I mean after all most of Einsenstein's films are blatant propaganda and nobody let that diminish their appreciation of his films, so I don't think that it should diminish anyone's appreciation of 1900 either. And while it might be little bit simplistic in it's politics, I think that it's also portrays quite realistically what  life probably was at that time in Italy.

All in all I think that it's a great film that every film buff should see. But it's one of those films  thats are so good that you start getting mad at it for not being great. I just felt that there was potential for being one of the greatest epic films ever made somewhere there but the second part of the film didn't really deliver.

So what are your thoughts about this film? </TEXT>

Poor McCabe. He had poetry in him. Too bad he rode into a town where nobody knew what poetry was but one, and she already lost to it.

	<TEXT> Great analysis. I agree basically with everything you wrote and I've been meaning to write similar post for sometime, so thanks for doing this so I don't have to.

  It seems like it is not as appreciated as other classic movies and to be honest it does't make a great first impression. I really believe that if you have seen The Searchers once, you haven't really seen it.

This was my experience as well. When I first watched it I liked it, but it didn't make that big impression. But then I rewatched it sometime ago and it immediately became one of my all-time favourites. Although it might have been that my first impression was what it was because I was relatively young when I first saw it. If I would watch it first time now I probably would appreciate it more from the get go.

The biggest knock on the film is the dramatic shifts in tone and questionable attempts at humor. I have grown to enjoy the comedic elements of the movie over time but I do understand this complaint. 

This was my biggest complain when I first watched it. Like you said it's shockingly dark western from 50s and then there is "arrow to the butt" type of humour in the mix.  But like you, I've come to appreciate that part of it more as well so it doesn't really bother me anymore.


 This movie alone made me a John Wayne fan, as I think he gives one of the greatest performances ever. Again, there is a ton that is almost impossible to notice on a first viewing, but Wayne's facial expressions tell the real story of the movie. Look at his scenes early in the film with his brother's wife, Martha. Not a word is spoken about it, but the looks and gestures of these two characters indicates an intense longing and passionate history between them, it's incredible how just a few minutes and no exposition can show this.

The Searchers truly is more subtle film than most people realize and it's made to be seen on the big screen. Modern audiences have been so used to exposition trough dialogue that they probably miss lot of the stuff on the film like the relationship between Ethan and Martha that you mentioned. 

Peter Bogdanovich has really great commentary track for The Searchers that's on Blu-ray/DVD that I recommend for anyone who wants to learn more about the film. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Reminds me a lot of the cowboy movies back in the day. They were insanely popular for a few years and then people just got sick of the same thing over and over.

I am not sure why you think that westerns were only popular for couple of years. That's definitely not true. Westerns were the most popular genre for many decades. 

And economics of making westerns back in the day vs superhero blockbusters these days couldn't be more different so I am always baffled when people compare these two genres.

But I agree with you that superhero movies have probably already peaked. At least I hope so.  </TEXT>
