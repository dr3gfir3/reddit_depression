	<TEXT> I've encountered quite a few "ADHD deniers" in my day. It has always pissed me off so much. The big problem, I believe, is that most people that don't have ADHD, for whatever reason, no matter how hard you try to get it through their head, just absolutely don't and can't understand what it's like having to live with ADHD. It just frustrates me so much. Untreated ADHD is one of the hardest disorders to live with. And here are these kids and adults having such a hard time, like seriously struggling, and it's out of their control, and all around them are people saying ADHD isn't real. It's something you get over. You can just make yourself focus, etc etc. And it just makes the problem so so so much worse. As someone that was diagnosed with ADHD and depression, which I believe was caused in large part because of my ADHD, I can't imagine being that person that's struggling so bad because of something they can't control while everyone around them denies that there's anything wrong and that they're just making excuses. It sickens me to think of the emotional and psychological toll that that must have on a person. I was in situation like that for a while, that I'm now out of, but if blows my mind, and makes me sick that people will do that to someone. Act like that towards someone that is in such desperate need of help and support. 

Sorry for the rant. 

TL;DR: ADHD Deniers piss me off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's based on the language of origin that the words came from. I don't remember specifically what languages, but everything that's considered a "bad word" came from a language that was spoken in a country that wasn't liked, and words that have the same meaning, but aren't bad words came from other languages that were spoken in countries that were liked. If that makes any sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say that while people tend to think vanilla is normal or plain, it does not in fact mean that. And I don't think people view it as normal or plain for everything, just some things. My brother used to work at Braum's (an ice cream store) and they had shake ice cream also called plain ice cream. When you mentioned it to anybody they automatically thought it was vanilla ice cream, but it's not. Vanilla is a flavoring. It didn't have any flavoring. It was just completely plain, no flavor. But like I said, I don't know that that way of thinking applies to everything, just some things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also just want to add, don't be embarrassed of your ADHD. I was also diagnosed with depression, which I believe was primarily caused by my ADHD. With my ADHD, I felt like I couldn't do anything. It made me feel like such a failure. Like I was constantly letting people down and could never accomplish anything that I needed to. It's a terrible fucking feeling to go through life feeling like a failure. Especially when it's something that you can't control. Before I went to the doctor I self treated with anything I could get my hands on. Which just made aspects of my life worse. You don't deserve to feel like that. You're ADHD is part of who you are just as much as your eye or hair color. So don't be embarrassed by it. With that said though, it doesn't have to be such a debilitating burden all the time. Untreated ADHD is one of the hardest disorders to live with. I'll repeat myself one last time, it doesn't have to be a burden, but you can't manage it on your own. If you haven't, go to the doctor. Get professional help. Getting medicine and help for me was a life saver. It absolutely changed my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not an Electronic Engineer, or any engineer for that matter, nor am I going to school to be an engineer. So I don't know how valid my advice is or if it's what you're looking for. But with that said, I WAS thinking I wanted to be an Electronic Engineer at one point in my life. I have heard engineering can be a great career for someone with ADHD. However, I would say that, if you haven't already, to go to the doctor. Get some medication and some professional help. Engineering school is tough for anyone, much less someone struggling with ADHD. Like I said, if you haven't, get professional help from a doctor. I would not recommend trying to do it on your own.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never was able to develop any coping mechanisms, so not really answering your question or what you're looking for, but without my medicine, I didn't. Through high school, before I was treated and got my medicine, I never studied and rarely did homework. I was smart enough that I still passed and graduated, but I didn't do nearly as well as I could have. And now I regret it. Now in college, with my medicine, things are a lot easier and smoother, and I just do my homework and study (typically just read through my notes as if they were a book and then I quiz myself) while my medicine is working, before it wears off. I know that's not what you're looking for, sorry I don't have any more insight. Best of luck! I hope you find a way that works for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I don't necessarily agree with it, it's genius marketing. It's all about the target audience. They know that women, more than men, purchase Dove, so they promote women's body image and that boosts sales. However, Axe is bought MUCH more often by men than women, and they know men don't care as much about whether a woman is being hyper-sexualized in the advertisement, and that it will appeal to them if they present it that way, and consequently, boost sales. So that's how they do it. They know their audience and they manipulate it to get more money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To more specifically answer some of your questions: Stuff tastes so good because your appetite isn't working normally because anandamide can't do its job and your back pain is gone because being seemingly impervious to pain is another effect from the balance of anandamide and dopamine being thrown off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> THC mimics a natural neurotransmitter in our brains called anandamide. Anandamide is normally responsible for boosting memory and learning, dulling pain, and stimulating the appetite. Typically, anandamide and dopamine partner and work together to control different pathways and other things as needed. However, even though THC mimics anandamide, it doesn't have the exact same effects. When you smoke weed, THC binds to your cannabinoid CB1 and CB2 receptors. You have these receptors in several different parts of your brain that are responsible for things like short term memory, coordination, learning, problem solving, and unconscious muscle movement. When THC binds to your cannabinoid receptors, it gets in the way of your natural neurotransmitters, like anandamide, from binding to them, which keeps all the above mentioned functions from working normally. When anandamide is prevented from doing its job, the balance of anandamide and dopamine is thrown off, causing the typical effects of marijuana that everyone knows about, like euphoria and what not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I understand, getting Vitamin C from anything, at any point while the adderall is working, will diminish the effects. Orange Juice is very high in Vitamin C so drinking a glass of it at any point before it wears off will diminish the effects. Your body is absorbing the adderall the entire time it's working. When it can't absorb anymore, that's when you feel the comedown. So getting any vitamin c during that will keep you from absorbing as much. And, at least for me, it makes a huge difference. I completely stay away from anything like that while on my adderall because if I don't, it feels like I might as well not be taking anything. I do take XR though, not IR so the absorption is different. But I believe it's still the same idea. Someone correct me if I'm wrong. </TEXT>

I don't agree that someone who identifies themselves as a girl should be forced to use the men's bathroom just because they have a penis, but I also don't see why they've made it such a big deal. It's JUST a public restroom. Just go in, take a piss, or drop a deuce and leave. I don't understand why it's become this big issue. Frankly, I don't see why they ever became separated in the first place, but for Christ's sake, you're just using the bathroom. Calm down. Both sides, in my opinion, just seem unnecessary. </TEXT>
