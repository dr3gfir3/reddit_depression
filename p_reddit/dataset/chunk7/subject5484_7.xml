You work at a major media outlet?  That's even scarier.

And, really, ask me if I care whether you think the story has already been sufficiently covered.  I'm sorry if that doesn't fit your conservative sensibilities, and your series of tirades about this suggests it doesn't.

Is that repetition of the same old same old?  Or is it, look at them bombs!  Hold the phone and stop the presses.  Cuz no one wants to hear about anything but this bombing.

The media is supposedly there to protect us and not the enemy of the people.  Remember that whole deal?

Well, in some ways, they are not unlike politicians and need to be reminded that they have serious job to do and don't just get to report on what gets them numbers.

Moreover, have you ever watched one of these 24-hour news outlets?  They run about 87 minutes of news for one 24-hour period ad nauseum.

It's utter BS that they don't have the time to cover this in their vapid programming schedules.

	<TEXT> OK, professor.

From an early date, rhinoceros horn was believed to have special properties, in particular that it would react by fizzing if it came into contact with poison, and so cups made out of rhinoceros horn were valued as a protection against poisoning.[5] It is thought that rhinoceros horn cups developed during the Warring States Period or earlier,[20] and rhinoceros cups (Chinese sgng ) feature prominently in pre-Han literature; they are, for example, mentioned in four of the 300 odes of the Book of Songs (nos. 3, 154, 215 and 292).[12]

	<TEXT> Oh, so it's not used in Chinese medicine "as an aphrodisiac".  That's convenient cover to suggest it's all recent Vietnam misinformation from the Western media when it is very very very well-documented that rhino horns were used for hundreds if not thousands of years in Chinese medicine.

Though rhino horn elixirs for fevers and liver problems were first prescribed in traditional Chinese medicine more than 1,800 years ago

https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/05/why-does-a-rhino-horn-cost-300-000-because-vietnam-thinks-it-cures-cancer-and-hangovers/275881/

Rhino horn has been an ingredient in traditional Chinese medicine for centuries.

http://www.rhinoremedy.org/medicine/point-less-rhinos

Rhino horn is a time-honored component of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). For thousands of years, TCM has credited rhino horn with the potency to cure an unusually wide array of maladies, from headaches to pus-filled boilsand even devil possession.

She met with Trump early to push her agenda about Syria.  She's not a neocon in any way, shape, or form.

I had fun camping, and I do see the value of being helpful and a positive influence on your community.

I somewhat understood as a kid, but now I 300% grasp what a conservative breeding ground it was.

I'd even go so far as to say there were troop leaders who ran scouts without the paleoconservative dogma, but BSA as a national organization is mentally alseep at the wheel and morally straight only when the entire rest of society has already moved ahead and prods them, kicking and screaming, to do what's morally straight and end their chauvinist bigotry.  </TEXT>

I'd expect them to remove the napkins from the table as soon as they sit down, make quiet conversation, and avoid chewing with their mouths open.  

Most importantly, they should avoid controversial topics and steer towards something everyone likes.

	<TEXT> People like to talk about themselves.  If you don't know what to say, ask someone about themselves-preferably calmly and coolly, not in a nervous twitchy fashion-and whatever they say, pretend it's really interesting and ask them to tell you more INSTEAD of starting to talk about you.

Remember SMOOFF

Situation- So how long have you known [party host] for?  How'd you meet?

Motivation-  What brings you to this [frat party/clambake/open mic session]?

Opinion- So whaddaya think about this music?  Really?  Then a) So what would you put on instead?  or b) If you like this one, then what else do like along these lines?

Occupation- obvious, maybe better if you're older

Family- obvious, maybe better if you're older

Free time- So what would you be doing if you weren't here right now?  Whatcha gonna do tomorrow?

And again, don't jump from their answer to telling them your answer.  Instead, explore their answer.  It's funny, but if you pretend to be interested in someone, then you often actually become interested in someone. </TEXT>

On one side, we have party over country.

And on the opposing side, we have pandering over principle.

Yeah, just lies about his contacts with Russians like the whole line of insiders with the bonus of only being half-divested and still making profits off the family business.
