	<TEXT> The card you're using. Have you ever had a different address with that company. Say 5 years ago you were living somewhere else and had the same bank or credit card company.

Have you spoken with someone at your credit/debit card company? If so and they say that the address is correct have them check all their systems. They have multiple systems and one of them could have an older address. It's a pain for them to check so they'll probably just check the first part and say it matches. This is sort of more common (but still rare) with debit cards more so than credit cards. For example say you have a Bank of America debit card with a MasterCard branding on it. The Bank of America system will have your correct address. But the system they update with MasterCard could have your old address.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like it. It works. Don't have to fiddle with things in my spare time.

I put Windows 10 (Windows 10 passed the activation test which I found surprising) on it for a week and got way way better graphics in Dying Light, Alien Isolation and Tomb Raider. But put Steam OS back on and beat them under Linux. Didn't really mind the dip in graphics that much.

Rocket League plays beautifully under Steam OS.

I have the cheapest i3 version but was contemplating buying a i7 CPU and upgrading the RAM on it.

Thanks for the reply. </TEXT>

This has decent reviews for coax to Ethernet. No idea personally if it's any good.

If any of the coax lines are straight shots or not to tricky I'd just tie Cat6 cables to it and pull it through the walls. Totally understand if you can't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you running Plex Media Server on the Seagate Personal Cloud itself?
From a brief Google search it appears that the Seagate Personal Cloud NAS doesn't have the processing power to be able to transcode videos. It'll only be able to stream the original file. Which would then be up to the client what they can play natively.
Which is why your computer was able to play videos better than the Roku.

I'd recommend:

Using Seagate Personal Cloud as just a NAS. Store your video files there.

Connect your PC via Ethernet and install Plex Media Server on it. 
Depending on your passmark score (https://support.plex.tv/hc/en-us/articles/201774043-What-kind-of-CPU-do-I-need-for-my-Server-) of your computer I'm betting you'll be able to stream to your Roku and Android box with no issues.  </TEXT>
