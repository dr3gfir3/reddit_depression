	<TEXT> You believe in utopia that does not exit, also if you want to change stuff you have to do it from the inside out. 

Sad truth is that Vui is not Tito and he will do what Tata Putun tell him to do. 

I don't know about you , but if it was my ass instead of yours I would much rather work for Euros than Rubles. 

P.S. Also, under no circumstances Putin is hilarious. He is someone who Serbia should stay away from as far as humanly possible.  </TEXT>

What I'm afraid of is that he will eventually in fact send out people to provoke/attack protestors and that is when shit will hit the fan. 

I already lived trough one of these "people have a right to peaceful protest" during Miloevi dictatorship. Next thing you know tanks are on the streets and innocent people are dying. 

Honestly my only hope is that organizers will see trough it and not allow students to get involved in bloodshed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Following is not my comment it is a comment of Trump supporter. No one wants US to enter another war. "Serving justice" while not knowing who did what is what got us in to this state to begin with. 

 I'm a huge Trump supporter, but this is one of the key reasons I voted for Trump, not to get involved in foreign entanglements that do not benefit the American people.
 Atrocities are being committed around the world and we ignore all of them except for this one? Are we now doing Hillary and her overlords bidding?
 There was good evidence that the last gas attack was actually perpetrated by ISIS on their own civilians to drum up propaganda for their cause. We know that the supposed white hats in Syria are a fake news organization, having been caught staging stories to support sympathy for jihad. Why is this different? Indeed there are many similarities and people are already point out inconsistencies in the sarin gas narrative.
 What is the implication of this attack? Has Trump been compromised? Are their traitors on his staff? Is he starting to become mesmerized by the control-left media, or is their some deeper plan behind all this?
 I can only pray that the truth prevails and Trump stays true to his convictions. If he was lied to, then he should expose the liars. Time will tell.

They call on all parties to let young people express their discontent through peaceful means and also called on police officers to apply the legal authority.

- Distinguished from the ruling party and the opposition sit together and resolve this issue in a separate room if need be, kill one another, but do not allow loss of life of children, the citizen or the police officer, because you did something wrong - conclusion statements.

Representative Police union of Serbia and Military Union of Serbia announced today that due to the bad situation and standards of employees on April 8 protest outside the Serbian government building in Belgrade.

They were stuffing the boxes like there is not tomorrow. There were 800 000 more voters than people legally allowed to vote in Serbia. 

Shame on you for your bias and spreading misinformation while you are moderating some of the largest subs on Reddit. 

Also I saw your other comments and they are nothing more than regurgitated washed out excuses that are coming form Vuiis government.

	<TEXT> I used [Route 1 Car Rental](https://www.route1carrental.is) in January. 

Originally we had Hertz and price was average, but after getting there our group decided to split in two so we ended up renting another vehicle. What I found is that if you rent a car or reserve a room last min. (24h or less) you will save up to 50%!!! 

For the record I was there in off season so this may not be true during summer. 

Here is the post I made when I returned it may be useful to you:

I'm not denying that chetniks saved your father, but the picture that you are painting of Chetniks not even close. 

Belgrade nullified his treason conviction because people who are in power are far right nationalist. Basically same exact people that were involved in Yugoslavian civil war. Heck some of them were even is Hague war tribunal, but were released. 

Nothing has changed there as far as politics and nationalism they just shuffle political titles from time to time. That is all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the 90s, you guys tried to exterminate all the Bosniaks (muslims), which is why Nato started bombing there.

Actually not, war in Bosnia ended in 1995. Nato bombing of Serbia started in 1999. 

According to interview for BBC documentary Madeleine Albright stated that they wanted to use infrastructure (air space, roads and land) to build NATO base in Balkans and Milosevic basically told them to fuck off unless they pay him. They didn't so they started to bomb the shit out of us for two month straight. 

Naturally base was built in Kosovo ( [Camp Bondsteel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Bondsteel) ) and my understanding is that it is one of the largest in Europe.

	<TEXT> Story time!

There is a church of something that comes to my door at least 5-6 times a year and it is always the same story. They knock I open and first thing they ask is my nationality ( I have unique name that is exclusive for that particular nationality ). 

Now just for the record we are talking about Christian Church and majority of people of my nationality is not Christian. 

I live in apartment complex and they only come to my door. They don't introduce them selfs nor do they want to answer how did they found me or what they want, unless I specifically state my nationality. It is totally creepy. 

Usually I just let them off easy and just tell them that I'm not religious and that they should take me off their list.

Last time they showed up, I told them the same thing and one of the guys actually started looking pass my shoulder and asking if there is anyone else in the household they can talk to. At that point I lost my shit. I started yelling at him and told them never to come back. 

I honestly don't know what to do if and when they show up next time.  </TEXT>

How many muslims did Russia take in? 

No one is denying that there is a huge fucking problem in Europe. Heck I my self was a refugee form Balkan wars and I'm first one to say that simply opening borders was a catastrophic fucking error that never happened before. 

I personally spent close to 8 months in refugee camp and they vetted my entire family that entire time. Out of some two million people that left their homes at the time only few thousand were actually given refugee status and were allowed to immigrate to other countries. 

With that said claiming that immigrants did this moments after this happened is nothing more than fear mongering and fake news spreading at it's finest. 

So unless you have some actual evidence that no one else on planet has you can respectively fuck off with that bullshit.  </TEXT>

Ah, gotta love how reddit leftist would stright off the bat blame Putin rather than our usual suspects (with whom Russia been dealing with for quite a while now)

And this

I wonder how many of you crazy liberals are happy about this. How many will #PrayForRussia and change your profile pics?

It is fucking pathetic and bit desperate, don't you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up in post communist era European dictatorship. It is not out of the question. Heck our beloved leader send out tanks on the streets of the capital to "calm" students who were calling for his resignation. 

With that said I think that they would "save" massacre like this only after things would seriously start to get out of hand.  </TEXT>
