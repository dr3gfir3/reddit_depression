	<TEXT> Its way cheaper than an ipad, and it looks better.  First party nintendo games.  People are looking at this like its a subpar home console when its really just an amazingly above par handheld.  

They made oodles on the 3DS and made it impossible for the Vita to succeed. Look up size comparisons and you'll see that the Joycons are larger than the control portions of the 3DSXL so they'll be fine.  Paid online is a must as they modernize their online systems and they've already said that they're gonna give subscribers free classic games each month.  

People fail to realize that Nintendo isn't trying to compete with Xbox or Sony, they're competing with Apple, and if you're a gamer considering buying an ipad for fun games on the go, this really is a better and cheaper alternative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [RECIPE]

(What I sent my best friend/posted on facebook for recipe.  Too lazy to retype a clean version with less cursing and profanity.) Warning! Profanity.

Cinnamon Rolls

Step 1: Hate yourself and harness your inner self loathing. Good? Drown that shit out with food. You gotta Cinna some Bons fam.

Step 2: Put a brick of cream cheese on the counter half an hour ago. (brick squad)

Step 3: Put 3 sticks of butter on the counter. Soften dat saturated fat. We got arteries to clog.

Step 4: Put 2 eggs on the counter. We need to get those unborn chicken fetuses to room temp. Baking is a bitch like that.
If you forget put em in warm water DONT MICROWAVE THOSE HOES!!!

Step 5: Pour 3/4 cup of standard bovine secretion and set it on the counter. (That's Cows milk for you 3rd grade reading level type assholes.)

Step 6: Take a deep breath, you're already committed, its either cheat day or you're obese (self loathing done right)

Step 7: Put 4.5 cups of standard white flour in a big ass bowl. (Note that 4.5 is the same as....never mind stupid people don't get iced Bons)

Step 8: Cut a 3rd cup of butter off of one of your sticks and put it on top of the standard flour in the big ass bowl. (It BETTER be soft or u need to chill and look at some cat memes for ten minutes or so.)

Step 9: warm up 1/4 cup of Milk and put 2.5 teaspoons of yeast and sugar in it. (WARM not HOT you yeast murderer)

Step 10: Put 1/2 cup sugar in the big ass bowl

Step 11: Put like 2 teaspoons of salt or something like that in the big ass bowl too 

Step 12: Put the counter eggs and counter milk in the big ass bowl.

Step 13: rofl that yeast Milk lookin pretty gross right now huh? (It BETTER be...) yeah dump that in the big ass bowl. 

Step 14: Hope you got a bread mixer bro cus you either need a bread mixer, a kitchen aid, or be swol AF at this point cus its time to stir that ho. (hahahaha umadbro?)

Step 15: Cover the big ass bowl and leave that shit alone for like an hour or something. Go act like you care about stuff on FB or something, cus that dough needs rising fam.

Step 16: Put most of the counter brick of cream cheese in a new bowl. IDGAF what you do with the rest man. 

Step 17: put thecounter butter in there too. (If you dont suck you should have one more untouched stick of butter left on the counter gettin all Squishy.)

Step 18: Add a mess of powdered sugar to this and mix vigorously. (rofl only calories ur burning today huh fatty.)

Step 19: Lick the mixing utensil you just used to mix your icing and giggle....lol you know what your brain does when no ones lookin you dirty little...

STEP 20: assuming you aren't a spaz and you haven't fucked everything up and had an existential crisis at this point (if you have its okay you already hate yourself remember?) spread a bunch of flour on a counter or table or something and slap the dough (which should be double big now) down onto it.

Step 21: Roll it out into a big ass rectangle or whatever you want but it needs to be like 2 pieces of computer paper big.

Step 22: Rub half of that last stick of counter butter all over it (lather like lotion) and then sprinkle the brown sugar, Cane sugar, and 2 tablespoons of cinnamon all over it. 

Step 23: Roll that shit up like you're a god damn cartoon character rolling a comically large blunt filled with angel shit, and then cut it into a bunch of rolls that are about an inch and a half thick.

Step 24: Plop them into a pan and then let those rise for like half an hour like you did earlier only this time quit bein a fatty and checkin in on it every 30 seconds. (Trust is the best part of a good relationship, and you want a hot and steamy relationship with these bons. 

Step 25: Bake em at 350 for 8 minutes and then turn it up to 400 for 4 min, and then turn down to 300 and vent the oven for 2 more minutes. ( I shit you not this is how they get perfect since you don't have a sick industrial robo bon oven, and baking is fucking stupid.)

Note: you can also just be a lazy piece of shit and bake em at like 280-300 for like 30-40min until they're dank.

Step 26: pull them out take a deep breath, and then bukake that icing onto those hoes.

Step 27: tuck that boner into ur waistband you got bons to mouth sex boyscout.
