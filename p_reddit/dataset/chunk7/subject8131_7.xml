 Confusion about his height also results from the difference between the French pouce and British inch2.71 cm and 2.54 cm, respectively. The myth of the "Napoleon Complex  named after him to describe men who have an inferiority complex  stems primarily from the fact that he was listed, incorrectly, as 5 feet 2 inches (in French units) at the time of his death.[220] In fact, he was 1.68 metres (5 ft 6 in) tall, an average height for a man in that period. </TEXT>

  As a secret vigilante group, the Klan targeted freedmen and their allies; it sought to restore white supremacy by threats and violence, including murder, against black and white Republicans.

Later on in the article, it states "Only Kaufman has been free on bond in recent years".

Therefore, I assume (and I could be wrong), all but Kaufman are still in jail since it hasn't even been enough time for the shortest sentence (7 years), to have been served with credit. </TEXT>

One issue BLM is protesting is cases of *unnecessary* lethal outcomes of minorities when interacting with police officers. Therefore, a minority can still be killed if they interact with an incompetent officer, no matter how educated that minority is.
