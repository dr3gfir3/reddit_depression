	<TEXT> I got it for $12 so it doesn't matter. I'll get the DLC. But what about the poor souls that bought the game on release? Did they know they would have to pay $15  dollars later just to play the Epilogue? Man, I don't know. I don't like that. I love DLC's, but not for something that maybe should have been included in the game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is underwhelming at times. I recommend just doing stuff that you like, ignore pointless fetch quests if you want, the game gives you plenty of freedom on how you want to approach. For ex. The Hinterlands. You can leave it and only come back for the important stuff. 

 Make sure you explore a lot though. It's worth it.  </TEXT>

If you wish to only controll your character, I suggest you play on Casual or Normal, as anything above that may require you to approach battles from a more tactical standpoint.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. So where I live there's a problem with the electricity and the power is going out several times a day. Today's it's happened like 5 times and it's only 2pm. It happened yesterday while I was playing but thankfully it worked normally when I turned it back on. Should I be concerned? I had it connected to a power strip but have since then switched it to a wall outlet. Should I play on my X1S or should I wait? I don't know if this problem with the electricity will go away soon, I don't think so </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Scorpio will be a higher-end device than the PS4 Pro, and will feature obvious performance and graphical advantages over the Sony offering. All Microsoft-published Scorpio games will render at 4K, meaning that they will not be upsized, as is the case with virtually all PS4 Pro 4 titles today.

my guess is that Scorpio will debut at a $500 price point, if not higher. I could see Scorpio retailing for double the price of the Xbox One S, especially if it actually includes VR hardware. </TEXT>

The thief would not be able to power it on, and if the engineers get clever they can find a way to make it clear for other people to see that the console they are buying was stolen and therefore worthless. And yet, if I get the console back in my possession, it would be cool to get it working normally. I'd like to know what you guys think. </TEXT>
