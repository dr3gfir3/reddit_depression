	<TEXT> You do have a dark sense of humour :)

It doesn't really work like that, though (at least not for me). I don't feel profoundly sad all the time... well, maybe deep inside, but on the surface I am very able of laughing and experiencing transient happiness. I am also quite experienced in looking happy. One of my coworkers told me the other day that I am the "bounciest" person she knows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been on treatment with a psychiatrist and several psychologists and none of them has ever suggested OCD. You are right in that it is much like a compulsion, in fact, I used that same word in another comment. But the truth is whenever I feel like that, I do want to die. I feel like I can't bear living any longer, it is too painful. And I also have many other symptoms of depression, so I'm not sure if your comment really applies. But thanks anyway! </TEXT>
