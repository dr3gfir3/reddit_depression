	<TEXT> I used a Texas rub for the ribs, that's what makes it Texas style.

Just in case you were wondering what it contains, it's just salt and pepper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really see that as ruining the steak, unless they don't let it rest. The only downside I see of cutting it into strips is that it will get cold wuicker </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quite simple, Buy that blend of meat and mix it together.
Make the tomato relish, you can find hundreds of recipes for it.

Fry the patties and bacon. When the patties are nearly done put the vintage cheddar pieces on so that they melt. Then put patties to the side to rest and toast the bun. Once toasted assemble everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same goes for this comment.. I didn't make up 'Vintage' it's a type of cheddar such as mild or mature cheddar. Vintage cheddar is aged for about 24 months making it a very sharp cheddar. If u've never tried it, go get some.. The taste is totally different from normal cheddar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't believe you got 22 up votes for that comment without any one explaining what tomato relish is... It's a combination of garlic onion and tomato simmered in vinegar and brown sugar, making it sweet and acidic. </TEXT>
