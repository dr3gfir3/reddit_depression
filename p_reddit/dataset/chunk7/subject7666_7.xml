	<TEXT> Ah, but it has to include the all-important "I don't know," with the appropriate emphasis that this is the continuation of a very long and frustrating back and forth. If there could also be an implication that the result will be ultimately disappointing to everyone involved, that would be perfect, although I may have to settle for a crest depicting sad people at a dinner table for that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because his writing is entertaining and funny and scary and sometimes meaningful? Because he understands the power of stories, how people shape them and how they shape people in turn? Because he puts humor in the darkest moments and dark turns in the lightest? Because he writes women like people? Because he gave us a Death that makes the end of your life a satisfactory, fitting thing? Because he loves mythology and understands that every community, even the smallest, has its own?

Maybe because Sandman was such an amazing work at the right time? Maybe because he reads his own work very well? Maybe because he is remarkably accessible and was good at social media almost before it was a thing? 

Couldn't say. If he doesn't do it for you, he doesn't. There are plenty of best-selling authors who leave me disinterested. All I can tell you is that what he writes hits me right where I want to read.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Roughly every fourth or fifth book I read is probably one I've read before. 

Many of the ones listed are in my re-reading standbys, but I'll add a couple I haven't seen yet. 

The Princess Bride, by William Goldman. Couldn't tell you how many times, now. 

The Discworld series. Some more than others, but all of them multiple times. 

Steven Gould's Jumper series (except for Griffin, the movie tie-in). 

The Guns of the South by Harry Turtledove. Love his short work, love his fantasy work, lost interest in the endless streams of WW-Whatever rewrites, but this one never seems to get boring for me. 

Jim Butcher's Codex Alera series. Love the Dresden books but these are better. 

Sherlock Holmes, although I prefer the stories to the novel. 

Stardance by Spider and Jeanne Robinson. 

The Moon is a Harsh Mistress by Robert Heinlein. 

Replay by Ken Grimwood. Struck a chord with me at the right time in my life and every couple of years I want to read it again. 

Good Omens by Terry Prachett and Neil Gaiman. Possibly the one book I can always pick up and enjoy reading again. Whatever the Venn diagram is for fans of this book, I am dead center.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely right. 

The thing people get wrong when they tell you it'll get better is that the pain never goes away. Nor should it. Instead it gets less and less intense as you gradually learn to accept it and focus on the memories rather than the loss. And because people say it gets better, you naturally figure there's some point when you're "better" and you can get discouraged if that's not happening, or if you think you're "better" but something reminds you and you're suddenly grief-stricken again. That's going to happen. 

You'll always be sad at losing them. Someday that will be just a wistful tug at your heart, followed by memories of what they meant to you. But for now feel what you want to feel, at whatever pace you need, and treasure the fact that you felt deeply enough about someone for it to hurt that match.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a fan of reading them in story arcs. Granted, I read them as they came out so it may be just what I'm used to, but I like jumping around the Discworld. 

It's true that the first two, "The Colour of Magic" and "The Light Fantastic" (really one big book split up) is the weakest one. It's more of a parody of fantasy novels rather than being the unique creation Discworld evolved into. But even the weakest Discworld book is hilarious and better than most others. You could skip those and come back, but you should read them before "Interesting Times."

Other than that, you can jump from any story arc to any other story arc without confusion as all the characters are introduced wherever they appear. Within the story arcs, you're better off staying in order as they build on one another.

Also? I envy you. I would love to read these again for the first time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It proves that I have a different opinion as to how the country should be run than the president and his supporters do. The news is accurate.

Is he cracking down on travel from a small group of countries in an apparent Muslim ban which causes hardship for innocent people and invasion of liberties while ignoring countries where terrorists who hurt us actually came from? Yes. But supporters want him to crack down and see this as a start. 

Is he systematically destroying our current government by putting people in charge of departments who, to a person, have spoken against, fought or sued that department? Yes. (Except for Ben Carson, who's there because... I don't know why he's there.) Has he left thousands of staff positions unfilled while putting his own people, unqualified apart from loyalty to Trump, in government offices? Yep. Has he left the State Department understaffed and unguided while he and his son-in-law handle diplomacy with the world? Also yes. But again, where I see this as insanely dangerous, his supporters see it as good and necessary for his vision to come true.

Is he stripping out every regulation he can find that protects consumers or the environment while getting ready to drastically defund the EPA? Big yes, and while supporters cheer this as helping businesses I'm remembering what the skies used to look like in New York and LA, and a river that kept catching fire...

The news I follow is accurate. It just doesn't scare you the way it does me. </TEXT>

Compliment him, help guide investigators away from his more obvious transgressions and profiteering, and he'll sign whatever you put in front of him as long as he can say he's making American great again. Also, they've come this far, don't underestimate the amount of humiliation they'll get as video clips of their eager support will be used against them forever. They are VERY aware of this, and re-election (and campaign funds) is more important than anything.

But I will add a quote you may already be tired of.

"To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President, right or wrong, is not only unpatriotic and servile, but is morally treasonable to the American public. Nothing but the truth should be spoken about him or any one else. But it is even more important to tell the truth, pleasant or unpleasant, about him than about any one else."

	<TEXT> As things stand now, 0%. The GOP controls the House, where impeachment begins, and as long as they can use him to ram through their corporate Christmas wishlist they'll keep supporting him.

If conclusive evidence is produced that ties Trump to Russian interests, maybe 20%. He and his machine will deny it, accuse the accusers, do their best to muddy the waters and throw smoke bombs and use every trick they can because Trump is incapable of admitting error or even seeing wrongdoing if he's the one doing it.

If Russian connections are proved AND he continues pissing money away AND he does something else to aggravate enough of the GOP: maybe 50%. They really, really don't want to own up to having supported an impeached president and will support him as long as voters seem to be on their side. Most of all, they don't want leftists to have been right.

If enough voters rise up against them, especially if GOP loses ground in the midterms because enough voters want him and them gone, odds go up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, first it depends on your tastes. I like fantasy and science fiction, and I recommend anything Neil Gaiman reads of his own works. Audible.com has a sale recently on the complete Sherlock Holmes, read by Simon Vance, who does an amazing job.

I have a 45-minute commute twice a day so audiobooks and podcasts have become a regular part of my life. People get really touchy when you go past on the highway, reading...

If you're interested in the Harry Potter books in the list you sent, it looks like they're the Jim Dale versions and he does a wonderful job. I'll listen to him read anything.

In odd science fiction I like "The Rook," by Daniel O'Malley.

There are books I like whose audiobooks don't work for me. I like John Scalzi and I like the actor Wil Wheaton, but his reading voice grates on me so I avoid them. Personal preference.

I'd say find the books that sound interesting, then listen to the samples to see if that's someone you want to read to you for a couple of hours.

The one I posted about was "The Night Circus," by Erin Morgenstern, also read by Jim Dale, which I loved. But I was talking about books in general and mentioned that, and was told it wasn't really reading a book. Even if I agree that listening isn't reading, the subreddit isn't /r/reading... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Books are ______. Ebooks are _______. Whatever you fill in the blanks with, it'll be wrong for somebody.

It's subjective, and always will be. I said the same thing when ebooks were getting started and all the articles were about the death of print.

Print books are wonderful. The heft and the smell and the physical sensation of turning the pages and the ease-of-reading for some people and the sentimental value and the ease-of-access and the way you can scribble notes in them and the ease of lending and the lack of batteries and the resale/bequeathing options and the way you can flip through pages to find things and the marvelous gifts they can be and how settling into a chair with a book and a cup of something hot can transport you and just the simple joy of having them on your shelves, all great things.

Ebooks are wonderful. The ease of purchase anywhere and at any time, the (generally) lower prices, the massive reclamation of storage and shelf space at home, the ease of searching within text, the ease of adding notes that can be emailed or texted or sent to Evernote or wherever, the built-in dictionaries, the ease of adjusting fonts and margins to taste, the hundreds of thousands of free public domain works available, the way you can knock off a few more paragraphs or chapters waiting in line wherever you are, the ease of copying passages to paste elsewhere, the ease of buying and sending as gifts, and the great joy of being able to carry hundreds around at all times, which for a reading addict such as myself is a damn miracle.

For some people or some books or some situations, print books are better. For others, ebooks. I've been gradually replacing most of my books with ebooks, thousands of them since I got my first Palm Pilot, but I keep the ones that I like better in print such as big art and photo books, books with amazing covers, frontispieces, maps or artistic binding, books that have been signed, books with sentimental value, books other people in the house want to read, etc. Meanwhile if I get the urge to re-read all the Discworld books (again) I've got them all in my pocket.

It's not an either-or. It never was. And neither one is going away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kind of a spinoff from an earlier post, but I was reminded of it over the weekend listening to a friend play. He does excellent acoustic versions of songs he likes, and while he plays mostly rock I've been introduced to a lot of country that way. But his versions have no twang, no drawl, no steel guitar. I listened to Keith Urban because I loved this guy's versions of "Who Wouldn't Want to Be Me" and "Raining on Sunday" and sorry Keith, I liked his better.

I also tend to like just about anyone singing Daft Punk songs more than Daft Punk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Bechdel Test is a handy way for a writer to look at their own work, or for an audience to examine a book or movie or show, to see if women exist in it only as support to the male characters. It wasn't supposed to criticize all movies, nor was passing the test ever a guarantee of feminism or quality. 

When the movie's focus is a male character, the Bechdel Test likely won't apply and it can still be an excellent movie. When the movie's focus is on an event, or a group of characters, and the focus is *still* only on the men and what motivates them, that can be a sign that it wasn't very well written. The Bechdel Test, based on a cartoon conversation, was a funny way of pointing out how very, very many movies treat women solely as plot devices, exposition or just ways to motivate the male characters. 

Poking holes at the test does not invalidate the point of it, which is that for much of Hollywood's history women are less important to stories than men. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need to know how to light people on fire.

Wait, let me try that again...

I need to know how to light people, who are near fire.

I shoot a local group of performers who use fire in many of their acts. Most of the time this is at night, with little available light around save perhaps lampposts. 

[I can get shots like this](http://imgur.com/a/Sn645), but I'd like to be able to narrow the aperture to get more detail in the flames and less blown-out white areas. BUT I need to be able to see the performers, and when I try a flash it takes away from the rich colors of the flames reflecting on their faces, hair and clothing. 

Ideally it should a portable, self-powered solution (or a better way of using my flash, which I admit I am not the best at) as they tend to move about quite a lot. Help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After reading this and the [excellent guide posted below](https://www.reddit.com/r/Instagram/comments/5dqyf2/an_rinstagram_guide_to_gaining_followers/), I spent the evening last night liking and commenting on other people's posts, especially people already following photographers who do similar work to mine. I also cleaned up my feed a little, deleting low-interest personal posts to help focus it a bit more.

Result: a bunch of likes, a few comments, and 10 new followers. Also, I found about 25 new photographers I wanted to follow, and saw a lot of great stuff. So, net win, I think :)

Going to try keeping this up for a week and see what happens. It can be pretty time-consuming, though.

One advantage of liking and commenting is that Instagram's recommendations for images I might like seems to be getting more accurate, and that can only keep improving. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends. For most images I have some presets to process pics the way I like right away, with only a bit of tweaking and cropping to do. For some images, especially portraits, I'll take more time -- say, 15 minutes to an hour -- to get it right. Images where I have to combine images, swapping heads or removing tricky things from backgrounds, etc, it could be a couple hours. And if I'm creating a photo illustration, I can keep coming back to it for days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go get a naked baby doll that stands up, or a mannequin if you have access to one, or even just something with smooth curves. Put it where you'll take the picture. Put lighting around it. Snap pictures. Move the lighting. Snap more pictures. 15 minutes of that will give you a lot of useful information about what lighting to use. Like the others here, I'd suggest from the side to get shadows. 

For that matter, set the timer on the camera and take pics of your own butt under different conditions. When you can make yours look good, you can make hers look great. 

Not light-related, but good to know for a straight-on butt shot: she doesn't need to stand straight and flat-footed. You can shoot that if she wants, but also try some with her putting one foot slightly forward, or crossing her ankles, or putting weight on one foot and cocking her hip up to make an s-curve with her body. Put her in high heels, or ask her to raise up on the balls of her feet. You won't see any of that in the pic, but you will see more attractive lines along her hips and her butt.

Edited: I wrote it wrong about closeness of the light vs softness of the shadows. </TEXT>

What this does, I think, is give you a heads-up of cool photos you might have missed in the stream and maybe goose you a little to like and comment on a fellow photog's work. If you get useful comments back, more the better.

By doing it inside Instagram rather than starting a thread here you immediately have access to comment because you're already in the program. Just more convenient, once you get the DMs set up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. People comng forward with information that could get them fired or worse are already taking a huge chance.

BUT I would consider it if the following conditions were also put in place:

- President Trump can no longer use any version of "a lot of people tell me" or "I heard this somewhere" or "someone told me this." He must name his sources, every time.

- Politicians in general cannot use any versions of "all Americans believe..." or "Americans want..." Not only this never been accurate, it has the added effect of implying that anyone agreeing with them is a "real" American and anyone disagreeing is not. If you were elected, you were elected to serve everyone in your district and you'd better be trying to do just that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's one relatively harmless encounter. 

No, it does not mean that all, or even the majority of Trump supporters are racist bigots.

No, it does not mean that President Trump or any of his staff advocates this sort of behavior.

But it is true that attacks such as these have been increasing. It is true that many of President Trump's most extreme, most vocal supporters have said such things. It is true that he has been slow to denounce them, only specifically addressing it once and then after people kept commenting on his silence. It is true that the FBI's task force on terrorism was instructed to stop investigating white nationalist terrorists to focus exclusively on Muslim and IS.

So I don't see this one event as anything more than a drunken idiot, *by itself*. But I do see an ugly trend rising that we need to keep our eyes on. </TEXT>

1. It may defuse the situation. Sometimes when someone is being rude, they started off polite but got pissed when no one took them seriously or they felt they were getting the run-around. I've sent more than a few rude people away happy that way. 

2. You may discover an actual problem with your system or business and resolving it is a good thing which will head off customer problems in the future. If that's the case, you should not only fix it but thank them for pointing it out.

3. Anyone watching, including potentially your boss, will see that you did everything you could and are not at fault.

4. Other customers will be on your side.

5. If the customer is being rude just to be rude, it completely takes away their fun. They want drama, they want to make a scene, they want to get something for nothing, they want to get you upset because it's fun and because if you get rude back you justify everything they've been saying. Pissing someone off by being unfailingly polite is deeply satisfying and won't come back to bite you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The police get to decide what is peaceful and what is not.

The order, as written, includes anyone organizers, which is vague enough to include someone posting on Facebook about meeting up to protest.

There are already laws on the books for rioting. This is designed to scare people away from protesting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, no. The very first amendment protects the freedom "peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances."

Not giving that up without one hell of a fight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were, eventually. Sort of. "Trash," "The Message," and "Heart of Gold" were run the next summer during rerun season, six months after it was canceled, without much fanfare and no promotion.

	<TEXT> Trump's campaign [took a pile from private prison lobbyists](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/02/23/private-prisons-back-trump-and-could-see-big-payoffs-new-policies/98300394/).

[A couple of Sessions' aides took jobs as private prison lobbyists.](http://altoday.com/archives/12888-private-prison-company-hires-former-jeff-session-aides-lobby-d-c)

In the expansion of the illegal immigrant roundup memos, one of the changes was that immigrants would be detained as soon as they were charged, rather than after being convicted, and that [new detainment locations should be built immediately](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/trumps-immigration-detention-center-expansion). 

Sessions has announced that steps would be taken over states that have legalized marijuana.

It's the perfect combination for the GOP and the white nationalists that have moved in: get rid of the non-white people and the druggies, treat them horribly, and make money doing it.

	<TEXT> It's not there for the money. It's to silence dissent and any public political speech the people in power don't want heard. 

Getting money out of it is just a bonus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a well-done show with a good mix of funny and dramatic elements, helmed by a guy who at the time could do no wrong and had a cult following already for his previous shows. Joss Whedon threw everything he had into this one, with a lightning-in-a-bottle cast and excellent writers, and his fans quickly loved this show about underdogs fighting against an unjust system and just trying to get by in the world. 

Then the network ran it out of order, pre-empted it every other week for local sports, canceled it, and THEN ran the two-hour premiere episode.

Now the online communities for Whedon's previous shows had grown and found each other and discovered the power of activism, something that was actively encouraged and promoted for the new show. Get lots and lots of people engaged in talking to each other and telling new people about a show, get them excited about it, and then have the show -- a show about misfits and exiles from society, mind you, people they identified with -- pulled out from under them: recipe for cult status.

When the DVD was released it broke sales records. All the episodes, in order, including the ones that weren't aired till much later, and (I think) every single one had some sort of commentary from the actors and creators of the show, all of whom are funny and charming and silly and appreciative of the fans. Now the fans could see what could have been and got even more pissed off. And they bought more DVDs and pushed them on friends and family. 

Being a Browncoat meant becoming part of a welcoming community for many fans. A decade later the show still tops "which show shouldn't have been canceled" lists.

Also, it's a really fun show. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On paper, women have the same rights as men.

In reality, women tend to get paid less for the same positions (your specific circumstance notwithstanding), they tend to get talked over in meetings, they tend to get overlooked in hiring in many industries, they tend to be treated as sex objects. It is an uphill battle getting many of those in law enforcement to take any rape besides the "crazed pervert" version you mentioned seriously. They often face enough harassment and condescension in the STEM fields that they are grossly underrepresented in those industries.

Basically, women are often treated, by default, as less than men in every particular. Obviously there are places where this is  not the case, and society overall is getting better about at least noticing and acknowledging it if not doing much about it, but the view of women as second-class still remains.

When women talk about rights, they know the rights are (mostly) already on the books. What they want is attention to the fact that those rights are being ignored far too often.

(By your request, I avoided abortion, even though that's a large part of why people are marching. The Oklahoma anti-abortion bill that a legislator defended by saying that pregnant women were host bodies is a perfect example of how many people feel about women.) </TEXT>
