	<TEXT> https://ivn.us/2015/07/30/story-behind-pay-party-primaries/

The origin of government-administered primaries begins in the late 1800s and early 1900s, when state governments began to intervene to curb the influence of party bosses and tackle corruption. A series of reforms  including regulations, the adoption of the Australian ballot, and direct primaries  culminated in the formation of a hybrid system, whereby public funds are used to administer primary elections that in some states bar participation by unaffiliated voters. </TEXT>

If this theory is true than NATO must prepare for chemical weapon attacks in the European theatre again because Russia is in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.  That would turn an arguably minor attack by a failing regime into something that just can't be substantiated without major, major implications.  

I just don't see this theory panning out.  If NATO thought that Russia was using chemical weapons there would be a shrill panic right now.  Russia isn't that stupid.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why can't they?  We have no evidence of Russia colluding with Assad to use chemical weapons.  Why would they?  Do people understand the implications of Russia violating the Chemical Weapons Convention?  If Russia is violating the ban, that means NATO's entire strategy to fight Russia must change.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're fundamentally misunderstanding what's being put to question here. I haven't seen anybody question whether the chemical attacks were carried out or not, but why it was done. I haven't seen anybody question whether 50+ tomahawk missiles were in fact fired, but rather whether real damage was done to the base.

No, I am not misunderstanding anything, [look at #SyriaHoax.](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SyriaHoax src=tyah) There are real accounts across the political spectrum claiming the attack never even happened. 

[How the alt-right brought #SyriaHoax to America](https://medium.com/dfrlab/how-the-alt-right-brought-syriahoax-to-america-47745118d1c9)

 US President Donald Trumps decision to launch strikes against Syria in the wake of a major chemical weapons attack provoked outrage from the far-right groups who were his most aggressive supporters. As rumors of the impending strikes broke, they launched an online campaign claiming that the chemical attack had been a hoax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm seeing this conspiracy theory across the political spectrum.  

Some Clinton, Trump, Stein, Johnson and Sanders supporters are posting RT and Sputnik links about this attack on Twitter right now.  It is just so embarrassing to see people getting conned by Russia after the Senate hearing last month about this exact thing.

	<TEXT> Not all of them.  The moderate GOP congress critters in the Tuesday Group are already sharpening their knives for Trump.  The moderates in the GOP will be the ones who suffer electorally for Trump's unfavorability rating come 2018.  

As we approach the midterms, look to see the most divided GOP in modern history.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get the conspiracy theory here.  

We have international aid organizations in this besieged city confirming two chemical weapon attacks, we have a satellite image showing two craters matching the description of the attack, and US allies including France, Canada, and the UK have seen radar and IR data on the flight path of the planes that dropped these chemical weapons. 

Where is the conspiracy, are people seriously implying that Syria has crisis actors being flown in like Sandy Hook?   </TEXT>
