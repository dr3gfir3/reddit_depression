	<TEXT> This has nothing to do with Companion/WW dialogue. I am not a vampire lord. I have no diseases or afflictions. I do not use mods on this character and have no enabled. I literally just snagged the Oblivion Walker trophy and before I shut off the game for the night, another NPC said that I smell. I've been playing this game since day one with only minor breaks and never had this. I'm on PS4 if that helps. Anyone else have this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What exactly did you want to happen? I'm not even a big fan of Harry Potter but I've seen them all because I like movies and going to the theater.

I went to this movie last night and thought it was pretty good and now all I'm seeing is hate. I just want to know what you wanted to see that would have made it better.  </TEXT>
