	<TEXT> Can't agree on either of these. [Germany is quite big in homosexuals, in fact the biggest in the EU](http://www.towleroad.com/2016/10/germany-lgbt/) and also:

In other countries, incestuous relationships between consenting adults (with the age varying by location) are permitted, including in **the Netherlands, France, Slovenia and Spain. Sweden** is the only country that allows marriage between half-siblings and they must seek government counseling before marriage.[134]

The most public case of consensual adult sibling incest in recent years is the case of a brother-sister couple from Germany, Patrick Stbing and Susan Karolewski. 

In the Netherlands, marrying one's nephew or niece is legal, but only with the explicit permission of the Dutch Government, due to the possible risk of genetic defects among the offspring.

Historically:

Many European monarchs were related due to political marriages, sometimes resulting in distant cousins (and even first cousins) being married. This was especially true in the Habsburg, Hohenzollern, Savoy and Bourbon royal houses. However, relations between siblings, that may have been tolerated in other cultures, was considered abhorrent. For example, the accusation that Anne Boleyn and her brother George Boleyn had committed incest was one of the reasons that both siblings were executed in May 1536.

	<TEXT>  He has always seemed like the type of person who would prefer to build his control over the population by focusing them on an imagined enemy to fight against, as a way to ignore the problems that aren't actually trying to be fixed with the country.
 It's similar to the tactics used by the Republican Party in the US

I have a few pretty simple questions:

1. So who/what exactly is that "an imagined enemy" you talk about? Examples.

2. Indeed, that type of tactic is typical for the US, most recently however it's a part of the strategy of the Dems, not so much of the Reps, and again fear mongering in the US is a more of a State/Govt policy in general.

3. Why are the names of those murdered not mentioned? They def have nothing to hide anymore or fear for their lives. Do you, or anyone, expect people to be moved just by some MSM claims not supported by facts? And as you are the one making parallels with the US - how about that SINGLE act in Orlando where 49 gay people were shot dead and many others wounded?

	<TEXT> **EU Says It Cant Block Russia-Backed Nord Stream 2 Pipeline
EUs executive arm proposes negotiations with Moscow to ease the security concerns of some member states**

BRUSSELSThe European Union is giving up on efforts to stop a Russian pipeline project and instead proposing negotiations with Moscow to alleviate the security concerns of some of its members.

Under pressure from about a dozen governments led by Poland, the EU had been attempting to block Nord Stream 2, which would provide a second gas link from Russia to Germany and double the Baltic Sea export capacity of Russian state-owned energy company, PAO Gazprom.

At stake is increasing the blocs reliance on Russian energy at a time when Brussels has sanctioned Moscow for its military intervention in Ukraine and EU governments warn of political meddling by the Kremlin. The pipeline would allow Russia to divert its gas shipments to Europe away from Ukraine, cutting off an economic lifeline for the country beleaguered by violence and instability.

In a March 28 letter to the Danish and Swedish governments, seen Thursday by The Wall Street Journal, the European Commission, the EUs executive arm, said it has no basis to bar the planned pipeline.

Pushing for a political solution, the commission said it would seek a mandate from EU governments to broker a deal with Russia that would define Nord Stream 2s legal framework and align it with Brusselss priorities.

We dont like Nord Stream 2 politically, said Anna-Kaisa Itkonen, an energy spokeswoman at the commission. This being said, there are no legal grounds for the commission to oppose Nord Stream 2because [EU] rules do not apply to the offshore part of the pipeline.

The letter, written in response to a Jan. 25 request by Denmark and Sweden for a prompt assessment of the pipeline project, ends a long-running debate on whether the EUs political concerns could be translated into legal action against Nord Stream 2.

Still, the commission reiterated its position that the project jars with EU objectives to diversify and secure gas-supply sources, curb dependence on major providers like Gazprom, and prevent a concentration of transit routes.

The commission sees no need for new infrastructure of the magnitude of Nord Stream 2, Vice President Maros Sefcovic and Energy Commissioner Miguel Arias Caete said in their letter. The commission will also continue supporting the transit of Russian gas through Ukraine.

Policy makers are crafting the commissions request for a mandate to broker a deal with Russia, and a timeline for the process is not yet available, an EU official said.

Putins Pipelines

The Swedish port of Karlshamn is taking part in Russia's expansion of the Nord Stream pipeline, while the island of Gotland declined.

The commissions statements contain no major revelations, said Russias envoy to the EU, Ambassador Vladimir Chizhov. He declined to comment on whether Russia would negotiate a bilateral agreement with the EU on Nord Stream 2, citing the lack of a proposal for talks.

It is also unclear whether EU governments that have sparred over Nord Stream 2 would green-light the commissions bid to seek a deal with Russia.

Poland and other eastern members of the EU, which benefit from transit fees and supply security as long as Russia uses existing pipelines, staunchly oppose doubling the existing Baltic Sea connections capacity to 110 billion cubic meters a yearenough to meet Germany and Frances combined annual consumption.

Berlin, on the other hand, has sought to prevent political meddling in Gazproms project, which is also backed by European energy companies.

During an October 2015 meeting in Russia with President Vladimir Putin, then German Economic Affairs and Energy Minister Sigmar Gabriel said the parties should strive to ensure that the EU doesn't get regulatory oversight of Nord Stream 2. If we can do this, then opportunities for external meddling will be limited, said Mr. Gabriel, who is now Germanys foreign minister.

Even if EU governments mandate the commission to negotiate with Russia, Moscow may have little incentive to sit down for talks on an intergovernmental agreement now that the EU has said it lacks authority on offshore pipelines.

For Nord Stream 2, a wholly owned subsidiary of Gazprom based in Switzerland, the commissions acknowledgment marks a major vindication. The companywhich had been planned as a joint venture including Royal Dutch Shell PLC, Wintershall AG, Uniper SE, OMV AG and Engie SA until Polish regulators derailed ithas long argued that it is fully compliant with all laws and regulations.


The European firms continue to back the project, which has already committed 4 billion ($4.3 billion), applied for regulatory approval in Sweden, and shipped about 700 kilometers of pipes to warehouses around the Baltic Sea, more than a quarter of whats needed.

The commission confirmed that the national authorities are in charge of approving the project, which is something we have said all along, said Sebastian Sass, Nord Stream 2s EU representative. As far as an intergovernmental agreement is concerned, we dont see a need for that, because for us the legal framework is clear.
