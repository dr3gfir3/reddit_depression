	<TEXT> The essential problem is the profit-making insurance model for covering the cost of health care. 

Illness is not an accident. It is a part of life. The high fixed cost of providing a healthcare system, starting with the education of medical professionals, makes the system resemble the economic structure of a public utility rather than a competitive commodity. The competitive insurance model has failed. It is time to transition to a public service model with universal coverage, like fire and police. No one (not even the top .01%) is wealthy enough to have modern healthcare once the system has fallen apart, due to cutthroat competition. Reality must trump ideology.

Bottom Line: It's not profitable to insure people with a high risk of being sick. In fact, the whole "health insurance" game is sick. Insurance companies' profits depend on screening out people who need healthcare, and patients hold off spending on healthcare coverage until they know they'll need it. Who's fooling whom? Everyone. It's time to change the game to one that makes sense. Healthcare systems have high fixed cost. They need the broadest market base to cover those costs. Services should be provided based on medical need, not income -- something like fire protection services, or water supply, or highway repair, or some other public utility. It could be privately run, and highly regulated. Or it could be run by a government. But it can't be run as a commodity market.

This is why the private insurance model doesn't work. ACA helped expand coverage. But now the sick chickens have come home to roost -- getting care they previously couldn't afford -- and their lives are not profitable to insure. So private insurers are getting out, or jacking up rates. Leaving us with a problem: EITHER throw the sick ones overboard (unless they have the cash to pay their own bills) -- i.e., repeal ACA for Republican "consumer-driven" private health care, OR recognize that we've kicked the can down the road to a dead end, and have to replace the private insurance model with tax-financed health care for all, where we're all in, and the healthy pay up front to cover the current sick, knowing that they will be covered when their turn comes. That's civilized -- a quaint concept, don't you think?

The market alternative to a Single Payer healthcare system turns out to be massive mergers and downsizing in the healthcare industry. This is leading to a private Single Provider system, whose sole objective is profit maximization.  I, for one, am not comfortable putting my health into those Invisible Hands.

According to a recent report, www.WhenHospitalsMerge.org , the number of public short-term acute care hospitals in the U.S. dropped an astonishing 34 percent between 2001 and 2016. The number of secular nonprofit hospitals, too, shrunk by 11 percent, while for-profit systems shot up by more than 50 percent. In rural areas, where it is harder to turn a profit, these trends have left tremendous disparities in health care access. 

Clinton corporate Democrats orient towards existing power. They see their role as supplicants, negotiating out of weakness, always working within the framework of corporate rule.  The result in healthcare, ACA,  was sold as a great business plan for Big Pharma and the insurance industry. What corporate Democrats have always had to sell is their ability to assure consent of the people. They tell us not to struggle, just trust them to speak for us. Bernie Sanders opened the escape hatch.  A lot of people are no longer in the herd. Now they have to figure out how to continue to act together, finding the means as well as the will to wrest back their democratic power.  

For many, electing Donald Trump was the first step in asserting themselves  breaking free from the system of false promises.  When they find that Donald is just another false prophet, that the promised land is still beyond their grasp, will they be ready to take charge, democratically, for themselves?  Thats the direction Sanders proposed, but it wont be easy.  The way forward only works when people stay mobilized and involved.  </TEXT>

[The entire portfolio of USACE Civil Works water resources infrastructure and programs, existing and proposed, could be affected by climate change and adaptation to climate change. This affects design and operational assumptions about resource supplies, system demands or performance requirements, and operational constraints.

	<TEXT> HIAS, the global Jewish nonprofit that protects refugees, today called on President-elect Donald J. Trump to uphold the United States longstanding policy of protecting refugees.
,,,
 Welcoming and protecting refugees resonates especially deeply in the Jewish community, which remembers the plight of Jews who were turned away during World War II when they had nowhere else to go. Then, as now, governments and politicians falsely cast refugees as a threat, when they should have been sheltering them from the threats they were fleeing. No one expects to one day become a refugee. When families are suddenly forced to leave everything they know behind and flee their home country, its because they had no safe alternative." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump garnered fewer overall votes nationwide than John McCain and Mitt Romney, the past two losing GOP nominees, did in 2008 and 2012. As of this writing, with almost all votes counted, Trump has tallied 59,611,678 votes; Romney pulled in 60,933,504 in 2012, and McCain 59,948,323 in 2008.

By comparison, Hillarys 59,814,018 votes (which won her the popular vote, but not the Electoral College vote) is considerably less than the 69,498,516 Obama got in 2008, and the 65,915,795 he received in 2012 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The scandal is that Comey choked twice in the face of an insurrection by the Giuliani crew at the New York office.  First, fearing criticism of his findings, on July 5 he defensively justified his decision that no prosecution be pursued -- opening up this can of worms.  Then the friends of Giuliani in the NYC FBI office played Comey a second time, holding back information that they had -- that Weiner's laptop was shared  with Huma and had a copy of Huma's email files on it. They strategically told Comey about two weeks before the election.  Comey feared the news would be leaked to Giuliani (as it had, if Giuliani's boast to Fox News, days prior to Comey's late October announcement, can be believed).  Comey caved on Friday, October 28, announcing to Congress that evidence against Hillary might exist in these unexamined files.  Now we know that there was no there there.  But the damage has been done, as planned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> JA: Theres an early 2014 email from Hillary Clinton, not so long after she left the State Department, to her campaign manager John Podesta that states ISIL is funded by the governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar.  Now this is the most significant email in the whole collection, and perhaps because Saudi and Qatari money is spread all over the Clinton Foundation.  Even the U.S. government agrees that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIL, or ISIS. But the dodge has always been that, well its just some rogue Princes, using their cut of the oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves.

But that email says that no, it is the governments of Saudi and Qatar that have been funding ISIS. </TEXT>

Of course the FBI, which was investigating the Watergate break-in, refused to confirm Woodward and Bernstein's story:
Asked by The Washington Post to discuss Segretti, three FBI and Justice Department officials involved in the Watergate probe refused. At the mention of Segretti's name, each said -- in the words of one -- "That's part of the Watergate investigation." One of the officials, however, became angry at the mention of Segretti's name and characterized his activities as "indescribable." </TEXT>

The new mechanism will be a public one and not based on ad hoc tribunals. This reform means that investors can be protected from discrimination in a narrow number of cases, but in a manner which does not leave any room for concern on the right of states to regulate in the public interest.  The procedures of the Investment Court will be transparent and its judges appointed by the EU and Canada.The Commission is committed to completing and refining the reform of investment dispute resolution and the discussions of the past few weeks and days have helped shape that commitment. </TEXT>

On Oct. 3, F.B.I. agents seized several electronic devices from Mr. Weiner: a laptop, his iPhone and an iPad that was in large measure used by his 4-year-old son to watch cartoons, a person with knowledge of the matter said. Days later, F.B.I. agents also confiscated a Wi-Fi router that could identify any other devices that had been used, the person said.

While searching the laptop, the agents discovered the existence of tens of thousands of emails, some of them sent between Ms. Abedin and other Clinton aides, according to senior law enforcement officials. It is not clear if Ms. Abedin downloaded the emails to the laptop or if they were automatically backed up there. The emails dated back years, the officials said. Ms. Abedin has testified that she did not routinely delete her emails. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The deeper problem is the profit-making insurance model for covering the cost of health care.  Illness is not an accident.  It is a part of life.  The high fixed cost of providing a healthcare system, starting with the education of medical professionals, makes the system follow the economic structure of a public utility rather than a competitive commodity.  The competitive insurance model has failed.  It is time to transition to a public service model with universal coverage, like fire and police.  No one (not even the top .01%) is wealthy enough to have modern healthcare once the system has fallen apart, due to cutthroat competition. Reality must trump ideology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Starting with Chris Wallace's question:
I want to ask you here on the stage tonight, do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely - sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election?

TRUMP: I will look at it at the time. I'm not looking at anything now. I will look at it at the time. What I've seen - what I've seen is so bad. First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing that the New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care. And it's so dishonest, and they've poisoned the minds of the voters. But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on Nov. 8, but I think they're gonna see through it.

Trump never definitively says anything.  He expresses himself by innuendo and insinuation, charges without backup -- never evidence, never clear statements.  Fuzzy thinkers operate on overall feelings.  They feel comfortable with "knowing what he means" and are annoyed by anyone trying to pin Trump down to a clear statement.  So in answering whether he would commit to "accept the result of this election" Trump's response is "I will look at it at the time." And his explanation appears to be that the media have "poisoned the minds of the voters".  That's where the logical steps end.  He veers off to say "I think the voters are seeing through it. I think they're going to see through it. We'll find out on Nov. 8, but I think they're gonna see through it."  The implication -- but Trump never directly makes his point -- is that if the voters see through the media's poison, he will be elected, and he will, of course, accept the results.  But if their minds have been poisoned, and he loses, he would find that result to be unacceptable.  Time for a 2nd Amendment insurrection? As Trump says:  "I will keep you in suspense." </TEXT>

In that speech, he said in the email, I wrote her a long riff about economic fairness and how the financial industry has lost its way, precisely for the purpose of having something we could show people if ever asked what she was saying behind closed doors for two years to all those fat cats. He also acknowledged that it was definitely not as tough or pointed as we would write it now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> global material productivity has declined since about the year 2000 and the global economy now needs more materials per unit of GDP than it did at the turn of the century. While this may seem counter-intuitive it has been caused by a large shift of economic activity from very material-efficient economies such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Europe to, at this time, the much less material-efficient economies of China, India and Southeast Asia. This results in overall growing environmental pressure per unit of economic activity and shows that additional effort around public policy and financing is required to improve material use efficiency substantially in the coming decades.

This is the kind of understanding that is needed to make trade policy that would work for people and the environment, rather than just heighten profits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This discussion article lays out the territory for a real debate about immigration.  I don't agree with several main points:
1) stagnating real income in the U.S. reflects competitive pressure globally, and changing technology, not immigration.
2) the idea that the U.S. was 85% "white" until recent immigration shifted the balance is a misunderstanding of what "white" is all about.  Foreign-born residents from Europe were often seen as a threat by native-born Americans.  But they became integrated and defined as "white" America.  Left behind as outsiders -- as "nonwhite" -- are Blacks and Spanish-speaking immigrants who form a large enough group to maintain a cultural community, even though they participate as workers in the larger society.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Michael Hudson offers a powerful critique.  I  know his work from the Left Forum.  I see it reproduced in UNZ which appears to be alt-right.  Hudson points to the problem.  He doesn't discuss solutions.  That allows essentially correct analysis to be used as ammunition to propagate reactionary nationalist utopianism.  A left-green alternative would not be an easy solution.  It relies on people to choose a path away from slaughter, and a recognition that uncontrolled climate change will sink us all.  My alternative is NOT Politically Correct.  But it would give humans a fighting chance to survive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I want radical change, and I come from a different place than Trump.  One difference is that my vision doesn't allow for shortcuts.  As Eugene Victor Debs said a hundred years ago: 
[Too long have the workers of the world waited for some Moses to lead them out of bondage. I would not lead you out if I could; for if you could be led out, you could be led back again. I would have you make up your minds there is nothing that you cannot do for yourselves.](http://www.azquotes.com/author/3810-Eugene_V_Debs)

For the democratic process to be effective in bringing about change, we have to want to listen and work with each other.   It can't be a winner-takes-all world because the cost of coercing other people to play your game is too high.  I want to convince you that climate change is real, and we have to live within the real.  There are problems, but we can solve them.  Now that may sound like Hillary, but she can't deliver because she believes that existing power cannot be challenged.  And existing institutions like the banks and Wall St. hog resources we cannot afford to waste.  I live in New York, so I feel free to vote for Jill Stein.  But if I lived in a toss up state, I'd have to vote for Hillary. Stopping One Man Rule, is my first priority.  Fighting President Clinton will be hard, but at least the veneer of democratic process will remain intact.  There will be space to mobilize the movement we need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason democratic institutions of governance exist is because people fought for their right to self-rule.  The victory has only been partial.  The struggle continues.  Our ability to self-rule politically is subverted by concentrated power in few hands, who own and control the institutions that are needed to make actions effective.  The problem can't be simply abolished.  But it can be mitigated, with struggle. If we want to live in a society that does better for more of its people, we need to defend fair and free elections, and organize ourselves as active agents to counter the weight of institutional power (most crudely, money,  but also, leaving the heavy thinking to the experts).  Unrigging the system will not be easy.  You can cut the Gordian knot, but then everything that knot held together will fall apart unless you've built an alternative structure to keep things working.  Remember: Don't Give Up.  There's no one to surrender to.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After the election is past, the real struggle begins.  By proclaiming that this election is "rigged", Trump is pivoting from politics within the American Constitutional system to delegitimizing elected institutions, and making the U.S. government "fair game" for popular resistance -- without the inhibition of "non-violence".  Fighting dirty is what he knows and what he teaches.  And if sections of the police and army can be split from their oaths of loyalty to defend the Constitution...  
The republic is in jeopardy.  Unfortunately, Hillary and corporate politicians are too weak to defend democratic order, because they don't have a better future to offer.  We need to re-invent a democratic future worth fighting for.  And that fight starts with ideas and political engagement that mobilizes people after the election is over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Trump Taj Mahal, a 17-acre Jersey Shore gambling hub which cost more than $1 billion to build, was a losing proposition since it opened its doors in 1990. A report from CNN this summer found that the casino started bleeding money almost immediately, before filing for bankruptcy four times.

About two weeks after the Trump Taj Mahal opened, the now-G.O.P. nominee told Larry King in an interview that his new venture was a tremendous success. In reality, according to CNN, the casinos bank account had less than zero dollars on four of the first 16 days that it had been open, amassing deficits of up to $1.7 million. Later that year, New Jersey approved a $65 million bailout for the hotel, and it filed for bankruptcy for the first time a year later.

When his daddy's support tapped out, the nanny state of New Jersey came to the rescue.  But it wasn't enough.  Bankruptcy followed bankruptcy.  But Donald, in his genius, converted each of these disasters (paid for by other people) into opportunities for himself.  And he can do the same for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive known Jeff for 15 years, Trump said. Terrific guy. Hes a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it  Jeffrey enjoys his social life....

Epstein has spent the bulk of his adult life cultivating relationships with the worlds most powerful men. Flight logs show that from 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epsteins private plane, dubbed The Lolita Express by the press, 26 times. After Epsteins arrest in July 2006, federal tax records show Epstein donated $25,000 to the Clinton Foundation that year.
Epstein was also a regular visitor to Donald Trumps Mar-a-Lago, and the two were friends. According to the Daily Mail, Trump was a frequent dinner guest at Epsteins home, which was often full of barely dressed models. In 2003, New York magazine reported that Trump also attended a dinner party at Epsteins honoring Bill Clinton.
Last year, The Guardian reported that Epsteins little black book contained contact numbers for A-listers including Tony Blair, Naomi Campbell, Dustin Hoffman, Michael Bloomberg and Richard Branson.

Somehow, neither Gary Johnson nor Jill Stein were on Jeffrey's A List.

	<TEXT> CNN interviewed Mitnick on air via satellite and asked him about the Trump campaigns argument that avoiding taxes meant Trump had dealt with the tax code brilliantly. Mitnick said that Trump had virtually zero role in preparing his own taxes. His only contribution was to hire Mitnick. Here, Mitnick gave a grin. He was enjoying himself. Those returns were entirely created by us, Mitnick said.

So Trump is not a tax code genius.  And he can't retaliate against Mitnick's blowing his boast because he still needs Mitnick to answer any questions from IRS auditors -- unless there really is no audit.  Then Donald would be called upon to release his tax returns, as promised -- whose contents he doesn't understand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> John Faso is in a close race in upstate New York with Zephyr Teachout.  Faso's support for Trump has not changed -- but it was already minimal.  To his distress he can't separate himself from the Trump ticket on which he is down-ballot.  His vulnerability is that his party proved itself to be so bankrupt of believable Presidential candidates that all of the contenders were rejected.  We now understand: it's not only the cream that rises to the top; it's also the scum.  Trump's gaseous content, his low specific gravity, propelled him to the top of the heap, atop a sea of rejected Republican politicians.  Faso's problem is the disgust factor, which has begun to trump party loyalty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came across this description of Coney Island in decline while looking for references to my old optometrist, Dr. Irving Herzenberg, who is interviewed for this article.  I grew up in Coney Island from birth (1942) until I left for grad school in 1962.  (I just came across an old eyeglass case with Dr. Herzenberg's imprint.)  Trump Village is just being built in 1964.  Fred Trump had already built Beach Haven, just to the north of the Belt Parkway.   My uncle and his family moved from East Flatbush to the Warbasse Houses, which were in between the Trump properties. Warbasse was also being built at the time (1964).   In retrospect, the housing shortage after World War II, and the failure to build housing that the poor could afford, led to poor people moving into substandard housing, growing conflicts, and old neighborhoods -- predominantly Jewish, but also Italian -- being displaced.  Many of those fleeing their old neighborhoods wound up in Fred Trump's new developments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The brilliant idea of not paying taxes only works as long as other people pay your share of the social burden.  Otherwise you're on your way to a failed state, where only fools pay taxes, and vital government services don't work.  That used to be the story in "less developed" countries, but not so much in the U.S.A.  But cynicism about social responsibility has corroded the moral fabric that kept the republic intact.  About 40 years we crested, and as real living standards stagnated, the bitterness that has turned us against each other set in.  The idea that total abandonment of responsibility is "smart" is a thief's ethic.  Read the damn article and you'll see why Trump knows the problem because his business model IS the problem:

Mr. Trump hasnt hesitated to castigate corporate executives and Wall Street money managers for taking advantage of tax loopholes, and has proposed eliminating the favorable treatment of their income, a tax benefit that pales in significance to the magnitude of his.

Yet Mr. Trump chose not to release his returns, and his tax proposals would not close a single loophole that benefits him. On the contrary, he would make the tax code even more favorable to real estate developers like himself. He would lower the tax rate to 15 percent for limited liability companies and partnerships, the very entities in which Mr. Trump holds most of his assets.

He hasnt proposed anything to address these loopholes, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.

At the broadest level, Mr. Trumps tax avoidance undermines the entire tax system, which rests on the foundation that every citizen pays a fair share.

Our whole system is based on voluntary compliance, Mr. Rosenthal said. How will people react when they see a self-proclaimed billionaire like Trump pays no tax? Why should they pay?

Mr. Rosenthal said it reminded him of the famous quote attributed to the hotel owner Leona Helmsley: Only the little people pay taxes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Statement of the Campaign for Peace and Democracy,
   
          We are supporters of the democratic Syrian Revolution and opponents of military intervention from the outside. We oppose all attacks on civilians in Syria, whether committed by the Assad regime and its allies, by ISIS, by other jihadist groups, or by anyone else. We support the call for the removal of all foreign fighters from Syria: the anti-regime jihadis, the U.S. special ops forces, and the Turkish army, but also the Russians, Iranians, Hezbollah, and numerous Shiite militias backing Assad. It is a humanitarian and political imperative that the horrific bloodletting in Syria be brought to an end.
         
A cease-fire deal was recently negotiated by U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. The cease-fire, however, has collapsed, following what Washington called its accidental strike on Syrian government soldiers and then what was most likely an intentional bombing by Russian or Syrian aircraft, or both, of an aid convey trying to get supplies to one of the many areas besieged by regime forces.
 
           But the Kerry-Lavrov arrangement was flawed from the start. It failed to address the underlying political issues of the crisis, and was therefore doomed to failure. Worse, had it been consummated, it would have meant joint bombing by the United States, Russia, and the Syrian government of many thousands of the people now being bombed by the Russians and Assad. In the name of fighting terrorists, innocent civilians and democratic rebels would have been bombed along with ISIS and other jihadists, the latter located near Free Syrian Army units -- as they are being bombed now -- but the bombing would have taken place with the seal of approval and participation of the U.S. government.
 
           As it stands, the assault by Assad and his various foreign allies on Aleppo is shaping up as a humanitarian catastrophe of the first order. The current ferocious bombardment of civilian targets there is just the beginning. On October 1, there will be a "Global Day of Rage for Allepo," with [worldwide demonstrations](https://www.facebook.com/Global-Campaign-of-Solidarity-with-the-Syrian-Revolution-147353662105485/) in solidarity with the people of Aleppo and against the sieges, the barrel-bombing and missiles, the intentional targeting of rescue and healthcare facilities and workers -- and the lies and diplomatic charades.
 
            In New York City, a demonstration will be held on Saturday, October 1, 1:00 pm, at Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, 48th Street and   1st Avenue. In Chicago, demonstrators will gather at 1:00pm on Saturday at the plaza just south of the Tribune Media Building, on Michigan Avenue, at the north east end of the Dusable Bridge across the Chicago River, and in Washington DC  at the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, at noon on Saturday. Check here for other events in the U.S. and around the world.
 
            We are also writing to draw your attention to two recent statements about the Syrian crisis (included below): "An Open Letter about Syria: the Russia-US Bombing Deal Will Bring Neither Peace Nor Justice," and "Syrian Writers, Artists, and Journalists Speak Out Against US and Russian Policy," published by The Nation. Both statements are signed by individuals, not organizations.
 
In peace and solidarity,
Joanne                Tom
