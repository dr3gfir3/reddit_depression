Whenever people learn where I'm from, they want to know about the Woodland Butcher.

It's not the first question people ask me  that distinction belongs to my birthmark.

They don't ask with their voices, but with how their eyes traced the lines forming a handprint over the right of my face. There, the palm on my cheek and the thumb bisecting my mouth like a harelip, the index and middle fingers slicing across my dark eyes and into my dark hairline, and the wrist trailing down until it covered half of my body. It's crimson, vivid against the golden tones of my skin, and no one could look away when I walked down the street.

My mother said it was because an angel held me real tight before I was born. My classmates considered me cursed, and my father agreed with them. Auguste thinks it makes me beautiful.

I can't talk about the Woodland Butcher without talking about Auguste. I can't talk about myself without talking about Auguste. All three of us are tied up together in ways the true crime novels could never detangled, if they could even find the ends. They all weigh heavy on me.

I'm going to tell you about the Woodland Butcher. But first, Auguste. And summer.

---

The summer before my junior year of high school was a rolling boil.

The air hung like a wet wool blanket and you drank it in instead of breathing it. The neat asphalt roads of my sleepy little town were melting, and the carefully manicured lawns of the two and three story track houses were turning brown. The forest surrounded us, engulfed us, and filled the air with the scent of dried pine.

At the end of town, right before a trailhead that wound its way through the trees, was a 7-11 that I used to walk to in the mornings before it got too hot. I'd fill up my backpack with snacks and then fuck off into the woods to read poetry and avoid my cavernous, echoing house  my mother made partner a month earlier, and my sister had elected to spend summer at her college town. The woods weren't so deafening.

That July day, one of many slow ones that unfurled after the clamor of the Fourth, seemed like any other. I made my trek, freckles blossoming across my broad shoulders, and the air condition of the 7-11 blasted me in the face and irritated my eyes. I nodded at the bored cashier and started weaving my way through the aisles.

Auguste was in the magazine aisle, which seemed like a stupid place to meet someone like him, but I rounded the corner and stopped to gape at him standing there, all the colors of milk and honey. His golden hair brushed against his shoulders and his face was carved from alabaster, almond-shaped eyes made of emerald. I had never seen a boy like Auguste, and when he looked up at me, bright and beautiful, he smiled widely.

"Hello," he said cheerfully. "I'm Auguste, I just moved into the neighborhood."

"Leo," I replied. There was a weird, giddy feeling in my chest as Auguste stepped closer to me, pale and perfect. "It's nice to meet you."

Auguste giggled as if charmed. If love had a sound, it would be that.

Auguste was a creature meant for summer, meant for walking through the woods and having the sunlight illuminate the silhouette of his body through his thin tank top. The world felt quiet when he'd turn and look behind him, aristocratic fingers reaching out to tangle in my own. This experience, this youthful joy at touching and loving another, was so fresh and new to me I felt helpless to resist him.

Long summer days passed like that, meeting Auguste at the convenience store and heading out into the woods, laughter always bubbling out of our mouth. Auguste would trace the edges of my birthmark and place kisses on my brow, sweet and chaste, and I would teach him about Byron and the names for all the trees. We were young and in love in a delirious way, drunk on learning everything about each other.

"This place doesn't have any stories," Auguste told me. My head was in his lap as we lounged beside the pond, hidden so deep inside the woods no one from the outside could find it.

"It has one," I told him. Before the end of the year, it would have two.

There is a story about these woods, and we were told it every Halloween.

When the white settlers came, the indigenous people told them that these woods were already settled by a spirit crowned with antlers, and this spirit jealously guarded its domain from all outsiders. Like they always do in these stories, the white men did not listen.

In the night, a beautiful maiden would appear to one of the settlers and lure him into the woods. In the morning, the rest would find the man torn to pieces, a look of ecstasy upon his face.

There were seven settlers and so the maiden appeared for six nights, until only one man  always mysteriously immune to her charms  remained on the seventh. Terrified, he waited with his rifle as the beautiful maiden came to him with long pale hair and crooned to him. She tried to draw him from the safety of the fire, but when he didn't listen to her sweet songs, she transformed in front of him.

Her body became tall and spindly, her skin a vivid red, and her pale hair twisted into a crown of antlers. Her sweet mouth opened into a vast chasm of teeth, and it ate the bullets the terrified man shot at it before he ran from the camp.

It chased after him so closely that the man could feel the hot breath of the spirit on the back of his neck, and it followed him all the way to where the natives dwelled, stopping right at the edge where the woods led to their village. It could not cross into civilization from the wild, and the man, it is said, never left the Native village for the rest of his days out of fear of it.

An activist told this story when a property group tried to push the boundaries of the town deeper into the woods. Three days later, the inspector demarking the subdivision was found mauled and shredded, and all development halted. Our town remained the same size it always has.

I was in the third grade, and everyone was convinced the monster was me because we both had red sin. This backfired on the head bully  my older sister and I crept into the woods right outside his backyard, and she held me on her shoulders as I held up cardboard antlers. We could hear his screams of terror from our spot, and ran away laughing before his father could find us.

"He never talked about it again," I told Auguste. His fine-boned fingers traced around my birthmark and across the bridge of my prominent nose.

"I know who to call upon to frighten my enemies away," Auguste murmured. His hair was like spun sunlight. My whole body felt warm. The summer had gone on for what felt like years.

Summers always die.

The sounds of crashing undergrowth announced the arrival of the elite to the pond, carrying towels and wearing bathing suits. I lurched up and tugged Auguste with me, intent on getting out of their as quickly as possible.

"What" Auguste said, right as Jackson Karl called out, "Look what we found!"

Jackson Karl was the quarterback, his father an executive and his mother a doctor. I suppose you can imagine what his smug face looked like.

"Come on," I murmured to Auguste. "Let's go somewhere else."

"But who are your friends, Leo?" Auguste asked me. His fingers were wrapped loosely around my wrist, and Jackson zeroed in on them immediately.

"Why are you hanging out with this loser?" Jackson asked, which was much different than what I expected  his tone was jealous instead of hateful. "Surely someone like you could do better."

Auguste scoffed and leaned up to my ear to whisper loudly, "Let's go to my house, Leo."

Jackson flushed a vivid, embarassed red as we left laughing. I didn't understand why for months.

We found the body a week later.

August was ending, the junior year on the horizon, and my own Auguste walked in front of me, leading me by the hand through the trees. I don't remember what we were talking about. We've talked about so many things.

The woods around us were silent, the trees as serious as temple pillars, and Auguste's hair glittered in the sun, pale skin glowing like alabaster. Before we stepped into the clearing, Auguste turned to laugh at me. I forget why. Things felt soft-focused and unreal, gauzy fabric pulled taunt across my eyes. I loved him in the gentle press of fingertips and closed lips in stolen moments.

The lines of the clearing were very stark, the colors so bright they felt unnatural. We stopped on the edge of it, Auguste pressed into my side, and dawned matching shocked expressions.

"Oh," Auguste said. We had never seen a dead body before.

There was Jackson, or at least half of him, his torso and head protruding out of the water. His blood was a red oil slick across the water, his ribcage torn upon so all his insides were outside and filled the clear with the smell of sun-rotted meat. His eyes were wide and glassy, yet his expression was one of a saint experiencing religious ecstasy.

We turned back to the 7-11 and called the cops. When they came, we led them through the quiet wood side by side and didn't touch each other. The cops told us to go home after we guided them to the pond. I wondered out loud if corpses could cause algae blooms, and Auguste hid his giggles into my shoulder; people thought he was crying.

Everyone knew Jackson was dead and that we found him before we reached the road, and they stared at us with wide gazes. No one spoke a word to us, as if seeing death marked us even more as outsiders. I didn't feel any different  maybe vaguely sad Dr. Karl had to see her son like that, but I wasn't upset over the body nor did I care about Jackson being dead. I didn't even really think about him unless the therapist my mom made me go to brought it up; my lack of response discomforted her greatly.

Auguste thought about it the same as me, but his parents never made him go to a therapist. Dr. and Mr. Veisi understood when Auguste needed help, and Auguste needed help as often as he cried.

Jackson was the first corpse, and the first victim of what they'd later name the Woodland Butcher. I didn't know that yet. I didn't know anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, by its very nature very experimental stuff has a tendency to crash and burn. Some of us naturally gravitate towards things that feed the hungry masses and are naturally "easier" reads, while some of us...don't. I mean, I write queer horror exclusively, I'm not pretending that I'm going to be one of the popular writers on Reddit. Cliche garbage is easy to consume when you're just scrolling through Reddit on your lunch break.

Hopefully by keeping up with the weird shit, people will start to like it! </TEXT>
