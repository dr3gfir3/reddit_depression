	<TEXT> The maternity leave example is a good one. I, the father, could have taken 4 months off paid if I was the primary parent staying home. My wife got 2 weeks paid, her saved vacation time and then took the remainder of 3 months off unpaid. I chose not to take the time because I wanted to be at work and saw some opportunities coming I did not want to miss out on. 

We both agreed we were better off, or the child was better off, with my wife staying home even if it meant less income.

I know this is a very specific example but it speaks to the point you are making and the decisions families make that effect the overall income of the woman, my wife in this example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for sharing that. Nicely organized and clearly presented. I have to ask, what's the end game? I am frankly not surprised that a bunch of super rich people have connections to Russia. Is the idea that Trump will somehow be in service to Russia? I mean business people doing business is Russia should not be surprising.

So no we draw a web of connection between all these people dating back pretty far in some instances;

 gt;8/10/2016 - "Howard has major investments in Russia," Trump told Russian politician Alexander Ivanovich Lebed after his trip to Moscow with Lorber, according to a 1997 profile of Trump in the New Yorker. See, they dont know you, Trump told Lorber. With all that investment, they dont know you. Trump they know. Source

To what end? If the end goal is accusing him of treason, which you will need some hard evidence for. 

Schiff has said there is no definitive evidence yet. I would say now that we are learning Trump has been unmasked for some time, I would think there would be definitive evidence? He also says in the below linked article that we shouldn't be jumping to conclusions...

With that being said, in the Wiki when referencing what people have said about the Trump/Russia meme there was no reference to former high ranked US officials saying they saw no evidence connecting Trump to Russia. Linked below. 

I know that with every connection seen it looks more and more definitive that Trump is so deeply tied to Russia, but I honestly think your looking at the trees. If you are going to make a definitive Wiki maybe some context would help, like showing what other major US political figures have connections to Russia...this will help to demonstrate that it is more common than perceived and not just look like Trump people are the only Americans who talk to Russians. 

Also, for context, when the Wiki references the Russian Ambassador personally meeting with Trump it leaves out that there were 3 other ambassadors there. So Trump met with 4 foreign ambassadors. And if you want to know what this obviously nefarious Ambassador looks like he is the fat bald Russian guy sitting with the Dems during The Presidents joint address to Congress this year. Source for Trump meeting with 4 Ambassadors is linked below. 

I am worried that hate for Trump is manifesting in this conspiracy theory and hope that it means he will be impeached. However, George Bush's former AG thinks that Trump could have emailed Putin asking for dirt on Hillary and that would not even be illegal. Linked below. 

I hope Congress can complete their investigations into Russian meddling so we can all move on together. I think part of that should require that the FBI actually analyze the DNC server, so that they can be an official source of blame for Russia and we aren't basing this off of Crowd Strikes analysis.

Either way thanks again for sharing and hopefully we can all move forward onto new ground together.

When you ignore that there were already high ranking Dems working to serve Russian interests, then you can paint a picture that the President is some sort of Russian stooge. So context allows for a broader view of the situation which puts a big thorn in the side of the Trump/Russia conspiracy.  </TEXT>

In eleven states that headquartered black-owned banks in 1994, not a single one is still in business. Of the fifty black-owned insurance companies that operated during the 1980s, today just two remain.

This article makes some really good points. The main issue seems to be that conglomerates are growing and 'small' business is shrinking. I also think for the Black owned business problem we need to make sure that investment funds are available for Black entrepreneurs.  

This is actually something that Trump has addressed during the campaign so let's see how he follows through on this promise. </TEXT>

We can encourage more economic development in these areas and provide on the job training for those who need jobs immediately. Then people from these neighborhoods can choose to stay and participate in the maintenance, continued development or new business or they can follow the infrastructure outward from the inner city and help train/build new projects.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  nonbelievers

That's the biggest chink in the climate change messaging, it has become a belief structure. My biggest problem with the arguments for human caused climate change as a majority negative thing is that much of the arguments are based off of modeling, which is continually adjusted. 

The best corollary I have heard is related to ulcers. Everyone was in agreement that ulcers were caused by stomach acid, this was a widely accepted explanation. Two guys hypothesized that ulcers were actually caused by a particular bacteria and when no one believed them one of the scientists took the bacteria and developed ulcers.

I am skeptical of any scientist or person claiming to have respect for science that chastises scientists for skepticism. There are a ton of testimonies and talks given by scientists who are skeptical of the human caused and catastrophic predictions by the people pushing the current Climate Change message. 

It is a problem when someone has a questions that that person is put out and called a denier.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was a bad move by the WH, it could be anything from trying to be 'muscular' to trying to hide evidence. 

I said this elsewhere in this thread and before that, I want an investigation so both of us cannot hold conflicting positions on what happened. I think there is nothing there and others think there is and until we have an investigation both this positions stand, on conjecture for the most part. 

I apologize as well for being a dick about the motives thing it can get pretty toxic in here and I may have been over reacting.

Either way I am anxious to put this behind us so we can resume MAGAing, together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  please do comment back once you look into that story. to do otherwise implies you're not here for fruitful discussion but just looking to confirm your world view.

Oh man, you are preemptively attributing motive? 

I read a  WaPo article:
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-sought-to-block-sally-yates-from-testifying-to-congress-on-russia/2017/03/28/82b73e18-13b4-11e7-9e4f-09aa75d3ec57_story.html?utm_term=.b6d5b4542402

So they tried to use executive privilege, which is not unheard of. They also tried to use attorney client privileged? 

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/when-presidents-invoke-executive-privilege/

looking through the history of executive privilege(above article), it is typically used to protect the person who would be testifying...which in this case wouldn't matter because Yates presumably wants to testify which explains the attorney client privilege move. 

So it was a power play that looks like it blew up on them. This certainly adds some intrigue to her testimony. 

My biggest problem with the whole Russia story line is so much of it is conjecture right now, we need to get to the facts and move on in a direction depending on the facts. </TEXT>

I think it is more that these men are, and i really hate this term, thought leaders. Bill gates alone is someone who has given away large sums of his fortune to better the world, and he also improved the world by revolutionizing computing.

	<TEXT> Originally I was defending the point of the article. But personally I think the bigger picture is the method and execution because we should understand it and learn from it, like you are saying. 

I don't see the wrong doing with the Trump aspect, what do you think they did wrong or criminal I guess is more accurate. 

I do not think the administration has handled the constant reporting well, if I had to guess I would say they didn't take it seriously at first. My guesses aside I would like the house to quite the drama and just get to the bottom of their investigation into both Russian method and execution and any Possible Trump admin wrong doing so we can move on. 

The first step would be to have an actual governmental organization examine the DNC server so we aren't resting all accusations on Crowdstrikes' analysis. 

I also find it odd that the Russians were paying healthy sums to the Podesta group to do their lobbying, which was closely associated with Trumps opponent, but then they undermined her campaign and collided with Trump? It's weird. 

Either way let's investigate it all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He went on TV and made a big deal about Rumps Russia ties more than once. He immediately holds a press conference following nunes after the surveillance presser. Always with Trump being the main talking point. 

The article makes the case that the big deal isn't about Trump, it is about how effectively Russia can manipulate the internet and investigating their methods. So by bickering about Trump they are missing the forest of the overall Russian efforts to alter American public opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This could have been a really great article if they didn't try to attribute some malicious attack on green energy. 

But the entire goal of Trumps panoply of executive orders  enabling more oil and gas development and weakening regulations on carbon emissions  is to prioritize dirty domestic energy sources (oil and coal) over clean domestic energy sources (natural gas, wind and solar).

Reducing regulations for 'dirty' energy sources is not a war on green energy. The article points out how green energy is on the rise and companies are making long term strategies around it. It also makes a point that an 8 year span of a President who isn't actively promoting green energy isn't enough to slow the growth of the industry. 

If they left the manufactured intent out then we see a picture of a shifting industry, which has little to do with Trump. 

I think the best case for solar is not an environmental one but a democratization of energy. What's says liberty like a self sufficient piece of private property powered by the sun. </TEXT>
