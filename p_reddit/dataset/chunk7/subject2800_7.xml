That is to report America and the world honestly, without fear or favor, striving always to understand and reflect all political perspectives and life experiences in the stories that we bring to you. It is also to hold power to account, impartially and unflinchingly. You can rely on The New York Times to bring the same fairness, the same level of scrutiny, the same independence to our coverage of the new president and his team.

This is not an apology. Kind of like when the Republicans accused Obama of apologizing. Self reflection != apology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great summary, and people should read the whole thing. There are numerous instances of Trump and his associates denying involvement with Russia, that are now known to be false. Team Trump denied pushing to soften language around Russia in the RNC platform, which is now known to be false.

It's possible that they truly don't have any improper relationship with Russia. It's also highly possible that they do. It's unquestionable that they've lied about their relationships to Russia and their contacts.

The *only* conclusion that is clear at this point is that we need a full, independent investigation. Anyone who argues otherwise is being dishonest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having lived in 4 different countries, a lot of this resonates with me. Universal access to health care should be considered a right, but that will only happen if voters in the US demand it. Free college tuition is tricky though - when I lived somewhere that provided this, only about 15% of high school students went to college   they were streamed in that direction based on testing at age 12. This is a fine system IF there are sufficient options for students who don't go to college. Transitioning would be brutal however.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the linked article:

If the dossiers contents have been corroborated, then its worth looking into the specific claims made therein and expanding the investigation to include the Rosneft dealings. Could President Trump's refusal to release his tax returns contain the final matryoshka? It stands to reason that the contents could either prove or effectively disprove 45s possible involvement and collusion with the Russian state. After all, if Trumps tax returns list any of the banks in the consortium amongst his lenders, he will have effectively traded American foreign policy for cold, hard cash. Thats grounds for treason. That's an impeachable offense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The president is correct that his Cabinet nominees have run into flak from Democrats in the Senate; nine of 15 department secretaries have been confirmed. The situation is much worse when you include those below Cabinet level. Of 549 key appointments, the White House has yet to name 515, according to a tracker by The Post and Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization.

Wow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its hardly a surprise that Trump would rather campaign than take up the less flashy, more private chores of actual governing (attending meetings, reading briefing reports, negotiating with legislatures, helping draft laws). For almost all of his adult life, he has been a lover of the limelight, ever hungry for the validation of public attention, from seeing his name in print to becoming a reality show star. And campaigning is the aspect of politics closest to such media spectacle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm mostly a paper book reader, but I do listen to some audiobooks. I'm a runner, and during periods where I run a LOT, audiobooks are great. I also enjoy them on long road trips. I do find personally that I need to pick my audiobooks carefully though, ideally not too many characters. The Martian was fantastic as an audiobook, as was The Art of Racing in the Rain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, the thing that really seems important to me about this now is whether the Trump campaign was in any way linked to it or in contact with the people doing the leaking. Trump has denied that his campaign was in contact with Russia, and that narrative seems to be unraveling.

It was clear before the election that Russia was responsible for providing info to wikileaks, and somehow, inexplicably, a large number of voters weren't concerned.  </TEXT>
