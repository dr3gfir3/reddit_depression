	<TEXT> Hello there and thanks in advance!

So I have a large data table in one sheet that will be continually updated. Materials and their details going to the right in that same row. Different materials will have different details provided (columns are the type of detail provided "weight", "volume" etc) and if material doesnt have that columns' detail, a 'N/A' goes there. 

Pre-setup a form with formatting etc on another sheet, with vlookup in place, so that x calls the material's data-row into the appropriate form sections.

Issue: The form will have rows with 'N/A' because not all materials will have the same details provided. How do I set up a macro/etc to get rid of N/A rows?

Is there other ways of taking one sheets data and calling into a form based on choice, allowing formatting etc.

Thank you again
