	<TEXT> For me at least, The Book of Henry will either make or break Colin Trevorrow as a director. The fact that the movie has gotten so little advertising or recognition, and is being released the same day as Cars 3, has me worried. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kinda disappointing PSH didn't get more screen-time in MI3, at least in my opinion. Not to mention that one of his scenes (near the end) is just a replay of the intense opening scene. He didn't have to be in every scene, but one more scene where we see just how menacing he is would have been nice. Like if we saw him talking to Ethan's wife shortly after she was captured.  </TEXT>
