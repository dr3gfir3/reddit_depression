	<TEXT> Are you talking about the source material? In the anime, at least, the people who kicked him out were really hammy about it, which would be fine if the rest of the show was like that but it didn't give me that impression.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me it was the people in the first episode who wanted to screw over the MC. They were like cartoon villains. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, not really. If one work in the universe is of a bad quality then it changes my opinion of the other series negatively. It's also why I pretend bad sequels of good movies don't exist/aren't canon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shingeki no Kyojin, K-On and to some extent Ping Pong the Animation  - the manga is pretty good but the anime changed a few elements which imo made it even better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the ending was perfect tbh. It marked the end of Oreki's grey lifestyle and pretty obviously hinted at their relationship. The whole show was about how Oreki got out of his shell, I don't think what comes after was really important. Sure it might be unsatisfying if you wanted more Chitanda x Oreki but personally I thought the place it ended at was perfect.

	<TEXT> I think that's intentional. The character development she gets for the most part comes about due to Oreki solving the mysteries. It's the thing that connects them both. Later on, when Oreki's lifestyle begins to change, we see more aspects to her character in the last 5 episodic episodes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Vol 6 is more like filler

I haven't read it but apparently there's major plot and character progression in at least two of the stories. And are you forgetting that the fourth volume was just a collection of shorts as well?  </TEXT>
