	<TEXT> It has always been a soap opera. But I find that the zombies appear often enough.  Too much zombies would get boring quick. At least they switch it up and have some interesting zombies in there.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My idea for Rainbow Six Siege the TV show. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's the year 2005. Bandit must go undercover and take out a drug kingpin, *El Chavo*. *El Chavo* owns all the drugs, all the whores. In the first episode Bandit must kill a fellow police officer to keep his cover. In the second episode Bandit has to rape someone to keep his cover. In the third episode Bandit has to snort heroin to keep his cover. In the fourth episode Bandit saves a village of starving children. In the fifth episode he kills an underage girl to keep his cover. This will make him a complex and grey character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the year 1999. Witchers have died off, but supposedly a Geralt of Rivia has claimed an unclaimed throne in the East. In the West, an army of Man-Goats approaches, led my MangyRyder, the fearless leader. Ciri, to the South, leads an undead army, but she's blind now guys. To the Southeast there's an enemy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mass Effect 3 is considered a good game with a shit ending. It won't change anything if I don't like the ending. Journey before destination. And let's be honest, TW3 probably has a better ending.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry but from now on yes, we will compare every single RPG to The Witcher 3. I'm just being pragmatic about it. You know it's going to happen.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, ME: A is a great game, but not in a million years does it hold up to TW3, no way Jos. In fact, I'm willing to bet that if they make ME4, they will borrow a lot from TW3. They kinda have to if they want the game to be good and praised. Like I said, don't get me wong. It's a good game. But it's not The Witcher 3. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm in Velen 25 hours into the game doing the Family Matters and Ladies of the Wood quests. Will the game tell me at what point in the storyline will further advancement null the other side quests? For example can I care of the main quests in Velen before doing the side quests or would advancing the main storyline block access to these quests? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why does Hannibal get a pass for fake outs? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-24 00:49:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everyone always complaining about fake out deaths in TV shows (notably TWD) when Hannibal did it not once, but *twice*. Once in S2, when Hannibal cuts and maims every major character but none of them dies except a secondary character, and in season 3 when Hannibal and Will jump off a cliff. Now, you could say that, since the series might not come back, then yes, Will and Hannibal could be dead, maybe not. But that goes out the window when people involved in the show have expressed desire for more seasons, and if that happens then you bet your ass they gonna bring Hannibal and Will back. All in all, Hannibal always had superb writing, acting and direction, but it always struck me as odd how they made these huge fake out deaths but nobody seems to criticize them for it. I thought it was cheap, especially in season 2 </TEXT>
