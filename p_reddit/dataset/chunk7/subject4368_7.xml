	<TEXT> Also consider the realism aspect of King of the Hill. Unlike other adult cartoons, King of the Hill never utilizes the fact it's animated to create the humor. If you look at other animated programs like Family Guy, Simpsons, and pretty much any Adult Swim cartoon, much of the humor comes from showing crazy situations you really only could through animation. KOTH never does that, so when situations like this occur and everyone just goes along with it, it makes it so much funnier when you think that the show is trying to be as real as possible. </TEXT>
