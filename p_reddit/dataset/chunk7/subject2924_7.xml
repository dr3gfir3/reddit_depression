	<TEXT> Thank you

I really enjoy Deadpool, but I would definitely hesistate putting it on this list. Logan came out just a month or so ago, so I really don't trust my instincts enough to put in on here, hence why no movies from 2016 or 2017 are on this list. And The Martian and Interstellar, while they were good, I found them to be a little bit overrated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to say, I don't know many non-American films. There are some Japanese films I love that didn't make the final cut, but that's about it. </TEXT>

And hey, to be fair, I don't like Citizen Kane one bit, and many do consider it to be one of the best films ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kong: Skull Island
Rogue One
Full Metal Jacket
Citizen Kane

EDIT: Also Inception and Interstellar. Both are fine films, don't get me wrong, but some people feel like they're fantastic, which, in my opinion, I think is wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone's into what they're into. Not everyone likes to date white people, and not everyone likes to date asian people, black people, hispanic people, green people, etc. It's just preference. Obviously, personality comes first, but if all a person has to go on is your looks and doesn't know you, it's perfectly okay. </TEXT>
