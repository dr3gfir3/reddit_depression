Trust me pats fans are committed to making sure evil wins even when the pats get eliminated (which will happen at some point)

i would vote evil even if the giants were the last/only evil team left trust me. </TEXT>

I scrolled down to the comments and they were filled with exactly what your describing.  They kept deflecting from nazis to muslim extremism saying they are hypocrites for making a movie about nazis while ignoring muslims.

You dont have to go far to find straight up holocaust denial in these comments either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow thanks i could not find what it was used for. at all when i looked.  How do you know it was used for sugar beet processing?  Thats such a weird thing i kept hearing chemical plant or distillery etc.

On doing a bit more research i found some articles saying it was indeed used for sugar processing with a distillery located inside the building complex. </TEXT>
