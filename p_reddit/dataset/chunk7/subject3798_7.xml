	<TEXT> It could be that we tend to associate the color gray with cooler colors, so if an image contains lots of grey or black tones as opposed to white, our eyes pick up on the coolness of the image. Blue hues specifically tend to evoke a more somber mood, so it may be that that mood transfers over to a grey-heavy image. </TEXT>
