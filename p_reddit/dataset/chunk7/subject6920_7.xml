	<TEXT> Interesting. Thanks for taking the time to respond. The TurboTax forecast app shows me owing the same amount despite my IRA contribution being 0 or 5500 if I have the "does your employer provide a retirement plan" checked "yes". If I check "no", then the 5500 ira contribution does decrease what I owe. So it makes it seem like the fact that I'm provided a plan at work (that I don't use) eliminates the tax benefit of the 5500 contribution to the IRA. Very confusing to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a retirement plan available at work but don't use it for reasons I won't specify. I have a traditional IRA account with TD Ameritrade. Right now I contribute about $600 a week to my TD brokerage account. Is there any tax benefit or good reason to contribute the max per year to the IRA?  Does it make capital gains non taxable or something? The same goes for my wife, except she does use her 401k for work and has a TD traditional IRA. Should she also contribute to that fund for any tax purposes?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 27 and don't have a retirement plan at work but amass my savings in TD Ameritrade brokerage, which is about 50k (I also have an IRA account there with about 10k). I contribute to my taxable account about $600 per week. What I'd a good ETF to just set and forget? I'm looking at VOO, SCHX, VTI, QQQ (in a smaller chunk since it is so heavily weighted in technology sector). Any ideas, recommendations, or criticisms of my plan?

	<TEXT> I don't have a retirement plan at my current job. I have a rollover IRA account at TD Ameritrade. I want to contribute the max yearly amount to a traditional IRA (which I think is $5500?). How do I go about doing this, and is my rollover IRA the same thing as a traditional IRA? Basically I'm asking is do I just deposit the funds from my bank that were direct deposited there from my work into the TD IRA? Or do I have to have HR at my work set up a direct deposit to the IRA account? And also do I need a separate "traditional" IRA account set up for this or will the rollover suffice? </TEXT>
