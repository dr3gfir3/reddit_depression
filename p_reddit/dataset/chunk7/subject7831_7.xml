	<TEXT> Yeah I did some research and this is actually legit. There's a whole bunch of stuff in it that goes back to Solomon, I'm guessing that that's what D based this on.

Shit's getting weird and dark, but the dude is a genius. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey man, the papers were just agreements to not share the script.  It wasn't anything crazy, just that I'd be liable if I shared or published it or showed it to anyone.  That was a while ago.  

I've got about a week until the play. Update and catch up on the history soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Everyone.

I was gonna post this to /r/occult but it seemed like the crew in the sub-reddit has been really helpful with other people dealing with really strange stuff. So I'm posting this here instead to ask for advice.  I hope you'll forgive my shitty writing.  Sometimes it seems like people who post here are crazy detailed and just really professional or something.  I ain't that guy, at all, but I really need help and I hope you can give me some advice about what's been going on.

I guess I'll just jump in and start telling you where this all started.  I guess that's where D showed up at our place.  So it's like a Tuesday night around midnight or so and we're hanging out bullshitting politics and getting fucked up like usual.  There were about eight to ten of us living there at this point.  It's not really like a squat or anything because the building it legit (but I don't think it's actually zoned residential). 

Anyway, in walks this guy. Wearing a fucking suit.  A really crazy nice suit, all straight lines like it was made for him.  Now, I don't really care what people look like but most of us at the A-Worx (it's our name for the anarchist collective) are pretty grungy.  You know. we're all spikes and denim and stuff with a mix of leather lovers, goth chicks and thrift store junkies.  So it was weird to have this dude all clean cut looking like money walk in in the middle of the night.

He doesn't even say anything but everybody there eventually sees him   stops talking. We all start looking at each-other like "what the fuck" and then Bean-boy jumps up, pulling on his shirt and yelling. 

"D! motherfucking D! yeah! hell yeah!" waving his arms around.

"Bean, you know this guy?" I asked.  

I felt like a bit of a dick but I had been around the A-worx for the longest out of everyone there. So I felt like I needed to know who was around and keep things on the level.

"Yeah man! Fucking D!" pointing at him with his good hand. "This is the dude I was telling you about. The fucking mad writer!"

Now I remembered.  Me and Bean-Boy were hanging out after this anti-capitalist puppet show a couple weeks back. It was sweet, there was this awesome chick who opened for it playing Misfits songs on a Ukulele. Fucking epic.  Anyway he was telling me that he met this guy in NYC that put together this naked fire dance in the middle of the city with about 50 performers.  Turns out that he's a playwright too and he told Bean-boy that he'd be down this way soon and look us up.

At this point Freddie, Dervish, Faks and the rest of them started talking and lighting up again,  a bit less interested now that they knew the guy was cool.  I, on the other hand was really interested and introduced myself to D.

"You must be Jason." Dude stared deep at me.

"Yeah I'm Jason. Bean tell you about me or something?"

"Yes. We talked about you quite a bit.  I understand that you are the actor of the group." It wasn't really a question but the silence was weird.

"Well, I am really into performance art.  I've done a few things that A-worx put together and did one formal play a few years back.  It was received pretty well."

"You do have something. I can see that. Let me tell you about the project I want to put on." He started to walk into the space.

I was getting excited. Acting and performance art has always been my thing and this guy seemed like the real deal.  It wasn't about money or fame or any of that bullshit for me.  It's the whole idea of putting on masks and changing how people think about the world.  

So then frigging Faks gets up, slaps D on the shoulder and starts to hand him a bong.  I try to stop him, mostly cuz I know that it's like half weed and half dust, Faks loooves dust. I was pretty surprised  when D put up his palm to me and torched a huge hit.  I was even more surprised that D started moaning "Ahhh... PCP" when he exhaled.  This guy might look all fancy but he's pretty bad-ass.

Anyway we started talking.  He had written this script that he was really into.  The thing only had one single performer for the whole play. I was fucking psyched, this was a huge opportunity, especially since this guy was known.  So not only that, but it was about a guy who's trying to raise a Demon, and that's cool enough but there's more.  D insisted that this had to be performed Guerrilla style at this old-ass cemetery at midnight and we'd have to climb the walls and break in.

 D said he could get a cadre of about 200 people to break in to see the performance live and that it would be professionally filmed and then shown to small exclusive groups. I was so excited about the whole thing, I immediately started hounding him about reading for it and asking for a script.

"Jason. Do you want this?  Do you agree to put on this performance under my guidance?" He was looking me dead in the eyes.

"Yes, I do. I'll do whatever I need to to make this great." Feeling a bit weird about being like a beggar, but this seemed like an incredible opportunity.

He shook my hand and told me the part was mine.  He said I had something.  He didn't even care about me reading for it or trying out or anything.  D decided right there it was me.

Then he explained that there was one single copy of the script.  He told me that I could never show it to anyone and said that even though he was not that kind of guy, he would sue the ruin out of me if I copied it or showed it to anyone.  He made me sign some papers and handed me the script.

The first thing I noticed was that every page of the script had a seal stamped into the paper I guess to mark the original copy.

The title of the piece was "Byleth".

"Jason. Take this script. Find some quiet private space."he looked around the A-worx like he was trying to make sure there was private space here, since it was mostly open industrial. "You have sixty days. In sixty days, on May the 6th I will be here in the afternoon to meet you and escort you to the performance area."

"Wait, you're leaving.  You're not going to check up on what I'm doing or give me notes or whatever?" I was shocked and getting a bit nervous about my skills.

"This script is all you need.  Study it inside and out.  Make it yours. Read it, act it out and feel it.  It's that simple." he put his hand on my should and said "May sixth, be ready."  he turned and walked out the door.

Fucked up right?  That's a lot to put on somebody and expect that they're going to do a decent job of something so important.  I'm a fucking cowboy though and I can pony up for shit like this.  I was determined to do this right and got right to it.  I took a quick puff and headed off to my room to start reading and studying the script.

The script was fucking sick.  It was just like he described it, a solo piece about a kid who turns to the occult to gain power and does this big elaborate ritual to bring this Demon to help him. The ending was not really anything climactic, just the end of the ritual but overall the play was amazing.  I started work on memorization and performance the next day after I read through it a few times that night.

Over the course of the next week shit starting happening that was really messing with my concentration.  My buddy Fleek who lived with us at the A-worx overdosed and died.  I found our cat, Chaiman Meow, fucking gutted and nailed to the wall. This caused a huge rift among everyone in the space and it ended with fist fights, a broken nose and three of our regulars moving out. And there were just like a hundred other little things that just kept coming up, really fucking with the A-worx, our friends and my concentration.  

But I sucked it up and did my best.  I practiced and memorized lines 6 hours a day, every single day. I tried on different voices and personas. I did it sober and and I did it high. On blow and on weed, drunk, whatever.  I really experimented with it trying to find the right way to play this.

Ah shit.  I've gotta run right now.  Faks is freaking out about his girl Camilla, she's been missing for a few days.  Anyway I promise I'll write more soon, I need some help   gotta get through this.

For now, has anyone heard of D?  He was a big writer and performance artist in NYC.  Anyone ever see or hear about a play like this? Or know anything about this shit?  Please let me know if you do.  I've got to tell you the rest of what's happened so far but anything you know about what I wrote so far might help with what I'm dealing with right now.

Write more soon.

At this point I had no idea what to accept. I thought about trying to somehow trace her phone position by calling our mobile provider, but decided against this and instead sped home. I know my wife very well, and planned to question her and examine the situation at home in order to discern the truth of the text.

My head was, as you would imagine, alive with theories and possibilities. But I will not list all everything that I considered while driving. My purpose is to share this information in an effort of preservation, not to aggrandize myself for my impotent analytical ability.

I was there in no time avoiding the previous traffic fluidly, and flew into the front den, my son perched on my hip. I stopped dead in my tracks to find that my wife was sitting on the couch between two men in suits, who were then flanked by two security guards.

She called my name in a sympathetic tone but did not seem frightened as she quickly rose to take S. from my arms. She turned to look inquiringly at the men behind her who were now standing up from the sofa.

"What did you tell them?" I pulled at my wife's arm sleeve.

"Everything" not even turning back to face me.

"I trust that you can arrange care for your child quickly." The man in the suit to the left of my wife inquired.

I thought for a moment.

"Yes, let me call our neighbor and tell her it's an emergency."

"It is." He confirmed peering into my eyes, clearly making a statement, and clearly angered that I had not come into the lab sooner.

I made a phone call and arranged for child care for the day, or even the night if necessary and within 30 minutes our son was being watched at our home and my wife and I both were escorted into a black SUV in front of our building.

'Are you Ok? What happened?" I asked, examining her face.

"They arrived thirty minutes ago and said that there had been an incident at your lab. They said people were possibly spreading something, like a disease and that I needed to tell them everything that happened since yesterday." She looked concerned but relatively stable.

"Did you leave the house today?" This may have been my only chance to ask.

"No they arrived right after I texted you, when I woke up. Why? Do you think I have something and would spread it? Oh god, our son." this is where the tears began.

"I don't think we're sick. It's Ok. Let's just see what they know." I put my arm around her in the back of the truck as we drove to the lab.

I inquired about what was happening with the two security guards in the back with us, as the driver had the privacy window up and were inaccessible. As I had expected they were of no assistance or information other than sharing their orders, which were to deliver us to the lab.

When we reached CERN it was almost as if my second home had been completely transformed. The grounds were now surrounded by four levels of barbed wire chain-link fence and there were concrete barriers littered in front of and in between sections every few feet. There was a new makeshift security entrance that had a staff of ten or so armed guards. It took fifteen minutes of conversation and phone calls even to allow their own SUV onto the grounds where we found an entire secondary protocol at the front door. There we were thoroughly searched, scanned and questioned, and my credentials were retrieved before we were allowed access.

Once inside, there were further similar but smaller hurdles as we were escorted downstairs.

"Dr., please" the bald man in the suit gestured to one of the many doors to small offices in the hallway. My wife and I proceeded to enter the room, but he quickly but gently took hold of her elbow.

"We need to ask you questions. Separately." It was clear that there was no way to prevent this.

"Misses, please" gesturing to the room right next to mine.

I caught my wife's eye, and clearly both our eyes contained some worry.

"It's ok." I reassured her "I'll be right next door."

I was sat at a small metal desk, upon a metal chair. The room was entirely devoid of furniture or decoration.In only a moment after sitting I received my expected guest, and was a bit surprised to not recognize the man whatsoever. This was a large enterprise and there were many people involved, but after working here for over eight years most people were familiar to me, if not known well.

This man was unfamiliar and also a bit unsettling. He was of average age and height with short black hair. He was fit but seemed to draw his body into the room as if he was both completely relaxed, and expertly tensed at the same time.  From the moment the door opened his eyes were peering into mine intently.

"Doctor, as you know we've had a breach, the results of which are specific temporal anomalies.  I understand that you have experienced the Phenomena." he held his hands behind his back, ever so slightly leaning forward over me.  His statement seemed so matter-of-fact that it took me an extra moment to respond.

"Yes." I said quietly.

"Yes? You must tell me about what you have experienced." his lips pursed coldly.

"What is happening?  What was that experiment, and exactly what is it causing?  I need to know if this will affect my family."

"For your family then." raising his eyebrows slightly "The experiment was the successful confirmation of a new theory regarding the method by which matter could be made to exceed light speed.  Accomplishing this has caused an ongoing shift in space-time culminating in temporary distortions of reality. We are trying to determine how this is, and what can be done to reverse it." He spoke very quickly, as if scripted."Now what have you experienced?"

I was not entirely satisfied with the answer I was given, though it seemed to be both clear and true.  It was lacking detail and seemed like an attempt to discard the question by satisfying it minimally.  I felt that in order to get more information I may need to give, so I began to recount my experience while I was in the Lab, describing the first door. I decided to stop here, and ask a question.

"The other employees are they still here? Have they had the same experiences?" 

"We are questioning the employees, collecting information and then sending them on their way. Some are here, other's have answered our questions and have gone home. Most have had this same experience regarding new Doors in their homes or other locations. Now, when you arrived home?" He inquired.

I continued my story explaining that my wife had traveled through a door and exited from a distant building. I recounted everything that had occurred with one large exception.  I did not inform the man about spotting my wife in the city, entering the apartment or seeing that someone had a dragged a body through one of these doors.

"And that is everything?" He looked deeply into my eyes, examining them.

"Yes, why?"

"Others, who had friends or loved ones travel had some further experiences." 

"Such as?" trying to prompt him for detail.

He studied me and seemed to make a mental decision "Various things.  No matter. If that is your complete experience then we are finished.  I've been told there is one other person to see you in a friendly capacity. I'll send him in."

The man turned quickly to leave. As he did so I noticed what looked like an almost unnoticeable tattoo on the back of his neck.  It was a series of dots in a formation that resembled a Cyrillic letter.  The dots were scattered but seemed to be some sort of geometric formation, similar to a QR code. I wondered if this was a requirement for this man's position in the organization, or a bio-metric security system.  It did strike me as I'd never seen before on anyone in the building including security staff.

In a matter of seconds, Leonard entered the room. I was a bit surprised to see him as he had been absent from the office lately. Leonard and I had worked together closely for two years about five years ago.  He was a reliable person and a good friend though we had not seen each-other quite so often after he was reassigned.

Leonard smiled at me meekly.

"Leonard, how are you. What do you know about what is going on?"

"I'm doing well, considering the circumstances.  Frankly I do not know much about the incident, but I did hear some stories from others."

"I've seen the doors, what else have you heard about?" I asked.

"Well" he said slowly and quietly "I heard that some people saw others going into and out of doors. Have you seen anything like that?"

I held my ground with my original story, feeling that it was important not to tell anyone about the scene I had seen at the apartment. I decided instead to inquire further.

"They saw people coming in and out? What were they doing? What did they say?"

Leonard looked displeased for a split second before recovering himself and asking "Only the people who experienced it could tell you. I'd love to learn more before they let me go home, did you see anything like that?"

I sat silently trying to navigate my answer when we were both startled by a loud knock at the door. I was jolted and Leonard turned to answer the call.  

That's when I saw it. My "old friend" who I had known for years, who was so traditional and routine that he categorized his socks by week-day had a tattoo similar to, but slightly different from the man who questioned me.  It all fell into place. I was not speaking to Leonard, I was speaking to his double.  I was questioned by a double, and now my old friend was being emulated in front of me. My wife had one out there in the world and she had committed a violent crime for some unknown reason and dragged the body through that door to god-knows where.

Whatever had happened, the outcome was that these doors were some sort of cosmic photocopier for our species.  Duplicates of human men and women were being made when one stepped through, and they were acting in our world with their own unknown agenda. The revelation was fast, and though I was awestruck I also steeled myself for action.

"Leonard, wait. I did see something." I blurted out quickly.

He turned back to me with one hand on the door, waiting for my response.

"I don't trust those guards, can you buy me a minute? I want to talk to you about this, not them." I said trying to curry favor and get rid of the other intruder.

Leonard cracked the door, had a word with the man who had knocked and came back to me.

"It's my wife," I said in a low voice "You know that she stepped through.  Well I saw something else. But..." I paused "I haven't gotten a chance to speak to her about it, and I want her here to get the full picture.  Can we bring her in?"

Leonard looked unconvinced.

"Lenny...." I said pleadingly "You know us! We do everything together, and I just couldn't tell anyone, and I haven't told anyone, unless I share it with her too. You know how we are."

"Alright, I'll fetch her and then you can both tell me?"

"Yes" I confirmed. "Thanks."

He left the room swiftly and as the door swung shut I shot up and headed for the corner of the room near the door.  I knew that this was my only possible chance, and even if we got out of the room together, our chances of escaping the building were very unlikely.  However, after the shock of realization about what was happening had finally hit me, it was easy to let go of probabilities, fear and doubt.  There was only one chance, one option pitted against us never leaving this building alive.

My wife walked in first and seeing the empty chair turned her head to see me crammed into the corner.  I put my finger over my mouth and gestured that she should keep moving forward toward the empty chair.  She caught on quickly and she managed to block the view of that empty seat from what looked like Leonard.

Once they were both inside the room and the door was swinging shut, I leapt. My years of  Krav Maga classes paid off in this moment for the first time.  I had taken them before I had started working in New York City in the late 90's in order to protect myself. In retrospect I never would have thought that I would be in more danger in Switzerland of all places.

Within a split second I had my left hand covering Leonard's mouth while my right arm was wrapped around his neck strangulating him.  After a short struggle at acceptable noise levels Leonard was unconscious on the floor.  My wife was looking shocked and scared but was clearly understanding that the situation was dire.

"Everyone here, they are not what they seem.  They will never let us leave this building alive. We must find a way out." I whispered frantically to her.

She nodded her head slowly "How? There's an armed guard right outside the room!"

 This room was absolutely bare with no other possible exit. I pointed at the ceiling. 

"We might be able to find a vent."

I got up on the table as quietly as possible and started handing ceiling tiles down to her.  After a few it became obvious that this was not going to get us out of the room.  There was only solid concrete one foot above the drop ceiling which small holes for the pipes and wiring.

"Shit." not used to swearing often "Ok. We're going to have to take that guard out and get his gun."

Clearly this was not a popular option with my wife, as she looked absolutely horrified by the idea. She started shaking her head no, and dropped her face into her hands sobbing slightly.  I reached out to her to hold her and reassure her that there was a chance.  This could work if I could get his weapon.  I continued, explaining that I knew the building well, that we could get to the warehouse and force the loading doors, that we could in fact get out of here if we played our cards right.  At that moment there were several loud knocks at the door again and I lifted her head by the chin.

She looked up at me with tears streaming down her face clearly scared but accepting the reality of the situation.  Then her eyes widened.  She was no longer looking me in the eyes, but looking behind me.

Expecting to see the guard entering, I turned.  But there was no guard and the door was still closed.  However, about one foot to the right of it, stood another.

With one meaningful glance between us, we were gone. The implications of using one of those doors was not considered for a moment.  At that time it's appearance was a miracle.  Only later did I smirk about that horror being our only salvation.

This is where we come to the end of what I have experienced.

We safely exited a door in an office building only two miles from our home.  Our fortune was incredible.  Within minutes we had convinced an employee to bring us to our house where we picked up our son and began our journey.  It was not simple and we were forced to be very cautious and even break a few laws to exit the country.  It did not stop there.  It took us three months of rides from strangers, borrowed money from friends via western union, several illegal border crossings and lots of camping outdoors before we reached Morocco via a ferry from Southern Spain.

Here we felt safe enough, at least far inland where we situated.  We were able to get a  friend to access our accounts and send it to us via mailed packages addressed to some locals we had befriended and paid well.  We were able to rent an apartment in a small remote town under false names and over time we trusted that we had managed to leave as little of a trail as possible and that we were safe.

Even knowing this we agreed to never allow ourselves to spend more than six to nine months in any one locality, at least for the foreseeable future.  We've managed to live ordinary lives in the years past the incident, always with some worry, but comfortable considering what we have seen.  

That is my story, and I give it to you in hopes of only one thing.

If you see a door that should not be there, do not use it.

If you know someone who has gone through that door, be wary of them always. They may not be themselves.

If you see someone with a strange dotted geometric tattoo on the back of their neck, get away from them at all costs.

Our world has been invaded.  The uninvited are here, among us, with an agenda. They must be stopped if our race is to remain in control of it's own destiny.  Spread the word, spread the knowledge and Godspeed in our defense. </TEXT>

I had barely slept.  Analysis, speculation and nightmare scenarios left me turning over in bed for several hours when I realized that I needed to get my son, S. to school.  Though the recent events were astounding and all encompassing, I did not want to sacrifice my family's stability by changing his schedule abruptly.  Frankly I think that my desire to retain a sense of normalcy was my main motivation.

My wife seemed deeply asleep and I chose to let her take refuge in that for a time while I cared for the business of the morning convincing myself that I would be returning in thirty minutes time.

I was frustrated to see the traffic become almost impassable as I neared the school and tried to calm myself by realizing that it would only add perhaps ten minutes to my trip.  I chatted with S. as our car inched closer and closer to the building.

That was when I saw them.  Outside the school building were three black SUV's and alongside them were six men in suits.  One of the men I clearly recognized from the institute, his oddly shaped bald head standing out very clearly.  I could see them peering down the street towards us, speaking into their microphones and pressing wired receivers into their ears.

Without even realizing what I was doing, I pulled hard to the right down the nearest side street which was relatively clear and escaped the scene.  The staff was obviously there waiting for me because I did not arrive at CERN last night.  In no way would I allow myself to be escorted to the office and separated from my child under any circumstances, and this would certainly be the outcome if I was seen.

I weaved through the town toward the highway that would lead home, explaining to my son that it looked like school was closed today.  He giggled and asked me if it was Christmas, to which I replied that today might be a special secret holiday.  We talked about what kind of holiday today could be distractedly, as once again I found my car in standstill traffic.

"Is that why Mommy's here?" S. inquired excitedly.

"Mommy?"

"Right. there." he pointed out the open window to a small cafe on the left side of the street.  

After a moment of casual scanning I saw her.  K. was seated at an outdoor table at the cafe sipping coffee and laughing across from a local resident.  I had no doubt whatsoever that it was her.  Everything from her clothes (the ones she was wearing yesterday) to her mannerisms convinced me immediately of another fact I could not possibly reconcile.  I had left her sleeping, drove here at a relatively fast pace, and yet here she was in the middle of breakfast with a stranger.

I sat dumbfounded watching the man pick up the check, taking her hand and the two of them leaving the cafe.  They were walking down the street laughing and looking like they had some private joke between them before turning the corner.

I quickly maneuvered the car to follow them and watch them ascending the stairs of a complex on Chemin Du Renard, and then disappear into an apartment.  My mind buzzed, split between reality and madness. I went from thinking that she was cheating on me, to thinking that she must have passed through another door at home and exited here.  What I could not do was to allow this to unfold without knowing what was happening.

I pulled the car over into a small space much too near the intersection, but safe enough to park for a short time.  I put on my blinkers and calmly explained to S. that I was going to lock the doors, and he should stay in his car seat.  He did not complain, acting as if this were a game we were participating in.  I kissed him on the head and told him I would be right back.

I ascended the stairs, becoming overly excited and even enraged.  I knocked on the door, waited, then knocked again.  There was no sound from inside, and no response to my inquiry for several minutes.  I then began to pound heavily on the door, shouting my wife's name.  Nothing.  I twisted the handle, and impotently shoved my shoulder against the door.  There was nothing for it.

I quickly had an idea and executed it.  I ran downstairs to the main entrance of the building and located the office.  I burst in and frantically explained that my wife had locked our son in the car, had the keys, and could not hear me from the apartment that she was in.  I think that my excitement and agitation had great effect, as the manager immediately got the super and we headed up to the apartment in question.  

"Mr. L's apartment?" The manager looked at me inquisitively.

"Yes, that's her friend. Please, I must get those car keys, he's just sitting there screaming." I pointed to the car on the corner.

The manager and the super shared a concerned look, but after knocking and getting no response they unlocked the door and the three of us entered the foyer.  

"K.," I shouted, barging into through the foyer quickly.  

When I reached the bedroom I saw it, and was able to act quickly.  There was one door in the bedroom, leading I suppose into the master bath.  On the floor to the left of that door was a thick trail of blood, as if something large and bleeding had been dragged.  The blood trail ended abruptly at the wall, one foot away from the bathroom door.  

I turned quickly, blocking the view of the super and the manager and ushered them back to the front door.  

"She's not here, but I found the keys in my jacket," I uttered as we left.

I rushed back to the car in a panic and drove away before I could even hear or acknowledge their response. As I pulled away they were still standing on the landing watching me drive.  I have no idea whether or not they re-entered the apartment, and I cannot imagine what they would think if they had.

I saw the screen of my phone light up in the cup-holder of the car and raised it.  It was a text from my wife,  It said "You bringing S, to school?  Could you pick up some aspirin on the way back?".

I did not have even a moment to consider the implications of this phenomenon taking place in my home, miles from CERN.  I was immediately shocked into action as my phone began to ring and I swiftly made my way to our kitchen to answer, so as not to wake my wife or son.  

"Yes" I spun around looking behind me toward the bedroom, feeling very paranoid.

"Dr N. Listen to me carefully." The voice was metered and fast "There has been a security breach at CERN,  We are this time requesting all personnel to immediately make their way to the institute.  There is nothing to be concerned about but your presence is integral at this time. Please confirm your arrival."

"I what has happened" I stammered.

"Mr. N.  I can only share that your presence is required immediately.  Please leave your home, we are expecting to see you in thirty five minutes." at which point I heard the click of disconnection.

I looked behind me toward the bedroom, and then down at the phone as I slowly placed it in it's cradle.  

In all of my time at the institute nothing like this had ever occurred.  I could only assume that the phenomena I was experiencing had been noticed and was being acted upon.  I wondered for several minutes what the organization or the security staff would possibly do with the information regarding what I had witnessed.  I wondered if they knew that it was continuing to have effects off-premises, and that being the case what action they could take.

My fear overcame me quickly.  I knelt down holding my chest as I allowed the surge of blood in my ears and the pounding of my heart consume my thinking.  I gasped after realizing that I had stopped breathing and began to focus on calming myself.  I understood how to mitigate the effects of this panic attack, having had them for years in college.

After centering myself, I decided that there was no other option than to comply with the security personnel.  I turned back to the bedroom to dress and wake my wife informing her of where I was going.  

"No," I stated matter-of-factly when I saw the bed empty, the bathroom door open, no sign of my wife, and only our usual single bedroom door.  "No, no, no." I repeatedly like a mantra as I tore around the room and then the remainder of the house.  My son was asleep in his bed, undisturbed but there was no sign whatsoever of my wife, K.

She went through, I thought.  She must have been woken by the call and came to check on me. She probably didn't even notice that there were two doors in her sleepy confusion. My eyes went wide, the pounding of my heart began again, my head was swimming with thought, and I must have lost consciousness.

I awoke again to the phone ringing. There was a very sharp pain at my right temple and upon later inspection I realized that I had hit my head on our dresser.  I groggily made my way to the kitchen again, not having any idea about how much time had passed.  I assumed that this would be a follow up call from the new security contingent at CERN, but I was wrong.

"Hon, it's me." I was entirely startled by the soft tired voice of my wife.

"Oh God. You're ok," I exhaled fully "Where are you?"

"I I am in Annemasse," she said questioningly.  "I am at the MJC Youth Center."

I looked at my watch and saw that I had only been unconscious for minutes.  Annemasse was almost an hour from our house.  My eyes widened in wonder.

"I don't know what's happening to me," she whimpered "The last thing I remember is getting up to come see who you were talking to.  And then," the rest was indistinguishable through her now full out crying. 

"Listen," I said "You are ok.  There's nothing wrong with you. Do you hear me K?"

"But," I did not let her continue.

"There is nothing wrong with you. This is something else. Please, tell me what happened after you got up to some see me."  I wanted to know just what she had experienced.

"I got up, opened the door, walked through it and then I was in another room instead of our hallway. That's what it seems like, but I must be going crazy.  I keep thinking it's a tumor, or an aneurysm, I'm so scared." 

"It's not. You are fine.  I can explain everything, but just know that you are well. I will come get you.  I'm leaving now and will get the neighbors to come and sit for S. He is still asleep."

"Alright.  I'm ok.  I am in a dormitory room with two students.  They are very kind and gave me some clothes to wear.  I will say goodbye and meet you near the front office."

"I will be there soon.  Stay calm, I'll explain shortly." 

I hung up the phone, arranged a sitter and left the house posthaste.  I was relieved and incredibly worried at the same time.  She sounded safe however there was no way to quantify what this experience may have had on her, mentally or physically.  Thoughts of the darkest kind ran through my mind as I sped to her location.

When I arrived I calmed her, explained everything I had experienced and decided to take her to the hospital and tell the doctors that she had lost consciousness, demanding a full scan and workup. We sat waiting for hours until finally she was given a clean bill of health, confirming that all her scans and physical responses were normal. We both decided not to talk too much about the events that were unfolding.  We were tired and concerned enough without intentionally aggravating both of our imaginations. We focused on confirming that K. was well and deciding to spend tomorrow examining the situation over breakfast.

It was near to sunrise when we returned home, relieved the sitter and took a very short and fitful nap.  We were feeling somewhat relieved but pensive regarding the intense unknowns of this situation.  

Lucky for us we had no idea where this would lead, until the next day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My name is Dr. N.  I choose not to reveal my identity for the sake of my family, and will provide no details that may put my anonymity at risk. I will be able to provide no evidence,no background or laurels for myself or my colleagues.  I share only the record of what I have experienced, posted anonymously. I do understand that the incredible nature of what I am choosing to share publically will likely result in my findings being immediately discredited by anyone who comes across them.  There is nothing that I can do to ensure that this message is heard by the general public without putting my family, my life and my career in immediate danger.

I am resigned however, to try, for the chance that the information may become historically important at some future date.

I am a research assistant at CERN working with data gathered from the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) experiments in Geneva.  Three months ago the CERN institute underwent some large scale development, and security policy enhancements.  It soon became clear to me that there was a new project preparing to be implemented and it was being strictly monitored to prevent communication regarding the nature or scope of the work to be undertaken.

An unknown military contractor was hired and within days our labs, data centers, and the entire premises was overtaken by this new personal.  I am not comfortable with weaponry of any sort and I must share that the sheer number of armed personnel made me uncomfortable for the duration of their stay.  This became a very tense time and I was often unable to focus due to the stress.

I will do my best to keep this as non technical as possible, as the information that is most important to share is actually of a very non technical nature.  I began receiving large sets of data to analyse. It was clear that the new experiments were now operational and the collider was running at full operational capacity.  

Based on the data, I can say that the LHC was now actually operating well beyond operational capacity, as far as it had been originally conceived.  It took me nearly a week, but after processing and analyzing the data sets I was given it became clear that somehow the LHC had managed to accelerate beyond the speed of light.  I questioned the data, checked and triple checked and I became convinced that this was the case.  Furthermore it seems quite clear based on my calculations that the accelerated material in question was not a subatomic particle at all, but a full and complete AU (gold) atom. This made the issue of acceleration even more astounding and groundbreaking.  I only had various small pieces of data however the story they told when assembled and analyzed was quite clear.

At this point my curiosity got the better of me and I began to inquire frequently and widely regarding the current experimentation.  Over the following days it became immediately apparent that I knew a great deal more than anyone who was not central to the operation. The security protocols were very stringent and entirely successful, as no one outside the inner circle (of which I do not know the members) knew anything of substance.

This is the point at which you will likely discard what I am about to share with you as a hoax, the imagination of an insane man, or any number of explanations more scientifically reasonable than what I am presenting.

It was 7:30pm on Wednesday July 27th, 2016 and I was ensuring that my analysis processes were running properly before leaving for the evening.  Everything looked to be in proper order and I turned to exit my office.  It struck me as I took hold of the door knob.  There, approximately one foot to the left of my single office door was an exact duplicate,  There was at that time a second door, exactly like my only office door in every detail offset by approximately twelve inches on the same wall.

My first reaction was absolute paralysis.  I stood staring and not taking my hand off of the pre-existing door handle for some time and I experienced a deep intense sense of dread.

It was at this point that I quickly concluded that I was being made the focal point of a somewhat strange but almost typical prank by my co-workers.   The scientists who made up the staff at CERN were varied, most being very intense and serious people.  However there was a contingent which was heavily into what is called "Geek Culture" and who tend to very much enjoy mixing their fascinations with pop culture with their work.  Dr F. from Switzerland for example kept a poster in his office with a Kitten hanging from the entrails of a Zombie character stuck in a tree which held the caption "Hang in there Baby".  Dr. F. and his similar cohorts were known to occasionally pull pranks such as putting popcorn kernels in the heating units and other such partially disruptive but somehow accepted undertakings.

I turned toward my computer monitors and stated "Funny, gentleman" attempting to be affable.  Our monitors all were equipped with cameras that could be accessed on site or remotely and I had assumed that they were watching my reaction to their hijinx.

It was at this point that I realized that the cameras also stored footage for security purposes and I began to access the recordings in order to determine who had installed the false door and when.  Being that there was no possible way they could have done so while I was in the office, I skipped backwards to the previous day after I left in the video log. I confirmed that the door was not present yet, and began fast scanning forward.  I was confused when I reached the morning, and more confused when the timecode approached this past hour.  The door had appeared instantaneously 7 minutes before I got up from my desk to leave.  In one frame it was not present, and in the next it was.  

I shot up and turned my back to my monitors facing the new door and I began to examine it closely, first visually and then cautiously approaching it.  It appeared exactly as the original in every detail including scratches, the small dent that was added when new equipment was moved in last week, and even the frame and thin space beneath it were exact save for one detail.  The light coming through the base of the new doorframe was red. It was not bright or intense, but there was a clear red hue that could be seen at the base of the door.
This is when the noise began.  There was a bump against this new door.  At first it was solitary, sounding as if a ball had hit the other side of the door.  Then the bumping noises increased in frequency. The sounds were random almost similar to a fish flopping on a desk.

My initial reaction was to open the door, as it almost felt impolite not to do so.  I stopped myself and took a much needed moment to ponder the situation.  I closed my eyes, took off my glasses and pinched the bridge of my nose as I went over the facts in my mind and where they may lead.  Although clearly subject to information bias, I concluded that the recent experiment had somehow created this effect. The effect being the duplication of a solid structure in my office.  Unbelievable, however the evidence clearly suggested it as the most plausible causation.  As far as the red light beneath the second door I concluded that it must be generated by some type of safety lighting system in between the walls of the building.  I had never seen nor heard of safety lighting being installed inside a wall, however it would be useful when the staff were wiring.

I decided to investigate and prove my hypothesis regarding the light and rose to open the door.  

The door was no longer present.

I was as shocked by the disappearance of the door as I was of it's original appearance. It was at this point that I decided to leave.  I collected my things, left the office, went down the hall, outside to the parking garage and drove home quite hastily.  

When I arrived home I was plagued by the thoughts of the day's events but tried very hard to be present with my wife and son and take comfort in the fact that the anomaly was no longer existent, and my world was restored to sanity.  I read to my son, tucked him in for the night and spoke to my wife for some time before she also turned in, at which point I took a bath and prepared for bed myself.  The bath had helped me calm my mind further. I had in a matter of hours allowed myself to mentally compartmentalize today's event and move on with the remainder of my work and life.

That is, until I left the bathroom and saw the two doors in my bedroom.

Subject: Final Status	

____________________________________________

Greeting Mrs. Brenson,

My name is Lori Steinman.  I am a regional claims specialist for Sunfire Insurance company and I have been put in charge of your account.  Typically these claims are handled by our junior staff but due to the unique nature of this particular case, Sunfire Insurance wanted to ensure beyond all double that this matter was handled both efficiently and completely.

I have spent the last week working closely with the Maynardville police department, the local fire department as well as our internal claims investigation staff.  As i'm sure you know there have been many questions regarding the details of the incident that lead to the loss of the property on Red Oak Road.  At this point however we feel that enough information has been gathered to secure a ruling regarding cause and liability in this case, and I am emailing you today regarding the final status of the claim.

Before we get to this, I want to sincerely extend my condolences to you regarding the loss of your brother and his partner.  I cannot imagine what you are going through during this troubled time and I want you to know that all of us here share your pain and wish you the best during your period of grief.  I am very unfortunate, and very sorry to add to your burden at this period, but company policy regarding the findings of the police and investigators (both internal and external) clearly dictate the outcome of this claim.

Sunfire Insurance is denying the insurance claim for coverage on the home fire due to the following:

According to the local police department and the fire sheriff's office, the property fire at 1823 Red oak Road, Maynardsville on June 8th, 2015 at approximately 12:45am was deemed to be intentional, malicious and caused by the resident or residents.

I understand that this is likely to come as a shock to you, but the evidence found was unmistakable.  After an exhaustive search of the remains of the property the fire inspectors tracked down the origin point.  They found that the electrical socket on the Eastern end of the master bedroom was the source of the fire.  Normally an electrical fire would be fully covered, however the cause of this particular electrical fire was a small butter knife which had been bent and inserted into the outlet.

The police and fire department did report that they had seen cases where there was accidental insertion of objects in this manner, however our final assessment is that the fact that the knife was bent in half, and both ends were positioned quite clearly to fit the outlet rules out any chance of accident in this case.

Furthermore the police have determined that in all likelihood, this action was taken by a resident or both residents of the home.  There were no signs of break in and no police reports of strange activity from the tenants or the neighbors.  Furthermore it seems that your brother and partner only knew one resident of Maynardsville who was quickly cleared of suspicion.  There are no other suspects who may have had intention to do the residents harm.

It is therefore the determination of the police department, fire department and our company that on the night of June 8th, 2015 at approximately 12:45am one of the two residents of the property in question intentionally bent a knife, inserted it into the electrical socket in the master bedroom, and then got into bed.  As you know they were subsequently both fatally injured in the resulting fire.  I want to share that the fire department confirmed that they likely suffered little or no pain, being that they were suffocated by smoke and unconscious prior to their fatalities.

In regards to contents, there was very little remaining.

The vehicle parked at the property has been released from police impound and you may arrange pickup or sale at your convenience.  The remaining salvageable items are being handled by our fire mediation specialists, are available for delivery, and include:

- Several ceramic pieces from the kitchen including tea pots, cups and ephemera.

- Brass and stone planters from the front garden.

- The entire contents of the potting shed in the back yard including potting materials, and yard tools.

- One small antique china doll, and a small decorated box which were found between the exterior brick wall and the cinder block construction in the corner of the master bedroom.

I again want to offer my sincerest condolences for your loss and the grief that must accompany this information.  If you have any questions regarding our findings you may request the investigation packet of information which will provide you with crime scene photos, police reports, fire inspection reports and other supporting materials.
We at Sunfire Insurance appreciate your patronage, and are available at any time to answer any further questions you may have regarding this claim or anything further.

Thank you and be well. </TEXT>

Subject: Ok I have no idea what to do here	

____________________________________________

To be honest things are really not going well, and Leah and I have been completely out of sorts for the past few days.  We're exhausted, fighting constantly and just generally having a really rough time.  I don't want to unload on you, but you've always been supportive and I don't really know anyone here that I can talk to about this stuff.  Beyond the fighting and relationship problems we've had some really really weird things going on here, that I don't think I would ever tell anyone else.  I know you won't judge me, and I'm thankful to have your ear.

Jesus, where to start?

The day after I wrote last Leah took off to her acting class and I decided it was the perfect time to try to locate and deal with the rodent problem.  I wasn't ever really going to lie to her if I found rats or signs of them, but there would be a big difference between her seeing them, or coming home after I had dealt with the situation.

So I got a drywall saw, and decided to start low to the floor in the bedroom wall behind the headboard (we are sleeping in Mom's old room).  So I removed a section of the drywall to take a look and see if I could find droppings or nests or whatever might explain all the ruckus we've been hearing.

I found nothing in that section, but continued on the other end of the room, where I did find something really odd, and totally not what I expected.  So I open the wall in the east corner of the room at the floor and there is this shiny pile of stuff sitting there on the floor in the space between the bedroom wall and the exterior of the house.

There were trinkets, some of mom's old jewelry, ribbon, a marble, a little tied up bit of black hair (mine? From my first haircut way back?) and just a bunch of other random little bits and pieces.   I recognized some of them from our childhood like those earrings that mom used always complain that you were taking, and that little "eye of god" think I made out of yarn and popsicle sticks at summer camp.  Poring through the stuff I was a bit freaked out to find a tooth in there as well. I'm assuming it was one of our baby teeth.  I can't say that I liked touching that.  

The really odd thing was that there was absolutely no sign of rodents.  The pile was not shaped like a nest or anything, like you might expect an animal collecting stuff to make one.  There were also no droppings, or scratches in the wood or drywall, pee stains. Nothing. So I had no idea what the heck is in there making noise and collecting stuff from the house at this point, and I had nothing to tell Leah (who is really starting to get touchy at this point, after not sleeping well for so long.)

So I grabbed all of the items and threw them out, since there wasn't anything in there really worth keeping.  I didn't tell Leah about that, figuring it was kind of pointless, but I let her know that I had looked and found no signs of rats, and replaced those sections of drywall.

That night really sucked.  Leah got home in the evening after going out for drinks with some of her classmates and immediately got this displeased, wrinkled look on her face when she walked in and threw her keys on the table.

"Jesus it fucking stinks in here" she threw out immediately.

"Really? I don't smell anything." I didn't. I'm not the cleanest person in the world, but it's not like I left food out or anything.

She let out a disgusted sound and told me she was getting in the shower, and I resigned myself to a very shitty night with a very cranky sleep deprived girlfriend.  I tired to put on Netflix on my laptop to watch a show while she was showering, but every time I turned it on, it started to boot and then just immediately shut off.  Just what I need, a dead laptop which I can certainly not afford to replace.

Then I start hearing Leah shrieking like she was being murdered in cold blood, and jumped up sprinting to the bathroom at full speed.  I swear in that moment, all I wanted to do was to stop that horrible noise.  It felt like the whole county must be able to hear it.  I tear open the shower curtain to find her crouching in the tub absolutely covered in red and black muck, crying.  And this time, I could definitely smell it, it stunk to high heaven.

It seemed like maybe it was rust with the red-orange material, but that doesn't really explain the black crap or the horrible stench.  I was pretty sure there was no way that sewage lines could cross over into the water supply pipes, but then I remembered that this house has a well.  So it looks like now we need to have that looked at too.

So, we used some old throw-away towels to get her cleaned up   ended up driving out and buying a gym membership, just so she could take a decent shower.  The water quality improved a little bit in the house, but it was still running brown on and off after that initial deluge.

God, I'm sorry this is so long I'll try to wrap it up.

So we get home from the gym, not really talking and go to bed. You've been married for a while, I'm sure you're familiar with that cold silence in bed, where neither person can sleep but both pretend to.

We finally start to go down, and then it frigging starts.  Not scratching this time, but tapping.  Like this fast tapping noise, in bursts of a couple seconds, on and off.

"What are they doing" I hear Leah ask, half asleep.

"You hear that?"

Leah sits up rubbing her eyes and looking around.  "Yeah, what is that?".

The noise happens on and off for like 10 minutes as we struggle to listen. 30 little taps, and then nothing, then 10 more taps and then nothing.  This time it sounded like it was coming from the kitchen, and I figured I must have scared off whatever it was from the wall that morning.

Before i know it, Leah is out of bed switching all the lights on. 
"Oh my god, fuck this" and she headed toward the kitchen turning on every light along the way and muttering angrily.

I have to admit, I was paralyzed. With her out of bed, and me being alone in the room, I didn't budge an inch.  After a few seconds of silence I was about to call out to her when she beat me to the punch.  

All of a sudden she was at the bedroom door absolutely screaming full tilt "Oh very fucking funny, you fucking asshole!" and she throws something at me in the bed which hits me full in the face.

"What the fuck?" I ask as I taste blood in my mouth and start to tongue my front lip.  Looking down I see Mom's old white china clown doll in my lap, some of my blood on it's face, and I look up at her questioningly.

"Don't even" she crossed her arms. "I can't sleep, you're being an asshole, I get showered with shit, and you think it's funny to set me up like that?  What the fuck are you thinking?"

I've pissed her off in the past, but I've never seen her like this in my life.  I took a second to calm down and wipe the blood from my face before slowly calmly telling her "Leah, look at me.  I have no idea what you're talking about".

"The fucking clown.  You positioned it on the table like it was opening your little dream box or whatever.  Are you trying to freak me out or what?  Why would you do that?"

"What? I didn't do that."

She just looked at me disbelieving, and then threw up her hands.  She turned and I heard the front door slam, and then the car starting.  I tossed the doll and ran outside just in time to see her tearing down the road.

I sat down and waited for a couple hours, hoping she'd come back but she didn't.  I tried calling her, but I could hear her cell phone ring inside the house.  After a while I submitted to trying to get some sleep alone.  When I got back in the house, I cleaned up my face with spring water from the fridge, and grabbed a rag to clean up Mom's doll since I thought it might be worth something to someone.

Only I couldn't find it.  It wasn't in the bed, or under it.  After 20 minutes I gave up looking, and decided that maybe Leah had grabbed it when she left or something. Honestly, I was freaked out.  I kept trying to tell myself that she must have taken it, but I swear she didn't leave the doorway or bend over or anything.  And I'm pretty positive it was in my lap and I threw it after she left.

The rest of the night was quiet in the house, but I didn't sleep a wink.  I just rolled around all night.

Anyway, she called me an hour ago, she had slept in the car, drove around this morning and is heading back now.  We didn't really talk about anything real other than trying to make up and me trying to comfort her.  I honestly don't know what to say to her when she gets back.  And frankly I still have no idea what the hell happened.

I'm wondering if maybe Bob Blakemoore had come in and left that doll on the table or something.  He is always leaving his carvings with people.

Shit, anyway I'm gonna clean up.
I'll be in touch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate your concern.  I don't want to come off like a jerk but the fact is, I'm just not into any sort of religious or spirit stuff.  Seems to me that if those were real experience they would have been exposed to the light of day at this point, with cell phone camera's etc.

Occam's razor right?  

We're in an old house with bad wiring that hasn't been lived in since my Mom passed months ago.  Hey! Actually you may have just REALLY helped me figure something out!!!

It's got to be the Rats probably chewing on the wires!  I didn't even consider that till just now. THANK YOU for helping me think this through!  The rats are causing both the scratching AND the electric problems, totally makes sense!

Thank you! </TEXT>

Subject: Some Issues	

____________________________________________

Thanks for your reply.  I'm really glad to hear that Justin is feeling better.  I've heard that fevers at that age can be really crazy scary.  I'm sure you dealt with it well and I wish him a speedy recovery.  Tell him his uncle thinks he's a warrior!

I am so not complaining, but holy crap mom had a LOT of stuff.  Leah and I have been working like 12 hour days just going through clothes, boxes, drawers and doing our best to sort out mementos from trash, from stuff we might be able to sell on Ebay.  Think we're gonna make a small fortune on those old orange juice cups with the star wars characters on them.  Might be able to make a living off of the geek crowd!

You asked how things are going, so I wanted to give you an update.  

Honestly, things have been a bit weird over here.  You said mom didn't ever mention anything about rodents or whatever, but we've honestly not gotten a decent night's sleep since we got here.  It seems to be getting worse too.  It ramped up to the point where every hour or so at night there's this scratching noise that seems to be right in the room with us.  It seems really loud, but maybe it's because we're asleep and it's so quiet out here.  Then when we sit up or make any kind of movement or noise it just stops dead.

I swear Leah and I must have sat up in bed and just looked at eachother apprehensively for like 2 full minutes 10 times last night.  She is now totally convinced that it's rats, and furthermore she thinks they must have had babies.  That would explain the increase but I still think her phobia is getting the better of her.

She insisted that I do something about it, so I'm going to head to home depot tonight and get some tools so that I can open up some of the wall behind the headboard and check it out.  I'll have to do it when Leah's out at her class so I can "Say hello to my leeetle friend" :)

So one more question.  The lights.  There seems to be a problem with the electricity.  Did mom ever mention that?  I know you  talked to her a lot more near the end than I did.  Honestly if she mentioned anything about any issues in the house, can you try to remember and let me know?

Every once in awhile they flicker or dim.  At first I figured it was brownouts (this is a really rinky dink town) but it's been going on since we got here.  Once in awhile it seems like we get a surge or something as well.  The lights will just go super bright for a second, or the tv will turn on all of a sudden and I'll catch this weird burning smell.  

I don't want to make this your problem, just wondering if Mom mentioned anything.  Starting to expect aliens showing up at this point or something.  Oooh maybe it's the Grey's scratching at our walls to test our reflexes!  I'll have to ask Whitley Streiber. Ha.

Oh God, I almost forgot.  You'll never believe who we saw today. Here's your hints: Corn Cob pipe? straw hat? Feeding us candy cigarettes by the carton?

You got it!  I'm standing in the kitchen doing the dishes and I almost fall over.  Bob Blakemoore is literally pressing his wrinkled face against the kitchen window right in front of me. So once he had completely freaked me out we got him in through the front door and had coffee and reminisced for almost an hour. 

He was really sweet as always, and told me that the year he spent living with us after Dad died was the best year of his life. He's still smells of whiskey and tobacco, still smoking a corn cob pipe and still after all these years has those piercing light blue eyes.  It was really something to see him again, and believe it or not as he was leaving he pulled a little carved wooden dog from his pocket and gave it to me, just like when we were kids.  He must whittle ten of those things every single day and give them to everyone he comes across.

He talked a lot about you as well and we laughed for a while once he found out that you became a lawyer.  He snorted and said "That girl. Boy she loved to argue, every single minute of every day".  I think he had you pegged from the beginning. Anyway I filled him in on your family, kids, career and everything else.  He told me to make sure that I sent his regards.


Well, I'm really beat.  I'm going to try to get to bed early tonight and get some sleep before the nightly ruckus starts up again and I have to soothe Leah and try to convince her that it's definitely cute bunnies in the walls and not rats.

Chat soon!
