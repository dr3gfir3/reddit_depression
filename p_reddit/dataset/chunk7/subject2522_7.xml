	<TEXT> You are exactly the moderate this thread is about. Who are you to say someone's protest is wrong? What moral authority do you claim? Have you had to suffer under the oppression the minorities face in this country? The hatred they face on a daily basis? Comparing absolute statistics is a completely inappropriate way to analyze the problem, you need to look at rates. You will find that minority groups face a disproportional amount of police abuse, housing discrimination, finance discrimination, you name it. These are problems brown people face EVERY SINGLE DAY. Have you ever been scared of a regular traffic stop? Have you ever had people look at you with disgust because of what you are or who you are dating? 

Crime is a good start because the right loves to pump up those statistics to show 'the others are lesser.' That is so fucking wrong it makes me sick to my stomach. High crime is what happens when an entire population is disenfranchised and marginalized. When there is no opportunity to lead a successful life in the mainstream the only other options are crime. 

Brother, you need to dispel you ignorance. You need to understand the problem and have some god damn empathy. You need to go into these communities and see it for yourself instead of smugly judging people from behind you computer screen. You know where that gets you? More fucking hate and the cycle continuing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A single payer system will inevitably push down doctor pay. The only way to prevent students from shying away from medical school debt because of a lack of financial return is to reduce the cost of educating doctors. This is a big reason we have such a shortage of geriatric doctors. There are tons of open fellowships but they don't fill up becuase the pay in that field tends to be much lower because of Medicare.

 I'm not sure if you are trying to say medical schools should lower their standards, but that would be horrible. What we could use more of are physician's assistants.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You missed the second half of my view on intervention, we have to build the social architecture to make our interventions achieve our goals and protect our interests in the long term. 

Afghanistan was certainly required. Would you have preferred having an entire country for Al Qaeda to operate in with impunity along with a government that openly supported them? Afghanistan under the Taliban was a major national security threat to the United States, both our interests overseas and our domestic security. The intervention was less of a problem than the reconstruction and insurgency that followed. 

Vietnam was a travesty, so was Operation Iraqi Freedom. (Fun fact: the original operation name was Operation Iraq Liberation, but the acronym kind of made it too obvious.) We accomplished exactly what we set out to in Operation Desert Storm. I don't know what you are talking about. We protected our interests in Kuwaiti oil, while also deterring Saddam from taking further extraterritorial military action without our approval. 


Being a fiscal conservative doesn't make me a miser. You have a very distorted view of what it means to be a fiscal conservative. There is more to this world and policies than money. There are many intangibles that are arguably more important. </TEXT>

The watchdog had previously rated the Clinton Foundation with four stars in 2007, and in 2012 downgraded it to three stars due to changes in its methodology. Its original four-star rating was based on the foundation's financial health and performance. In 2012, it also evaluated the charity on accountability and transparency. Charity Navigator requires five independent board members, but the foundation had only three during the 2009 fiscal year, Thatcher said. The downgrade came the same year that Charity Navigator was a member of the Clinton Global Initiative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's why there are a bunch of poll workers. The idea is that all of the poll workers combined should be able to recognize most people in the precinct. Also, since you can only vote in your precinct it would be pretty impossible to vote multiple times. Your name wouldn't show up on the rolls of other precincts and once you sign in that's it, you can't vote again. You can try to impersonate someone else but you need to know their full name and what precinct they vote in and then hope they don't try voting and also haven't sent in an absentee ballot. The system is pretty rigorous and has worked pretty well for quite some time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not true at all. What is going on now is a twisted version of supply-side economics. The tax thing is really because Norquist is a giant asshole. Conservative economics is balancing the best of free market efficiency with government rules, more like the British Conservatives. Now, I am a center-right fiscal conservative and somewhat of a hawk. By that I mean I support military interventions if all other options have been exhausted, but we need to back them up with more funding through the State Department and USAID for any intervention to be successful.

I believe the government should spend its effort doing two things: (1) reduce inefficiencies in the market and (2) set and enforce the rules by which companies operate (i.e. regulations). Reducing inefficiencies also means realizing that is not possible in some areas. Prisons are my big issue, free markets put perverse pressures on private prison operators where they can really only post growth through recidivism and squeezing the money out of the inmates and families through morally questionable means. I also think the most efficient option for healthcare would be a single payer system coupled with more financial help for doctors going through medical school to prevent a shortage of doctors. Now, the best way to get to a single payer system is by expanding and reforming Medicaid and Medicare, until they cover nearly the entire population. At that point centralized reform would be politically amenable. Instead of traditional conservatism, think pragmatic libertarianism. Right now, I'm a disenfranchised Republican, because I do not support the religious right and its fight against religious liberties. I'm not a libertarian because I think the Fed is important, and I'm not a Democrat because there is a lot government expansion which is just ripe for corruption and is also terrible because the government is supposed to be terribly inefficient. That's a feature not a bug. It's to make it more difficult for our government to abuse our rights because institutional inertia should slow down decisions enough the public can take notice. 

I think the future of American conservatism will look more like the Tories in the UK (excluding the fiasco Cameron caused). </TEXT>

She has the knowledge and network to craft and implement the policies I want to see, like criminal justice reform, mental health reform, education reform, and infrastructure development. All this without raising our deficit by increasing taxes on the ultra wealthy. Hillary has been fighting for the rights of the disadvantaged since the beginning of her career. She has always been a fighter for our human rights. On top of that she will do great job at handling the complex foreign environment we currently find ourselves.

The same arrangement was in place at the previous house in Miami. The $5,500 per month rent was paid via Bannons accountants in Beverly Hills, but he was never there, according to someone with direct involvement in the rental arrangement, who requested anonymity for fear of repercussions from Bannon. In my opinion, he was not living there, said the source. He maybe came around twice a year for a couple of days at best, but he did not live there. The sources account was supported by another neighbor, who declined to be quoted for publication. </TEXT>

[270towin](http://www.270towin.com/historical-presidential-elections/) has a nice map of all presidential elections. It shows how parties sputtered and morphed during these elections. Maybe we are entering a new Era of Good Feelings as we focus on improving all the terribleness within us that Trump brought to the surface. I guess I can dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really think globalization has confused the US population on how its government really works. The federal government is extremely limited in what it can do. The federal government takes the 30,000 foot view and operates from there. Most federal policies will have minimal affect on the average citizen, except for tax and social welfare policies. The rest is state government and the government we really see and that affects us the most is our local government. That's our counties, our towns, and our school boards. 

If people don't like they way things are run, local elections are where the action is. On top of that, local elections are frequently decided by a handful of votes.  </TEXT>
