	<TEXT> Are you kidding me? Precisely in all editions before 5th full casters have *always* reigned supreme.

I agree with the fact that this is reality altering magic that should be powerful. However the DM rightfully possesses discretionary powers with regard to certain wishes. You see, when players enter the game there is an implicit understanding that they want the game to happen. Wishing for "slay the BBEG" or "bring me the McGuffin" flies directly in the face of that. But that's the extreme cases.

I also agree with regard to twisting wording. Toying with your players should be reserved for players who like to be toyed with.

But that's not a problem with wish. It's a problem with the DM.

It's a problem with how the game is arranged, with the clash in expectations, with ingrained preconceptions of the game.

A bit unrelated, going back to your "swing from the chandelier and drop onto the goblins scenario". Can you guarantee next time you will make the same call? This is my personal problem with 5e - lack of consistency(among other things). It's why I stick to 3.P. This is not a condemnation of 5e, just a preference borne of my priorities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **All the answer here are wrong!** ^(Unless they agree with what I said below.)

The correct answer is: However hard you both agree he should.

Here's a handy chart in case you're having trouble deciding:



\# | Lethality | Expectation
-|---------|-----------
0 | None | Characters may be rendered unconscious or disabled, but won't ever actually die, and won't suffer permanent injury. I love my characters and never want anything bad to happen to them. A TPK will result in the characters being rescued in some fashion.
1 | Very Low | Characters who "die" can come back with a permanent penalty of some kind, but won't actually die. This does not include obviously suicidal actions (swimming in lava, etc.). I like my character, and want to play them for a long time, but I'm okay with them taking a few hits along the way. A TPK will result in something bad happening to the characters, such as
2 | Low | Enemies will not actively attempt to kill disabled characters, but may kill the character while attempting to disable them. Enemies will not coup de grace anyone already unconscious. I like my character, and I'd rather not die. TPKs may result in players bleeding out or naturally recovering; it will fall entirely to the rolls of the dice.
3 | Normal | Enemies will attempt to kill disabled characters when the opportunity arises, but will typically focus on important threats first. I like my character, but death is a part of the game. TPKs will have varying results depending on the nature of the enemies; players may be killed or captured.
4 | High | Enemies will target easy targets, and will make a concerted effort to kill as many players as possible. Death will be a serious concern. Character death is a thing; I won't let it ruin the game for me. TPKs will have varying results depending on the nature of the enemies; players may be killed or captured, but are more likely to be killed.
5 | Very High | Someone will probably die every session. Encounters will be above average difficulty for your level. Combat will be fast and brutal. Fuck my character, I'll roll a new one. TPKs will have varying results depending on the nature of the enemies; players may be killed or captured, but are more likely to be killed.

	<TEXT> Me, I'd welcome this type of backseat gaming.

In fact I use a rule, where characters with certain knowledge skills can, once per session speak authoritatively on some subject. I.e. they can actually say something like "There's a dwarven village over that hill where a famous master armourer makes his home" and unless that contradicts the rules of the game or established canon, the arrangement is, that I have to accept that statement as truth.

This goes back to establishing that trust between each participant in the game, regardless of role. And of setting the correct expectations for a game, right from the get-go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Due to the unbelievable diversity of civilized creatures in my setting, racial or ethnic prejudice is very regionally specific, frequently on a historic or political basis. I also deliberately tend to avoid monoculture races(as is the norm in D D in general).  

Sexism... that's mostly non-existent. Real life humans are products of millennia of evolution and exhibit a fairly significant amount of sexual dimorphism.  
There is nothing in the magical land D D to back up that arrangement mechanically.  
Obviously there is some amount of sexism, but that's usually socio-cultural, or due to divine intervention. Take drow for example. Which means that a different culture would have different customs and traditions. Remember that bit about avoiding monocultre races?

Violence in itself is given no special treatment regardless of variety. The details depend on the comfort level of the players of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, yes. The quick resolution is something we can all agree on. In fact I'd lower the threshold to 1 minute.

My point is that, although it is the DMs prerogative to make the ultimate ruling, he shouldn't abuse the authority, since this is a group activity, a collaborative effort, not a solo performance. If a player brings up a certain inconsistency and the party all agrees, then the DM should only overturn this if he has a very good reason to do so. This is where trust comes in. In a party where trust is established, the players will accept a questionable ruling, because can trust the DM to have a good reason to do so. Where this trust is missing, is get where you get arguments.

And people don't realize how many of their decisions are subtly motivated by fear. Fear for the safety of their character, for the integrity of the game or their fun. Fear of confrontation. Of being screwed over. Of having their agency taken away. Fear of veering into territory you have no prepared material for. Fear of ruining the story you want to tell. Fear of being forced to improvise.

So what is agency? It is the ability to meaningfully affect the world around you. It requires the ability to make predictions about that world. If the rules change so often that you never know what the result of your actions will be, that impinges on your agency. And people will argue and rules-lawyer to hell and back if it allows them to preserve that. No so-called "rules-lawyer" argues for minutes on end just because they like being confrontational(well maybe some do, but that falls wholly outside the game by that point). They argue because it threatens their ability to have fun in the game.

This of course doesn't address the dickheads who use the game as a vehicle for other, mostly out of game purposes. That however is a whole 'nother can of worms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This attitude of deference and blind obedience to the DM needs to **die**.

You said so yourself, you have a person who has expertise at your table and one who doesn't. Do the real-life common sense thing and trust the one with the expertise.

Set up procedures to handle rules inconsistencies. Ask the DM how much he is willing to stick to the rules. Ask the player how much he is willing to tolerate the rules not being stuck to.

A reasonable arrangement IMO, is for the experienced player to, once, correct the DM whenever he makes a mistake, on the promise that the DM will accept that correction unless he has good reason not to. Of course that requires trust, and we all know how hard that is to acquire. People simply don't realize how many interactions between DM and players are governed by fear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the DMs point of view... most real-life humans are petty. They don't like getting blindsided.

This is not a defense of him, but it is a concise illustration of my point, from the player side.

Even I have, consciously and deliberately done this. Why? Because it works. In my case it worked. The DM caved. But only because he had been placed before a done deal. When it had already been too late.  
There was a campaign where the DM was being unreasonably restrictive with sticking to the rules. So when I was denied a small concession to realize the character I wanted, I went in whole hog, instead abusing the rules, to the letter, just so I can get my character to work. It is something I would never allow as a DM, but I was attached to that character and as a player had been backed into a corner.

This is precisely the sort of adversarial attitude and defensiveness I was referring to. It's unhealthy for the campaign as a whole. </TEXT>

Technically I have the data documented in text files and spreadsheets, but just entering that into a sheet again will be a pain in the butt.

Backup your shit people.

Your characters.  
Your campaign documents.  
Your scribbled notes.  
*Backup everything!*

(I should know, the drive with my entire campaign recently perished. And now mythweavers. If I hadn't had a backup, basically the entire campaign would have ended then and there.) </TEXT>

I'd like to point out something else - sometimes in spell tables you'll see a dash: "-"  
That means that you cannot cast spells at that level, period.

However sometimes you'll see a zero - "0". Which means that you would only be able to cast spells of that level if you have bonus spells from a high ability score. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just another way to describe AC:

**Touch AC:** Your AC without armor or other things you wear. I.e. the active component of AC, how much you can move out of the way.  
**Flat-footed AC:** Your AC when you can't react. I.e. the passive component. How many protective things you've got on you.

***
Also, conceptually, the game has a much wider range of values. I.e. the lowest bonuses are lower than in 5e and the highest bonuses are *much* higher. Ability scores are not capped. You can have 30 strength. Or even 100.

Oh, forgot this: There's the concept of "Ability damage", where certain effects reduce your ability scores temporarily(damage) or permanently(drain). And negative levels are a thing. You can have your levels drained(usually by undead). </TEXT>

It seems in every story the party just puts up with the DM, no matter how crazy things get. Even experienced players and DMs seem to just bend over.

Very rarely the party bands together against the DM, but I've never really seen any stories where they actually organized and tried to get the game back on track, salvage it or just collectively refuse to submit to the authority of the DM.

Have any of you played or been witness to such a momentous event?

	<TEXT> Depends on why you might wanna play previous editions.

3.5e ramps up the complexity and depth of the game by an order of magnitude or two. You can do more, play more, and you need to keep track of more.

2e(which I have only barely played), is, as I understand it, very much an all-in affair. You either get all the books you can get your hands on, or don't bother at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also

* Casters reign supreme.

* Numbers are much broader.  
The fact that numbers start lower and go higher means that at L1 you're a peasant, at L20 you are a god. Opposite to 5e where at L1 you're an adventurer, at L20 you're a slightly more heroic adventurer.

* Character building takes a lot of time.  
It's finicky. The range of the system means that not all character options are suitable for all games. For example the toughness feat is pointless in any game that moves past level 1-2.  
People tend to use the word "trap" options, which is somewhat of a misnomer.

* You can actually play monsters.  
You can play dragons(not dragonborn, actual dragons, the same ones you'd fight otherwise). You can play undead, vampires, liches, what have you. And everything in between.

* There are some rules dysfunctions.  
Your table better be prepared to actually apply common sense. </TEXT>

If it's the first, you need to start with anything from a simple talk about letting the game flow to an ultimatum on behaving.

If he's right mostly however... well, introduce the idea of him correcting you once, and accepting your ruling, then talking about it after the session. But it needs to be a discussion(with you willing to give), not just "I am the DM, that's why I made that ruling". You need to be able to accept and stick to corrections.
