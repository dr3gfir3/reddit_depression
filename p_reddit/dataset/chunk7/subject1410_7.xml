	<TEXT> As a man who grew up about the same time as the internet, I've learnt to take everything with a rather large pinch of salt. I've had death threats, threats saying that I should kill myself etc etc (I used to be head mod of a sub with 50k+ subs and when FPH got shut down we got brigaded, but that's a completely different story), so it's something I'm "used to".

But one guy took it one step too far and I got super uncomfortable. I contacted the owner of the website who told me that he would help me with everything that I need. After that I phoned the none emergency 911 number and told the lady on the phone that I wanted to report someone threatening me on the internet. She sounded like she was around my age and was understanding. She took down all the notes and messages that I gave her together with the name and phone number of the website owner. 

A few weeks pass and I get a letter in the mail from the police telling me that the case has been dropped because they didn't see any value in continuing it.
I phone the number on the papers and get to speak with the officer in charge of the case. 

This was a woman, in around her 40-50's who had NO clue what she was talking about.

"You know you can't track people with IP addresses, right?"

"Uh, yes you can."

"Yeah, but not the way you think."

"You can track down a person to the specific computer using their IP address."

"Yeah... maybe. But it's not as easy as you think."

"....yes it is."

"Yeah. But do you really think he would admit to threatening someone over the internet? He could say that someone else has been using his account and internet! We can't prove that he did it."

"Do you think he'd admit to threatening me in real life if you that would've happend as well?"

"No... probably not. But still, there's no value in continuing this. But I do see here that someone has actually taken up the case again..."

So apparently someone higher up had taken up the case again. Great, right?! No. He took it up just to dismiss it again, saying that there wasn't enough evidence to support it. That I found out a few days later when a new letter arrived in the mail. To make things even better he went on vacation the day after, so I had to wait another month before I could speak to him.

He told me that they hadn't even contacted the website owner who would provide them with every detail they needed. They didn't deem it "necessary". </TEXT>

De som krde bussarna gjorde ju det fantastiska valet att slppa av supportrarna p Mllevngstorget.

Fr de som inte vet s r Mllevngstorget "mecca" fr MFF-supporters. Det r drifrn man tgar till stora matcher, det r dr folk tar sin "infr matchen"-l och det r dr man tittar p matchen om man inte str p lktaren.

S att vlja att slppa av tv busslaster med Hammarbyare var ett vldigt dumt val. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started out with the SNES when I was about seven years old, I think. After that I basically only played on consoles up to about two years ago.

SNES, SEGA Megadrive, PS1, PS2, PS3, Xbox and 360. Then I started playing PC and about half a year ago I upgraded myself to a real gaming PC.

From the beginning I mostly played Adventure Games. I was really bad at shooting, so that wasn't really an option. Later on I played Rock Band (Drumming) A LOT. I used to be top 200 in the world for a while.

I remember my first games being Krusty's Fun House (which was insanely difficult for a seven year old) to the SNES, Crash Bandicoot 2 for the PS1, Whacked! (which, despite the really low scores was funny as hell) for the original xbox, CoD World At War for the 360 and Heavy Rain for the PS3.

I've also realized how much I've shifted in the games I played. I played adventure and sports games for the most part. I also played a lot of RPG's when I got my first computer, but I never really liked WoW. 

For a few years I played a lot of Civ V as well (and I'm really looking forward to buying VI!). But today I've gone back a lot to adventure games again. A lot of story driven and linear games instead of open world games. (says the guy who's munching through No Man's Sky right now....). But I realized that it's actually really nice to play a single player story driven game where you don't HAVE to be creative and build stuff on your own. </TEXT>

But the mosquitoes have basically stopped biting me by now. I think I've gotten three bites in the last five years or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It kinda depends on what kind of hardcore shows you go to.

Some of the old school hardcore shows would involve fighting. Even early SlipKnoT shows would involve people bringing baseball bats and other weapons to beat each other up.

Or just look att G.G Allin shows, where he himself participated.

Most of the kids in the gif are probably the type of kids who want to mosh on their own, flailing their arms around, not caring if other people get hit, but would actually never participate in a "real" moshpit where pushing and shoving is required. </TEXT>

The tuition is $4.300 (they apparently pay half, so $8.600 for the full price) for  "50 Personal Instruction Lessons" and "More than 300 Hours of Learning". That's quite a lot of money.

They also "guarantee a $40,000/yr Job!" if you live in the US, Canada or the UK. </TEXT>

And when it does show servers, I can't connect to them. It just says that it can't connect.

Another thing that kinda bummed me out as well is that I found a server that I played around on, but it won't show up in my server history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The funny thing is that Apple isn't the first company to do this. I think HTC had one or two phones where they skipped the 3,5 jack and nobody batted an eye. But as soon as Apple does something, people go apeshit.

For example, when Apple took away flash support people went "HOLY SHIT. YOU CAN'T DO THAT", and then just a couple of months later, most major companies went "Oh, right, Flash sucks. We use HTML5 instead now." 

To be honest, the 3,5 jack is an outdated technology. It's just convenient to use it. If one of the companies that produce phones with Android would choose to remove the 3,5 jack, I'm pretty sure nobody would really care. </TEXT>
