	<TITLE> The Athanasia Killer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-23 22:56:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was down in Clay County doing another fluff piece on a State Fair when the murder happened not six blocks away. The Athanasia Killer had struck again; in a furious funk over my bitter divorce and highly unwilling to go back home to face it, I decided I was going to investigate. I'd once been the best. I'd once felt skilled and sharp. I'd once been young, and a *real* journalist, but none of that mattered now in the era of entertainment media, endless spin, and oceans of straight-up lies. Here, though, was something meaty that could not be denied.

I couldn't have chosen a worse target for a midlife crisis. The Athanasia Killer was purely a local legend kept alive by word of mouth in the South. Police and media alike never believed that the killings were done by the same person, and city and state officials vehemently denied they were serial killings at all. The first murder had been committed in 1809, you see, and the rest had been sporadic throughout the last two centuries. The victims had all been unrelated in any sense that investigators could see, and the similar methods had been blamed on copycats.

Nobody paid it any mind until a local resident charged with murder in 1967 argued the possibility of one secretly-long-lived man or a father and son pair of murderersand won. The defense lawyer coined the name the Athanasia Killer, and the jury unanimously bought it. The local media decried it as a farce against justice and chalked it up to the defendant being white and judged by a jury of white men. The national media refused to cover any of it.

But the murders continued. There I was in Clay County, March 15th, 2016, and the Athanasia Killer had struck again. What were they expecting people to believe now, 207 years later? Was this a son-father-grandfather-great-grandfather thing, with the family members still committing murders in their eighties? No, the residents had now defaulted to that crazier notion: it was the same man, somehow unaging, perhaps a wanderer living off the grid for fear of his immortality being found out. Perhaps the murders were how he stayed young, in some arcane or occult fashion. That was nonsense, of course, but some part of me hoped it was true. If I busted a case like that open on the national stage, well, damn, all my problems would disappear.

My first stop was Maury's Apothecary. The eldest daughter of the store's namesake had been the most recent victim, and I found the pepper-haired older man standing behind the counter in his store absently staring into space. "Maury?"

He jumped, and then looked at me with vaguely haunted eyes. "Can I help you?"

I showed him my credentials, pretending I was a bit more of a reporter than I truly was. "I was hoping you were open to talking a bit. Just seeing if you know anything about this Athanasia Killer."

He nodded then, and his eyes sharpened focus. "He's a bastard."

"You know him?" I asked, detecting some layer of strangeness behind the man's reaction.

"No." He turned away quickly. "Please go. I don't want to talk about this."

I decided not to push the issue. Instead, I went back to my motel room and did some research on the victim. It turned out that she had been quite the rebellious teenager; often in trouble with the law during high school, she'd graduated both to college and to greater risks. In the court records, it seemed Maury had paid great sums for legal defense and for bail on numerous occasions. I wondered if a small store could survive with expenses like thatin some sense, the Athanasia Killer had done his family a sick sort of favor.

My next stop was the sheriff's office, where a hard-eyed white-haired war veteran glared me down from the other side of his desk. I inquired about Maury's eldest daughter, and his face instantly perked upeven though his eyes, subtly, did not. "She was a wonderful girl. A light of this town, for sure. A shame what that monster did to her. If I ever find him, I'll string him up." 

Strange. There was that implied familiarity again, by referring to the killer as *he* or *him* directly rather than something less specific. "So she never caused trouble?"

The sheriff shook his head. "Nope. Delightful church-going girl."

I placed a few records on his desk. "But it says here you were her arresting officer on numerous occasions."

His fake smile fell hard. He put a hand down to his gun reflexively, but then visibly thought better of it. "We don't speak ill of the dead here, son."

A nice recovery, but I didn't believe him. Still, I knew when to back off. I bid a quick farewell and retreated.

Now noticing an odd spike in the number of law enforcement vehicles passing me on the streets, I decided to be a bit more careful. I checked out of my motel and drove out of townwith the sheriff casually driving a few cars back until he was satisfied I was leaving. Once deep in the back woods, I turned right around and checked into a different motel.

The previous victim had been killed about eight years before. This one had been a man of about forty-five, with a spotless record and glowing obituaries whose stories notably included no mention of anything within the span of his five years of unemployment prior to his death. The stories of his life just *stopped* with the loss of his job. I couldn't help but think of the sheriff's attitude toward speaking ill of the dead.

What link did he have to a rebellious college girl? I visited his home, a ramshackle century-old dwelling with an overgrown yard, and I was surprised to find that it was still inhabited. A trashy but attractive blonde girl in her late twenties opened the front door and shouted at me, thinking I was a prowler. Quickly, I introduced myself as a reporter investigating the Athanasia Killer, and she tensed unconsciously.

"Whatcha wanna know about him for?" she asked, looking back over her shoulder into the depths of her house.

Frowning, I asked quietly, "Do we need to talk elsewhere?"

"No, no," she said, looking warily past me at the street, before locking her eyes on mine. "I don't want no trouble."

"Is he here?" I whispered. "Is he threatening you?"

She hesitated before saying, "No."

"Then how would he find out what we talk about? I won't tell anyone. He can't possibly know."

Taking a step backward, she shook her head. "He'll know."

I reached forward automatically to say something like, "Wait," but she recoiled horribly and shrieked.

"Whoah," I told her. "I wasn't trying to hurt you."

Red-faced and anxious, she held a hand to her heart while she tried to calm her breathing. "It's not you. It's me. I'm sorry. Just don't touch me." She took another few breaths and said, "I can't talk to you."

"Wait, is it just you here?" I asked, pressing just a tiny bit more. "This is a big house for just you."

"It was my uncle's," she said, closing the door as she spoke. "Sorry. Don't ask around about this."

I stared at her closed front door for a few moments while trying to put two and two together. From my experience interviewing people, she'd definitely seemed traumatized by something. Had her uncle grown abusive during his many years of unemployment? She would have been very young back then, and that would explain her reaction to a stranger's touch. His death must have left her with this big house, and free of her abuseragain, the Athanasia Killer seemed to have done someone a favor through murder. But how could he have known about something as private as abuse? There was no way he was just some wanderer.

The hairs on the back of my neck rose, and I felt uncomfortably observed. Scanning her overgrown yard, I cautiously looked for threats, but saw none. Beyond the low wall that marked the beginning of the sidewalk, a housewife in purple sweats stood talking on her phone, a dog leash in hand. I saw her glance my way and then quickly move on. I usually had good instincts for danger, but surelyno. I shook my head. This was a strange county for sure, full of quiet dark places under the trees and hidden familial miseries, but the Athanasia Killer was not a housewife in purple sweats.

Visiting a diner for a coffee and a moment to figure out my next move, I sat and stared out the window. The street was wide but slow, and scattered locals went about their business at a country pace. This whole region had been more or less gutted by economic looting at the hands of corrupt politicians, and the high unemployment showed. The most made-up woman around was the waitress serving coffee, and I heard a few haggard men at the counter stools promise they'd pay up next week. She just sighed, smiled, and said, "Sure thing, dolls."

Lost in thought, I'd forgotten to actually sip my coffee; the delay gave me a chance to notice the odd smell. Looking closer, I saw thicker bubbles than I was used to. Suspicious, I dabbed my pinky and touched the corner of my lip ever so slightly. My heart began beating faster as I felt a slight swelling.

Poison!

I wanted to jump up and warn the men at the counter, but they'd already taken gulps. I watched, starkly poised in my seat, as nothing happened. Staring around in horror, I looked for any possible avenue of access to my coffee. I'd watched the waitress pour it, and I'd had it in my hands the entire time! The townsfolk outside went about their business, oblivious to the attempt on my lifeexcept for one teenage boy on the sidewalk across the street. He noticed me notice him, and he immediately turned and walked off.

It was then I began to question the myth itself. What if the Athanasia Killer wasn't an immortal man at all? What if it was something worse? A spirit, or an entitywith my mind opened to new possibilities, I was willing to consider anything. What if this region had a guardian spirit that dealt brutally with threats to the wellbeing of its residents?

No, waitthe cup. The cup could have been coated with poison! That would let the waitress pour the same coffee to everyone without me being the wiser. But who could have done it? "Ma'am, excuse me. Is there anyone else working?"

The waitress frowned instinctively at the odd question, but then visibly remembered it was her job to smile. "The cook. He just left on lunch a minute ago. You know him?"

I leapt up and ran outside without answering. Around the corner of the diner, I saw a chubby man in grubby white clothes removing his stained apron. At hearing my approach, he turned, saw me, widened his eyes, and then took off running. I roared at him and called up some of my long-dormant endurance from my younger days. Just barely catching him as he stumbled, I gripped his shirt hard and demanded an answer. "Why did you try to poison me? Are you the Athanasia Killer?"

He shook his head forcefully enough to jiggle his jowls. "Oh God, don't say anything! Please, for the love of all that's holy, pretend you didn't catch me!"

"What?" I glared murderously to show him I was done with vague games. "Pretend to who?"

"*Everyone,*" he whispered, terrified.

To our left, three middle-school age children playing behind a chain-link fence began to take notice. One pulled out a cellphone and began making a call.

"No!" the cook shrieked. Fighting away with the strength of a desperate animal, he stumbled, jumped up despite skinned hands, and ran with a speed that defied his form. I let him go, now intent on another lead.

Crossing the cracked suburban pavement, I shouted at the kid with the phone. "Who are you calling?"

He froze.

"Who the *hell* are you calling?" I roared, hoping to intimidate him into blowing the conspiracy. Opening the chain-link gate, I stormed over and grabbed his phone. My heart immediately sank, and I felt like a fool. "911, of course. You saw a man getting beat up, and you called the cops."

The kids quivered in place.

I handed the closest back his phone and held my hands up apologetically. "Sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. I'll just go now."

It was my turn to run.

What the hell was wrong with me? How could I have thought that *middle schoolers* were in on some vast murderous conspiracy? A conspiracy of two hundred years involving an entire county was unthinkable in its proportions, but that left either an immortal avenging vagrant or some sort of guardian native spirit. Both of those possibilities made me feel just as nuts. On top of that, I was now thoroughly lost, and my phone had run out of battery charge due to my overuse of the map app in a foreign place.

The sheriff's car pulled up alongside me as I walked, and those hard veteran eyes were upon me once more. "The hell are you still doing in town?"

I shrugged sheepishly. "Sorry."

"And are you harassing *kids?*" he asked. "Get in. I'll take you back to your car, then you're gonna get outta here or I'm gonna charge you with whatever I can."

There was no other choice, really. I climbed into his passenger seat and listened graciously as he berated me about coming into other people's towns and causing trouble.

"I'm a sheriff, see," he continued. "I take care of people around here, and guys like you don't make my job any easier. Now I don't like running people out of the county, but it's all part of the duty. Two hundred years, men like me been doin' our duty. I"

My hearing tuned out as I recalled a bronze plaque in the sheriff's office: *Est. 1805.*

Tuning back in, I hid any signs of anxiety and promised I'd head right out and give up on my fool's errand of an investigation. Throughout, all I could think was: a conspiracy didn't have to involve the entire county, at least not knowingly. Who did they call when things went wrong? An abused little girl, a stressed parent, wary housewives, scared kids playing in a yard

"Why's your hand shaking like that, son?"

I stilled it instantly. It was too late. He knew.

He sighed unhappily, pulled the car over, and climbed out. "Get out."

I didn't move. What options did I have left? My phone had died, and I was on some random unfamiliar road. I doubted there would be help from the run-down houses on either side.

He tapped his holstered gun. "Get out of the car."

Again, I had no choice. Breathing hard, I got out and stood, and he pushed me toward a blind alley between two houses filled with tall grass and gravel. "Don't do this."

"Idiot," he said fiercely. "You brought this on yourself."

I heard the sound of his gun being unholstered and drawn. "I won't tell anyone, I swear!"

"You're a reporter. I literally don't believe you."

"What if" A flash of desperate ideas occurred to me. "What if I helped you? If you really want to protect this county, I've got a way better use for your duty. It's obvious to any outsider."

My heart pounded in my chest a good thirty times before he finally said, "I'm listening."

I outlined the proposed partnership as best I could. "With my skills, I can uncover the corruption as it happens. I can figure out who's taking bribes, who's selling out the county, and what they're getting in exchange. That's how you help everyone at oncedon't take out criminal teenagers or abusive uncles. Take out the politicians that bankrupted the whole region, and maybe scare some people straight nationwide. Guarantee a few high-profile murders and a couple anonymous statements from the Athanasia Killer about corruption will dramatically change how things are done. Scare them shitless."

"Huh." He laughed darkly. "You're a goddamn genius, son. Only problem is, it's all bullshit. The moment I let you walk away, you'll squeal, and a two-century civic institution here will go down the drain."

"No," I insisted, turning to face his gun. "I promise."

"Promise ain't good enough. We gotta be bound by greater than that. You gotta be *implicated.* That way, I know you won't tell a soul."

His terms weren't nearly as stomach-turning as I expected. Feeling a little bit like my problems *were* actually about to disappear, I returned to that diner for a coffee and sat with a tentative smile while my phone charged from the adjacent outlet. This was an unexpected turn of events, but my midlife crisis could certainly have turned out worse. I would have a new job now, and a new duty that actually *meant something.* All it would take was one little sacrifice I was pretty sure I was willing to make.

Dialing that familiar number for the last time, I said, "Hey, it's me. I'm sorry I've been so combative about the divorce. I'll give you everything you want. I'll sign the papers today, if you're willing to drive down and meet me where I'm working. No, I'm serious. Clay County. You willing to make that drive? Yeah? Good. I'll see you soon." I hesitated in response to her unexpected emotion. I did mean it, but just not the way she thought: "I'm sorry things turned out this way, too." I hung up and sighed. My heart was heavy, but something excited me about the chance to make a difference again. With the media firmly locked down and kept a circus, exposing corruption like I'd done in my youth was no longer enough. I sighed again, this time happily.

"Looks like you found the Athanasia Killer after all." Across the table, sitting opposite me, the sheriff reached out a hand while the cook and the waitress looked on from behind their counter. "Welcome to the team." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A wall of awed, angry, and hopeful faces blocked the passage. "Tell us more!"

"What's the future like?"

"When does all this end?"

"Tell us more!"

"Where should we go? Are we safe here?"

Neil pushed along the edge of the tunnel by using his free hand to force people away from the unyielding stone. Behind him, Grayson held his arms up high and tried to calm the crowd. "Go on ahead," he shouted over, and Neil looked back to see the sea of people reforming in his wake.

On his own with Kumari now, he cut to the other side of the tunnel and moved with the flow of people heading deeper. Keeping the booth and cave numbers in his head, he thought of nothing else as he wended his way through the moss-glow-orange labyrinth. In a way, he *needed* to think of nothing but those numbers, for all the arms brushing against his, all the faces passing through his sight, and all the cries of children in his ears were purely sensations of the unknowing doomed.

He couldn't say a word. He couldn't save themexcept for one, maybe. Reaching the small possession-free booth, he began asking around. The trail of neighbor-given clues led him out of the main population and into a work area, where men and insect alike toiled in great caverns that glowed fiercely with an array of exotic mosses. More questions brought him to a grotto radiating dark blue up to an unseen ceiling, where he heard a familiar Australian accent from afar as its owner joked with the other men.

"Yadav!" Showman turned and wiped his face to clear off sweat. "Good to see you've not bought it, but this heat's no place for a baby."

Neil tried to act natural while the other laborers stopped scraping glimmering blue moss from the deep water-filled pits and turned to watch him while they took a break. "Um, this'll just take a minute. I'm going on a mission with a new friend, and I think your skills would be very helpful."

A man on the other end of the pool poked fun. "What skills would those be, Showman?"

The Australian shrugged it off. "Very funny. I'm needed here, Neil." He nodded toward some of the insects. "The boys don't get along with the Zkirax very well on their own. Rough men, the lot. I suppose I'm something of a mediator."

"Yeah, that's what we need," Neil said, feeling his chest tighten as the possibility that his friend might refuse became very real.

"What's the mission, then?"

He couldn't think of anything plausible on the spot, and the truth certainly couldn't be spoken in front of the Zkirax. "I can't say. But it's important."

Showman leaned on his rake. "Sorry. I've got a role, and I'm bad luck anyway." He grinned as the other men laughed heartily.

His face warmer than even the grotto's air, Neil grabbed at his last hope. "Showman, you look richie."

That rugged face slowly lost its red tones as all the humor within drained away. He swallowed once, his eyes ever so carefully making a slow scan of his immediate surroundings as he re-evaluated the connotations of the situation at large. A moment later, he donned joviality once more, his unease completely hidden. "For old times' sake, maybe I'll give it a shot. Let's go."

His heart thudding in his chest, Neil did his best to lead his friend casually out of the caverns. He made sure not to look back, despite feeling multi-faceted Zkirax eyes watching him with suspicion. There was no way the insects could know what that phrase had meant, but he still remained tense until they made it back to his booth. By then, Showman had noticed what he'd avoided looking at, and the two of them sat with Kumari and made fake small talk until Grayson returned.

The lanky man now held an enormous backpack, and he sat and began rummaging through the numerous supplies and food within.

"What's all that?" Neil asked.

"They outfitted us," Grayson responded. "Who's he?"

"A friend."

Showman held his hand out and Grayson shook it, but an unspoken exchange of glances told the Australian that this newcomer was also aware that something was terribly wrong around them. The three managed not to tip off the watching insects stationed carefully around the cavern.

Edgar arrived less than an hour later. Introductions were made, and then he said, "Come on, guys. Smile. Joke around. We have to walk out of here like we're on a missionbecause we are."

They did their best. Neil focused on his little daughter. She smiled and cooed at the constant attention, completely unaware that they were leaving safety once more, if that was even what it truly had been. The thought of these caves filled with billions of comatose people being fed upon turned his stomach, but he fought the urge to vomit.

At long last, the tunnel curved up sharply, and cold breezes floated past them. The final ascent was made in silence, and Neil covered his daughter's face and squinted at the seemingly bright light of the surface. After a few moments, his eyes adjusted, and he saw that the corpse-littered surface world was gloomier, greyer, and colder than when he'd gone below that morning. How long had he been in that strange crowded underworld? It had felt like two weeks lived in a single day, and this was a return to the harsh realities of life.

Two men awaited them next to a weathered pickup truck loaded down with gear and supplies. Mashburn introduced himself grimly and quietly in a manner that matched his solemn demeanor and white-streaked beard hiding a grizzled face; Cantey, a younger clean-shaven man with slicked back hair, just nodded and climbed on the truck.

Once they were all in the back and the truck was wending its way between endlessly scattered bodies, Showman whispered, "What's this all about?"

Neil looked to Edgar, whose head he could see through the back glass of the front cab, but there was no indication of whether the two new men could be trusted. "Later."

"I'm no soldier," the Australian muttered. "I trust you, specifically. I don't know any of these guys."

Despite the rough ride, Grayson had somehow heard their exchange from the other corner of the back bed. "Trust'll get you killed these days."

Showman narrowed his eyes, but said nothing further.

The truck came to an abrupt stop. Mashburn and Edgar both leaned out of their windows and looked ahead in the evening gloom. Cantey rose and peered over the cab.

Neil scanned the area, but he didn't want to stand with Kumari in his arms. "What's going on?"

"There's somebody walking toward us up ahead." Cantey opened a strapped crate and pulled out binoculars. After a moment's calibration, he shouted. "Go!"

Mashburn didn't hesitate. Sliding back into the cabin, he hit the gas. The kick knocked all of them back a bit, and Neil shouted again as he wrapped his arms around his daughter. When he managed to sit back up, he understood why the other men were suddenly so wary: countless silhouettes staggered slowly toward them from a hundred different directions. The longer he stared at the passing strangers, the more it dawned on him that these were not bandits or refugees. One slid by the speeding truck almost in grasping distance, and he recoiled as it clearly called, "*Hel*" in a rasping and pained voice despite the lack of a jaw.

Grayson rummaged quickly in his backpack full of supplies and pulled out a handgun. Showman dipped a hand back into his own gear and slid out a length of fearsome wood. Bracing on his knees, Cantey searched through another crate and brought out a rifle. Worried about the loud noises the guns might make, Neil held Kumari with his forearms covering her ears. Thinking it was some sort of game, she laughed and batted at his hands. He wanted to ask what was happening, but he doubted the others knew any more than he did.

The first impact sent a half-frozen and half-rotted woman up and over the front of the truck; her body cleared the back, but gore sprayed down into the bed nonetheless. Barely outside the mess, Neil pulled a blanket and covered his daughter.

But not all of her had made it. A single remaining eye glared up at him, and the jaw muscles kept moving as if she was trying to speak. Showman picked her up by the hair and threw her off into the thickening mass of closing figures. "What the hell's going on, Neil?!"

"I don't know!" he shouted back. "I don't know anything about this!"

More impacts up front followed, and the truck bounced over new bumps. Horrifying rows of passing hands began reaching over the metal edges of the truck bed, and Neil pushed them away desperately. A gasping man with a hole in his chest managed to grab on and climb up, and Grayson put the gun to his forehead and fired without a moment's hesitation.

Gore splattered backwards into the airbut the dead man kept coming.

"What the shit?" Cantey yelled. He added a forceful upwards kick, and their new passenger went sailing off into the sea of hands. Grayson stared, momentarily stunned. Neil could hear the clamor now, even over the roar of the truck's aging engine: some gasped, some shouted, and some, lacking lungs, simply clapped their decaying hands.

Beset by resistance ahead, the truck began to slow.

Neil fought away foul-smelling hands while critically aware of Showman laying about with his heavy stick right overhead. He'd asked for a break from existence itself on that bleak plain where he'd met Edgar, but had it all been a cruel joke? To stay in the tunnels of the Zkirax meant death, but leaving had only cast them into *this,* to be torn apart by the dead! He bent down hard against the floor of the truck, intent on shielding Kumari to the lastand then the resistance ahead cut away, and their speed grew rapidly.

"What the hell was that?" 

"Jesus Christ!"

"Mashburn, get us out of here!"

Sitting up slowly, he looked back and saw a wall of staggering silhouettes marred by a gaping truck-sized hole. The older man up front had carved his way right through, and managed to escape in the process. The other men in the truck remained wide-eyed, alert, and stunned until they'd managed to drive across the plains and through two rifts. Deep into the dark hours of the night, they set up camp in a defensible position among a jumble of boulders a glacier must have deposited long ago. Only then, ringed by stone, a campfire roaring at their center, and Cantey and Grayson on guard above, did they begin talking. In hushed emotional tones, they compared what they'd seen and shared their thoughts.

"It's not zombies," Edgar muttered. "Big line item in the Thompson Doctrine: zombies aren't real. They just don't make sense."

"Damn sure looked like zombies," Mashburn said, gripping his handgun close.

Showman sat, quiet but brooding, his gaze shifting among the others.

"I shot one in the head," Grayson whispered down from his high boulder. "It didn't even flinch. They're not zombies, at least not the way we've seen them portrayed."

While carefully feeding Kumari the first real food she'd had in weeks, Neil said, "I think one was asking for help."

"I don't like the sound of that," Mashburn grunted. "Iffin' we just assumed they were hostiles."

Neil saw Edgar glance his way; the long-haired man seemed to be holding back something dark and haunting. Waiting until the others went to sleep and Cantey and Grayson moved to posts slightly further out for better visibility, he wrapped Kumari in a bundle, let her doze off, and then slipped over to Edgar's spot by the fire. "You're holding a lot of cards close to your chest, aren't you?"

Edgar gazed over sadly for a moment, but said nothing.

"Like the fact that you really did die," Neil whispered. "And when you sprang up in the rain like that, you said you knew what the Grey Riders were about."

"We agreed it would put you and your daughter in danger"

"We're beyond that," he said directly. "I think we're in bigger danger not knowing. AndI'm not a soldier, but I think you should teach me what you know. Anything can happen out here."

Nodding slowly, Edgar responded, "Fair enough. Tomorrow you should start eating more, and I'll show you some exercises. Maybe train with a gun a little."

Neil stared down at the fire, thinking about how he'd nearly cut his arm off. "I haven't been truly tested yet. I know this. I've been to the edge, even looked over into the unthinkable, yeah, but I still know. I'd do anything to protect that little girl. She's more than innocent. She's a light in this nightmare, and she doesn't know anything about insects that are going to eat us or the Crushing Fist or evil masterminds."

"Cristina Thompson's not evil," Edgar replied, shaking his head. "That would be too easy. No, whatever her agenda, she believes she's doing the right thingand she has the knowledge, will, and ruthlessness to pull it off no matter what anyone else thinks."

"Is she really that good?"

Edgar's eyes caught his at just the right angle to reflect the glimmering fire. "My squad leadermy friendKendrick, he's a big guy. Strong as hell, tough-headed, and he's got machine strength thanks to Her Glorylong story. He even survived the Fight."

"*The* Fight? At the Capital Temple?"

"Yeah."

"Damn. I heard what went on there, but I can't imagine."

"Right? And this girl Lian, she's alet's say, natural with a knife, and fearless. I think she and Kendrick managed to ambush and fight Cristina Thompson once. She was in an anonymous Grey Rider uniform, of course, so they didn't have any idea what they were up against. They didn't stand a chance, not even with the element of surprise and two-on-one. She had an answer for everything. She *always* has an answer for everything. If we've thought ten steps ahead, she's thought twenty."

"That's honestly terrifying," Neil said, shivering from more than the cold. "One woman playing chess with all our lives, against a goddess, and across a thousand realities. Why are the Grey Riders working with someone like that?"

"You can't tell anyone," Edgar murmured, his eyes misting against some hidden pain. "I didn't even tell Ward Shaw, because I just don't know how to feel about it yet."

Neil looked around, ensuring that everyone else was truly asleep. "What is it?"

"I did die," his friend whispered, suddenly haggard as a mask of confidence fell away. He reached into his pack and pulled out the book Ward Shaw had given him. Laying it on his lap, he traced its edges with his fingers. "I never thought I'd have this under my own two hands. It's not just a reader of souls; it's an instrument of fate. It's been weaving its way through important events since the moment Cristina brought it back. And now it's with us."

Feeling oddly observed in some unknowable manner, especially as he thought about Shaw's belief that somebody in the future was reading about them, Neil carefully reached out and touched it for a moment just to drive home that it was real. "You think that means we're important?"

"Maybe," Edgar breathed, his eyes distant as he stared down at the book. "But it's bigger than that. This thing can talk to souls, so that means"

"souls are real," Neil finished aloud, stunned by the thought. "So does that mean the afterlife?"

Edgar gulped hard before continuing. "I don't know. But I do know that I was in darkness, after I got shot, after I fell. I was hanging there, and also flying somewhere at tremendous speed, but I couldn't be sure about anything because it was all pitch black and sensationless, and thenthere was a hole. I fell into it over the course ofI can only describe it as an instant eternityand there you were, and there I was, in the mud, in the rain, in the worms." He clenched his fists, fighting some nebulous and unknown pain. "And in that moment, it clicked. It's all about beginnings. Stories taught me that. When did we first see the Grey Riders?"

Neil shook his head, awed and attentive.

"Her Glory resurrected herself, and there they were, an attack on the Heart of her realm planned to perfection."

"Why?" Neil asked. "Why do they hate her so much?"

"I don't think they do. The thing is, Her Glory survived. That was their one best shot; I think catching her off guard was their Hail Mary. They were trying to put right something that has gone terribly wrong."

The hairs on the back of Neil's neck stood up as he thought about those re-animated dead men and women that had mobbed the truck. They'd been asking for help; had they just been confused and terrified? Mob mentality might have taken over, and"What did she do?"

"As far as we know," Edgar said. "Nobody's ever come back to life before. Once you're dead, that's it. People fight to stay alive, but not once has anyone ever come back from whatever's next. Her Glory's special, though. She can bend the laws of reality in a way nobody else can. I have a horrible feeling that she's fundamentally broken something."

"Other people can come back to life, too," Neil responded, his heart racing. What insane implications such a thing might have. "An incredible gift!"

"Did those people look like they *wanted* to be alive again?" Edgar shot back, his expression fearful. "What if it's far worse than we know? I didn't make a choice to return. It just happened. What if, because of what Gisela did, human beings *can't* die? Think about it."

And he did think about itabout how, once wounded enough, those wounds would never heal. Once diseased too far, one would remain diseased forever. Once dismembered"Oh, hell."

"Yeah."

"Should we tell someone? Did you tell Shaw?"

Edgar shook his head. "They'll figure it out soon enough. A great many terrible things might be headed our way, and I don't think I could tell him without revealing that I really did die. That's my secret for now. And besides, I wasn't absolutely certain until I saw those people moving. I think they've been slowly returning to awareness for some time now."

"On the way to the caves, I saw one look at me from inside ice," Neil agreed with a shudder. "But wait, didn't you say the Grey Riders are making a mistake?"

Edgar nodded. "They probably think killing Her Glory will plug the hole she made when she ripped her own soul out of the afterlife."

"Send back the source of the issue, resolve the problem."

"Yeah. But I believe she's the only one that can fix this. If they actually manage to destroy her, we might be stuck this way forever. We should be asking for her help, not antagonizing her. It's likely she doesn't even know" He took in a sharp breath. "Is that another function of the auto-suicide devices? Maybe total vaporizationbut Clint said Bill's still alive somewhere" Deep in thought, he kept shaking his head and nodding at murmured calculations.

Leaving his friend to it, Neil returned to Kumari's side, made sure she was comfortable, and curled up to try to sleep. His mind stormed with intense thoughts, but his permanent exhaustion from malnutrition helped him overcome it.

He awoke to Cantey saying, "Yeah, we know the truth. Why do you think we volunteered to get the hell out of there?"

"How long do you think their food stores will last?" Showman responded, his tone tense.

Mashburn grunted. "Not long enough. Shaw's got teams all over the place putting up radio towers and cutting roads and encouraging people to start farms, but it'll never take before it's too late."

Sitting up, Neil found only an empty blanket next to him, and he almost panickeduntil he saw Showman holding Kumari.

"She woke up before you did, father," the Australian said with a grin. "Imagined you needed the rest."

"Thanks."

"Of course." Showman's grin faded. "We have to go back and tell them what the Zkirax are planning."

Edgar returned from somewhere among the rocks with a response ready. "We can't."

"It's not right! There are children down there!"

"And they'll die the moment the insects know the deal's off." Edgar picked up his gear. "Ward Shaw bought us all time and organization. The price was very high, but we still might dodge it if we can resolve the situation in time. Let's get our job done."

Showman didn't seem happy with that answer, but his normal jovial manner returned to hide his inner negativity. "What is the job, then?"

"A heist of sorts," Edgar replied. "We're almost there."

Taking Kumari back, Neil helped pick up as best he could, and the crew hopped on the truck and rode on. The path grew rougher as they approached the mountains to the westthe Rockies, as far as he could guessand the last rift was like an eye doctor's lens switching to a better focus. The massive mountains ahead changed subtly; green and white patches shifted, the sky altered tint, and a tremendous Gothic cathedral jutted from between the bases of two peaks.

Elegant stonework curled out from flying buttresses of untold number and complexity. Broken stained glass windows a hundred feet high were visible even from the distance of their initial approach, and their pointed arches glinted in the morning sunlight.

"It's the tomb of Wecelo the Thief," Edgar explained while leaning out his window, his words solemn and awed despite the need to shout to be heard over the truck's engine.

Cantey shouted, "Never heard of him."

"You wouldn't have. He's been dead something on eight hundred years. Shaw's scouts only recently found it and figured out what it was. They told him, and he told me." Edgar pointed a route between the tree line ahead. "See that? The road was salted heavily, and stones laid, when this was built. That way should be clear."

"We're going to violate a tomb?" Showman asked. "What kind of mission is this, exactly?"

"Don't worry," Edgar called back. "This place was much closer to home before the Devastation. It's been looted a hundred times before, used as a church for a century or two, and left in ruins for a few after that. I doubt Wecelo will mind one more visitor."

Neil scooted closer on the bouncing truck bed. "Then what are we after?"

Edgar grinned back at them and held the book up to the glass of the cabin's rear window. "We're gonna talk to Wecelo himself. He stole a great many powerful and amazing objects in his day, and we'll need every single one of them if we're going to put up a fight against you-know-who."

The trees closed in as Mashburn began angling the truck along the forested road. Neil moved back to his secure spot with Kumari, and Showman leaned close. "I have a bad feeling about this."

Neil nodded. "Me too."

"It's you and me then, friend," Showman told him quietly. "I don't like being kept in the dark, by Shaw, you, or this Edgar fellow. Let's start being proactive about surviving all this."

Neil shook his offered hand. "My thoughts exactly."

The massive cathedral loomed darkly as they began spiraling up the base of its foundation hill. It might have been his imagination, but Neil felt watched along the entire ascent. The Gothic architecture had been built to seem soaring and light, but centuries of vines and weathering had left it ominous and glowering. Worse, Ward Shaw had said there was something here that would require his engineering skills. What hadn't he been told? Feeling like a pawn being moved about by multiple distant powerful people with inscrutable agendas, he climbed out of the truck after the others, held Kumari warily, and stuck close to his one real friend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After quickly regaining his composure, he ordered, "Get out."

His men departed without question down the spiral-carved tunnel, leaving Neil, his baby, and his two companions alone with the giant bearded man whose eyes had *definitely* just flashed black in a startling inhuman manner. He was back to normal now, though, and stood regarding them each with a calculating gaze. "First things first," he said, his eyes falling on Edgar. "As foolish as it sounds: did we meet in a dream in 2007?"

Edgar blinked repeatedly before coming up with an answer. "Not exactly."

"But that *was* you?"

"Yes. We accidentally entered an insanity reality awhile back." His jaw dropped with subtle awe. "So that was really you?"

"Apparently." The large man rubbed his beard. "It might be a question of *how* any given insanity reality drives human beings crazy. If that world put your temporal awareness in flux somehow, that would certainly disorder the brain. In that case, my dream was not a dream at all, but the overlay of an alternate timeline-knot that never happened."

Neil watched this exchange, feeling as if *he* was crazy. "What, like your Doctor Who show you told me about?"

Edgar laughed. "Yeah. Timey-wimey wibbly-wobbly stuff and all that."

"But physical time travel to the past is impossible," their host continued, his eyes falling on Grayson. "I can only assume something radical has changedor, you're a ridiculously brazen liar."

The lanky blonde man held his ground.

"Guys," Edgar cut in. "This is Ward Shaw."

A flood of associations hit Neil, and he stepped back once instinctively to put a small distance between Kumari in his arms and their host. "You're that guy!"

Ward gave a dour half-smile. "Yes. I am." He reached into his desk and pulled out a non-descript brown-bound book that held no markings or title. Laying it on the table, he said, "We have a bigger problem. Somebody is using this book on us."

Edgar's eyes went wide. "Is that!"

"It is." Ward looked to each of them to judge their reaction. "This book allows one to talk to souls, past and present. I've had certain unhappy interactions with this device, and I feel a very specific chill when it is being used on me."

Neil narrowed his eyes, not sure if he believed this. "Somebody's using *that* book? The one on the table right now?"

"If it can read souls in the past," Grayson explained quietly, "Then someone can acquire it in the future and use it to peer back on us."

A tingling existential horror crept up his spine, and he hugged Kumari close. "You're saying we're in the past right now?"

Ward put his hand on the book. "We're always in the past to someone. Long dead, but apparently not forgotten. Fortunately, my awareness of this book's use is information in itself. It means that some or all of us are important right now."

"How's that?"

The big man donned a self-deprecating grin. "Effort is selection. Would you tell a story in which nothing important happened?"

"I suppose not."

"Who do you think it is?" Edgar asked, seeing his supposedly random companions in a new light.

"There's no way to tell." Ward lifted his hand away from the book that he had called a *device.* "Know that this means that we four are now bound in something larger than ourselves. One, some, or all of us will be involved with something that likely saves the human race."

"How do you know we aren't involved in dooming it?" Grayson asked, his face pale.

Ward shrugged. "Someone has to be left to tell the story."

"Not if that person is a gwellion," Edgar said, tense.

Their host let his eyes fall to the floor in momentary despair.

Neil bounced Kumari a bit to keep her from getting restless. "What's a gwellion?"

Edgar looked to Ward, but then explained it himself. "A witness. Someone whose role in events allowed them to see something and describe it later. Usually a tremendous disaster." After a moment's consideration, he continued. "It's like math. Equations and numbers weren't created by anyone, they just exist. But they don't exist for real, they're just concepts. Still, we can rely on them. If we become aware of a disaster, it's because of a gwellion that lived to tell the tale."

"So every disaster has one of these people?" Neil asked, wary.

"No. But we never hear the stories of disasters that don't."

In a wide, fleeting, and ephemeral way, he understood. It was a sort of Catch-22 artifact of logic and events themselves. Edgar had said they could rely on this as a thing, so"If we can figure out we have a gwellion among us, and possibly who they are, we can guess the disaster that's coming?"

"Bingo." Edgar grinned. "You remind me of my friend Randy. You engineers are sharp."

Neil accepted the compliment without dwelling on Edgar's quietly told tale one night of how much he missed his new family.

"You're an engineer?" Ward asked. "What's your name?"

Conscious of the room's attention suddenly on him, he said, "Neil Yadav."

"Yadav Yadav" Ward narrowed his eyes. "Why have I heard that name before?"

He shrugged as best he could with the baby in his arms. "I was a head engineer for one of the farming realities for a good while."

Ward turned away to face the back wall of his carved office as if it held an invisible window to other places and times. "Astounding coincidence, given the circumstances. I know your name for a reason. You were the head engineer of the farming reality destroyed during the saving of the people of the First World."

He shivered with repressed anger. "Yes."

"I must confess," he continued, his deep voice concerned. "I discounted you from importance at first. You are a random refugee with a baby in the same room as a man who claims to be a defected Grey Rider from the future, a Vanguard soldier I've had contact with through time and insanity, and myself, a half-Bre'kat career soldier who has had repeated contact with entities beyond human conception. But now it turns out you are an intelligent man, an engineer, one of those crucially important every-day human beings who worked for the greater good throughout the disasterand you were wronged by the same woman who enslaved and used me for so many years."

Gulping, Neil asked, "What woman?"

"Cristina Thompson."

He shook his head. "I don't know any Cristina Thompson."

"You haven't heard the stories?"

"I was never really a fan of gossip."

"The destruction of your farming reality wasn't random. She chose it."

His skin ran with thousands of painful prickles and his heart began thumping in his chest. That was when everything had changedthat day, though joyous for the people saved, had ended his career and cast his family down among the masses of starving wanderers. To think that somebody had *made that choice*his repressed anger broke free, boiling horribly under his heart. Somebody had made a devastating choice; this woman, apparently, had taken it upon herself to destroy his second home and cast his baby and his wife out into the wilds. Rani was still somewhere out there, fighting gods knew what. His heart and prayers went out to her.

"I see the truth of it in your face," Ward said compassionately as he turned around to face him again. "And I hate to do this, but I must send you away from these caves."

Aghast, he snapped out of his internal pain. "What? Why?"

"I keep finding myself making deals with the devil," the large man confessed sadly. "It's only a small consolation that this time it was not in pursuit of my own empowerment, but for the chance to build a new home."

Grayson suspected immediately. He glanced back down the spiral-carved tunnel. "What did you do?"

"It's carved to prevent others from hearing conversations in this chamber," Ward said. "There are spies everywhere."

It was Edgar's turn to be taken aback. "You mean to say we're not safe here?"

Ward shook his head and sighed remorsefully. "Only a select few are aware of the deal I've made. You three must keep it secret. Even you, Grayson, whom I do not pretend to trust yet. This was the only way to end the fighting and establish a temporary base from which to begin organizing the mass exodus. The Zkirax have agreed to host us until their food stores run out."

Neil felt like he knew the answer already, and he wished he didn't have to ask. "Then what?"

"If by that time we have not found a new home and moved on, they will use gas pods to render the human population in these caves unconscious, and we will become their new food source for getting through the long winter."

"You didn't!"

"I did."

"Everyone here"

"Many billions. I'm aware. It was the only way."

Neil froze, locked motionless by the thought of the Lost Tunnels and their millions upon millions of pictures posted in hope and regret. Beside him, Edgar and Grayson both clenched their fists as they visibly came to terms with the truth of the supposed underground haven.

"You're just like her!" Neil finally hissed. "Unilaterally making decisions that condemn countless lives!"

Edgar put a hand to his forehead.

"No," Ward said. "I refuse to be like her. If the men, women, and children here end up being eaten, I will be among them. I will remain."

Grayson shook his head against unknown thoughts.

"But you three are here now," Ward continued. "Fortuitous timing. I need you to go out there and accomplish certain objectives that cannot be linked back to us. The political situation in this region is extremely delicate, predicated on numerous conflicting secret agendas and unspoken non-aggression stances. If the Zkirax catch wind that I plan to renege on our deal, billions will die. If Her Glory comes to see the refugees as linked to the Grey Riders in any way, billions will die. If the Grey Riders suspect that we know anything about them, they may attack us, the Zkirax will react negatively, and billions will die. What we need is someone affiliated with no faction at all, and for that, we need a dead man."

"Who?" Edgar asked.

"You, of course."

"I'm not dead."

"Aren't you? With no sources of entertainment besides tales told around the campfire, the story of your squad's Week of Hell has spread rapidly through the region."

That brought a wide grin to Edgar's face. "Wait, you know about my squad? Where are they?"

"Scattered. Stranded. Some dead," Ward said apologetically. "But the bulk have reached the single far exit from this region and founded what is being called the Waystation. In time, all refugees will pass through there. We have roughly two years to complete a full evacuation before that planet will be destroyed by a natural disaster and escape from this area of the multiverse will become impossible; deadly growing cold on one side, Her Glory's wall realities on many others."

"Where is this Waystation?" Edgar asked, ignoring the bad news in favor of the good. "How far away is it? Is my squad still there?"

"You can't go there," the bearded man said, his expression again apologetic. "Everyone knows that you are dead. You were the last casualty of the Week of Hell, and your squad left your body on a bleak plain after a conflict with the Grey Riders. Since your death is common knowledge, behaving brazenly as yourself will give you true anonymity. To minds as paranoid as those of our enemies, you claiming to be Edgar Brace will guarantee that they regard you as an impostor. The fact that you fit all your own details perfectly will only prove, to them, that it's an elaborate deception."

"I've heard talk like that before," Edgar said, concerned. "In the stories."

"Then I think you've guessed who our enemy is."

"I've guessed, sure, but it's not possible. She died. That brownshirt boy literally read the story in public, and it ended with her death."

"Did it?" Ward lifted the book and regarded it for a long moment. "This book can reach into the past to talk to souls, but it does have its limits. Namely, some measure of physical and interdimensional distance. If I was to read your soul right now and you were to ride out of here, eventually, the text would simply stop. Similarly, if the reality you were in, say, suddenly shot across the multiverse, the text would also stop."

"Jesus." Edgar began pacing the small chamber.

"What is it?" Neil asked, and Grayson supported his question.

Ward answered it with grim finality. "Cristina Thompson is still alive."

Neil's skin tingled with heat all over again. He hadn't been aware that she'd been considered dead, but finding out that she wasn't filled him with bitter bile.

"Are you sure?" Edgar asked. "Absolutely sure?"

"Yes." Ward's gaze grew distant. "I was asked to keep this secret after the apparent end of the Crushing Fist disaster so that she could live on in secret, in peace, and raise Thomas. I hated her with a passion I cannot convey, but I chose to put aside that anger in favor of our search for a new home and a new beginning."

Edgar stepped close to the desk and put his hands down flat on its dark wood. "But now she's causing problems, isn't she?"

"I sense her strategies and machinations in these affairs, yes. There is no military mind left among the exiled human race that could possibly put together the sort of offensives and agendas we've seen. The paranoia and near-perfect efficacy the Grey Riders have maintained in keeping themselves secretwith blood-burning agents, auto-disintegration mechanisms, voice changers, coded conversations over radioit is, in a word, flabbergasting. I've also heard the story of their initial attack on Her Glory's Heart, and it was planned with every contingency in mind. I simply cannot believe anyone else is driving this conflict but her."

Neil looked to Grayson.

The lanky man seemed quietly bitter. "I don't know who my superiors were. We were all anonymous, even from each other."

"Seems accurate." Ward picked up the book and lifted it forward. "I've learned all I can with this. I have a mission for you, and you cannot refuse."

Taking it gingerly, Edgar studied the plain brown cover. To Neil, he seemed deeply saddened that he would not get to see his squad. "What if I just make a run for the Waystation instead?"

Ward shook his head. "You won't. I've only met you in a dream, but that dream held certain unmistakable tones. I'm certain you're a man of honor."

Edgar rubbed his temple unconsciously. "I don't know about that. I was hoping to just let you know what I've seen and discovered and let you take it from there. I'm not sure I'm willing to take on Cristina Thompson myself. Everything she touches suffers horrible fates. I just want to see certain people again."

It was an inappropriate time to smile, but Neil had a guess as to who in particular he was talking about.

Ward nodded with understanding, but said, "Think on this: I bought us several months of organization and direction by making a horrible deal with the Zkirax. The insects trust me to follow through, just like the humans here trust me not to betray them. It's a house of cards predicated on numerous credits and debits on the value of my word alone. Honor is a piece on the board like any other, Edgar. Everyone is aware that it *can* be cashed in, but it is only worth as much as their belief that you *won't.* Take that book on credit, and make sure you cash in your honor only when it matters the absolute most. Now is not that time. Not yet."

Edgar stepped back, accepting his words and his mission.

"As for you, Neil Yadav," Ward said. "You must go with Edgar for several reasons. One, I would not have you and your baby remain here to die. Two, you must have a specific believable reason for going, or else the Zkirax will know I've told, and the alliance will be off. Three, there are too many coincidences and motivations at work here for me to believe you are simply a random passerby. You have every reason to hate Cristina Thompson, and she is the ultimate objective of this mission."

"I have to find my wife, Rani," Neil said, terrified for Kumari in the face of all this. "And I can't bring a baby on some sort of war mission!"

"If you go with Edgar, I'll have our bureaucracy send Rani Yadav ahead if she comes through here," Ward told him. "I don't expect you to stick with Edgar all the way to the end, but you must travel with him for the first leg of the journey. He'll need your help with something specific. After that, I recommend you go to the Waystation and wait for your wife. All of us will pass through there over the next two years, one way or another." 

He gave his last and weakest protest. "I know you think I'm important because of some sixth sense about being in a story or something, but I'm just a father with a baby. I can't imagine anyone wanting to read about me and Kumari. We're nobody special."

Ward laughed lightly but genuinely. "With all due respect, Neil Yadav, considering our population and mortality situation, being a father and raising a child is the highest calling left to the human race."

Edgar nodded and echoed someone else's words. "My squadmate Pixley said there's only one hope left for uswe have to start having babies."

They were serious. Neil accepted, if only to escape the coming horrible underground massacre. While Edgar remained behind to compare more highly classified intel, he wandered out through the spiral carvings after Grayson.

He saw the offices and the people in the tunnels outside differently now, knowing that they would be killed and eaten soon; knowing that they had no idea, and that he couldn't tell them. He lingered in the offices, going over papers filled with names. Ward had told him to look for his wife if he wished, and to take any people he might know with him to escape what was going to happen, but Rani Yadav was not listed anywhere. There was, however, one name he recognized. "Hey Grayson, will you go with me to talk to somebody?"

"Might as well. Got nothing better to do, and I definitely don't want to join a work crew. Who is it?"

Reciting the booth, cave, and level numbers in his head repeatedly, Neil felt his heart lighten a bit. After so much loss, it had been amazing to recognize a friendly name. "A man I used to know back at the camps that I want to try to convince to come with us. His name's Showman." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Joey was first brought to me, I didn't really understand what it was his parents and doctor wanted. At the time, I worked at a small startup that was experimenting with new techniques in magnetoencephalography, commonly called MEG, which is a sort of real-time MRI that allows medical technicians to scan a patient's ongoing brain patterns. More specifically, for the previous two years my company had been working on visual reconstructionour algorithms could build a black-and-white image of what a subject was processing in their visual cortex.

In short, if you imagined a sight, we could see it with you.

I immediately disliked Mrs. Campbell. I'd already gotten several pushy emails from her, so by the time she and Joey showed up in my office unannounced I already knew exactly who I was talking to. Her power suit, uptight sitting position, and severe expression only added to her edge. "Look, I've already had this conversation eighty-seven times before," she stated, eyeing me as I moved to sit behind my desk. "You'll go on about how this isn't your specialty, or Joey's case isn't appropriate for the technology, or a dozen other excuses. I get it. It's not in your job description."

Lifting a hand sheepishly at having been so expertly called out, I went to speak, but she cut me off.

"I'll have you know that I literally learned neuroscience to better pursue the truth of my son's condition. Every other doctor in the tri-state area has come up short; this is *my* lead. I know enough to make an educated guess: your technology will uncover something about Joey's problem."

She let silence hang over my office.

Next to her, Joey sat with his face buried in a thick book. He was as small and gangly as I'd expected an ill six-year-old boy to be, but Descartes' *Discourse on the Method* seemed a bit out of his age range.  My immediate suspicion was that the mother herself might be driving some of her son's endless night terrors. I considered her words for a moment before asking, "You *learned neuroscience?*"

She was not amused. "Yes."

"Are you a doctor?"

"No."

"Then where did you find the time?"

The slightest hint of a proud smile curled up the side of her lip. "I'm extremely motivated."

There was no arguing that. Since we did need a younger test subject to round out our resultssomething I'm sure she was aware ofI begrudgingly acquiesced and hurried her out of my office so that I could speak to her son alone.

"You reading Descartes? That's pretty heavy stuff for a boy your age."

He looked up with sharp bespectacled eyes surrounded by haloes of exhaustion. "There's so little time."

Subtly put off by his odd answer and perceptive gaze, I shrugged away my apprehension. "Alright then, let's begin." I led him to the next room and explained that our process would require ongoing meetings and tests, since every brain and all the patterns within in were unique to each person. The bio-feedback mechanisms and tests would take time to adapt algorithmsnevermind. He was reading his book again.

I couldn't help but smile. At his age, I'd escaped into books the same way. His overbearing mother likely didn't help his desire to be present in the moment, either.

The first tests were simple enough. I hooked him up to a less intensive helmet-only version of our machine and had him run through our anchoring images: a tree, a kite, a basketball, and a variety of other pictures with basic shapes and strong recognition quotients. The written portion and medical history had already been submitted by his mother; done for the day, I walked him out. "Our computers will process our recordings of your brain for a few days, and then we'll be able to do more next week."

He hesitated before going back into the lobby. "You're not like the other doctors."

I smiled. "I'm not?"

"No. You're actually here."

Interesting praise. Medical professionals were certainly encouraged to develop emotional distance, but I was not that kind of doctor. "Thanks, Joey."

He grinned and nodded hard enough for his hair to flop, and then he ran out into the lobby, his book still clutched in his hands.

At one appointment a week, it took about three months to truly narrow in on an accurate brain map. The interesting thing about working with such a young subject was that his brain was more malleable and changing far more rapidly than any of our adult subjects. Other technicians sometimes worked with him, but I made sure to stick with his case and keep an eye on him.

As we talked about philosophy, life, and his favorite superheroes among the Avengers, it began to hit home that this bookish little boy slept less than two hours a night. Wracked with night terrors as he was, every week we wasted was another week of torture he didn't deserve. I was more than happy to move forward with looser confidence intervals than normal in our data; his brain was constantly changing anyway, I argued, not telling them my real reason for wanting to begin our investigation early.

I was actually excited that first night we slid him into the tube of the machine for a real imaging run, and I think that excitement transferred to his attitude. There would be no more guesswork, pills, or therapy. After a never-ending series of failures and a lifetime of suffering a medical mystery that had defied all regimens and treatments, we were finally going to witness his night terrors directly. We would stand with him against his fears and see what he was seeing. He put down his book completely for the first time since I'd known him, and slid into that imaging tube with a worried but hopeful expression.

Thanks to all the prep work and our years of computer and medical research already implemented, it was now as simple as watching the video feed as our mainframe began deciphering the ongoing changes in the magnetic fields of the neurons in his visual cortex. As the fuzzy black-and-white image grew more coherent, the feed took on the appearance of someone filming from inside the sheer white tube. "Joey, can you hear me?" I asked.

"Yeah!"

"I'm going to flash some simple indicators along the tube above you, alright?"

"I won't be scared."

"Alright. Here we go."

The technicians and I watched the video as the programmed patterns appeared as darker squares on the inside of the tubeat about a five second delay for processing the tremendous quantity of three-dimensional neural data the machine was reading every millisecond. "Looks good. Now comes the hard part, Joey."

"What do I do?"

"Now you have to sleep. Are you tired?"

"I can sleep anywhere, even here," he breathed. "You wanna know my secret?"

I looked in through the test chamber window at his feet, wondering. "Sure, what?"

He said triumphantly, "I'm *always* tired."

The technicians and I shared an awkward laugh, and then we went about the business of waiting. He fell asleep rather quickly and random scattered imaginings filled our feed, but the real data would only come once he had begun dreaming.

I was reading a magazine when the first coherent images began flickering to life. There was a slow moment of strange tension that all of the men and women in the control room shared as the curious fuzzy blurs began as something primally recognizable and then sharpened into something unknown. What the hell had that *been?* For a second, I'd felt as if I'dwell, I can't say for sure, even now.

But the feed now showed a murky greyscale scene full of indeterminate fog and little wriggling black things.

"What are those?" someone asked, and we all peered intently at the screen.

Someone else wondered aloud, "Is this even a dream? It looks a view from a camera on a weather tower somewhere."

It was a pertinent question. There was none of the mise en scne we'd observed in other subjects' dreams. Here, there were no identifiable landmarks, no shifting locations, and, apparently, no sense of self. Joey's dream was simply his own point of view floating somewhere foggy while scattered unidentifiable bits of black motion moved about in strangely disgusting manners. I'd thought they were birds at first, purely by context, but my senses began linking the sight to that of a petri dish.

Little black blobs wriggling in a foggy petri dish skywhat the hell were we seeing here?

And, more importantly, why was this the source of so much stress for Joey that it always woke him up? Talking quietly in the control room, we each agreed that dreams like that would be rather peaceful if that was all that happened. Of course, that was not all that happened.

Mrs. Campbell herself was out in the waiting room dozing, and I requested she come to my office immediately on threat of arrest. Our security guard and two technicians stood as witness while I turned my laptop around and showed her our recording. "This is Joey's dream," I told her, barely covering my anger and disgust at what the video had apparently turned out to be. "This is what wakes him up screaming multiple times a night, every night. Mrs. Campbell, I hate that I have to ask you this, but *do you submerge your son underwater in a vat of leeches?*"

"That's ridiculous!" she spat, furious. "I'll get my lawyer immediately if you're going to accuse me of child abuse. I didn't work this hard his entire life to *cause the problem myself,* you son of a bitch."

The guard coughed, and she sat back down and uncurled her fist.

As unpleasant as it was, I had to probe deeper. "Have you ever heard of Munchausen by proxy syndrome?"

She took a long breath in through her nose, and then said flatly, "That's not what this is."

We all watched in silence for a few heartbeats as the horrible end of Joey's dream played out onscreen: one of the distant wriggling black blobs shot forward, growing quickly into a massive swimming annelid worm that opened a horrible mouth ringed with teeth and attempted to swallow the point of view itself. The video cut back to his normal eyesight inside the tube just before, due to Joey himself waking up screaming and panicked.

Mrs. Campbell stared with a moment of true vulnerable fear before quickly donning her mask of confidence again. "That's what he dreams about?" She sat a little taller. "Then we've made progress. It's heartening to finally see what's going on in his head. As for your accusation, you didn't look at his files closely enough. He's been having trouble sleeping since the day he was born. There is literally no way I could have caused this in him, especially in those first few days. I wasn't even allowed to hold him because he was so weak due to an inability to sleep well."

I shook my head. "I saw that in the files, but I know the records have been faked. The human brain restructures itself around age two or three and erases everything that came before. I seriously doubt it's at all possible this nightmare has recurred since before that time, let alone as far back as the first day of his birth. That would imply some sort of chemical or neurological poisoning" Noticing a certain subtle droop in his mother's shoulders, I turned to one of the technicians with a horrible suspicion. "Do we have *Mrs. Campbell's* medical records?"

We did, as part of a legal footnote for putting Joey in the program. I leafed through to six years ago, and there it was. "You were on nootropics before and during his pregnancy. Cognitive enhancers. Untested on pregnant women and children." I studied her defiant expression. "I bet you're still on them. You just *learned neuroscience in your free time,* did you?"

She finally spoke, and with vehemence. "I'm a single mother, you asshole. Have you tried modafinil yourself? It was the only way I could work hundred-hour weeks, between my job and raising Joey and coping with his illness."

One of the technicians spoke up with a sour face. "But you were on them before you even had him."

"That's enough," I said, raising a hand. All anger had drained from me at finding out that this was not intentional. "It wouldn't help Joey to call the authorities into this. Now we know another piece of the puzzle. Mrs. Campbell, I apologize for inappropriately putting you on the spot, but I hope you see we've learned something for it."

She shoved away from our guard, but scaled down her aggressive stance. "Next week? Same time?"

"How about tomorrow night?" I couldn't stomach putting him through another week of waiting. The other technicians agreed to work overtime, and we came in on Saturday.

Joey came in with Viktor Frankl's *Man's Search for Meaning* under his arm, and I asked him, "You're really into the philosophy, aren't you?"

Again, he said, "There's so little time." He added more to this second answer because we were closer: "Now that it knows about us."

I frowned. "What do you mean by that?"

He seemed confused at my question, but I didn't want to push him further. He was, after all, still a permanently exhausted six year old boy. We set him up in the machine and proceeded to wait for his dreams to begin. Now that we knew the cause of all this was likely some sort of neurological poisoning during pregnancy, we spent the entire wait speculating and arguing. Hammering out ideas, we came to the educated guess that some sort of traumatic memory had been permanently ingrained in his neural makeup thanks to the cognitive-enhancing drug that had riddled his body throughout gestation.

"The womb!" one of our female technicians shouted in the manner of a eureka. "That's the cause of the fixed murky perspective. He's literally remembering being in the womb! I bet if we tried out our colorization technology, we'd find out that murkiness is red."

As his dream began again with that same perspective in that same foggy void, we added our new colorization algorithms, and the video sharpened. Now we could see that he was indeed floating in some sort of nebulous red environment, which would have been expected from the dim light penetrating Mrs. Campbell's skin from outside.

So our theory was coming together, but the obvious question had to be asked. "Why the leeches?"

We threw out a couple ideas, but our resident neuropsychologist could only guess, "Maybe they're an addition or a change due to later fears, perhaps leeches he saw on television. The original form of this memory is impossible to know for sure. Something scared him horribly when he was very young, and this is what remains to torture him." He hesitated. "Maybe this happens to all babies, really, and we just forget because of the restructuring of the young brain two years in."

They were good theories, but I was still worried about Joey himself. "So how do we fix it?"

"Honestly? Maybe electroshock therapy."

"What? No. Come on."

Someone else threw in a radical idea. "Maybe show him the video and ask him what he thinks it is?"

I looked up and jumped back just as the giant leech-like creature again swallowed the screen and Joey woke up screaming. Seeing the video as real might scare him even more, but it was worth a shot.

With Mrs. Campbell and two other technicians who Joey trusted in attendance, we sat with him in a private room the next day, a Sunday. He laid his book carefully on the table and watched the video on my laptop with a pale face. "That's it. That's my dream." His mother held his hand, but he didn't panic like his records said he had before in hypnotherapy and dream therapy sessions. "It's real!" He began breathing harder, but he seemed to retain control. "I don't want to talk about it. They tried to make me talk about it before. I couldn't describe it."

I knew that from his records, and I'd already had an idea to handle it. "They asked you to describe it before, because they couldn't see it. Are you able instead to talk *around it* now that we can see it for ourselves?"

He fought back tears. "I'll try."

"Alright, Joey. Do you have a sense of when this was? Just nod for yes or shake your head for no."

He nodded.

"Good. Was it a long time ago?"

He nodded.

"And you were smaller than you are now?"

He nodded emphatically.

"Did something scare you at that time?"

He nodded weakly, his features draining to white. "I don't like thinking about them." Almost as if to protect himself, he took his book and held it to his chest.

"Them?" I pointed to the unmoving black blobs in the paused video. "You mean these guys?"

"Yeah."

I looked to the others for confirmation before continuing with our plan now that the questions would get riskier. "Are you aware that creatures like this really exist, and are harmless?"

That got him paying attention. "Really?"

"I can show you some scientific information on them, if you want to see. They're not nightmares. They're real tiny little things that can't harm you."

Lowering his philosophy book to his lap, he took the new text I'd offered him and looked at the article for leeches. He began to smile, and even laughed. "Is this for real? They're that small?" He looked at his hand and compared it to the life-size millimeters-long picture of a worm. "I must be huge now! I had no idea because there's no way to tell then and now."

His mother rubbed his arm, not daring to hope. "So you're not afraid of them anymore?"

He shook his head, flopping his hair about. "No way! I'm gonna sleep right now and stomp that stupid leech if he tries to eat me this time. I'm the one in charge, right?"

"Yeah," I said, smiling uncontrollably. I looked to his mother. "Let's get him to the chamber and see how he does?"

She nodded happily. I couldn't imagine what she was going through, finally seeing some understanding and progress for her son's torment. We let her sit with him this time, hand on his ankle, while he lay inside the machine. He was excited, but sleep came easily thanks to his permanent exhaustion, and we all waited expectantly for his dream to begin.

This time, he finally had a sense of self, and we watched as imagined hands paddled out before his sight to move him along through the crimson liquid environment. Now that we had some parallax, we began getting a sense of his environmentand it turned out to be a vast flowing tube rather than the small space we'd expected. The leech-like creatures still wriggled in the distance, but he eluded them by swimming away from his initial location. Moving with the current, he began passing floating little dots of flaring light colored red by the thick unknown liquid, and these, too, moved with the flow.

Someone else was the first to ask, "What the hell are we seeing?"

As the tube opened up into a mammoth pulsing cavern whose walls were fleshy and striated, I think it slowly began to dawn on all of us that our theory had been both horribly wrong and horribly right. This *was* a memory from a time many years before when Joey had been much smaller, but he had not had these experiences during pregnancy.

I began to understand when we saw the first flaring point of floating light suddenly flash and form into the fading silhouette of an infant human before vanishing in a strange blur. Thisit wasn't possible! This wasn't a gestation memory. Joey had been brought into existence filled with memory enhancers, and the great barrier of brain restructuring that made all human babies *forget* had failed to work on him. This was *prelife!*

We stared in horrified awe as he swam through tube after tube, slowly revealing to us the nature of prelife: it was alive. The tubes were arteries, and the chambers strange hearts. Leech-like creatures ate the flares, and weird octopus-like entities ate the leeches, and strange propelled mouths ate them in turn, all winding a web of eating-upon-eating that seemed to host thousands of different types of organisms in every artery.

Existence before birth was maddeningly full of life in every respect, so much so that bits of that desperate moving and writhing energy gathered into flaring points and became sentient in our form of reality. Were these souls? Or were these simply the perspective *I* which rode around in each of our minds looking out from our eyes and hearing through our ears to experience the physical world and wonder at the meaning of it all?

His philosophy books. What ifno "Wake him up!"

The others refused, and I backed away from the feed. They hadn't heard what he'd said, in so many tiny little ways. They hadn't pieced together the grander horror out there known only to this boy. He was a *living soul* in the truest and most profound sense; Joey knew the prelife form of existence so implicitly that *he'd never bothered to confirm with other people that they didn't know!*

And he'd spent every waking moment of his life reading philosophy books because *there's so little time now that it knows about us.*

I'm not ashamed to admit that I panicked. You might even call it a breakdown. I just happen to know what *it* is nowan unknowable entity so tremendous that it is a form of existence unto itself, filled with energetic life to the point of bursting spontaneously into our very souls themselvesand I shudder for the future. I'm not afraid of it destroying us. No. Against a creature so cosmic, we would never see it coming, and never suffer a millisecond. I'm not even convinced that dealing death is something such a beast of Life is capable of.

No, I'm afraid for that other fate: the path where it has become aware of our child-souls escaping into another mode of existence through birth; the path where it puts a stop to that leak of its vitality. Women will still get pregnant and babies will still be born, because those are physical animal processes, but without a spark from prelife existence, what will be riding around in their heads? What will see the world? What will wonder at the meaning of it all?

I shudder because I know, as a scientist, that vacuums of all sorts tend to be filled. Something will possess our babies and become their soulsit just won't be us. By Joey's subtle indication, it may already be happening, and we may already be outnumbered. After all, I'm not like the other people in his life*I'm actually here.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  can you go through a typical day, and how you think through elements of your stories? In other words, what questions do you ask yourself to get to the solution that is our weekly Wednesday story.

It's less a day-by-day process and more something that I'm always doing. My primary forms of entertainment are movies, tv, and videogames in these genres, so I discuss everything I see with the people in my life and apply everything I learn to an ever-growing pool of genre consciousness.

Then, the task is figuring out what a story is offering to a reader versus what the reader wants. Sometimes, not giving them what they want is the right route - for instance, if a character they like dies - but not giving them what they want has to be done with the mutually understood intent that it has been done on purpose. If a story simply wanders away from what a reader wants, it's a bad story. If I show a reader the possibility they want and then snatch it away, they at least know that pain is purposeful (e.g. tragedies, horror stories).

I'm of the belief that stories should always have a specific point that is being barreled toward with force. The story should create grand ideas that stimulate the imagination, build believable cohesive worlds and characters, and ultimately leave the reader with a sense of triumphant exhaustion as if they've been on the journey themselves and all those hardships and victories were their own.

What that means for weekly stories is - you might be a reader in an office or at home and you're having a slow week. You watched all of Monday's and Tuesday's TV shows already and you're thirsting for an escape. Ideally, I want your Wednesday to hold a tangible sense of excitement at the prospect of a juicy new mental stimulation - and then you get to think and wonder for the next seven days about what might come next. That's what I'm shooting for because that's what I love myself as a consumer of content, so I try to construct individual chapters that provide that feeling while the whole arc grows inevitably toward a conflict you see coming miles away but which still plays out the way real life plays out - randomly, tragically, amazingly. That's how life really happens. Very little is unexpected on a big scale, but everything is unexpected step by step.

In terms of my actual day, I pretty much sit down and write my 5000 words with small breaks because the general progression of the story has already been built in my head. I do whatever publishing work needs to be done after that. Write emails helping people write or get out there. Then there are Skype sessions with contacts, reading some content myself, and then, most importantly, hanging out with people I care about :) </TEXT>

Thanks a ton! I will!

 I was just wondering how your own subreddit works?

It's pretty informal here. I post my stories here, and pretty much anything goes. I'm excited to read stories by other people, especially set in the Multiverse, even if I can't comment without accidentally influencing or accidentally approving / disapproving.

 And wheres the best place to start in your stories and the order to read it in to fully encapture the world you portray?

I'd check out this [fan-made wiki and reading list](http://forest.wolfnexus.net/wiki/index.php/Multiverse_unofficial_reading_guide). They're awesome over there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How did we unleash Hell on Earth? Simple - it was the same mistake humanity always makes.

It started in a parking lot.

A breeze came, stirring the steam rising from patches of old ice that were sublimating under the surprisingly warm afternoon sun. I sat in my car, feeling none of that interplay of heat and cold. Eating a hamburger and drinking a soda, I idly watched nature ebb and flow. The wife never used to let me eat fast food.

I was finding that greasy food was not really the holy grail of indulgences that I believed it to be when I couldn't have it.

The discarded wrapper and empty cup found their way to the back. The growing pile of fast food trash had started rather innocuously on the floor, and grown from there, to the point that it was now beginning to threaten the entire back seat territory. The villagers were alarmed, but the king couldn't be bothered every time he was in his castle, his mind was elsewhere.

I lowered the drawbridge and stepped out of my car. Immediately assaulted by warm radiance and chill breeze, I walked across the parking lot and stood above a large patch of ice, watching the flowing steam rise from the ice in roiling aerial columns. Had we been going about this all wrong?

There was no liquid. It went straight from ice to steam thanks to conflicting conditions and a vast power source on high.

Turning away, I hurried back toward my building, my thoughts churning over something important that I couldn't quite yet pin down.

I didn't hate her. I hadn't meant what I'd said. This place, the place I was instead of with her on all those half-remembered days this place made me think of her at all times, and, yet, it was my only refuge from a veritable ocean of despair that seemed to blanket everywhere else.

It was all muscle memory by now. Keycard, push open the heavy door with a slight forward lean lasting roughly a second, warm air conditioning breeze, turn right, dingy white rectangles and slightly-too-dim lights, twenty to thirty seconds of zoned-out walking past fliers, posters, and notes I'd never once looked at, turn left check rumpled clothes, cough once, fix hair door.

"Doctor!" my intern cried, jumping first to the right, then to the left, then back to his monitor, where he quickly alt-tabbed away from a game. He was burning bright red when he swiveled around in his chair, but, to his credit, he managed to play it cool. "How was lunch?"

I knew Emil played games half the time, and I didn't care, as long as the work got done. I didn't tell him that, though. Why spoil one of the few office joys? "Good. What are you working on?"

"Just, uh, this morning's data."

I managed not to laugh. He was smart and capable. He'd finished that two hours ago. We didn't have enough work to justify his presence, but we couldn't let him go, or else we'd lose our funding for interns in the future. "Any conclusions?"

He shook his head. "It still just looks like a mess."

Gazing beyond him, I regarded the wall of glass that protected the next room. Filled with computers and equipment, the testing chamber ran most of our simulations in a semi-automated fashion.

I picked up a random tennis ball that had been moving around the room whenever I wasn't present. I imagined Emil bounced it against the wall to pass the hours. This time, I bounced it against my coworker.

Turner sat up abruptly, dropping his book. "What? I'm awake!" When he saw that I wasn't buying it, he changed tack. "It's lunch time."

"It is," I told him. "But I think I have an idea."

Both of my companions perked up. Ideas had been sparse the last few months.

"Sublimation," I said, staring at our equipment. "We've been running data assuming certain things. Specifically, that we'd get statistically sensible data. What if our equipment causes dramatic changes in behavior? Like the sun on ice."

Turner frowned. "We're not the sun. We're sending in very little energy."

"But we have no idea what these manifolds contain," Emil replied, sounding intrigued. "It's very little to us, but"

I nodded. "Let's start separating the data and see what happens."

We'd had many leads over the last several years, yet I never grew jaded. It was always exciting to feel that *today could be the day!* The applications of a breakthrough at our lab wouldn't mean much immediately, but we could open the door to a host of fantastic science-fiction technologies and, as I often told myself, that might have made my personal sacrifices worth it.

It was two in the morning - and long past the time we all should have gone home - when Emil sighed and waved a hand at his monitor. "Even with the separate data sets, they're all still just clouds of random information."

Sitting at the table behind us, coffee mug in hand and a dozen pages of notes strewn nearby, Turner turned his tired gaze over at the screen. "Why are you looking at brain maps?"

I turned abruptly. "What?"

He yawned. "That's a neural map. You guys giving up for tonight or something?"

I looked back at the monitor. "Rotate that."

Eyes wide, Emil moved the graphs we'd made. As they turned, their shapes became absurdly obvious.

We said it at the same time: "*Brains?*"

Turner narrowed his eyes. "Wait, is that our data? Why does it look like brains?"

"They're overlapping images of brains," I replied in amazement. "Not actual physical structures, but holographically equivalent results of the complex physics at play. We've been mapping a very dense collection of neural networks! And look here, at the changes over time - that's why our data just looked like garbage - they're reacting to our energy!"

Standing abruptly and hurrying over with his coffee, Turner studied the monitor alongside me. "You're saying these brains are active?"

I nodded. "Alive, even. I mean, we'd have to get a neuroscientist to verify, but they look normal to me."

Emil was the first to ask the obvious question. He seemed more worried than excited. "Um whose brains?"

That gave Turner and I pause.

Whose brains, indeed?

If we'd found a dense collection of living brain maps in a twisted-up higher dimension, then these were people. If they were people, then who were they?

And what were they doing there?

"Get the phones," I said. "We've got a thousand calls to make."

"Won't everyone be asleep now?" Emil asked.

I couldn't help but grin hungrily. "Wake 'em up."

Mathematicians, neuroscientists, and physicists flooded our lab over the following month - and we moved to a bigger one when it became a problem. Funding had always been a struggle before that night, but the money began pouring in without us so much as writing a grant proposal. Everyone wanted to be a part of the insane discovery that the electrical patterns of human brains were accessible in higher dimensions.

Nobody knew what it meant, either.

Was this proof of the existence of a soul? I didn't think so. We were seeing the exact same thing that a magnetic resonance imager might see. It was the entire brain, but just the brain - nothing more, nothing less.

Was our entire model of physics wrong? We weren't sure. Something was certainly going on beyond our understanding, but the rest of science remained in place.

The more we mapped, the more brains we found. The more brains we found, the more institutions began pouring funding into encouraging people to get brain scans. A prize was posted for the first person to match up, and donations quickly ballooned it to incredible heights when the prize broke a hundred million dollars, the world went crazy.

We had people claiming they could feel us mapping them, and that we were causing them health problems. We had psychics claiming they'd known about our findings all along, and that was how they'd been reading minds. We had conspiracy theorists protesting that the government would use this technology to scan their thoughts.

That one always annoyed me the most. If we could read thoughts, we wouldn't have to compare brain scans to actual living people, now would we? We'd just pick the names out of their heads, and -

Actual living people.

I was in the parking lot of our new lab when that annoyance and revelation hit me. I put down my soda and left my hamburger half-eaten. There was no longer a pile of trash in the back seat, but only because a maid hired by our PR guy cleaned it every day.

No.

No, absolutely not.

That couldn't be it.

I approached the new building in a daze. Keycard, push open the light door with a slight forward lean - oops, stumble - warm air conditioning breeze, turn right - no, left - damnit!

Shaking my head, I sighed and aimed for the proper hallway.

Turn right check rumpled clothes, cough once, fix hair door.

After so long at the old lab, the vast warehouse-like space of our new place always astounded me in subtle ways. A hundred of the best and brightest minds from across the world sat and stood at desks and at whiteboards, working at a breakneck caffeine-fueled pace. The world was watching, and we needed answers.

I walked to the gigantic main whiteboard and stood by it, regarding the long list of possibilities we'd come up with.

Many men and women slowly approached me. I think they could see the profound horror on my drawn face.

Turning, I looked each of them in the eyes. I was sure I'd remember all of their faces for the rest of my life, because, in that moment, the world was about to change. I didn't have any eloquent words for it. "Guys we've mapped eleven billion different brain patterns. We've scanned four billion living human beings. They don't match up."

It hit them all in a slow wave. We hadn't thought of it before, because we hadn't wanted to think of it before. The implications were enormous, confusing, and terrifying.

I said it for them. "The active brains folded up in higher dimensions that we're mapping - I think they're dead people."

Twelve percent of our staff quit that day.

We told no one. We couldn't say a word until we were certain.

The minds we were seeing - were they suffering? Were they in an afterlife right at that very moment? Was it Heaven? Was it Hell? Or were they simply floating in oblivion? What were they experiencing? It was maddening to think about.

Secret funding quadrupled our staff. Wilczek, Higgs, Legget, Witten, Hawking - we got them all.

I didn't know how our funders were keeping our project under wraps, and I didn't ask. It probably didn't even matter in the face of what we were uncovering. When we finished mapping all the minds hidden in higher dimensions and found ourselves looking at a list one hundred and eighteen billion entries long, we knew for certain: we'd found humanity's dead.

And they were still alive somehow, somewhere.

Our facility split into two projects once it was confirmed. Half of us focused on figuring out how to use brain images to decipher thoughts and images. The other half focused on communicating with the dead in some manner.

We'd already seen their neural patterns respond to the energy our equipment had been using to scan the higher-dimensional manifolds. From there, the teams focused on connecting more directly.

I remember the day that we first managed to hook a computer to a mind and vocalize their consciously directed attempts at speech. The process took over a thousand iterations and several billion dollars - and a few years of our lives - but it was all going to be worth it. We had all our investors on hand, and a translator for every language.

Turner was given the honor. He looked around the warehouse at the hundreds gathered around, grinned sheepishly, and then spoke into the microphone. "Hello? Can you hear me?"

A few moments passed, and we were worried that it might not have -

A few tentative words followed.

An older man stepped out of the crowd. "It's Occitan," he said, translating. "An old dialect from around southern France, in Languedoc, between the twelfth and fourteen centuries. He said: who is that?"

Turner motioned the man forward. "Ask him what his name is."

The answer came a moment later. "Petrus."

"What year is it?" Turner asked.

The older man translated the question, and then the answer. "He says thirteen hundred and two."

A great silence fell across the warehouse at that reply.

We were talking to a European peasant that had died almost seven hundred years before. Like everyone else, I stood frozen by the implications. Could I talk to my wife again? Could I have another chance to tell her that I hadn't meant what I'd said? The last thing she'd ever heard

"Who is the King of France?" Turner and the translator asked.

The answer, as I heard it: "Philippe."

A lag followed as we each thought back to history class, and, then the blanket of silence ruptured as a massive swelling cheer filled the air.

It was real.

I lost track of our size and funding after that. We'd made honest contact with a dead person, and money became irrelevant. Everything we needed was thrown at us, and the world found out through security leaks a month before our press release.

I didn't care about any of that. I could have retired immediately as an insanely wealthy and famous man, but I worked day and night for my own reasons. Emil was still with me, too, though now he was being paid far better than any intern. He'd met Laura, so he'd probably guessed at the secret reasons for my dedication to the project.

We couldn't choose our connection among the individuals in what we had begun calling the afterspace. On our breaks, we all spent every minute talking to the dead. I knew whose voice I wanted to hear, but I kept getting African tribal chiefs, Mongol warriors, Egyptian slaves, Roman legionnaires, and any number of people I'm sure someone would be fascinated to speak with.

One guy - honest to God - got Albert Einstein on the line.

We kept that connection open permanently. He was more than willing to help out; in fact, he'd been collecting data since the moment of his death in the very hopes that something like this would happen.

Always the scientist, we'd chuckled at that.

And yet he would not speak on his current experiences. None of them would. Not a single dead mind would vocalize what they were seeing, hearing, or feeling. We knew, from their neural maps, that they were experiencing *something*, but none would reveal what it was. When unduly pressed, some expressed a willingness to try, but then complained that they could not vocalize the thought to us.

It became known as the New Cosmic Censorship hypothesis. Humans were born with no knowledge of what came before, and, when they died, they could not give certain censored information back to the living. It was in their brains, in their experiences and their emotions, but it was still hidden from us.

The next development came in a both natural and surreal manner.

Einstein's connection was always open, so they gave his computer a little mobile drone to roll around on. With certain thoughts, he could order it to move around. We gave him a visual feed, too, so he could both see and hear the world around his computer. After he expressed frustration at not being able to write on the boards himself, they gave him mechanical arms.

It became eerie when somebody thought to dispense with the makeshift setup we'd cobbled together and, instead, give him a full-on robotic body.

Suddenly, Albert Einstein was walking around our facility, working on theorems, giving lectures to droves of visitors, reading books in his free time, and recharging in the corner every night.

From there, it was fairly obvious what was going to happen next.

Our investors - and a world full of elated donators and supporters - bought more robotic bodies. We bought the warehouse across the lot, and filled it with artificial bodies that would remain on hand for anyone we thought scientifically useful and, then, for anyone we found particularly important or interesting and, then, for anyone whose loved ones paid enough.

And that was when I realized why Big Money had invested in us. How much would *you* pay to have your loved one back? A hundred thousand? A million? They worked out *deals* with almost anyone based on one's ability to pay. They lobbied the government and got tax credits worked into the system itself. It was a basic human right, they argued, to have your loved one resurrected robotically if their number came up.

It was still random, you see. If the family didnt pay at that moment, there was a chance they'd never have another opportunity. There were one hundred and eighteen billion minds in the afterlife, and growing - and the vast majority of those were ancient people from between the year 8000 BC and the year 1200 AD. The odds of having someone you loved come up were worse than any lottery. 

And yet, people still hoped.

I still hoped.

For having a think tank comprised of the brightest minds in the world, we sure didn't see possibilities that turned out to be obvious later. I suppose we were too caught up in math and science to think about the human angle.

I was in my office when I heard the first screams.

The power went out shortly after, leaving me in the dark, save for a few red backup lights.

"Emil?" I called.

"Yeah, Doc?"

"Did something explode?"

"I didn't hear anything like that," he said.

In the dark, I frowned. "Then why isn't the emergency power coming on?"

He had no answer for me.

Stepping out of our shared office, we peered up and down the crimson-lit hallway. My first thought was that we were under attack by one of the protest groups that had made serious death threats against us. There were a great many people concerned that what we were doing was wrong, and I knew enough about religion not to ignore the strength of their convictions.

And there was every possibility they were right - I just didn't care. I had to have my moment. I had to talk to her.

We crept down our hallway, passing concerned scientists on either side.

At the corner, we found a security guard on the ground. I bent down to check his neck for a pulse, but stopped halfway to the floor.

Something had torn his legs out of their sockets. His lower half was leaking dark liquid. Under the crimson backup lights, the pool looked black as pitch.

I stood and backed away.

Emil saw, and nearly retched.

"It's gotta be a robot," I said quietly. "They're a retrofitted military design. They could probably do this to a man."

"But why?" Emil asked, following me quickly down another hallway.

We couldn't stay where we were. Something was seriously wrong. I headed for our warehouse working space first, and peered in through a bent door.

Something had rampaged through the area. Desks had been overturned or obliterated, and I saw black bloodstains on the red-cast floor. Somewhere distant, I heard machinery moving. Was it? No - the humanoid robotic forms were nearly silent.

Heavy footsteps fell somewhere nearby, and we darted inside the shattered warehouse space. Hiding underneath a desk with Emil, I tried to guess what had happened. Had one of the teams connected someone dangerous to a robotic body? Why would they do that?

Our foolishness struck me quite hard. We'd never really considered the fact that the dead could lie. Someone says their name is Petrus, and we take them at their word

The desk lifted away so smoothly I almost didn't notice it. Only the sudden span of red light across my arms betrayed our discovery.

It stood above us, five feet of wiry metallic crimson. One arm lifted Emil by the neck, and a smooth and creepy voice gave me an order. "Tell me how to get out of here, or the boy dies. And then you die."

"I will," I told him, intent on appealing to his ego, based on some self-defense training we'd had after the first death threats. "I will! Just, first - who are you? Who are you *really?* How did you trick us?"

He laughed, and the eerie noise set me on edge. "Trick you? You people are idiots. A little military jargon and you were convinced I was a good guy. Still, I'm gonna do things right this time. No alcohol this time. No anger."

"What do you call all this?" I asked, horrified. Two black cameras set in a crimson metal mockery of a face gazed down at me.

"A guard figured out who I was," he grunted. "I had to."

"You had to hurt all these people?" I asked, looking up at Emil, who was struggling to breathe. "Let him go, and I'll have them let *you* go. Blame it on what's happened - pulling you out of the afterlife."

The chrome head turned as he looked his victim in the eyes. "But I I want to hurt him. You abandoned me for *years* in that place. I hate all of you so much, I just..."

"No, we *rescued* you," I countered. "You died. Nobody could do anything about that."

He nodded slowly. "I died right I remember"

Slowly, the metal hand unclasped, and Emil fell to the floor, gasping for breath.

"Out that door, then to the left," I told the robotic dead man. "Go down the hallway. It's the third door on the right. You'll come out to a parking lot, and you'll have to make a run for it."

He turned away, then, and moved quickly out.

Of course, the guards were ready in the parking lot. Numerous machine guns rang out in the distance, and I sat with Emil until it was over.

The incident changed everything about how we operated. I had personally come face to face with the dangerous forces at work, and so had many others, and we were no longer exuberantly risky. Every single step of the process became filled with checks upon checks, and the public eye was glaring down on us with ire. We'd almost resurrected and released an infamous serial murderer and rapist. He'd killed three guards and six major scientists, along with damaging a large portion of our facility. We looked incompetent at best, and like idiots at worst.

Despite all our best efforts to reform our procedures, eventually we were ousted. Our investors gave us all the boot and installed yes-men once the process no longer really needed us.

They kept the connection machines running night and day, and made countless numbers of them. Eventually, they started rolling out people's dead relatives in a more consistent manner. I had to sit at home and watch as my neighbors each got the call one by one.

And, still, no call came for me.

Emil visited often, and Turner visited sometimes. None of us were able to find jobs in any field remotely related to science, so we began to suspect that we'd been blacklisted. We were lucky to have enough money to live on already, thanks to wise choices when it all started.

Not that money was going to last long as a thing. The flood of Resurrected, as they came to be called, began drastically changing the social landscape. We had the greatest minds of every generation coming back and taking up the top positions at universities and research institutions. Who could say no to installing Albert Einstein or Isaac Newton at the top?

Many of our former colleagues joined us in unemployment. There were only so many positions available, and great names throughout history kept appearing to take those spots.

They didn't require food, drink, or sleep either. Without the hindrance of a human body, they could work tirelessly through the night, and we began to see rapid advances in technology and science even as regular working men and women became obsolete.

It started at the top, and worked down.

I knew something was seriously wrong when my gas station attendant, Lou, was replaced by a Resurrected. Some family had paid to bring a person back from the dead, and now they were working at a gas station? It was eerie to see a robot doing a man's work in such a mundane setting.

Around that time, people started killing themselves in the hope of coming back as a robot. They left payment for themselves through a lawyer to ensure the money and the whole thing became sort of a twisted semi-religious movement.

What do you do when your world is falling apart all around you? They'd always told us robots would take our jobs. We just didn't expect it would be our own dead friends, family, and ancestors operating them. They outnumbered us, could outwork us, and were going to outlive us. In many ways, I could see what the protest groups had feared. If the dead replaced the living, would humanity simply stall forever?

I heard my dad was back in town, paid for my brother, but I had no interest in speaking to either of them. There was only one person I wanted to talk to.

The whole world had gone insane, and society was coming apart and all I could think about were the last words I'd said to my wife before she'd died. How many years had it been now?

I couldn't move on. It was impossible to move on when the chance of talking to your dead loved one actually existed. That realization put a profound shock through me as I sat watching an episode of Jeopardy in which the historical questions were actually about the contestants who had lived in those eras.

The dead had to die for the living to move forward. We were being overtaken by the sheer weight of our own past.

I wasn't alone in my dark thoughts.

When I spoke with Emil about these feelings, he revealed to me that he was already part of a movement dedicated to purposes I had only begun to dream of.

Turner was, too. They just hadn't been able to tell me until they knew how I felt. My longing to speak to my dead wife had concerned them.

But I'd given up on that. It seemed that it wasn't in the cards for me, and I'd realized it was unhealthy to hold on in any case.

The streets were filled with Resurrected by then. They'd gotten more lifelike and less militaristic bodies, yet, somehow, they remained in the uncanny valley. They strolled on the sidewalks, drove cars, and sat on their porches like any normal person except they'd died.

They were dead, and they didn't deserve to still be walking around.

I kept my growing hatred hidden, like many of us did. They'd taken our jobs, our neighborhoods, and now our futures

I did the final calculations, since I knew the process best, and had been there from the beginning. With little time for infiltration, and the risk that any of us might die at any time and then tip off the dead, two thousand of us descended on the Large Hadron Collider at the planned day and time.

It was late November, and crisp out. I didn't feel bad about the Resurrected security guards. They were just chrome and wires. Our soldiers - some of whom had been with us since our first major lab - sliced their way into the facility with zealous fire.

They hadn't even thought to defend it from such an attack, since none of the dead had any idea what we could do with it.

With the facility cleared, the soldiers set up to defend against a possible siege, and the rest of us got to work.

It was eerie how fast the Resurrected responded. Soldiers from our team that had died in the attack came at us in chrome bodies only a day later. What could possibly have convinced them to switch sides so easily? Was it simply a matter of self-interest? Now that they were dead, had they decided to cast their lots with their new demographic?

It was too late, in any case. With the calculations complete and the equipment properly prepared, we activated the Collider.

Nothing happened as far as we could see, but the Resurrected stopped - everywhere, all at once.

We'd filled a crucial extremely small and curled-up higher dimension with carefully engineered static. The robotic bodies here on Earth had lost their connection to the afterlife forever.

We walked out of that facility with a burgeoning sense of freedom. Thirty-six billion robotic bodies stood frozen all over the planet, and six billion human beings remained to carry on without their very own ancestors in the way.

It was after that, while picking up the pieces, that we found all the left-behind private communications between the Resurrected. Those communications clued us in. Those communications showed us how short-sighted and foolish we'd been.

There was no New Cosmic Censorship principle. There never had been.

They'd all simply lied.

The afterlife was, as they'd described it to each other, an infinitely small box filled with the speaking, screaming, and shouting minds of everyone who had ever died - and each new death, each new brain pattern, made the whole place just a little bit hotter and denser. They'd described the afterlife as ever-increasing squeezing of one's awareness, ever-increasing burning heat, and endless clamor. There was no end in sight, no relief, and they'd collaborated together from the very first moment they'd felt our tenuous probing.

They'd lied the whole time lied to escape, lied to find freedom and return to the living world.

Instead of working with them, or hoping for the best, we'd closed that door forever.

The thing is, nobody around me seems to care. They kick the empty robotic bodies, string them up, laugh and celebrate. They work, eat, sleep, and party. Death is something that happens to other people, or old people, or the deserving.

I tried to tell them that death comes to us all, and that we'd made a grave mistake, but nobody wanted to listen. Every single human being that comes after us - for the next two point two billion years, at least, until the static we made decays - will go into that box. Every old person that passes on in slumber, every young person that dies tragically they'll all end up there. Every child that is ever born will one day become another mind thrown into torment. 

We are all going to die, and we are all going to end up in an infinitely small box together, screaming forever.

And nobody cares. That's the hilarious and mind-numbing part. It's the same simple mistake that humanity always makes. Even after all that, we still haven't solved any of the other issues facing our future - pollution, global warming, resource depletion, automation, wealth inequality, antibiotic resistance - and nobody cares about those, either.

The excuses are always the same: someone else will deal with it. Those things will happen to someone else. We've got time to figure it all out.

It's laughable, and it never changes.

Me? I won't be around for those rides. None of this has any point, not now that we know what awaits. This world is just a waiting room for Hell. I'm not waiting around with these fools.

I'm going to go apologize to my wife. </TEXT>

It wasn't that I was unremarkable. Everyone has something about them that is uniquely their own. It just so happened that my *thing* was floating through foster families, schools, and social situations without leaving a single mark. I was just slightly too shy to make lasting friends and just slightly too outgoing to fit in with other loners. Consequently, I ended up living with more solitude than any of them.

But it was alright. Through high school and college, it was fine. I told myself that it was all good. Every dog has his day eventually, and I was just a member of those silenced masses that TV shows and movies ignore. When the football players and cheer leaders and student council representatives all graduated into the real world, they'd be on the same ennui-filled playing field, and then I'd rise up and

I don't know what I expected, but it didn't happen. Instead, social media happened.

It started innocently, with MySpace in high school. Facebook followed during college, and then even Google Plus joined in. As the years passed, they taunted me with a growing sea of shame. Everyone else was happy, smiling, partying, drinking, dancing, going on vacations, and having the times of their lives. What was I doing? Nothing worth noting. I had a Facebook account, and it had so-called friends I'd collected over the years with increasing desperation, but I couldn't bring myself to post anything real or substantial. My few attempts garnered no views and no likes.

The night of my college graduation partywhich nobody had attended, despite the hundreds of invites I'd sent and the dozens that had clicked *yes, attending*I felt something dark bubbling beneath my heart. It was a simmering boil of pitch bitterness that had been pooling there my entire life, and, too pained to let things continue the way they'd been going, I shattered a sacred tenet.

I lied.

Heading out onto the streets, I found a random college party, moved into the center of the crowd, and shouted "*Go team!*" before snapping a picture of myself surrounded by countless drunk people who had automatically sent up a whoop and a toast for the team.

I ran home, and, hands shaking, I posted the picture on my Facebook with the words, "Graduation party's crazy!"

Called out. I'd get called out. I knew it. Someone would recognize those partiers, or the house, ororthey might just not believe I could actually have friends. I drank the entire bottle of liquor I'd bought for my pitiful unattended party. The world had ignored me this long, but being called out and humiliated would be far worse. I would have given anything to take it all back.

Turning my face up out of a pool of my own vomit, I awoke to a groggy hangover, a painfully bright beam of sunlight, and over a thousand likes.

*Who knew you were such a party animal?!*

*Congrats on graduating!*

*Woo we're all adults now!*

*When's your next one? Couldn't make it but I'll be there next time!*

My God. Not only had they not called me out, they'd leapt at the opportunity towhat? What *was* this? They didn't want real. They didn't want substantial. They wanted to consume positivity and be made happier themselves for it. In that respect, I couldn't judge, because we were a dichotomy. They wanted exciting time-of-my-life posts, and I wanted their reactions. I'd always wanted to be noticed, and now I could be.

Alone, I drove six hours to the beach and set up a bunch of pictures of myself supposedly on vacation in South America. I even asked a random girl to take a picture with me, and, lo and behold, she did it without thinking and with the same fake sudden-smile that everyone seemed to don when a camera came out.

*Who's that? You dog!*

*South America looks so beautiful this time of year!*

*Is that your girlfriend? Jealous!! Xoxo*

Amazing. The ease of all this was almost ridiculous. Nobody wanted to see through the faade. Nobody wanted to call me out. This was a space of desperate positivity. That post actually resulted in my first real date in years, along with people starting to recognize me and complement me on my supposed tan.

I grew addicted. I won't lie about that; not here and now in my confession. It was all glamorous parties, best nights of my life, and beautiful dates from then on, each staged with increasing audacity. The craziest part about it all was that my fantastic online life began dragging my real one up from the depths. People high-fived me on the street, girls asked me out to drinks, and an old teacher offered me a high-paying job after *seeing how well I was doing.*

He told me straight to my face that he'd thought I wouldn't amount to anything, and that I'd surprised him. It was a punch in the gut, but I smiled, shook his hand, took the job, and used it as more fuel for my glowing online life.

Of course, none of this really made a difference in the private hours of each day. When I had to return home to my small apartment and sit by myself watching Netflix, there was nothing to do but stew in the brutal tar that my fake life had made all the more painful. I wished that these times could just go away somehow; these same spaces were invisible in everyone else's lives, for they never shared these parts online, and I wondered if they all had to endure the same isolation and pain.

Since that first night when I'd discovered this magic, the liquor had not decreased in frequency. Sitting alone and drinking, I regarded a message I'd gotten on Facebook from a girl I'd actually liked: *sorry, I had fun on our date, but I just don't think I can keep up with you! You're so social and outgoing and I'm a homebody that mostly sits at home watching movies. Hope you understand.*

The laughter wouldn't stop. It grew in my chest until I couldn't breathe, until I couldn't take it, until it became humored screaming powered by the blackest irony. There was no way to reconcile the powerful allure of my online life with the basic realities of my real one. I couldn't admit what I'd done, and I certainly couldn't stop.

So I drank.

And I drank some more.

Then I took some pills for my drinking headache.

Then I had a coffee, drank some more, and took some pills to help me sleep.

Feeling worse than I'd ever felt in my life, I took more painkillers.

And then I took some more, just in case the headache came back.

That's how it happens sometimes. It's not always about killing yourself. Sometimes, people are just lost and wallowing in consuming tar, sinking only to be caught inescapably, suffocating on their own pain.

Turning my face up out of a pool of my own vomit, I awoke to a groggy hangover, a painfully bright beam of sunlight, and over a thousand likes.

Somewhere in my haze of liquor and pills, I'd posted about partying like there was no tomorrow, and the voyeurs out there had eaten it up. I'd even taken pictures of pills and told them it was ecstasyand nobody had called me out even though they were clearly brand-marked painkillers! They didn't *want* to see the truth! The power of their denial was amazing.

So amazing, in fact, that none of them wanted to believe I'd killed myself the night before. Despite the clear story played out in my posts full of lies, they wanted to believe I'd partied hard and had another best night of my life. As always, the consequences in the private hours of my life were mine alone to suffer.

The first thing I noticed, about an hour after waking up, was that I had no heartbeat.

I stood in front of the mirror without a shirt on and examined myself. There were no wounds, no bleeding, and no injuries. I'd overdosed, and it had left me looking normal. Surely, this was all some sort of delusion. I must have still been high on painkillersdespite everything feeling normal, albeit a little cold, I chose to believe that I was still alive. My breath put no fog on the mirror, I couldn't feel my pulse, and a thermometer gave my body temperature as startlingly low, but I refused to believe the obvious.

In fact, I went to the store and bought groceries. The clerk took my money and packed the bags and said good day. I smiled at a random person on the street, and she smiled and nodded back.

I was alive. I had to be.

It began getting harder to move, and I retreated to my apartment and pulled up my shirt in the privacy of my bathroom to find my skin turning purplish-grey.  Frantically Googling, I discovered that my cells were breaking down and my blood vessels were rupturing. What could I do?

I had only one thoughtreturn to my addiction. Quickly taking photos before the discoloration reached my face, I grabbed as many angles and smiles as I could. Who knew if I would ever be able to take more? Hoping against all sanity, I threw stuff all over my apartment and then posed in front of it, posting *crazy party last night, at least I'm feeling great today!*

As the views and likes began rolling in, I started feeling a little better, and my mobility increased. I'd been right: the same force of collective human denial that had kept me alive in my dead body could also sustain me.

I couldn't leave the house for long. I had just enough time to go to work each day before making a new post; suddenly, I became the superstar of my own fake world. The grander the post, the more the likes; the more the likes, the more the rot in my limbs seemed to stallbut it never, ever reversed. Every time traffic delayed me or I had to stay late at work, another small part of me blackened a tiny bit. I managed to transition to working at home, and thankfully, for at that time I was wearing turtlenecks every day to cover open rotting sores on my neck.

Working at homeand the fact that I never had to eat or sleepgave me time to stage an elaborate online life, which kept me stable for several months. My face was getting purple at times, but I covered that with makeup. Awkward. I think that's what gave me away, and one like myself finally contacted me.

*Idiot*, she wrote. *You'll give us all away by posting like that.*

She gave me an address, and I showed up to a small house in the middle of backwoods country with no idea what to expect. I only went because I'd become aware I was fighting a losing war to stay in existence. I knocked, but nobody came to the door. Eventually, I found that it was unlocked, and I pushed my way into a horrible brown miasma. For the first time, I was thankful that my numb senses could hardly detect smells. Deeper into the dark, I found her by the light of ten computer screens.

I didn't actually think she was aliveor, rather, animate. Most of her skeleton was exposed among rotting gobs of flesh that dripped putrid black ooze. One hand manned her keyboard and the other manned her mouse, a decade-old corpse that had become melded to her chair.

Her skull still held hair on the side closer to me, but she turned to look at me, showing white bone that had been hidden by my perspective. Her face was surprisingly intact, kept together by careful maintenance, and her eyes were the only thing about her still fully alive. "Idiot," she rasped quietly. "You have to be smarter about this."

"How long have you been doing this?" I asked, mortified.

"A lot longer than you." She turned back and clicked on one of her screens. "You gotta have more than one profile if you ever want to make headway."

I stepped a little closer. "What do you mean?"

"I was just a skeleton and some muscle tissue two years ago," she said, her voice a soft lilting whisper pushed out by a single moldy lung that I could see contracting. "Until someone hacked my account and pretended to be me. I'd died out here alone"

"and since nobody knew" I realized aloud.

"Exactly."

If my heart had been able to beat, I might have felt a dozen things at that moment. First, though, I asked, "How many of us are there?"

She grinned with half-missing lips. "More than you know, I bet, but we get to live only as long as nobody knows about it, so they're very, very good at lying." She let her single lung relax for a moment before continuing. "Work from home or scam on the internet for a living. No bills other than electricity, since we don't eat or need water or heat."

"It's kinda great, isn't it?" I said quickly, excited to finally talk to someone else in a genuine way in months. I'd once wished my real life could rot off and fall away, and it actually had, only to leave me with remorse at what a fool I'd been.

She smiled again.

I moved my computer there three days later, and soon bought more to scale up our operations. For the first time in my life, my private hours were actually spent with someone else, and I found the black tar around my heart receding. She began looking and sounding more human with each passing week as her flesh regenerated bit by bit after every post.

But of course I'm still the one the world left behind. It wasn't exactly a fairy tale, but it was *my* happily ever afteremphasis on *after*and I lost the will to go on after it happened.

A breeze blew open a curtain, and a man who had gotten lost after his truck had broken down on the forest road saw her through the window. She was still rotted all over, and he knew instantly. That was it: she fell to the ground, gone. Only her purple and black bloated corpse remained.

I cleared everything out after the passerby ran away and I found a new place to hole up, but it's just not the same. I'm not even sure people like me can ever truly come back to life, or if the best we can do is to cling to a false existence in the mental sphere of humanity, but I just can't go back to being alone. I guess that's what this confession is aboutI might be dead, but I still know when I've crossed the line into disgusting insanity. Thing is, I don't care. I'm not even going to tell you who I am in particular, so I'll get to keep living my false life. I'll still be out there posting, along with countless others of my kind, and you'll keep liking and commenting on the supposed best nights of our lives.

I'm happy with this, no matter how disgusting it might be, because I'm no longer alone. She might just be a bloated corpse, but I've got a girlfriend now. She's the one you can see smiling and partying in all my pictures. You wouldn't believe what can be done with Photoshop these days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Something like a graph that showed which stories are more heavily connected might be a good thing to try?

Yeah, we're going to need that. I actually have an idea in mind to use the Power of the Internet in just such a map to write parallel book series that actually take place at the same time with different characters. I'm sure someone's done that before somewhere, but I'd like to pioneer it for horror / sci fi, especially with some of these massive events. It'd be fun to write (and hopefully to read) what's going on in lots of different places during the Winter of the Multiverse that's happening now in the stories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I mention it because you call Portal in the Forest the first story, but starting from The House Beyond the Edge (making Portal at least the fourth story) works really well too. The scale of the thing starts small and constantly grows, as opposed to starting with a big scary multiverse and then eventually reading the older, smaller stuff later on to fill in some details.

That's true. I consider Portal first because that's where the narrative seed really began, both prequel and sequel, although I wrote previous series to set up certain characters and ideas under NoSleep's restrictive format. I'm actually not sure how I'd package and market those prequel series yet. I think they might be too slow to get to the meat of things as true beginning points. </TEXT>

Oh I didn't get anything like that at all from it :) I'm excited to widen conversations on all this.

 Not just on your behalf; as you say, the sub feels tired and can be extremely repetitive at times. Removing quality content against the wishes of a vocal number of their subscribers in the name of enforcing rules must surely be a factor in that.
People are talking about leaving, I'm still subbed but tend to follow particular authors rather than the most popular posts nowadays. Volunteers or not, I think the custodians of a forum with such a large audience have at least some level of obligation to run it according to the wishes of the majority (of course, I have no proof the majority of users would actually be with me). Granted, the rules state otherwise, but aren't mods selected as a representative of the community to act in its interests?

I looked at the moderator lists and it looks like they change pretty often. Many are as new as 2 months old. I think they're sticking to rules that have become bigger than anyone involved, since nobody knows how or why the sub grew to millions of subscribers. No other creepypasta or horror site has done that. And I certainly don't remember any marketing push or any money involved, so NoSleep is a wondrous thing that came about almost at random, and nobody has the wisdom to manage it perfectly.

 Anyway, I've cluttered up your thread enough. Sorry. Keep doing what you're doing! :)

Through the amazing journey you've written I've at certain turns always thought "man, I wonder if Matt knows about MTG lore?" I am really interested in the Planeswalkers from MTG and your stories protagonists share a lot of the best parts with them. Man, that just made my morning.

I'm glad you've read them! They seem highly underrated for the amazing stories they produced. Maybe it's because the series never ended and just kept getting crazier and crazier, or maybe it's because the books were tied to a card game.

Urza and Mishra's Brother's War and the Phyrexians are some of the coolest concepts I've ever seen done in fantasy. The cards and the stories were all done with such epic history feel that it had an air of ancient inevitable tragedy about it. </TEXT>

Go in with a business card and a box of books for the employees. Put some loose papers in the books outling the work and with some direction on how to follow the story. If they get hooked like any of us have than they will be recommending your work to all their customers.

Absolutely! This is basically the best job ever. It's like getting to tell scary stories over a campfire that seats ten thousand people.

 And who/what has inspired the themes in your writing?

I think one of the biggest things on my mind the last few years is obliviousness. A ton of wonderful and terrible things are happening to our world, and numerous forces work to keep us in the dark and worried about daily drama and television shows rather than what's going to happen to what is now our global community. My stories often contain underlying themes of limited information and 'waking up' to the fact that somebody profits off normal people being kept oblivious (whether that profit is money for a company or souls for a demon). Where you choose to put your attention and every minute of every day of your life are precious resources to *someone.* I wonder if we aren't making sure that it is we ourselves who benefit the most from that, rather than someone else. </TEXT>

Oh boy, there are going to be so many presents for you ahead. I'm excited. That's the best thing I could hear. I pretty much craft all of these for maximum *the whole time?!* moments. The limited information of particular perspectives is the most fun thing I get to employ. I also think it's one of the most realistic aspects of literature. As human beings, we're always operating with limited information and a best-we-can-do understanding of what's going on. 

 ... I'm calling the alien creatures Skrillex, though, and I'm not sorry :-p

I don't usually comment OOC like this, but official canon is that Skrillex is a figurehead artist of the Earth 32 underground electronic music scene, and is now somewhere in the Zkirax reality unable to fill seats at his shows because the names are too similar and word of mouth is hindered in a time when word of mouth is all that there is.

	<TEXT>  Even with a thousand now subscribed to your sub, it's obvious to me that your writing is criminally under-appreciated. Not in that people don't enjoy it but that it just isn't reaching the amount of people it deserves to be. This upsets ME, so I can barely comprehend how this must feel at times for you.
 You're incredibly humble and haven't shown the slightest sign of ego that I've seen, but surely you must be aware or at least conscious that you're kinda onto something special here? It's near impossible for me to conceive the amount of planning necessary to achieve what you have not paying off in the form of some sense of satisfaction. As a reader though, it's easy to identify. As an author? I'm not so sure.
 I know many if not most creative types tend to be pretty hard on themselves. Personally, my default reaction to praise is often to thank politely outwardly, but disagree internally and just put it down to the person not really knowing what they're talking about or misinterpreting something etc.
 So I guess my question is basically when you look at your work, do you see what we see? Do you get a feeling that these are the early stages of something far, far bigger for you (career-wise)?

I believe that success, especially on the Internet, is a combination of marketing and product. You can have an average product and insane marketing and succeed, or you can have an amazing product and weak marketing and succeed. I'm shooting for that second strategy since I don't currently have the capital for employees or a marketing blitz. I'll produce consistent quality content for you guys as best I can and the success will inevitably follow on a timeline I'm comfortable with.

I do need to level up my marketing efforts, website, and so on, and that's all under way, but there are only so many hours in a day. It does frustrate me a little that I have to learn so many different skills and do everything myself, but it's rewarding in the end. Getting my MBA helped on the business side for sure. Everything I learn goes into the publishing side of my business to help other authors.

I have a plan in mind for this year that involves getting my website upgraded (it's already half done but with a temporary layout), getting my published books caught up, and then doing a larger marketing effort once I feel I look as professional as my work is.

 Because that's what I (we?) get. It honestly feels like a whole bunch of us have found the next Steven King at grass-roots level and that it's only a matter of time until the rest of the world catches on to what you're doing. 

:D I'll take that and feel motivated the rest of the week.

 I'm at a loss however as to how you'll make the next step towards that point and how we can help it along.

Hmm. Like the plan I mentioned above, stick around. I've been consistently surprised by much you guys want to be engaged, so I'm thinking we can do some sort of communal effort. The best thing any fan can do is mention my work and link to it. I have some pretty fantastic metrics I learned in one of my previous jobs, and I've managed to discern that any direct username mention always generates 1 new reader at minimum. Reddit's got millions of readers thirsty for content, so the power is in your hands.

 So when I see you having a guaranteed readership of potentially hundreds of thousands or more being taken from you for no clear or understandable reason (stories being over-zealously removed from nosleep) it makes me irrationally mad. 

The NoSleep moderators don't deserve any backlash. They're doing their volunteer jobs and they haven't harmed my career in any lasting way. In fact, moderation 'events' have been some of the most heartwarming moments of the last few years, because you guys comment in droves and remind me you're all still lurking out there!

 When I see average bimbo cam-girls on Patreon earning 10k plus A WEEK, then I see yours heavily underappreciated, it crushes me. And I feel a sense of helplessness to it all. Like, what now then?

I'll be putting a greater focus on the Patreon this year. It really should be my primary income, and income means success for this entire project. If we get to 2000+ a month, I'll never have to charge for a book again. If we drop to zero, I'll probably have to heavily scale back the writing to focus on publishing work, but I'll never stop.

On this end, the Patreon end, I feel I've just barely started. I'm saving up The Empty Earth's print version and beyond to publish at a more rapid pace on Amazon, along with some other ideas, and whew there's so much work ahead.

  I feel the way the subreddit is structured isn't overly welcoming to the uninitiated.

100% with you on that one. Gotta come up with a better structure. It might even involve hosting most of the content on my blog and using the subreddit mostly for new chapters that are less than a month or two old.

 Yet you've remained so outwardly positive and professional at every setback.

I'm glad you've noticed. I take it as a point of professional pride never to deride other authors or moderators. We're all in this together, and today's mangled oration is tomorrow's fantastic speech.

 Do these setbacks get to you more than you let on? 

Nah, success is inevitable, since nothing can stop me. There's no boss to fire me, no big company that might go under, and no gatekeeping publishing house that needs to approve my work. Since I write because I love to, I'll never stop.

 Do you have any ideas or even the compelling desire to spread the word further? I don't think fb is the answer, as people checking their feeds are generally looking for instant and brief gratification, funny pics etc. As touched on elsewhere here, it is quite tough to try and initiate a new reader to your work, no matter how sure we are that they would absolutely love it. An improved guide of some sorts will definitely assist.

Absolutely, the extensive work has become cumbersome over time. This'll be my biggest project for 2016.

 Have you entered your work in any competitions?

I submitted Portal into the Forest's first three chapters to an Ohio Grant thing, but it didn't go anywhere. I tend to avoid competitions because working 100 hours weeks I just don't have time to keep up on that whole thing. But if you guys find them, shoot them my way, and I'll absolutely submit something. Finding competitions I qualify for is 95% of the work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Which of your works is your favorite? Is it also the one that you had the most fun creating?

I've got a place in my heart for all my stories, but I think it's definitely *World of Glass*. That and its planned future books comprise a passion project I've had in my head for decades. It's also definitely the one I had the most fun creating, because the research and speculation it took was very rewarding. I've told this story before, but it's about a world where surveillance has been taken to the utmost extremes, and the Edward Snowden revelations happened two weeks after I released it. Life couldn't mirror art any harder. </TEXT>

1: I earned the Most Improved award in basketball in my high school in tenth grade, I believe because going from absolutely zero skill to a miniscule amount of skill was an 'undefined' percentage increase.

2: I'm a lifelong gamer, and I help run a free to play Open Source server for a super old MMO called Meridian 59 as a hobby: http://openmeridian.org/

That's awesome!

  what artists are inspirational to you or what works of art had a large impact on your own style?

Obligatory H.R. Giger. Then there are a range of movies, often indie films, like It Follows. The way they are shot, the images they use, and the feelings they evoke inspire great imagery in my head. I don't see many still pictures, but this recently inspired me: http://www.signalnoise.com/neowave-series </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A few of my favorite artists, namely George Carlin and Robert Smith (of The Cure), made it a point to not listen to other people's material so they could maintain as much of their originality as possible. Do you find it difficult to be both a fan of, and a contributor to, your genre in that regard? I've found that in my own writing (I write comedy) that I sometimes get stuck using someone else's voice if I spend too much time away from my own head.

This is definitely an interesting tension. I can't bring myself to read NoSleep anymore, actually. It's no knock on the current authors, but I've seen the same tropes, wrappers, and plot devices so many thousands of times now that it's really really difficult for me to read random stories, so I stick to just ones that people recommend. I've been posting 'blind' for years. On the same token, stories like Psychosis were written after binge reading a hundred creepypastas on the original site. I think getting a feel for the genre and trends can improve writing and inspire, while accidentally absorbing other voices is a real risk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Last week I had a friend that I had tried to introduce to your work. When he asked about where to start I realized that other than the wiki that /u/red_wolf_2 has been working on there is no comprehensive list readily available for aomeone new to your work.
 To the uninitiated it can be rather intimidating trying to dive in with no direction and he walked away before he even started reading and I fear it may be the case with many others.
 I would guess that word of mouth is a big part of getting new readers here so my question is: How do you, as the author, go about introducing people to your work?

These are some really good points. I've been meaning to create a map or some easier way to understand what's going on. Right now, I link people who ask to the first story (portal in the forest) and if they like it they usually figure it out. I imagine that has a poor retention rate, so I've got to do better :) It's messy having the stories spread all over Reddit, my blog, Amazon, and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Where does your love for science fiction and fantasy stem from?

Absolutely 100% my family. My entire extended family is full of smart characters and great people, but we're all very different. The one thing we could all talk about at family reunions was cool science fiction, and my early home life was dominated by Star Trek the Next Generation, Deep Space Nine, the Twilight Zone, and Doctor Who.

The fantasy half of my interests stemmed from the books I read all the time. Robert Silverberg's Majipoor series, the early Magic the Gathering books about Urza and the Phyrexians, and of course Dragonlance. One of the most poignant moments for me in all my reading might not have been that big a deal for most people, but I'd played the Magic the Gathering set called 'Ice Age' somewhere around fifth grade - and later I read the epic tale of Urza and his brother Mishra as they brought war to their entire world. When it finally ended with a bang (literally, continent sized explosions), the book left off with it starting to snow at an unseasonable time. Suddenly connecting the dots, I realized the terrible cost obsession would have for a character I loved (and his world), and that still leaves me saddened. How about that - I just realized that moment definitely found its way into my subconscious, since I didn't notice until just now the parallels between that and the Winter of the Multiverse just now becoming a serious threat for the Exodus.

 Also, where did you first get the inspiration for what has become your "Multiverse" series?

I actually don't think I can answer this in any fashion without massive squee spoilers. Hmm. Let's just say I've been working on it a very long time, and something big behind it all will become clear in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How much time do you spend writing? In a fairly short amount of time you've written a ton.

I don't track hours anymore, but my goal is 5000 words each weekday. That definitely costs five or six hours a day. This and publishing are what I do full time.

 Also, do you get writers block and if so, how do you deal with it?

I'm not really sure if I get what television shows portray (where an author, usually John Cusack, stalks around his apartment for months in mental agony), but I definitely get a feeling I call *off the rails.* I can write anything at all. Trademarks aside, I could have Superman eat Kryptonite cereal and be totally fine. That doesn't mean it will feel right for Superman to do that. A story is *off the rails* when a character's actions don't feel right, simply aren't interesting, or (worst of all possibilities) their actions miss some great opportunity for an awesome story. This usually happens when I'm tired or drained, which is surprisingly often, because writing is like working out, but with your mind.

When I get off the rails, I talk through the story with someone, usually Jacqueline Miller of [MC2 Studios](http://mc2studio.co/). She's helped me up the professionalism of my brand in many ways, and she personally made the cover art for my last three books. (I think the difference between the greyscale crud I made and her work is insane.) It's funny to talk through stories with someone because there you are wracking your brain in a fog of notions trying to figure out what direction to take, and they're all like "It'd be cool if they went left." And then you're like... wow, yeah, it would. Then you talk through the reasons the characters might go left instead of other directions, and what the consequences might be.

And it's usually as simple as that.

 P.S. You're my favorite author, I've been recommending your stories for years and recently started supporting you on Patreon.

Thanks a ton! This engagement is what keeps me slogging through the early years of becoming an author. I might have quit two or three times at certain points if you guys hadn't all been so awesome :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Thank you for your dedication /u/subject3921

Thank *you* for reading and commenting!

 The average typing speed is around 40 words per minute. So 309,182/40 is 7729.55 minutes. Or 128.83 hours of solid typing.

Oh wow, I wished I wrote 2400 words an hour. Typing speed isn't the bottleneck; rather, it's crafting the narrative. I average almost exactly 500 words an hour with pure science fiction, 1000 with sci fi / horror (like portal in the forest), and 1500-2000 if I'm writing free-form anything-goes stories like many of the ones I put on NoSleep. From what I've heard from other writers, these rates are all very high, and so is my daily goal of 5000 words. That resulted in 98,513 words for January, just short of my 100k stretch goal :/ About 35,000 of those went into the New Exodus Vanguard stories and other assorted horror one-offs. The rest are going into pure science fiction books I'm working on privately at the moment.

Editing and publishing does take significant time, but not as much as it used to. I'd say editing and publishing a book like The Moon Aflame takes one solid night of overtime, since I already put in the work in many ways (templates I've built, proper grammar the first time). And I always re-read stories I post twice, making minor edits and fixing typos in the first 20 minutes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Hurricane Spirits </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-02 23:57:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was on a road trip down to North Carolina with some friends when it happened. Hurricane Joaquin had just cancelled our primary planned event, but we were already halfway there when we got the call, so we decided to go ahead with the trip.

We had about five minutes of glorious mountainside view from the balcony of our lofty rented cabin before the clouds sealed away all sight of the valley below permanently. Protected by the Appalachian Mountains on every side, we didn't get much direct rain, but the sky was the darkest grey I'd ever seen for mid-afternoon in the summerand it never, ever let up. That night, we lit sparklers and joked about the crazy shadows they made.

This high up, the fog right outside our balcony was actually a clawing cloud of Joaquin itself reaching deep inland, and the grey was so thick that the silhouettes of our hands and heads found purchase not even two or three feet out. I should have known something was wrong when I reached out from that high balcony and into that mist to jokingly shake hands with my own shadow; I smiled for the picture, but didn't tell anyone that the chilly darkness there felt eerily like an icy and hollow hand gripping mine in return. I knew there was nothing out there past that sharp drop but vast spilling reaches of sky and cloud not limited until the opposite mountain slope miles distant, and yet

One of my friends lit a fire, and I sat by it, nursing a hand that wouldn't seem to warm up.

One of the girls asked, "Anyone wanna go for a walk? It's beautiful out!"

Two of our five volunteered happily. Hiding my trepidation, I went with them. They hadn't felt it. They would be caught off guard if anything happenednot that anything would. I told myself I was just spooked. It would be fine. That made four of us total; our fifth, the only other guy besides me, chose to remain behind and read by the fire.

The front door let us out into an alien world. We knew there was a long curving row of cabins to the left and right of ours, but we couldn't even see the closest. The sharp slope shot up to a single tall lamppost that guarded the steep driveway with what had become a tangible orange halo in the fog. By that sphere of light, we moved along familiar lawn and stone, still treading on bits of civilization until our flashlights became necessary and the protective beacon of orange light behind faded into misty darkness.

The paved mountain road snaked in both direction and elevation, and we walked down it, searching for the hiking paths the girls had noticed on the drive up. They were only about five minutes' walk down, and we found them quickly. All three girls climbed right over the *Paths Closed* sign, ignoring it, and I was forced to follow.

Down a steep set of stairs, we reached twisting dirt paths among the trees, each and every way forward even steeper than the road had been. Cut off quickly by the fog, our flashlights had the appearance of short blades of light, illuminating almost nothing useful.

Picking our way along in search of a loud roar, we came to a waterfall that wasn't supposed to be there. Fueled by the hurricane's rains, its titanic force had cut a new path down the mountain. Thirty feet wide and incredibly fast, it was finally enough to force the others to turn backat least until one of the girls saw someone waving from a boulder near the other end.

"Hey, it must be safe if they're out there taking a picture," someone suggested.

We pointed our flashlights at the waving silhouette, but the beams fell short by a large margin. Something felt very wrong about this, but I didn't have enough evidence to speak up. Instead, I tested the surging waters with a stick, and watched in surprise as the branch was torn out of my hand and thrown down the steep slope. "Whoah. No way. This is too dangerous."

By then, the others were also starting to feel the surreal *wrongness* of the night. What had been beautiful and strange was now becoming ominous and encroaching. That silhouetted stranger in the distance kept waving at us slowly and methodically, but we turned away with a rising group sense of unease, only to find that the path behind us was gone.

The others froze, confused, but I kneeled close. The dirt path exposed between layers of leaves was still there, just impossible to see from the height of our eyes while standing. This close to the churning waterfall, the fog had become thick enough to obscure the very ground at our feet. 

There was nothing to do but crawl.

Muddy, soggy, unhappy, and feeling strangely watched, we each knelt down and moved on hands and knees to avoid falling over the sheer edges of the snaking path. I knew that several splits were up ahead, and we would have to choose correctly if we wanted to get home safely.

One of the girls gasped in surprise, and we all followed her cue and leaned hard against the rising slope to our left as a runner in a bright green shirt and loose running pants jogged past. I shouted something angry at him, but he ignored me, and vanished into the fog ahead quickly despite his bright shirt. How could anyone be running out in this? How could he even see the path?! Maybe he just lived around here and knew them well enough

A bright green blur appeared ahead at about torso height, and we all prepared to ask him the way back out of the trails. Finally able to see the path under our feet, we stopped crawling and walked up to him. He was facing away and did not respond. I thought he might have headphones in, but I soon saw that was not the case as he turned to look at us.

Actually, I should say that he turned his head to look at usjust his head, further and further, until we audibly heard sickening cracks. Bruised cheeks, empty eyes, and a horrible grin now faced us directly, all opposite the direction of his body, which was still pointed forward.

Some of the girls had begun screaming, but none of us moved until he began runningright at us.

Pushing back down the path at dangerous speeds, we hugged the rising slope to our right and ran as fast as we could away from the nightmarish specter. The fog thickened again as the water's roar grew, and I knew we were in danger of falling, but that bright green spot in the fog surged after us relentlessly. I was afraid of tumbling down and getting seriously hurt, but I was even more afraid of being caught by that backwards-facing runner with his spindly limbs and strange gait. Whatever that thing was, it was one hundred percent *dead*, and that meant

We came up short as we reached the torrential waters and again faced that distant silhouette waving at us from the distance. Behind us, blurry green approached at speed, and I decided there was only way out: up.

Helping the others grab vines and footholds and work their way up, we climbed alongside the thunderous waterfall, barely getting out of reach of the path as that green blur ran past below. It continued on right out across where the waterfall was supposed to have been and vanished into the gloom.

I suggested we go back down, but the others refused. We had no way of knowing if that *thing* was truly gone from the path, and this new waterfall had, with its destruction, carved a very workable path up the slope. Settling in for the unhappiest climb of my life, I picked my way up the mud and rocks and felled trees as best I could. In the rear, I couldn't see the lead climber, let alone where they were taking us, and I yelled my concern as we climbed closer and closer to the deadly rolling waters.

A scream followed, and one of the girls ahead shouted, "If you're back there, *who am I following?*"

There was only mindless screaming and dangerous climbing and leaping after that. Much of those moments are a blur. Maddened by fear, and with nowhere obvious left to go, we desperately clambered across terribly steep mud and jutting trees, somehow finally reaching a path that curved down from out of the fog to our right. Still unable to see more than two or three feet, we crawled the last of the way up, finally reaching those stairs we remembered with the last of our energy. They took us up to the *Paths Closed* sign, and we spilled out onto the road on exhausted limbs, barely catching our breath before frantically trying to figure out what the hell had just happened.

That orange sphere of light burgeoned in the fog ahead, marking our return to safety. We stumbled into our cabin and huddled by the fire, unable to truly explain any of it to our friend that had remained behind. By the fire, and now warm and safe, it was hard to remain frightened. We locked up all the windows, closed the blinds to hide the balcony and the shadows beyond, and hid inside playing board games for the rest of the weekend.

It was only as we were packing to leave and once the hurricane had passed and the clouds had gone that I finally saw the truth of the hills below.  I stepped out onto the balcony for the first time since our experience, bent on seeing the beautiful slope and valley and remembering it that way rather than as the nightmare we'd gone through; it took me several minutes to decipher what I was seeing.

The sharp drop below our balcony led to a wide miles-deep bowl of forest, as I'd remembered from that first glimpse, but it had changed during the hurricane. What had been a forested bowl was now a massive muddy pit; all but traces of the trails had been wiped away, new waterfalls had torn up the landscape in numerous places, and massive boulders had rolled destruction down the slopes until finally shattering far enough below that I grew dizzy just peering at the wreckage.

From the balcony, I could see the path we'd taken in our fear: that narrow trail and the dangerous sliver up which we'd climbed remained the only way out of the destroyed bowl of terrain. Any other path would have led to falls, becoming trapped, or worse. Of the silhouette that had waved at us, or of the stranger we'd somehow followed on the climb, there was no signbut deep down in the darkest tangle of that devastation, I saw a bright green runner's shirt stuck on a branch. It fluttered, caught by the wind, and then, freed, sailed off into the sky above the valley. </TEXT>

---

Such a bad idea. This was *such* a bad idea. I knocked again.

The door swung open, and an air of sadness immediately burned hostile. "What the hell do *you* want?"

"I took it," I told him, shivering as I did so. "I took Remy, and I saw her there."

He watched me for nearly eight heartbeats, judging my sincerity. My purposeful shiver had likely sold the deal. "Alright." He moved out of the way, wordlessly inviting me in. "And no, you can't have any beer."

I sat tall on his couch, tense. "Let's start over. Call me Porter."

He moved unhappily to the chair across from me. "Is that your real name?"

"No. It's important we stay disentangled from the men we might run into, and from each other."

"I see. Then call *me* Guy."

"Just Guy?"

"Just Guy. Now tell me what you claim you saw."

I leaned forward and put my hands on the living room coffee table to draw out unseen concepts with gestures. I explained the lighter details of my search, the heavier details of that horrible experience in the anti-light of the Beast's gaze, and my recollections of his friend Gabby's face among the countless tortured souls within.

"I believe you," Guy said, sighing. "Or I believe you took Remy and dreamt you saw her."

"It was her," I said calmly. "Or else I wouldn't be here."

"Why *are* you here? Forgive me if I don't assume you just care too much."

"Fair point." I turned my head and looked out the window at the chill afternoon street where men walked family dogs and women ran by with headphones on. This was the view; this was always the view. Some long-unexpressed sense of stasis prompted me to finally ask, "Have you ever noticed that it's always fall?"

He rubbed his eyes tiredly. "That's impossible. I remember that it was summer when we" He frowned.

"When you what?" I asked.

He fought off exhaustion and stood. "Wait. We took Remy, didn't we?"

I nodded. "I think we did. So much for all that planning. I can't remember what we talked about now."

"Or what we're supposed to do," he said, moving to the window and studying the shifting houses across the street. "Didn't you have some idea where we should go?"

"I know the direction the Beast is in," I told him, standing and flexing my fingers against the strange dragging inertia of entrance into the dream state. "I can still feel it out there, like it's slightly bending absolutely everything. But going near it would be stupid as hell."

He snapped his fingers. "The drug dealers!"

"Yes!" A bit of the plan flared back into focus. "The creator of the pills must know something. No way whoever it is makes and distributes something like Remy without having a bit of knowledge about all this. Hell, I felt super hopeful just once, and it tipped off that Thing and nearly got meI don't know, *caught.*"

"And why you, Porter?" Guy asked, remembering more himself. "Why don't most of the other users suffer the same way? I've since seen people take it and tool around without a care in the world. It was only you and my friends that stumbled into nightmares."

"Bad trips," I said. "Maybe like other drugs, they're rare and random."

"Maybe." He moved to the door and flung it wide, exposing the afternoon street beyond, where men still walked family dogs and women still ran by with their headphones on. "Where to?"

"I don't actually know." I stepped out into the cold sunlight and tried to get a feel for the constantly changing suburban blocks around me. "The dream world's weird. You just kind of end up finding what you're seeking."

Guy said simply and grimly, "Yeah."

"That way, then." I turned left, and we began walking down the sidewalk together. For a time, it was actually a little awkward. I'd expected immediate adventure, but now we were just two guys on a walk. "So what's this girl to you?" I asked, breaking the silence.

"A good friend," he responded. "Her parents died awhile back. Nobody left to go after her but me."

I grew wary. "You got some sort of hero complex? That kind of thing gets people killed."

"No."

I accepted his answer for the moment, because the sky was bruising amazing shades of orange and purple. It had been night last time I'd taken Remy, and this was wholly unexpected. "Is that the sunset?" Massive flares of painted pleasant neon roiled above, and both of us stared in wonder. My vision slowly fell to a warehouse much closer than the sky. "That's it!"

We opted to walk rather than sneak close, hoping that we would look like random pedestrians if someone saw us. That proved to be unnecessary, for no guards were stationed around the warehouse. It made sense, actuallythe place wasn't even accessible from the real world. Who would they be guarding it from? Hallway after hallway rolled by until I held Guy back from the last corner and peeked around it. "Nobody's home."

That, too, made sense. It would be rather difficult to stay on Remy more than temporarily without overdosing. This time, though, several safes had been set up in the middle of the floor; I knew it was for the cash, and prompted by the stacks I'd taken. Given how strange the dream world was, they hadn't assumed someone had compromised the operation, but they'd taken precautions nonetheless.

Ignoring the pallets of boxes filled with pills, Guy studied some of the papers on a large table near the safes. "They keep changing."

I took one, read it, looked away, and then read it again. "They're not real."

"Then are there any leads here at all?"

I was about to say no, and perhaps suggest waiting for suppliers to make a drop-off, but I already knew that might take days or longer. When I looked up, my eyes caught upon a subtle distortion at the other end of the pallet farm. "What is that?"

We moved closerI stared up at the ceiling as I passed, but saw no evidence of the ventilation system I'd previously used to access the place, or of the grey forms that had cornered me within. Without mentioning it, I turned my attention to the disturbance ahead. Up close, it had the vague wavy outline of a door, albeit one formed of heat shimmers.

Guy's hand went right through it. "This can't just be some random thing we dreamt up."

I tried my hand, too. "How do we access it?"

"We've only got one variable," he said, pulling some dark blue pills out of his pocket. Had I given him those? "Here goes nothing." He downed one without hesitation and then took several deep breaths. His next attempt to reach out succeeded, and he turned the ethereal knob and pushed the door open. Water sloshed out onto the floor, spilled over by the undulating energy of an ocean whose surface ran almost exactly level with the base of the door. The dark blue waters mirrored the open sky, offering nothing but an endless expanse.

We both gazed out for a time, mystified, until he decided to take a leap of faith without consulting me. I almost shouteduntil he landed on something just under the splashing water. Looking closer, we could now see mottled dark blue marble just beneath the surface, forming a nearly invisible walkway out onto the open ocean. "This is it," he said, moving forward. "I know it."

Testing my footing, I stepped carefully onto the walkway. I hadn't taken a second pill, but it seemed I could follow him anyway now that the door had been opened. The threshold felt strange, like a thin membrane stretched across my face and hands until it broke, and some part of me instinctively understood that this was something new. A level deeper? A level higher? The strong sea breezes felt amazing and free.

Those same breezes became the primary threat as we inched our way along the narrow and hard-to-see blue marble. My shoes and ankles were soaked instantly, and the lapping waves upped that chill splash to my knees, especially when the wind strengthened. Looking back often, I watched as the door shrank in the distance, leaving us fully out on the sea. "I'm not so sure about this!"

"I lost Gabby on the ocean," he shouted back. "And this wouldn't be here if they didn't use it!"

That seemed reasonable, but I never had a chance to agree. A particularly strong wave hit me; I fell to the wet blue marble and slipped halfway off. Gripping the other edge of the stone and kicking my legs against the surprisingly powerful current pulling on my legs, I roared for help. Guy came running, but he'd been quite far ahead. I had the space of a dozen rapid heartbeats to truly *feel* the vast darkness of the ocean, cold and endless below my kicking feet. I thought I could sense something approaching, like some horrible creature that might swim up and grasp my legs at any moment. Who knew what might reside in this layer of the dream world, or within the dark depths of those completely unknown waters?

Guy helped lift me up, and I clung to the marble and tried to still my racing pulse. Adrenaline still burned in my veins, so I stayed close as we made our way more carefully along the narrow marble. We sighted a dark line on the horizonand then we were there a tick later, jumping from the abrupt end of the marble onto bright reddish-orange sand the color of a deep sunset. It was there that we first saw evidence that something was seriously lacking in our understanding of the dream world.

A weathered stone face about ten feet high rested at an angle in the firesand, its vacant eyes staring out over the ocean at some unknowable ancient destination. The grey rock was pocked and weathered, and fully real to the touch as far as we could tell; someone had actually carved this eons ago. This was no dream statue.

"Porterit used to point the way," Guy realized. "Look, it's almost facing the underwater marble path."

I lined myself up and judged the perspective. "I think you're right." At that angle, the sun was also in my eyes, which begged a certain question. "Didn't we see sunset earlier? Why is it light here?"

He put a shading hand to his forehead and looked up at the sky, but he found no answer.

We slogged along the firesand beach, slowly finding more evidence of ancient habitation until I began to grow inexplicably weak. I fell to my knees in the sand and sighed with exhaustion.

"You're disappearing!" he said, quickly handing me another pill. "We have no idea where we are. Take this before you end up back in some random place in the real world."

I swallowed it and watched as my translucent hands returned to opaque. "That should be a priority."

"Which?"

"Mapping the overlay of the dream world to the real world," I said, remembering now that we had actually talked about this just before taking the drug. "It might help if we knew which parts of the real world correspond to which parts of the dream world. Skip ahead on future trips."

"You think we won't find her tonight?" he asked, suddenly crestfallen.

Damnit. His obvious pain was actually getting to me, despite my repeated mental warnings that I should keep attachments light. "No, man. This is just our first scouting attempt."

He took that with grim grace and turned away. "I think there's something up ahead."

He was right. A vast stone wall, as ancient as the other remnants but in much better repair, spanned the way ahead of us from beyond the firedunes to deep in the ocean itself. This was definitely something. We both tried to run to it, but found the effort weirdly futile. Walking measuredly up to the wall instead, and seeing no other way over but climbing, we used weathered and pitted handholds to begin our ascent.

I snapped awake in my cubicle and immediately began clicking and typing out of pure habit, something I'd learned to do to avoid being caught sleeping. Already, that dread despair that had surrounded my life in the office began closing in. Seeking any distraction, I turned in my chair. "Guy, have you got the week's reports?"

He turned to look at me in turn, and said, "Yeah, hold on, I'll email them to you."

We both slid back to our monitors and keyboardsand froze.

"I think this is my dream," I said, looking around for familiar nightmarish clues.

"No, I think it's mine," he responded.

I shook my head. "I have nightmares about when I used to work in an office."

He frowned. "I have nightmares about having to go work in an office when I graduate."

"Fair enough." I stood, picked up my monitor, and threw it on the ground. It bounced, unharmed, and returned to the desk. "Damnit!" I tried to leave, but found every exit blocked by smooth grey cubicle fabric.

That grey reminded him of something. "Wait, aren't we climbing a wall somewhere?"

I shook my head roughly, and then scrambled to hold onto stone as I shot up from the depths of some sort of dream bubble our mutual fears had created together. He was already falling past me, and I caught him reflexively. My dream-strength was minor, but it was enough to snap him out of it, and he grabbed the wall just beneath me as he swung hard against it. I grinned down at him. "Try to stay focused."

"You too."

We climbed on.

The top of the wall lay impossibly high in the air, and we gazed down upon a tremendous city of gold and bronze. There were no spires and domes; flat roofs dominated the architecture. I wondered if I could find an opportunity to peel up some of that gold lining from the tan brick buildings. My planning stopped as Guy asked, "Where do you think we are in the real world?"

Somewhere high up, clearly. Were we on a radio tower looking out over the city? Or was this place purely in dreams? He pointed to the distant harbor, where one elaborate wooden vessel stood out among the others, enormous and dark. "That's the boat!"

"Which?"

"The one I lost Gabby on." He began to climb down the other side of the high city wall.

"Whose boat is it?" I asked, following.

I nearly slipped when he said, "Death's," but surely he couldn't have meant the actual concept and Reaper himself. Maybe he was just being overly poetic. 

We reached the street and stepped down into a flow of people that either hadn't noticed or hadn't cared about our climb. I tried to focus on faces, but got nothing more than blurs and vague expressions. We were cramped and crowded, but I couldn't be sure whether we were actually still alone. Their clothing was unlike anything I knew; primary colors were dominant, but only in patches and strips on rugged browns and blacks. "Is this where the pills come from?"

Guy seemed unhappy. "Do they carry the boxes over that wall every time?" He pushed deeper into the maze-like streets, and I knew he was heading for the harbor.

The tan stone alleys would not cooperate. Angled, twisting, and labyrinthine, they always offered easy passage with the swiftly flowing crowd, but they never actually seemed to lead anywhere useful. Guy began moving faster, and I changed my stance to that of a slow run to keep up. A few rapid turns later, I realized that we were both running, not in that open and free sense that dreams made impossible, but in a desperate attempt to keep up with the quickening crowd that pushed and jostled and threatened to trample us should we slow or fall. We both realized we were in serious trouble at the same time.

"We have to get out of this flow," I shouted. "Look for anything that we can climb on!"

But the smooth walls had lost all of their windows, doors, and open shops. Blurry hands began pushing at me, and a choir of distorted voices demanded that I go faster. Pushing to the physical limits of my speed, I ran as fast as I could alongside Guy, even then sensing the crowd's feet nipping at my heels. Swept along, we swiftly approached a sharply angled turn that I guessed we would smash against with force. The narrowing alley had sped up the flow far too much.

In fact, the walls had become so narrow

I shouted my idea, and we both attempted the leap at the very last moment. Throwing out my hands and feet, I managed to put pressure against both tan walls. Guy followed, slipped, and nearly fell, but caught himself at the last moment.

We hung there, a rushing stream of heads passing by mere inches beneath, until we found good angles and began pushing our way higher. As we inched up the alley, the walls seemed to grow higher and the ground stretched away, leaving us dangerously exposed to a fall. Neither of us had breath to talk, so we just kept at it until we came to the gold-lined edges of the flat roofs themselves.

"Ah, shit."

"What now?" Guy asked.

With my hands pushed flat against one wall and my shoes pressed hard against another, it didn't seem like there was any way to actually grab the edge of the roof and climb on. Tiring, we remained there, a mile fall to the forcefully flowing crowd awaiting us. I held out a hand a few times, but could feel the drop nearly happening.

"I have an idea," Guy said through grit teeth. "You hold on tight and I'll climb on top of you to get to the roof, then pull you up."

"How about *I* climb on top of *you?*" I offered, almost out of strength.

"Fine. Just hurry."

He shakily moved his hands down one at a time, and then followed with his feet, leaving him just short of the top. I put a hand out to my left, applied pressure, then moved my other hand, sliding above him inch by inch. "Ready?"

He just grunted.

I let off the pressure on my feet and instead put my weight on him. He began sliding away under me, and I grabbed the edge of the roof as quickly as I could; he fell, and a terrible jerk pulled my legs straight down as he hung from my ankles. With both of our weights on the tips of my fingers, I shouted, "Go!"

He pulled at my jeans and shirt to climb up, and I did my best to block out the strain and hurt. Finally, he found the edge of the roof himself, slid over my head, and turned to pull me up and onto warm gold.

We were safe.

"That was close to the worst thing ever," I groaned, gazing up in pain at the dimming sky.

"Trust me," he replied. "There's worse ahead."

I believed him. Staggering along the rooftops until we'd both recovered, we approached the harbor from a high angle. Out of the threat of the alleys, we could now see bustling trade being undertaken by blurry-faced natives. Strangely, the faces of those men disembarking from the ships to deliver wares were clear and recognizable. I knew we'd found something important when I started noticing normal clothing among the lotand then one man passed by with a familiar box in his arms. "That's it! He's got Remy!"

Guy watched with narrowed eyes, clearly angry at whoever was responsible for the drug. Staying low, he crept along the gold-lined edge, following the deliveryman without being detected. We found ourselves on top of a massive stone warehouse by the docks as the sun truly began to set for the second time.

Our quarry exited the warehouse empty-handed after a moment and headed for the docks.

"Figure out which boat he's unloading," I whispered, heading to a curious stone ventilation access. Leaning into it, I saw carved handholds allowing entrance; climbing down, I began feeling a wave of nausea and exhaustion. Clinging to the lowest handhold, I peered into the vast dockside warehouse while my vision began doubling. I needed to take another Remy, but I also needed both my hands to stay on my perch.

A pitch black silhouette stood by the piled boxes of Remy. It turned its head slowly my way, and I found myself paralyzed by strange dark blue static. Ruby points of light began sliding around the curve of that silhouette, some sort of horrible eyes about to see mebut the paralysis got to me first. Finally in free-fall like I'd dreaded that entire climb in the alleys, I crashed down through branch after branch until finally hitting soft mossy ground with a painful thud.

It was cold. That much I sensed first, even with the wind knocked out of me. Crawling up, I saw that I was in a heavily forested area, and that it was the middle of the night. That city of bronze and gold had not had an analogue in the real world, and I'd accidentally left my companion

A crashing sound somewhere close by in the trees signaled that he had followed. Crawling over to his gasping and pained form, the thought of that terrible silhouette with the ruby eyes still chilling my heart, I groaned, "We need a better plan." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "That's not thunder!" Neil shouted, trying to simultaneously protect Kumari from the driving rain, grip Edgar as they rode, and peer ahead through the grey torrents.

"No," Edgar said back, the word muffled by his helmet. His next words were louder. "Somebody's fighting!"

The distant haze lit with purple, then with whitethen orange. Each glare came wide and momentary, passing with aloof but menacing threat.

Edgar pulled the bike to a sudden halt.

Neil stared up at what appeared to be streetlights for a four-way intersection bobbing in the wind and rain. The only issue: there were no streets. The bleak plain continued unabated beneath the high poles that supported the lights, and these barrens were dozens of realities distant from civilization besides. The lamp above and before them shone red. "What the hell is this?"

Edgar shook his head. "I have no idea."

"Then why are we waiting?!"

"It's about respect."

"What the hell does that mean?"

"If it's some sort of illusionary trap, it could have just put a wall in our way. It didn't. Instead, it used familiar imagery to *ask* us to stop without taking away the choice."

Neil held Kumari close, his eyes on the distant rotating colors of thunder and war. "You sure?"

Edgar nodded. "It's like Cristina Thompson says in the stories. What's out here didn't evolve to hunt or kill us. We're visitors, and nothing more."

The light turned green.

Neil held on tightly against the bike's acceleration, his eyes warily scanning the nearby environment. Whatever had made the streetlights did not show itself, and those green, yellow, and red auras faded into the grey rain behind as the distant explosions on the unseen horizon grew heavier. The odd encounter had passed without event, but the three of them were far from safe.

The bike rumbled as the ground darkened. Empty dirt had become biotechnological growth, and Edgar slowed somewhat to keep the wheels steady on uneven metallic roots. Small yellow lights among the twisting coils showed the way, until the nearby thunder began growing ominously loud and they were forced to change strategies. Coming to a halt, Edgar removed his helmet and pointed through the eerie yellow-tinted fog and rain. "There! See that canyon?"

Neil understood. Holding his daughter in one arm, he grabbed whatever else he could and ran across the uneven biomechanical ground in pursuit of cover. Edgar slipped down gold-glowing waterfalls ahead of him, carefully testing out a safe route down the flooding techno-root sprawl with his boots. A purple flash lit the nearby fog, and Neil steeled himself: there was no time to delay. Gripping Kumari tight with his arms, he gave himself momentum and bumped and skidded straight down to the muddy canyon floor. A rock jutted up at the last moment, threatening to impact his leg in the worst way possible, but Edgar grabbed his arm and applied force to steer him aside.

They were both up and running a moment later, splashing along the new river between the high canyon walls in search of deeper protection. A natural cove offered that sought haven, and they crawled up on top of a boulder to escape the icy waters. A partial dome kept the rain back, allowing them to warm up somewhat as they began catching their breath.

The earth trembled as the fighting above grew dangerously near. Neil cradled his daughter protectively, but she just smiled and poked at his face. She didn't seem to be aware that anything was wrong, and the wrapped blankets had kept her from getting wet or cold. The light show outside only made her giggle.

"She's a trooper," Edgar commented.

"Like her mother"

"We'll find her."

Neil smiled weakly down at his daughter. "Yeah."

The boulder underneath them shook as one of the distant impacts hit much harder than the others without warning. Dust sifted down from the low dome of rock overhead, and both men looked up in concernbut the formation was strong and the angle shallow. It would hold.

As the nearby battle ebbed and rose at random, Neil looked to his new companion. "We're on the edge here, aren't we?" He thought about how close he had come to cutting off his arm just to feed his daughter. "Humanity, I mean."

Leaning haggard against stone, his gaze on the curtain of rain at the limits of their hideout, Edgar said nothing for a long moment. Neil actually began to think the man hadn't heard him over the booming until he finally spoke and broke the embattled silence. "Yeah."

Neil looked up at the light show and spoke of the Grey Riders out there in the rain somewhere. "At least somebody's fighting for us."

Edgar's expression darkened.

"Aren't they?" he asked. "Wait, you said you knew something about them, didn't you?"

The other man finally looked at him. "You really wanna know? The Grey Riders have taken extreme care to hide their identities and motives. I think knowing what they're about would put you and Kumari in danger."

"Oh." Realizing that he wasn't a soldier of any sort and had a much greater responsibility, Neil shook his head. "Then don't tell me."


"We'll find her."

"What?" He looked up, but Edgar was still sitting in the same place, now with an alarmed expression.

Edgar's voice came from out in the rain a second time. "She's a trooper!"

Neil half-stood and peered into the grey. "What the hell is that?"

"Mimics," Edgar said quietly, also on his feet. "Don't listen to anything they say, and *don't* let them near you. They will literally eat you."

They both watched in horror as spectral humanoid silhouettes began slipping through the curtain of water and clambering onto the rocks below their boulder. The newcomers seemed like mocking shadows of their own situation; gaunt, spindly, and slow-moving, they looked every bit the starving refugee Neil knew himself to be. He shuddered as otherworldly glowing eyes began turning to regard him from belowin each face, one orb dark blue and one orb a strange purple that was painful to behold.

"When they're all coming up the rocks after us, we jump and run," Edgar whispered, gripping his arm.

A nearby impact sent shivers through the rocks again. Neil hesitated as he saw that most of the starving shadows were much smaller than the main large one. More than that, they were not climbing up as his companion had feared. On a strange hunch, he slipped a hand back into his pack, grabbed a large handful of wormy earth, and threw it down to the spectral family.

They ate the worms ravenouslythen regarded him again.

He threw two more handfuls. It was all he dared spare.

"We'll find her," the large one said, in Edgar's voice.

Neither group moved.

After several tense minutes, Neil slowly sat down. Edgar did the same while sharing concerned glances.

The spectral family turned their glowing eyes away and sat together among the low rocks; the cold water rushing through the little cove apparently didn't bother them, or they were remaining below out of respect. Without communication, there was no way to know.

Neil stayed quiet, aiming to do nothing that might disturb their unspoken truce, and he was thankful that Kumari was smiley and happy. How would such entities react to a baby crying?

Edgar kept his gaze on their ethereal visitors throughout the entire unseen battle, his expression more concerned than angry. Neil wondered if it had something to do with the realization that far more types of life had been uprooted and scattered than just humans; that knowledge seemed to stick to the bottom of his stomach like horrible clinging ice. Existence was tough on everyone these days.

When the awesome display of light and sound began to fade, Edgar gave a silent suggestion with a tilt of his head, and Neil carefully wrapped up Kumari's bundle and climbed down the other side of the boulder after him. Immediately chilled all over again by the waist-high water and constant drizzle, he kept his arms up and waded out of the cove. He looked back once to see an array of purple and blue eyes watching them from the shadows they had left behind. He knew they weren't human, but he still attributed to those glowing gazes a certain kind of hopeful goodbye from a fellow family.

Now that the rain had slowed to a drizzle, the climb up the techno-tangle at the end of the canyon was easier, and Edgar moved rather fast. He was over the top and shouting before Neil had even reached the last quarter of the ascent, for the yellow-lit chrome footing was still too slippery for him to catch up. The fistfight was over by the time he caught sight of the combatants.

Another bike sat by the one they'd abandoned; a tube ran between their gas caps, and a rough-shaven blonde man in a grey uniform lay sprawled in the mud. That signature black helmet was nowhere to be seen. Neil stared, realizing he'd just taken for granted the fact that the anonymous fighters were human. It was a relief to find out he'd been correct.

"They only give us enough fuel for the mission, so there's no chance of defection," the loser of the fight explained with a gasp. "The man in charge is paranoid as hell. Thought of everything."

"That sounds right," Edgar said grimly, his hand still clenched around a newly stolen gun as he held it pointed down at the man he'd taken by surprise. "And you saw our fuel as your ticket out of the war."

"Yeah, more or less." He pushed to his feet while keeping his hands in the air. His eyes jumped to the newcomer and the bundle in his arms that was obviously a baby. "Oh shit, sorry. There was nobody around. I just figured"

"I know what you figured," Edgar countered.

But Neil cut in. "What's your name?"

The defector looked between them for a beat, and then said, "Grayson." Now that he was standing, he was surprisingly tall, but too lanky to hold an intimidating presence. His rain-slicked blonde hair was slightly thinning, too, completely undermining any sense of threat about him.

"Do you care where you're going?" Neil asked.

"No. Just as long as it's away from those crazy martyrs."

Neil turned to his companion. "We can use all the help we can get, right?"

Edgar backed off. "I'm keeping the gun. And we'll only put little bits of fuel in your bike at a time."

Grayson lowered his hands with a sigh of released tension. "Fine by me. Let's just get the hell out of here."

Edgar raised his gun again. "First tell us what the Grey Riders are after." 

At seeing the gun brandished, Neil turned Kumari behind his own body and shouted, "What are you doing?!"

"No." Grayson stood in place, concerned but determined. "That's my only bargaining chip. I'll tell you when we reach a place of safety."

"Safety's not a thing anymore."

"You know what I mean."

Edgar glared for a tick, but then lowered his new weapon. "Fine."

An orange flare in the distance preceded thunder, and the three men made their preparations and exchanges as quickly as possible. Neil remained on the back of Edgar's bike with his baby while Grayson rode behind. A rift came and went, and they were finally out of the rain, but it was not warmer. Each rift brought a deepening chill.

"Are we going the wrong way?" Neil asked.

Edgar turned his helmeted head and shouted, "A little bit of backtracking. I know the region, and we're headed to the one place I'm certain civilization remains."

Riding and camping alternated in Neil's blurring awareness, and they neared that place just as the gas ran outfor both bikes. Walking for the remaining chill daylight, they camped in a thick grove of trees that already held signs of previous passersby. A fire pit had been dug and kindling had been laid out for whosoever might follow.

Grayson watched that kindling with a distant stare as Neil tried to start a fire.

"Here," Edgar said, pulling out some small tools and igniting the wood with ease.

With Kumari cradled close, Neil scooted closer to the fire. "Been out here awhile, I see."

"More than you know. I was Vanguard."

Neil raised his eyebrows in surprise, now making sense of the ragged uniform his companion wore. He'd heard of that mission, but, beyond the initial first week of injuries and immediate retreats, none of the Vanguard had returned. There was one other reason for his surprise. "Was?"

"It was a lie," Edgar said, sitting with a sigh. "Or maybe a conspiracy hidden under orders given in good faith. We were sent out to start new pockets of population without you."

"What were *we* supposed to do?" Neil asked, rocking his daughter gently to help her sleep.

Grayson finally snapped out of his trance. "Die."

"That can't be true."

Edgar nodded sadly.

Grayson put his hands closer to the small flames. "It seems to be the ongoing conceit of the First World Empire, or perhaps of humanity itself. They abuse the best and the brightest for their own ends, and the rest of us are left to fend for ourselves."

"No," Edgar countered. "They just didn't have the resources to save three hundred and fifty billion people."

"You sure of that?"

"Yes."

"Fair enough." Grayson took a blanket roll from the back of his bike and plopped down a good fifteen feet away.

Neil watched him for a time, concerned. "What's he talking about? With the First World's abuse, I mean."

You have to remember who these people were, Edgar said, poking the fire intently. The resulting flare lit eyes already afire with the weight of history. These were humanitys best, brightest, and most selfless. They went to the Amber Worlds in service knowing they would never return.

But that was a thousand years ago or something, wasn't it? Neil replied, shifting his position as his arm grew tired under his tiny infant daughter. Does that all still matter after so long?

I hope so, Edgar said softly. I don't know about Grayson, but we captured a Grey Rider briefly. She turned out to be a teenage girl.

Neil stared, aghast. What, like a child soldier?

No. We let her go, and she rode right back into hell itself. Theyre volunteers. Edgar lowered his voice. "Grayson doesn't seem to fit the other things I've learned about them. I don't like it."

They sat in silence for a time, pondering ideas and pains that each held very heavy weights.

Neil spoke up and said, "Wait, wouldn't he be different because he's defecting? We wouldn't have run into him otherwise."

Edgar nodded. Self-selection, I suppose. But the question we keep asking ourselves is: why do the Grey Riders fight? We *should* be asking ourselves: why dont we already know the answer? And the first half of that answer involves the extreme lengths theyve gone to hide their motivations from us. His eyes finally left the fire and settled on Kumari. I have a strong suspicion its for us.

How so?

Have Her Glorys forces flown past and left you alone?

Neil shivered as a course of fear ran through him. Yeah.

Thats it, I think. Maybe their reason for fighting is so dark, so crucial, that we would *have* to join them if we knew. Or maybe theyve scrubbed all links to us so that the billions of refugees walking across these worlds on foot remain innocent third parties. In either case, I dont think they expect to win.

You mean theyre fighting a losing battle?

Edgar nodded, and his eyes returned to the fire. In the face of her power, we are nothing. The Grey Riders themselves can only delay her as long as her innate mercy keeps her in check. Yet, still, the level of their warfare must escalate, bit by bit, for that is the nature of war.

"Crazy martyrs," Neil said, echoing their new companion's earlier sentiment.

"Yeah." Edgar glowered at some unseen foe. "And I think someone is using that innate heroism against them. They're being playedwe all are."

"What does *that* mean?"

Shaking his head, the ex-Vanguard soldier turned away and moved to sleep.

There was nothing else to say; the conversation had bordered on information that would endanger Kumari. Neil sat in the chill night and scanned the spaces between the trees, keeping brooding watch over his daughter and his companions until it was time for someone else's shift. Sleep came uneasily.

The next morning their long walk took them onto a snowy plain filled with strange sculptures. Kumari cooed at all the odd snowmen until Neil realized, with a pang of revulsion, that they were walking among frozen corpses. Something terrible had happened here between men andsomething elseand the casualties had never been cleaned up. The field extended as far as he could see, and the jumble of clawing and screaming dead spanned horizon to horizon without end. "Christ, what happened here?"

"Struggles," Edgar said with solemn respect. "But they're over now. We'll find the survivors underground."

Picking his way carefully between the icy statues of death, Neil stared at one human face masked by rime. As he passed, the eyes jumped to fixate on him. "That one's alive!"

Edgar and Grayson turned, but the frozen corpse took no further action.

Somewhere in the distance, a single crunching footstep resounded.

"I've seen enough out here to simply believe you," Edgar said with quiet alarm. "Let's go!"

Dashing through the field of corpse-statues, they hurried down a tunnel Edgar seemed to have previous knowledge of. Heading deep into the earth, Neil repeatedly told himself that his companion was trustworthyeven though he'd seen the man leap up from death and start wildly eating worms. The only positive sign about this venture was the increasing warmth, a sensation for which he was enormously thankful.

He grinned as he finally saw another human being guarding some deeper entrance, but his heart leapt into his throat as he sighted the *other* guard: a four-legged insect the height of a man, with protruding blade-like arms

"Relax," Edgar whispered. "The Zkirax are our allies. Out here, perhaps the only ones."

He heard the words, sure, but being instinctively alright with such an imposing alien presence was a more difficult matter. Kumari began to cry as it leaned its mandibles close and chittered, and Neil moved on with a sheepish expression of apology. Could the insect even understand his body language? He hurried on past, matched by Grayson, who trembled with unspoken revulsion.

The underground situation became clearer as the tunnels opened up into a massive chamber lit by glowing orange moss and filled with little wooden booths that now served as refugee shelters. A flood of people and tall insects streamed by in both directions, and he couldn't help but smile, because this meant survival. At least for the time being, he and Kumari would be alright. He rocked her back and forth a little bit and pointed out bright banners being woven by a cadre of old women. Kumari stopped crying and tried to grab at the distant colors.

Edgar caught up to them. "I got us a spot. Row seven, fifth booth."

"Here?" Grayson asked, eyeing the crowd warily.

"No. Four chambers down."

That was unwelcome news for reasons he couldn't quite articulate. Neil followed his new friend deeper and deeper into the maze of tunnels, trying desperately to understand the colored marking and numbering system the Zkirax had set up for those without pheromone guidance. For some reason, green and red were switched: green meant *stop* or *dangerous*, while red meant *human-friendly area.* Did their insectoid eyes see colors differently? Fortunately, the river-like flow of bodies was constant and enormous, dragging them ever deeper along the proper paths. The sheer number of people here was staggering, and the echoing noise in the tunnels came and went with often thunderous force.

It was then that they passed through the first of the Lost Tunnels. The location was central, such that travel anywhere within this region of the tunnels usually passed through it. Neil's heart sank as he saw the walls. Pictures had been plastered layer upon layer; pictures of faces, of families, of people, all lost and being sought by someone. Notes had been scrawled upon many, featuring rows, booth numbers, and chamber levels, but an equal number had simply been posted in hope or remembrance.

On either side of him, Edgar and Grayson also stopped. The three men took in the sight with silent struck awe. This was not the only Lost Tunnel, and this one alone stretched into moss-lit orange haze miles distant.

It is uncertain how long the photos stretched on that particular day, but later counts of the eight mile distance found it to be about a hundred and twenty thousand average photos in width and about thirty average photos in height, thus containing about three point six million photos per layer; at three layers deep, that meant the primary Lost Tunnel through which the three men passed eventually held about eleven million posted imagesper side.

"Got a picture of Rani?" Edgar asked, his voice cracking.

"Just the one," Neil responded, fighting back a horrible welling feeling of hopelessness. "I think I'll keep it in case I need to show it to people." He didn't say *because it would just get lost among the others up there,* but both his companions knew. Out in the wilds, it had been easy to forget the sheer scope of the Devastation and the Exodus it had forced upon the human race. Here, faced with it again, Neil found himself struggling to breathe against a very personal Crushing Fist around his heart. The endless images on those walls made it feel like he would never find Rani again.

They descended deeper and deeper into the warm caverns until they finally found their booth and settled in among their new neighbors in stunned silence.

"This'll be our temporary base of operations," Edgar said, after fighting off that dark feeling. "I have to figure out what happened to my squad and rejoin them. Grayson."

The lanky man blinked away some hidden pain and said, "Yeah?"

"Are you taking off, or are you sticking with us?"

He scanned the massive cavern and its chaotic sea of people. "It just hit me that I don't really have anywhere to go."

"Nobody does," Edgar agreed. "You wanna tell us what you promised now?"

Grayson frowned bitterly. "I'm sorry. I don't know anything. They compartmentalized all information."

"I thought that might be the case." Unfazed, Edgar slipped off into the crowd with a final shout. "I'll be back."

Neil sat Kumari down on his blanket and remained next to her as old women came by, cooed over the little girl, and donated bits of food and sewn clothing. He thanked them all, each and every one, wondering the whole time at the natural bond of humanity. How was it that these people had so little and yet made it their business to help strangers? He had a few worms left in his pack, but the Zkirax-made fungus gruel was, somehow, a better alternative.

The ongoing stream of people never seemed to end. Refugees moved about, looking for lost family members. Scarce doctors came and went at a rapid pace. Different Zkirax fore-insects stopped by to request volunteer workers in the crude sign language that had been developed to facilitate communication. By the end of the first four hours, Neil found the noise, dirtiness, and despair nearly overwhelming. "How are you so calm?"

"Calm?" Grayson asked, looking back at him with a haggard expression. "This is a nightmare. I had *no idea.*"

"What do you mean?" Neil sharpened his gaze. "I think it's time you told me something about yourself."

"I'm not a good man." His gaze traveled to a wounded child that had just been brought into the booth across from theirs. The boy was bleeding profusely, and, despite the commotion, no doctors were forthcoming. Standing slowly, Grayson floated over to him and kneeled. His crying mother asked if he was a doctor, and then ignored him when he replied in the negative. But, stricken by so much despair in so short a time, the lanky man seemed compelled to speak. "It's going to be alright."

The pale-faced boy and his mother both looked up at him. The woman demanded, "How do *you* know? I don't want to hear any more preacher bullshit from you people." 

"No," Grayson told her. He repeated, "It *will* be alright. I know."

"*Right.*"

"I'm serious," he said quietly. "This'll all be over soon. Can you just make it seven more months?"

The wounded boy asked weakly, "What's in seven months?"

Neil watched, mystified, as Grayson gripped the boy's arm and said, "That's when this ends, and we all get to go back home."

"You can't possibly know that," the mother said, her anger rising. "Stop filling his head with nonsense!" She looked down at his grimy uniform, noticing for the first time that it was almost entirely grey. Horrified, she rose to her feet and began to point at him as her mouth gaped open for a coming scream.

Grayson put up both hands. "We're here to help. We're *from the future.*"

Neil warily pulled Kumari into his lap.

Instead of screaming, she asked, "The Grey Riders?"

Grayson nodded.

Stunned, the woman fell back to her knees. "Seven months?"

"Seven months." Grayson looked down at the boy, who now bore a determined expression.

"What else?" his mother asked. "What's it like?"

"The future?"

She nodded hopefully.

"We go back, and they've solved the cold and the food problems. It's a tough year, but we get through it." Grayson looked down at his hands, thinking. "Andyeah, and since so many people died, there's more than enough to go around. Everyone gets their own house, free, and everyone gets to do whatever they like for a job. Going through all this united us, and we start finally taking care of people. There's no crime, because the food systems and housing take care of that. Money is just a horrible joke that assholes made to control people, and we just threw that whole thing out the window. I actually wasn't sure what to do with myself. One time, I went up to a hill, and I sat watching a valley for an entire day. I didn't have to fight for my life or go hungry or walk anywhere. It's good there. It's nice."

Another voice cut in. "What else?"

Neil and Grayson both looked up to find that the ongoing chaos in the cavern had completely stopped. Hundreds of people stood circled around watching in awe and silence. Tears ran down many cheeks. Even the children stood listening intently, as if this was the most important bedtime story ever told.

"What else?" a gaunt man at the front asked again, holding his children tight to his knees.

Grayson stood and looked around in rapid circles until he realized that the entire cavern's thousands of denizens were watching him with hope and need for all that he had said. "I, uh, can't say."

Dark expressions of disappointment rose up all around.

"Because of the timeline," he said quickly. "Knowledge from the future could ruin everything."

Another watcher said, "That's why they hide who they are?"

"Yeah," Grayson agreed, even as several men moving with intent slid through the crowd and grabbed him. He called over, "Best come along, Neil!" as encircled humanity swarmed forward in the hopes of hearing more.

Confused and slightly awed by what he had heard, Neil fought through the press and carried Kumari after the men who were escorting his companion away. The paths led up, and the guards refused to explain beyond, "He's been summoned." Several men stayed back to prevent the crowd from following.  

The trip through the maze took them to the second level from the surface, where a small tunnel marked in green led back to a cramped series of chambers that had been recently set up for offices. A male secretary quickly stood from behind makeshift crates that someone had carefully stacked into the shape of a desk. He proceeded to whisper with the guards before peering over at Grayson and Neil. His eyes lingered in surprise on Kumari, but he soon shrugged. "Come on back."

Dozens of men and women talked over one another in the rooms beyond, each person attached to radios or piles of scrounged papers of myriad sorts. Just how hard was it to manage billions of people? Neil overheard someone say, "Zkirax food supplies exhausted in three months," and his heart skipped a beatbut he told himself he'd heard that out of context. It could have meant anything.

At last, they were led down a spiral-carved tunnel through which the previous hectic sounds did not reach, and they emerged into a wide but low chamber that housed a genuine wooden desk. That alone was impressive and strange, but the enormous man who sat behind it was even more awe-inducing. Above a heavy beard and strong jaw, calculating eyes watched and evaluated them. "I apologize for the lack of chairs. We need all the wood we can get for refugee booths. You'll have to stand."

And stand they did. Grayson looked to Neil with trepidation, and Neil returned that awkward glance. They'd been noticed and summoned almost immediately.

Their host waved away the guards. Once they were alone, he said, "Despite appearances, this haven is in no way chaotic. The guards noted that you showed up in a Grey Rider uniform, and I decided to have you watched. That decision has proven fortuitous. My men say you claim to be from the futurethat *all* the Grey Riders are from the future." His tone left no room for misunderstanding: "Explain."

Grayson ran a worried hand down his stubbled face, visibly considering what to say. 

Before he could speak, a shout came from further down the spiral tunnel, and Edgar stormed into the chamber with a guard and the secretary from the front both chasing close behind. "Why have my friends" He came up short when he saw the man behind the desk. "Holy shit."

From the way their massive host roughly knocked back his chair and stood in one abrupt motion, Neil guessed that he was not accustomed to being surprised. Black flashed across the man's eyes, shadowing them completely, and he uttered with no small wonder: "*You!*" </TEXT>

I grew up reading fantasy just as much as science fiction, and this is something I still joke about to this day. I tell people about Robert Silverberg's Majipoor series, which was this awesome fantasy / sci fi fusion set on this big planet where they - uh, drank gray wine in three places, had delicious sweets on this one trip around the world for some reason, there were these really heavy meats with bread rolls, killed and ate some sea monster, and - some sort of political conflict happened later </TEXT>

Fantastic link. Gives me something to shoot for :) Also, I've read many of those, and I can't seem to reconcile those massive word counts to the actual sum of events in the books. I think it's mainly because my own writing style (likely from starting out from NoSleep/CreepyPasta) is so crazily concise and rapidthe entire Crushing Fist saga happened in 200k words, for example, yet The Fellowship of the Ring is 187k words and I only remember 2-3 major events from that book. That, and massive amounts of fantasy descriptions of locations, food, wine, fancy clothing, traveling... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I maintain that the Vanguard chapter on Her Glory is one of the most hauntingly beautiful things you've written thus far, and maybe you wouldn't have been able to bring the multiverse story there if The Crushing Fist weren't removed from nosleep.

I'm glad to hear that, since that is actually my favorite story I've written in my horror/scifi fusion works. There's a 27 foot long timeline scroll in my basement that I drew out for Portal in the Forest, and we started a little over halfway along that timeline with Cristina Thompson's mysterious arrival in a neighborhood in Richmond, Virginia.

It was supremely exciting to find a way to slip back to the early days and glimpse the 'past' as we know it (all the way over on the left of the paper!) and I've really been hoping to find some more angles to revisit that era. They had their own threats, political dealings (back when the Gemstone Hegemony was friendly! and the Plant God was just a baby pinecone), and reasons for living and fighting on. 

Seeing it all now, I do suppose it was inevitable I'd end up writing outside of NoSleep. I thought I could hint at all these things in their strict format, but it just hasn't proven possible. At times, I wonder how many repetitions of the same basic stories one subreddit can support, but then I realize that readers come and go.

Readers may get really into NoSleep for a year or two and then lose interest, only to be replaced by more people that have never seen the formula. So, really, NoSleep has found the same comfortable 'repost groove' that Reddit's format encourages in almost every subreddit. I imagine I'm somewhat of a wrench in that well-oiled machine, since I'm by nature a boundary-pusher. It seems I've directly led to rules changes more than once.

 And if it ever weighs on you, have a laugh and play nosleep mad libs. "I worked at [Walmart] for [193,767,149 microfortnights], but what I saw this man's [pompadour] do to my [bichon frise] chills me to my [conspicuous lack of knees]! (Part 236) (NSFW)"

Oh, jeez, this strikes home. I've started putting the title I *want* in the blog/Facebook post (like The Beast's Realm) and titling the NoSleep story what it needs to be to match other top submissions. It's kinda painfully ironic that my story was removed for some sort of reported title that I didn't even want, but eh, I'm over it. They've got their job and I've got mine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, since so many people are interested, I'll definitely continue this one. We might end up with 3 stories on Wednesday - this part 2, humanity revived part 2, and a NoSleep post. Busy weekend for me!

 Any chance it can be (or is intended) to be stitched into the wider Multiverse series or is it intended to be more stand-alone?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Consider this a confession of sorts; knowing what I now know, it seems only prudent to unburden my soul. At the same time, I want you to disbelieve me. Every single stranger who initiates a conversation with you wants something, and you should always trybefore its too lateto determine what it is theyre trying to talk out of you. Some are bad at it, and you can tell theyre asking for money or a favor before they even finish a full sentence.

I am not bad at it.

In fact, being not bad at it is how I ended up in the home of a young man who I'd guessed was about to be caught up in a storm. Ill tell you this: anyone can get a private investigators license. Never let a stranger into your home. No matter what we say, we are not there to help you.

Without asking permission, I moseyed over to the fridge, opened it, and pulled out a beer. You mind?

He was uncomfortable with my boundary-pushing, but Id toed the line perfectly. He shrugged awkwardly. Sure.

If they give a foot, take thirteen inches. I grabbed a second beer and showed it to him. I always drink two. One for me, and one for my buddy.

He frowned, visibly on the verge of telling me to put them back. Your buddy?

Yeah, I said, sitting down in the large comfortable chair opposite him. Killed in action.

Oh. He hesitated, his annoyance losing its momentum. You served?

Its a good idea to have at least two units tours of duty memorized: one recent, and one not so recent. That way, you can tailor your response against the age of your audience, because getting caught in a lie about the military can get you physically beaten. Since he was younger, I told him the not-so-recent one, and he nodded awkwardly. Not giving him time to dwell on it, I cracked open the first beer, took a gulp, and then said, So what were you high on when you jumped from that roof?

He tensed. Nothing.

Relax, I said with a grin. I took another sip of beer to remind him without words that I wasn't a cop. Im not going to bust you. Im just trying to get the whole story.

Fine, he offered, just before going big with his lie. We were on crack, and we just jumped off the roof because were stupid.

Now this was unexpected. He was still trying to hide something, but that something was very different than Id been guessing. Thats not what your friend Kurt said.

His expression sharpened. Who did you say youre investigating for?

Gabrielas parents, I said confidently, even though I was immediately aware Id completely whiffed. Citing the parents of a kid her age was usually a good bet, but, every so often, it turned out there was a sob story or a tragic loss that completely screwed you over.

He stood, extremely angry. I think you should go.

I knew when to call it and run, but something about this whole situation galvanized me to push it one bit further. Just tell me the name of the dealer that sold you Remy, and youll never see me again.

His face turned bright red with fury.

Ah, shit. Another strike. One more, and Id be in a big hurt. What Hail Mary could I throw here?  Gabrielas not the only one thats been hurt. Ive been paid a lot of money to make sure Remy goes away.

He relaxed ever so slightly after taking in my words.

Whew. Itd been fifty-fifty on that lie, at *best*.

As I left, I chugged the open beer in his yard and threw it in the bushes. The second I stashed under the passenger seat of my beat-up piece of shit car for later. I hadnt even really wanted them; I just hadnt been able to resist an opportunity to take something so unabashedly. In any case, Id succeeded, and come away with a name.

About six hours later, I donned a hipster t-shirt, mussed up my hair a little, and approached the guy in question. Like me, he was thirty years old and out of place at a party filled with college kids. Like me, he was there for a purpose, and floated outside the drama. Unlike me, he was unaware that his new drug had caused a debacle and been noticed by the police after one of the three kids had squealed. The police were far too open about details on their radio channelsespecially when it came to strange casesand, weighted down by bureaucracy, they were slow. I was not.

Hey, whaddya got? I asked the dealer, pretending to be younger than I was.

He studied me with bloodshot eyes, but the party was dark, and I could pass for twenty-five on a good day. Depends on what *you* got.

Because a hundred dollar bill would have been suspicious, I held up two crumpled twenties, three fives, and thirty random one-dollar bills.

The dealer suppressed an eye roll and put on a casual smile that even I had trouble detecting as fake. Alright, dude. I got something for you. Its new. He held out his hand and showed me a little bag filled with circular dark blue pills.

What the hell is this? I asked, fishing for more information as I turned the bag over in my hand.

Remy, he said quietly, taking one and swallowing it in front of me. Its perfectly safe, and an awesome trip. Guarantee youve never experienced anything like it. Puts you into REM dreaming while youre still awake.

So far, Kurt had been telling the truth. Did that extend to the rest of his reported nightmare? Pocketing the bag, I grabbed the mans arm and flashed him my private investigators license with my free hand. Tell me where you got these pills, asshole.

He cowered for a moment, as if about to crack, but it was only a diversion. He used the motion to get better leverage and twist out of my grasp. I chased after him, and we both ran out of the party and down an alley. There was profit hereI could practically taste it. Some newbie had created a new drug, and it was about to explode in popularity once the media got wind of it. I didnt know exactly how I would make money off of this yetperhaps by taking this amateur dealers jobbut I knew what money there was would be huge. For that imagined payoff, I ran at top speed down a series of alleyways while the dealer continually swallowed more of his pills. Was he trying to get rid of the evidence? I came to the entrance to a long box canyon between buildings and froze.

Imagine youre in a theater. Imagine youre watching a movie. The main charactermehas been told about something impossible repeatedly, but has now just seen it himself. The camera speeds closer to his face while zooming out, giving you that classic horrified perspective shot backset by a rising adrenaline crescendo. That was this moment: the dealer had *literally vanished into thin air* while Id been watching him, and my heart had skipped a beat in my chest.

Id been right about one thing: he *was* an asshole. Hed known that taking too much Remy allowed physical access to some sort of dream layer of reality, and yet hed still sold it to unsuspecting college kids. Did he simply think theyd stick to one or two pills and thereby remain safe, or was it more sinister than that? As I stood there and blinked in stunned surprise, I began to wonder if something deeper was going on here.

All my leads had been flipped, so I only had one left: the pills themselves. I drove home and sat in my living room with that little bag and the beer Id taken earlier that day both sitting on my table like forbidden fruits waiting to be consumed. I had a general idea of what to expect, but the fate of that girl in the hospital still gave me pause. As long as I didnt overdose, Id be fine, right?

Nah. Bad idea. Never take your own product. I could just sell these tomorrow. After examining them for any sign of a creators stampand finding noneI left them on the table and stood outside on the porch to smoke a cigarette and drink my lone beer.

My backyard was small and full of random debris from storms a few months earlier, but, tonight, there was someone standing in the far corner. Hey! I shouted. Get outta here. This is private property!

He didnt move.

I stormed toward him, angry, until something about his manner locked me in place halfway to his corner. He stared my way, expressionless; yet that lack of expression somehow itself held an utter hopelessness. Hed been alone so long that the very instinct of moving ones face with emotion had been beaten out of him by endless disappointment after disappointment. I could almost *feel* this truth in an aura filling his fenced corner.

God. Id taken one of the pills. How had I forgotten that? That seamless transition from waking to dreamingin this case, both at oncehad elusively slipped through my conscious grasp. I stepped to the right, and he followed me smoothly with his haunted gaze. The worst part, for me, was that he wasnt asking for anything. I expected everyone to have a scam. I expected everyone to try to initiate a conversation and run something on me. This guy, with his pale features and forlorn manner, had truly given up all hope.

I see you, I said tentatively.

Everything about him changed. His shoulders lifted, his eyes narrowed, and his lips parted. He pointed at the half-empty beer in my hand. Can He rasped for a moment, and then managed to continue. Can I have a sip? Just a little bit.

Wary, but enthralled by this surreal stranger in my backyard, I crept forward and held out the can. Watching his eyes, I pulled it back at the last moment, evading his slow grasp. Wait. There was some kind of pained need in his gaze, something that I recognized very well. You dont wanna do this, do you? I held out the can again, this time saying, Make the choice not to take it.

He strained against his own weakness, but then pulled his hand back and looked at me with utmost thanks. From one moment to the next, he was there, and then gone.

I stared at the empty space where he had been standing. On some level, I understood: hed been an alcoholic in life. It had probably ruined his family or gotten him killed. That meant, like that boy Kurt had told me, Id just been speaking with the dead

Panicked, I darted back into my apartment. It was a rundown place, one of a long series Id talked my way into and then continually avoided paying rent on, but it was my only current refuge. There were two rooms, a combination kitchen and living room and a bedroom, and the latter seemed to now contain two guests lying still under the sheets. Despite the blankets over their faces, I could still sense them staring at me the same way the other man had. I had been lying between them unknowingly for weeks, but I now knew I had certainly felt their unblinking eyes on me in the solitary hours of the night.

Grabbing the bag of pills from the table and running out to the street in a vain attempt to find a moment to get a grip, I ended up plunging headlong into the dreams strengthening effects. Light poles became trees, and then pillars; buildings changed and morphed at the edges of my vision. Id done my share of tripping, but it was infinitely more stressful knowing that *portions of this could actually be real.* What was dream, and what was spiritual? Those kids had spectrally interacted with recently deceased human beings, but Kurt hadnt been able to tell me what his friends had gone on to see. Whatever it was, it had scared them bad enough that theyd jumped from the roof of a burnt-out house.

Standing there on that lonely pavement among quietly shifting urban canyons, I thought I could feel something *out there* in the limitless expanse of dreams that ranged far deeper than the stars in the sky or the curve of the Earth on the horizon. Something deep in unknown darknesses and across black oceans radiated an intrinsic unhallowed vibration so far-reaching and powerful that it seemed to subtly warp all of creation. My fear brought me in tune with it, letting me sense some sliver of its power, and I *shook*. The size, unimaginable; the power, immeasurable. Every fiber of human instinct within me twanged with long-evolved response: *run away! Hide!*

But, despite the halo of dreaming numbing my senses, I also felt more awake than Id been in years. Like that fellow alcoholic in my backyard, Id let the despair of certainty and physical reality chain me. Id let my hopes get strangled by office chairs and grey cubicles until Id realized that, in such a mundane and pathetic world, I could lie my way into almost anything I wanted. Why work when you could just take?

But even that escape had just been a tunnel dug into another cell in the same prison. Now I knew that our Earth and our existence were tiny and meaningless in the face of a universe far bigger than we could ever comprehend. We were like barnacles clinging to a rock in the ocean, and that meant, wonderfully, that I knew nothing. Id been wrong about life.

My hope must have flared like a tiny little beacon on the fabric of dreams, for I felt an answering ray of darkness shoot out from the infinite distance. That black beam of awareness scoured the dreamscape, searching, screaming, extinguishing. My impression of it was that of an anti-lighthouse, not warning away for safety, but seeking to pull in and consume; an anti-lighthouse powered by a dark flame of fear with the intensity of a black star. This was that cosmic unknown Beast that I had sensed, whose mere aura warped dreaming into nightmares.

I ran, alive with both fear and excitement. This far away, my best chance was to hide and blend in with the boundless dreamscape like so many tiny humans before me. Their escape was always instinctual and automatic waking at the last moment before it caught them, but that avenue was closed to me: I was already awake.

A large silent crowd stood in place and stared at me as I dashed onto open grass. Even with that black beam roving the worlds above, this place gave me pause. Each child, man, and woman stood in front of their own weathering headstone, watching passersby from their quiet plots of earth and grass.

The legion roar of that searching darkness approached, touching upon the dream-sculpted towers of the city proper on the horizon; I could see the awake security-men and janitors inside, even at this distance, as they shivered and looked over their shoulders. One guard was slumped in his chair, dozing off, and I saw his aura stutter and strangle as the black surged around him. His scream of absolute terror joined the others, eternal. I shouted for his fate, aghast.

The beam began swinging closer.

The dead saw this and began slowly moving their arms, beckoning me among them. My every nerve surging with terror, I ran deeper into the graveyard, settling in my last scant moments on a spot marked by an ancient headstone that had been worn too much by time to remain legible. I stood facing forward like the rest of the various ancestors around me, noticing that some number of the plots held no spirit to accompany stone, dirt, and grass. Like the man in my backyard, some number of them had found resolution and what? Where did they go after this

Absolute pain and horror exploded through every cell in my body as the graveyard blackened. It was not darkness, in that sense of seeing nothing; it was anti-light, so that the trees and headstones and spirits became negative silhouettes outlined in electric grey. Each of the spirits clenched their fists and gaped their mouths, but none made a sound. Despite the pain, one old woman turned her head, kept her eyes on mine, and struggled mightily to put a finger to her lips, warning me without words to remain silent. If I made a single noise, it would pick me from the crowd in an instant.

The full intensity of the beam reached us.

I was on a vast ocean of screaming and tortured souls, above, below, in every direction, like a fog of faces and haunting pains. I was just a boy and my father roared at me with fiery eyes and raised his hand, but I held in my terrified scream. I was old and alone, having never been so much as intriguing to any woman. I sat and bitterly stared at passing couples, but I held in my groan of lifelong remorse. I was myself just a few years before, staring at a grey cubicle wall and seriously considering the merits of suicide because of the sheer pointlessness of it all, but I held in my muttered curses. At long last, the screaming darkness went for broke, inflicting every bruise, cut, or burn I had ever experienced or might ever experience all at once; and then every heartbreak, every loss, every moment of nostalgia or random sadness. I cried silently, wracked by immeasurable torture, but the old womans gaze locked on mine let the pain flow out of me and into the surrounding spirits who suffered with me for my sake.

And then it was over. Colors surged back into the positive spectrum. I fell to the earth, tears streaming from blurred eyes, every blood vessel swelled, every nerve on fire, every muscle caught in spasms. I choked and coughed and sobbed and bled from my ears and nosebut Id survived. Blinking to clear my sight, I looked up in thanks at the human spirits that had cloaked me in the crowd and borne part of my pain to keep my mind whole, but they were shaking and trembling with their own after-effects. Only the old woman smiled at me, and I suddenly felt like every scam and con Id ever pulled had been some sort of crime against the bond of human goodness that *did* exist between us after all. That hurt almost as much as the untold nightmare that the Beast in the infinite distance had inflicted upon me merely by gazing in my general direction.

I rolled on the chill earth, ruined, but straining to move: the beam was coming back my way! That moment of utmost need warped the dirt under my gaze, and I tumbled into a deep tunnel between the graves that had shifted into being through the force of pure unadulterated desire. Rolling down a slope that adjusted its tilt to keep my momentum up, I slid away from that horrible sea of energy as it burned past. I sent out a silent apology to those buried men, women, and children who would have to suffer that experience a second time.

Lying there in the darkness, hugged close by dirt on every side, I just breathed for several minutes and tried to recover my faculties. As my heart rate slowed, I began to feel a little strange, and I got out my cellphone to see where I was by its light.

I saw two images: a small circular tunnel through the earth, and *dirt*, right up in my eyes. I stared, trying to comprehend it, until it hit me: the Remy was wearing off. I was about to return to reality fifty feet under a graveyard!

I scrambled at the loose slope, but only managed to slide further down. Panicking, I began to envision what it would be like to suddenly become one with compressed dirt. Would I suffocate? Would I be crushed? Or would I just die instantly as earth molecules appeared all throughout my body? After surviving that brush with true nightmare, I was going to die down here!

No wait! I still had the pills! I pulled them out of my pocket and put ten of them in my mouthand then spit out eight, thinking of that poor girl whose face I had seen through a windowed hospital door. Remy was fast-acting when a person had already taken one. Id seen the dealer do it to escape me. I wondered if the chemistry of the human mind was more open when already partially in the dream state

The dirt disappeared from my sight as the new pills kicked in and the dream-tunnel became more real.

Forcing myself to calm down, I did the only thing I could: I crawled deeper.

The close walls circled ever narrower until I had to push forward with my shoulders to scrape dirt away. For a beat, I feared Id be trapped forever, but the tunnel Id dreamed into existence seamlessly became a rectangular air vent, and wide enough for me to crawl faster with relief.

A distant male voice echoed through the ducts. I hate this place, man.

I crept up to a grating and looked down upon two men talking among several pallets of unmarked boxes. Immediately, I remembered why Id come here in the first place; my subconscious had drilled down to where Id needed to go. One of the men turned his head to look behind him warily, and I recognized him as the dealer Id chased.

What are you worried about? the other asked. Just keep a low profile and avoid other peoples dreams and youll be golden.

Theres somethin out there, way worse even than what happened to Ricky, the dealer hissed. Ive felt it looking for us. *Were not supposed to be here.*

Look. You got me. The other man shoved a tied stack of hundreds into his hands. Now do your job. And stop talking about Ricky. He was dumb and wandered into someones nightmare. Thats on him.

Ignoring those ominous words, I stared at the stack of hundreds. There it was! Id known from the start that there would be a payoff somewhere in all this. Were these people actually using a warehouse *in dreams* to traffic drugs? As I watched the dealer grab a box and carry it out of sight, the genius of it all struck me. The cops could never raid this place, never trace supply lines, never even garner a clue where the product was coming from because the dealers would be waking up in bed with a box that had appeared from nowhere. For that matter, where did the pills come from? Did somebody create them in a lab, or were they themselves dreamt into existence?

With a grin, I focused on my hand, and a stack of bills appeared between my fingers. I thought my troubles were over, but my moment of triumph faded as I leafed through them and realized they were blurry, and that the text upon them changed every time I looked at them. Son of a bitch! They werent real.

But a pile of stacked cash on the table down below *was.* I just had to wait for the supplier to leave, and

I trembled and fought a wave of fear and nausea. As much as I wanted that money, the animal my brain rode around in had not forgotten the trauma Id just been through, and the prospect of more adrenaline and danger had my body rebelling. All it wanted was to find a safe place to hide until the dream wore off and I could go home.

*Its alright,* I told it. *Lets just get that money, and then well never stress again. Easy beers and burritos for years.*

Yet still I could not move. I kept reliving shadows of that invasive darknessright up until I looked ahead rather than down and saw a form approaching in the duct.

Not a shadow or anything related to darkness; that was the first relief. But as it continued to move oddly, what had appeared to be a distant grey silhouette sharpened into something that was actually much closer. I stared until it hit me: I was looking at a blank grey humanoid shape, *and it was crawling toward me.*

That sudden physical threat lifted my paralysis, and I crawled forward and right down another path as the clamoring noise of the specter quickened. I was already tired, and my muscles were burning, but I grit my teeth and crawled as fast as I could along cold cramped metal. Coming to a T-junction over a grate, I looked both waysand saw a second and third grey silhouette clambering towards me from both directions. There was only one way out.

Kicking the grate open, I slid down and fell into open air. Half expecting to jolt awake at the last second, I yelped in surprise as I slammed into a wide pallet of boxes and rolled off onto the floor.

Staggering up as quick as I could, I first looked up, where three blank grey faces watched from the vent but did not pursue; around me, the warehouse was empty. The supplier had departed. Creeping along, I found the table stacked high with cash and stuck stacks in every pocket. Hell, why not? Pulling on an old trick, I put a couple down my underwear, too, just in case I got caught.

Tense near to the point of passing out, I decided it was time to go while my luck was good. Grabbing a few bags of Remy from the boxes Id smashed, I crossed the warehouse space and peered around corner after corner before deciding each hallway was safe. Where was this place? Did it correspond to a real location? While so deep in the dream state, there was no way to tell. My primary hope was to go *up* in case I was still somewhere underground.

But the rusted old maintenance door I found led right out onto the cool night street. Objects on the edges of my vision still morphed and changed when I wasnt looking, but I was back. Exultant, but keeping calm and nonchalant, I walked until I was certain I was out of danger. At that moment, I ran, laughing and triumphant.

My shitty apartment seemed beautiful in its soft offering of privacy. I was going to pay rent for once, and maybe even clean up the debris in the backyard. After closing the blinds, I pulled all the cash out and placed it on the table to count it and make sure it was all real. Then, I hid it under my mattress. I remembered the two silent blanket-covered watchers on the bed, and I knew they were still there, but I couldnt see or sense them now that the Remy had worn off. Screw it. One more night between them wouldnt hurt.

I lay in the darkness for a time, my trauma assuaged by my success, but sleep came fitfully and full of nightmarish flashbacks.

I awoke around dawn, not nearly rested, but energized by unhappiness. In my flashbacks, Id had time to process some of the things Id seen, especially in that black river of pure torture. Among the screaming faces, I now recognized one: the girl Id seen through that windowed door at the hospital.

No. I couldnt do anything about it. Id gotten away with the money scot free. There was no connection to me whatsoever. Itd been dark at that party and Id put on different mannerisms for the dealer; I could walk right past him and smile and say hello and hed never even suspect. I had the cash. I was home free! Just forget about it!

But that dead old womans gaze haunted me, reminding me of what Id learned.

Goddamnit. God *damnit.*

I didnt know where the comatose girl was, or if it was even possible to save her, but I did know the direction from which infinite nightmare had sought to extinguish my small flare of hope.

I wrestled with this idiot idea for hours, telling myself that this was how people got killed in moviesthat stupid choice to go back or do something foolish after seeing the truth of the dangerbut I found I didnt really have a choice. I could either do this, or go back to hating life with the added despair of hating myself.

No. The small seed of true living hope that I found in that other world is more precious to me now than any other possession. I know its stupid, but I have no choice: I have to tell that kid his friend is still out there. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> We all love feeling scared, but it is possible to push it too far. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-17 23:59:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I used to love feeling scared, but after what Ive seen, Im just permanently numb. My friends and I often played a self-scaring game where wed visit purportedly haunted locations at night, take pictures, move around in the dark, and try to embrace fear as deeply as possible. It was our way of getting an adrenaline rush; some people went skydiving and some people raced cars, but *we* purposely scared the hell out of ourselves.

Gabby was the biggest fear junkie out of all of us. She was the one most interested in taking photographs too, as if she was intent on proving the supernatural actually existed. I didnt have the heart to tell her that I didnt actually think there was anything out there. Wed been to century-old hospitals where tuberculosis patients had died en masse. Wed stayed the night in horrible prisons with the lights off. Wed even gone up to a spot in the woods where it was rumored a mass murder had taken place in the eighteen hundreds. Through all that, wed never once seen anything out of the ordinary. Itd always been fun, though, so when the dealer at a college party offered me something new, I immediately thought of Gabby.

She scoffed when I showed her the little circular dark blue pills. Remy? What the hell is *Remy?* Is that like Molly?

No, I said, looking around the party to make sure nobody was watching us. Its new. My guy says it puts you in an REM dream state while still awake. Thats why its called Remy.

Her wariness faded as she realized the implications. Is it safe?

I grinned. I knew I had her interest. As safe as dreaming.

She grabbed our friend Kurt and we were out the door without even saying goodbye to anyone else at the party. Practically salivating over the prospect of this new adventure, she rhetorically asked, Whats the scariest possible place around here?

Kurt, the most reluctant of our trio, shook his head. If were really doing this Remy stuff, can we first try it somewhere normal? I dont want to freak out and get hurt or trapped or something.

I nodded diplomatically.

Gabby sighed. Fine. She looked up and down the orange-lit street, taking stock of the random scattered college kids on their way to and fro in the chilly night. How about here?

*Here?* Kurt asked. Like, in public?

I didnt see anybody acting crazy. Before we could all agree, she took one of the several Id given her and downed it. Here goes nothing.

Shrugging at Kurt, I took one, too, and he joined in with trepidation.

Nothing happened at first, and, of course, Id forgotten to ask how long it would take to kick in. Should we walk?

Lets go get sodas at the GetGo, Gabby suggested.

Something about her sentence felt a little odd. Was it already starting to have an effect? I walked alongside my two friends, studying the orange streetlamps overhead and passersby in the distance. That was the curious thing about dreams: you could never quite tell when they began. You were simply and suddenly *there.*

Psst!

I turned and saw a thin blonde girl standing in a nearby yard.

She waved me over. Hey!

Whats up? I asked. Behind me, Kurt and Gabby turned to look at her, too.

The more I looked at her, the more detail seemed to become clear: grey bottoms, a sweatshirt, a gaunt facewait, what?

She shivered despite her warm clothes and asked, You got anything I can eat? Anything at all.

I looked to Kurt, who shrugged and threw her an Altoid from his pocket.

She caught it, gulped it down without chewing, sighed happilyand vanished.

Im pretty sure all three of us screamed at the same time, more out of shock than fear. That triple scream seamlessly became laughter as we realized that the Remy was working. Wed all just dreamed a girl standing in a yard! Kurts Altoid sat in the grass, a tiny white speck in dark glimmering emerald.

But I was still awake, and smart enough to realize that wed all seen the same thing. Did this drug also cause people to share the same waking dream? Or were we creating some false participatory memory? It was impossible to know, and our analytical abilities were deteriorating as the stoops and ramshackle undergraduate houses around us took on surreal qualities.

Waking dreaming was its own class of crazy. With far more awareness than usual, I was able to see how my stream of consciousness constantly shaped and remolded everything around me. A house ahead grew taller, reminding me vaguely of an ancient Greek temple; it morphed into a weathered ancient Greek temple, reminding me of history and old things; it became a ruin, and then a house for medieval peasants, and then a booth from the Renaissance Fair. Only once I drew close enough to really focus did it stop changing and return to normal: dreams operated at the edge of consciousness, and direct concentration could dispel them.

This is just cool, not scary, Gabby said, looking around with wonder. Her smile turned into an evil grin. So far. She began walking faster.

We kept up with her, and Kurt asked, Where are we going?

Theres an abandoned house two blocks over. Lets break in and see how scared we can get.

That definitely sounded like a plan. Traversing a mazelike landscape of sidewalks, asphalt, cars, and houses that kept constantly changing in shape, meaning, and scope, we nevertheless made decent progress straight toward our destination. We were still awake, after all, and there was always a long narrow tube of reality wherever I decided to focus my eyes and awareness. We kept lookout while Gabby bashed in a low rectangular basement window with a rock.

We carefully slipped down in one by one.

It was only after I stood and looked around that dark musty basement by dull indirect orange light that I realized I hadnt thought to look at the houses exterior. Id been too caught up in the shifting dreamscape to get a sense of what kind of building we were climbing into.

The basement itself didnt look too strange. The grey dirt floor ran uniformly around the cramped space, and we investigated nooks and crannies among the stone foundations for a time by the light of our phones.

Look! Gabby said, excited.

I followed her pointing finger to a *skull* partially buried in the grey dirt.

Kurt laughed and poked it. It looks so real! Under our collective gazes, it turned into a half-buried teapot. Aww.

Gabby looked positively hungry for more. Lets go upstairs.

The creaking wood under our feet was oddly dark, and I put my phone light close, trying to figure out whybut the shades and *animation style* of the steps kept changing, as if I was watching a movie, and then a cartoon, and then a sketch, and then a comic. I fought down a wave of nausea and looked away, hoping that this trip wasnt about to turn bad.

I froze at the top of the stairs. Oh, sorry!

Four people stood withina woman at the sink, a man at the fridge, and two kids sitting at the kitchen table. They all stood unmoving and stared at the three of us blankly, likely too shocked to react.

Kurt held up his hands. Oh my god, wrong house!

Gabby stood between us, also warily still.

I expected the father to call the cops, or the kids to scream, or the mother to angrily shoo us out of the housebut none of them moved. As always, Gabby was the first to suspect that something was wrong. She stepped to the side, at first just once, but then twice, and a third time. The family of four turned their heads and gazes to follow her, but none of them spoke a word or otherwise moved.

What the hell is this? Kurt asked, gripping my upper arm tightly.

The mother turned her gaze on him, her expression still blank.

Dont swear, I whispered to him, keeping my eyes on the family while I slowly followed Gabby. There are children present

I didnt care *where* we were going, only that we were going *somewhere else.* As such, we were halfway up the next oddly darkened steps before I realized we were not heading for some sort of split-level exit. I hissed. Gabbywe cant go upstairs! The people here

She turned and looked back at me. Are what? she whispered. This place burned down two months ago.

I kept looking at her, but my thoughts went to the dark stairs and walls. They were blackened, I now understood, because they were charred. And the family in the kitchen

Kurts grip on my arm became painful. What the hells going on? Why am I dreaming of a family that died here? He looked up at both of us fiercely. *I didnt know about any dead family beforehand.*

Its the dream state, Gabby said with visible excitement. We must be seeing things outside of normal perception! She turned and made a move down the second floor hallway.

I caught her arm, and, for a moment, all of us were physically connected. Gab, if thats true, its time to go home. Study this until we know more.

Are you kidding? She pulled away, breaking contact. What if its a one-time deal? An accident of timing and biology? These are the big leagues! This is what weve always looked for! She darted off, disappearing into the shifting darkness and shade of the surreal second floor hallway.

Kurt let go too, fleeing the other directionback down the stairs. I cant. Im sorry, I just cant!

Torn and suddenly alone, I watched Kurt swing around the charred bannister pole at the bottom of the stairs and run out of sightand then I turned to face the shifting and uncertain hallway. I had to believe Kurt would be alright, since he was heading for the front door. Gabby, on the other hand, was heading deeper into a place where the living very much did not belong. I stepped forward into a swaying sense of subtle dizziness that hung about the second floor proper, and it took a few moments before the slow back-and-forth and eerie creaking made sense.

A boat! It felt like I was in the narrow hold of a boat. But on what ocean were we drifting? The phone in my hand had become a small torch burning with a dim white flame, and I held it before me as I cautiously opened the first door. It creaked horribly and then splintered away, too charred to function. 

A low rumble echoed through the hallway, and I slipped within the burnt room, feeling like Id just barely avoided some sort of gaze or awareness coming around a distant corner. I leaned back against the wall, breathing hard but quietly, telling myself that it was just a dreamand one that I'd had often, for that matter. Throughout much of my life, in dreams, Id fled that unhallowed awareness just around the corner, always diving for safety just before it learned of my existence. But now it was here.

My breathing stilled as I finally cast my sight around the room.

Dolls! God, why dolls?! A good forty-odd eerie little dolls with charred faces sat littered about the faded pink room in various pieces, their eyes fixated on me from every angle. I stared, my pulse growing to a roar in my head until I was finally forced to breathe again, but they all seemed too damaged by the fire to move. And then, beyond thema soot-stained window that showed out only onto dark emerald fog. The subtle motion of our surreal ship became prominent in my limbs again, and I inched my way around the room to stare out through those darkened panes.

Limitless black waters roiled just below, at about the height of the first floors ceiling. So it was just the second floor and above that were partially in another world, then I ducked down behind the bed, hiding among the glaring broken dolls, as the awareness in the hallway brushed past. It paused on the broken door, and perhaps even gazed in with some monstrous eye, but I dared not look.

Satisfied that the room was empty, whatever it was out there finally moved on.

I gave it a good long minute before I climbed back on my feet and crept out into the hallway. Where had it gone? The way backthe stairs downwere gone, replaced by a window onto green fog and dark waters. No matter. Gabby was the other direction, and I knew her well enough to skip the rest of the doors on the second floor. She would be heading straight for the attic.

It was about that moment, staring at the slightly open door to another set of upward stairs, that I began feeling more clear-headed. Looking back, I saw two images, one fading, and one growing stronger: the horrible otherworldly hold I had crept down, and a gaping burnt shell of a house with no solid second floor to speak of. I stood on an overhanging ledge of charred wood which was physically unreachable from the stairs in the distance. Implicitly, I understood, in that moment, that I was not *just* dreaming: the dream state had actually let us tread into something deeper, some dark blister on reality that had bubbled and festered into its own little nightmare.

And, in the real world, the attic door was closed and locked.

Goddamnit, Gabby, I mutterednot that there was a choice, considering that I had no normal way down from my high and unstable location. I took another of the little circular dark blue pills from my pocket and swallowed it. I waited, breathless.

The swaying and creaking returned rather quickly, and I began to lose sight of the real. Near my hand, the attic door was both closed and open, both closed and open, both closed and open and, then, just open. Set loose like a runner at the start line, I pulled it the rest of the way and sprinted up the steps, scared by how long Id left Gabby on her own.

My white torch snuffed out as I moved straight up into a horizontal ceiling of absolute darkness that hovered level with the top of the attic stairs.

I crouched to avoid nails that might be sticking down from the roof; the expansive space ran cool with drafts from the ocean air outside, and I used those drafts to inch along through the void. I felt melted plastic, soot, and charred wood with my fingers as I moved. This was still the burned-out attic. So why was it so impossibly dark?

Gabbys whisper came from somewhere out in the abyss. *Hes here*

Id found her! Mostly. Who? I whispered back.

*The older brother who set the fire*

I froze in the dark, taking in her meaning. Was he?

She shrieked suddenly, and then I heard wood creak and motion erupt from somewhere ahead and to my right.

Crawling forward and grimacing for fear of nails, I sought out the noises of struggle and managed to grasp her flailing hand. She knew it was me immediately, and pulled hard to escape something and crawl past me.

I was too slow. Painfully hot fingers that held the texture of over-cooked hotdogs gripped my ankle, and my kicks did no damage to whatever my shoes were striking. A horrific stench hit my nose, barely preceding a charred corpse climbing on top of me. Grappling with the nightmarish arsonist, I fought with dreamlike strengththat is to say, none, for every hit felt like I was doing nothing at all. My efforts to fight back held no impact.

The idea came to me in a flash out of my own fears.

Instead of fighting off the unseen horror, I gripped his front and side and stood up as fast as I could.

He groaned, gurgled, and convulsed, and foul-smelling goo hit my face from above.

I didnt need to see him to know what Id done. Letting go, I moved away, free to leave now that he was pinned to the roof by dozens of jutting nails that had to be several inches long each.

*Dont,* he choked out, audibly distraught. *Dont leave me here. Dont let it have me. Forgive me, let me go were almost there please you have no idea*

I ignored him.

Gabby found my hand in the dark, and we crawled our way to some sort of exitbut it was not the stairs back down. We emerged through a small hatch onto the deck of the nightmare ship proper. Here, the green fog was thickest, lit only by a spectral glow from an unseen moon. Above us, a wooden platform rose to a crest, and, on that platform, a figure in silhouette stood at the wheel. That silhouettes head and shoulders shifted as it slowly turned to look at us, and I found myself unable to move at all no matter how hard I tried. The effort only produced a subtle dark blue static along the outlines of my limbs. We remained on our hands and knees.

Two dark red points, like zero-dimensional rubies with endless depth, studied us for a moment.

Were we going to die? Was it going to kill us? Who or what *was it?* Wed crawled through a dead familys unending nightmare and a child arsonists private hell to findwhat?

The ruby eyes shifted away, facing ahead again, and I was suddenly able to move.

It began to pointstraight ahead, at some distant approaching destination. The emerald fog around us roiled in a new breeze and began to slide away.

I pulled Gabby back toward the hatch, but she resisted. Her eyes gleamed by spectral moonlight.

Dont do it! I whispered, but she crawled out of my immediate grasp as I remained at the hatch back to the real world.

She pulled out the handful of dark blue pills Id given herand downed them all in one determined gulp. I have to know.

I screamed at her, but she clambered to her feet and began to ascend the lay of the ship toward that figure. I thought to go after her, still, even then, but I felt *it* coming in over the waves: that awareness, larger and closer than ever, no longer just a stalking shadow of itself, but real, present, and growing nearer. Every almost-encounter with it Id ever had in dreams had been nothing but avoiding the smallest sliver of that ultimate terror which lay ahead on this dark ocean. I knew then that if I had ever failed to avoid it knowing of me, that if I had ever gone around those dreamscape corners just a little bit slower and gotten *seen* in the utmost indescribable sense, I would have died in my sleepor worse.

Crying. I was crying. I could actually see a shadow of the future in my mind, generated by my dream state. I could crawl back into that hatch and let Gabby find what shed been seeking ever since her parents had died, and nobody in my world would ever see her again. I would live the rest of my life wondering if she was suffering an unimaginable fate all alone inGod knew wherever this was.

It was coming up over the waves. Seconds. Heartbeats. We had mere moments.

Screaming silently in my head, I abandoned my grip on that hatch and ran up the charred wood of that ghastly ship and tackled her. She struggled and bit and clawed at me, but I dragged her away. There was no time for going back the way wed come; a rising scream that shook the world reached a crescendo as the ship tilted up along a massive wave preceding the unknowable Beast. The waters were dark enough to hide us from its sight, and that would have to be enough. With an instinctual prayer expressed by a leap of my heart in my chest, I pulled her over the side with me, and we plunged down into the icy pitch

and through it, down onto hard autumn-chilled grass, where her leg snapped like a twig and my arm shattered in four places.

Of course, we could never truly explain to anyone why wed jumped from the roof of that burnt-out house. Kurt swore that his pill had worn off by the time he saw us fall out of thin air; I did my best to convince him it was the last effect of his dream state. My pills I ground up underneath my shoe while I painfully waited for the ambulance to arrive.

I sat by her side in the hospital, at least as much as they let me. With no parents and no family, I was her emergency contact, and the confused doctor explained that he honestly had no idea what was wrong with her. She was unresponsive and wouldnt wake up, but, unlike a coma patient, her brain activity was constantly very high. Coma patients never experienced REM sleep almost by definition, but she was *always* in it, and exhibiting signs of extreme stress besides. Hed never seen anything like it.

But I knew what it was. Id only saved her body. Shed overdosed on dreams and fear, and the rest of her was still there in that nightmare layer of reality. What she might have found, Ill never know, but I no longer enjoy fear. Ive seen where it comes from; nearly touched its source directly, nearly had it become aware of *me* personally in returnand I have absolutely no desire to go back there before I see Death a second time and he drags me kicking and screaming into its inescapable maw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't approve or disapprove contributions generally, and instead rely on the multiverse nature of things to make everything possible somewhere. I've also purposely constructed several eras in the timeline to be fertile ground for stories, some of which I'll revisit myself, too. So if you like a story, consider it canon. I've kept a pretty narrow focus on specific characters so that you guys can let your imaginations run wild :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My only question is why you had to make the villain in the story have a middle eastern accent...

Demons can't lie, but they certainly allow you to mislead yourself. After some research, I realized that, thanks to his accent, I misinterpreted his name as Malcolm at the time. I now believe he was actually *Milcom*, the chief demon of the Ammonites, to whom children were sacrificed by fire. First became known ~300 BC, just east of Israel. With the phasing out of human sacrifice over the centuries, I imagine he's found a new way to capture souls. Sadly, this way also appears to be easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont have a gambling problem. Thats the first thing I want known. Its also what they all say, right? No, Im not addicted to gambling, but I have a co-dependency issue with someone who *is*.

Im not the coolest guy on the block, and Im not particularly good at anything. Ted is, though, and weve been best friends since we were four. Hes the one who always pushes forward blindly into adventures, and I guess Im the one who always gets him back out when things go sideways. Theres always been an element of luck to our continued physical and financial survival, but never more than now.

Wed flown out to Napa Valley for a friends weddingand already ditched the reception party at around eleven. I could hardly afford to do anything; Id only been able to come because Ted had bought me a ticket. Because I was only there on his generosity, I followed him to the quiet and rather empty bars that sparsely dotted the area. It was beautiful country, filled with vineyards and history, but it was *not* a party town. This frustrated Ted, of course, who began plying locals with drinks in order to interrogate them about local hotspots. Somebody has to be having fun in this town, he would say with a grin.

One bitter old man finally spoke up at the third empty bar we invaded. Theres a casino, if you really need it that bad.

We looked at our phones, but Google Maps showed nothing.

It wont be on any map, the old man said, scowling at us. Just go south from here and youll find it.

Behind our informant, I saw an unhappy look on the bartenders face. That should have tipped me offbut Ted was already thanking the old man and heading for the door. I followed quickly, ignoring the uneasy feeling in the pit of my stomach.

Driving through the rolling hills at night was a claustrophobic and confusing experience. Our phone signal dropped, and we found ourselves driving purely by instinct. West? South? East? It was impossible to know for sure. We stuck to the sole road until it turned to dirt underneath the wheels. Thats when I almost called the whole thing.

But Ted pulled up outside a graveyard and pointed. Look! Cars!

And he was right: two dozen cars were parked on the grass next to an unassuming old church that had all its windows boarded up. Hed only caught the sight across the graveyard and through the trees because hed been looking so intently. Triumphant, he said, Thats a hidden party if Ive ever seen one! and carefully drove the car between the headstones to reach the improvised parking area.

I climbed out with trepidation. Even up close, the century-old church looked dilapidated, dark, and abandoned. Come on, this is too much.

Ted wasnt having it. He ran right up and pushed open the front doorand bright light and the sounds of electronic games burst forth. In a moment, he was gone, and I was left to step across the high grass alone. The fact that there was actually a hidden casino here lifted my spirits a little; maybe it was all just a gimmick to encourage people to drink and gamble more.

Funnyit still sounded quiet and looked dark until the moment I cracked the door open.

The light and noise swallowed me, and I blinked repeatedly until my eyes and ears adjusted. I was almost disappointed to find that the expansive place within was exactly the same as any of the casinos Ted had made us visit in Vegas last year. Vaguely old timey red and gold carpets ran lush under warm lighting, and drunk businessmen and their accompanying younger dates played at scattered locations throughout. An old lady glared at me, defending her slot machine, and pulled the lever only after I moved past.

Finally relaxing, I shrugged. Whatever. We werent going to be robbed or stabbed here. This was still Napa Valley, after all.

In fact, they were rather accommodating. A wonderfully attractive waitress came by, said hello to me, and offered me a free drink on the house. I took it with bashful surprise.

Ted was already moving about the place to scout the best games and tables. I caught up to him, drink in hand, and he settled near a roulette table. Lets just watch for a bit, he said quietly. Make sure everythings on the level. Hidden in a church like this, I doubt they stick to gaming commission codes.

That made sense. We watched and listened for a bit, enjoying the taste of free drinks and the sight of pretty girls, as middle-aged businessmen won and lost with varying degrees of frequency. One pepper-haired Asian suit went on a lucky streak, getting the crowd all riled uphimself included. While onlookers shrieked with excitement, he bet it all.

He lost.

Heh, seems legit, Ted told me. Im gonna head over to the blackjack tables for a minute. And he moved off to begin playing.

That was everything I had, the Asian businessman said, dismayed. The two girls that had been clinging to his arms disengaged and began to look disinterested. Hurriedly, he made a motion to a casino manager, and the well-dressed but subtly subservient facilitator brought him a small suitcase. It clicked open with a rush of air, and I watched as the unlucky gambler pulled out bundled stacks of blue dollar bills.

That was odd. They were American dollarssame faces, designs, and everythingjust *dark blue* instead of green. Was this fake money? Some sort of in-house system? Come to think of it, I saw no chips, just money. If these were the replacement for chips, why all the care to make them so similar to real dollars?

The gambler in question did not have the same qualms. He gladly placed the stacks on the table. The crowd grew energized again, and the girls began showing him attention once more.

Feeling a little strange, I moved off, seeking Ted. I found him at the blackjack table as he won a hand.

Grinning, he pumped a fist. I like this place. Come on, play.

I dont have any money for this, I told him, sheepish.

Heres some. He handed me a hundred dollar bill. I took it and sat, but secretly stashed the hundred and pulled the last of my own cash reserves from my wallet. As I always did, I would return his money back to him when he wasnt looking. He never made me feel bad about it, and he had a high-paying job besides, but I just couldnt stomach leeching off of someone else like that.

We played a few hands while still enjoying free drinks; I drank slower to remain soberish, but Ted guzzled away, having the time of his life. He lost quite a few hands, but played well, and actually started accumulating more money than hed come in with. I, in contrast, lost all of my meager cash rather quickly.

Upon the loss of my last dollar, a suited man with slicked-back hair and a politicians grin approached and leaned down between us, an arm on the back edge of each of our chairs. He spoke with a thick Middle Eastern accent, although his skin was pale enough that it was uncertain what region he was from. Gentlemen, welcome. I dont think Ive seen you grace our establishment before. I am Malcom.

Nice to meet you, Ted said. This place is great. Love the free drinks.

Yes, Malcolm said with a widening grin. A small expense in the face of a casinos profits. I am not a greedy man.

So youre the owner? I asked, not wanting to be left out.

Yes, but think of me as your friend. He finally moved back and stood upright. His gaze shifted to me. I see you are out of money. Would you like to keep playing? He motioned a manager over, and a briefcase was opened before me, complete with the stacks of blue dollar bills Id seen before.

I glanced over awkwardly.

Ted was suspicious, but open to the idea. What are these?

They represent debt, Malcolm said graciously.

Interesting. Ted looked to me. You should do it, Ryan.

But that was not my name. I think Im alright, Jason, I replied. What did he have in mind? I imagined he was planning to use these blue dollars, if needed, and then slip out. They couldnt make us pay back a debt if they had no idea who we were.

Accepting my refusal, Malcolm ordered the suitcase closed and withdrew. Good luck, gentlemen.

I was left with a chill and a shiver.

From then on, I could only sit and watch as Ted gambled, talked up girls, and had a good time. The free drinks were no longer offered to me, and, indeed, none of the patrons or employees would so much as look at me. I should have noticed, but, again, my life was often lonely. I simply accepted it.

We moved from game to game, eventually ending up back at roulette, and Ted soon found himself in a situation we had witnessed earlier: energized crowd, streak of lucky wins, and a potential for a huge payoff. Despite my whispered warnings, he bet everything he had. The ball bounced, the numbers were called, and I sighed.

Hed lost.

Malcolm returned with a grin I imagined to be rather hungry, and the suitcase was offered to Ted.

Someone in the crowd squeezed my forearm in warning, but by the time I looked, it was impossible to tell who had done it. Dont. Lets go home.

Come on, Ryan! he shouted back. I could tell he still intended to rip off the establishment. Lets have some  fun! Reaching down, he eagerly pulled out two armfuls of blue dollar stacks, most of which he pawned off on me. I held them as he bet blue money on another roll. It might have been my imagination, but the stacks felt subtly warm.

He wonthankfullybut that quickly led to more bets, and I watched with a sinking feeling as my load of blue dollars shrank. The eyes of the crowd were upon us very intently now, and Malcolm seemed to be staring solely at Tedgrinning only when Ted looked his way.

We should go, I said again, but Ted ignored me.

There were a hundred opportunities to leave, but Ted took none of them. At long last, his final blue dollar went to the house. At that point, he whispered his intent to me, and I took off running after him a heartbeat later. I made it to the door and burst into the cool night air, but Ted remained just within.

What are you doing? I shouted to him. Get out here!

He seemed horrified. He stared down at his feet as they toed the red-and-gold carpets edge. I cant! I cant leave!

Malcolm approached calmly behind Ted, flanked by two suited managers.

Sensing something was wrong, I leapt forward and kept the church door from closingbut I made sure to remain just outside. Malcolm, what the hell is this?

The grinning man gave a small laugh. I told you that my money was a form of debt. People like your friend here never listen. They think that they can cheat the house. Perhaps that would be possible if the house, in this case, were not a demon. But it isI amand he is now indebted.

I stared up at him, trembling, but it seemed that I was not in direct danger. The next question was obvious. What does he owe?

The same thing that is always owed, Malcolm told me, his grin widening along his cheeks in a starkly inhuman manner. Each blue dollar represented a portion of his soul. If even one remained, there was a chance he might win it all back, and more, thus I would not technically own him. With not even one blue dollar left, he has no chance of escape. He is mine.

Looking past him, I saw the patrons and the employees watching us. I understood: they were *all* his. The Asian businessman I had seen gambling had been one of us, free, but no longer. I looked back to Malcolm, thinking about his explanation of chance. So you operate by rules then?

Of course. I am a demon, rule-bound by nature. This type of thing must be enacted fairly.

Ted still struggled with the invisible threshold, his eyes on me, his expression desperate.

How do I get him out? I asked, my pulse racing. If the roles had been reversed, I was sure Ted would have had a plan, but I had no idea what to do.

Malcolm laughed softly for a full five seconds before answering. There is nothing you can do except leave. To buy back even a single blue bill, he must have money. He has no money, therefore he cannot buy back the single blue bill required. Believe me when I tell you that this is not my establishmentshow do you Americans say?first rodeo.

Ted began screaming, but a gesture from Malcolm silenced him. Ted continued moving and opening his mouth, certainly, but no noise came out.

Heart thudding in my chest hard enough that I feared I might pass out, I reached in my back pocket and slipped out the hundred dollar bill. How many of his blue dollars will this get me?

It must be his money, not yours, Malcolm replied, his expression uncertain for the first time since Id seen him.

It *is* his! I shouted. He gave it to me to hold!

A manager whispered in Malcolms ear, and a frustrated sigh followed. At current exchange rates, that hundred will purchase twenty-one of his blue bills.

The other manager opened the suitcase, showing twenty-one loose bills, and I scooped them up before dropping the hundred in their place. Without warning, Teds screams became audible again, and he fell forward into the graveyard with me. Grabbing him by instinct, I kept him from falling completely down, and Malcolm stood staring at us with anger. Now that his careful veneer was fading, I could see ghastly undertones in his skin, and the pale outlines of numerous gnarled horns on his headand on the heads of the managers beside him.

Ted accepted the twenty-one blue dollars from me and stood, slowly recovering his wits and breath. Jesus, they had me. He gripped my shoulder. You got me out! *You got me out!* You always do. Thank you, thank you.

I nodded and began backing away from that unhallowed place. There was no way we could have known.

Care to make another wager? the demon at the church door asked. Now that you know what we are, there are greater winnings available. How would you care for immortality? Perhaps the power of flight? Or precognition? We can gift you these things, assuming you win enough.

Ted stopped following me and turned to look back at Malcolms charred face.

A terrible sinking feeling overcame me. Dont!

Imagine how much we could win if we could see the future! Ted said, still frozen in place. Wed be set for life!

Hes lying! I shouted.

I cannot lie, Malcolm replied with amusement. You know this.

Ill just bet twenty, Ted called back. Ill still have the one, so Ill still be free!

I kept screaming, but Ted staggered toward that open door and pushed within. Fully gruesome now, Malcolm gave me a maggot-filled smileand the door shut of its own accord.

Opening and closing the rotted wood a few times, I discovered nothing but a musty and abandoned church within. I could also now see that the cars parked outside were rusted and ancient, with models ranging from modern to classic. Those that had come here over the last fifty years had never left. Surely I wasnt the first to turn down the blue soul money? How had I never heard of

The old man at the bar.

His bitterness.

Hed lost somebody here, to this place, to Malcolm, and Ted had been an obviously doomed soul from the start. Telling him had simply sped up the inevitable.

I began the long walk home. I was alone now, but that was no longer my biggest fear. Id done my part. Id pulled a lucky last-minute move and saved Ted from a demon uniquely suited to his flawsbut hed chosen to go back anyway. There was nothing I could do but go on alone and wonder when my own particular brand of demon would fall across my path. On that day, I, too, would be lost. Thus was born Malcolms demonic confidence: even with friends to offer one last chance at escape, we are all human. 

We are each our own doom. </TEXT>

Theyd lost people before, but this was fundamentally different. Now, they were alone. Neil found himself twice as wary as before, three times as cautious, and infinitely more worried. Rani and Kumari were all he had left, and the three of them had no backup, no help, and no food. For the first time, they were truly alone in the wilds, and there was no hope of refuge or relief in sight.

For the first time, it truly hit home that they could all simply die out there, and nobody would ever know. Nobody would likely care, either, given how many hundreds of billions were also fleeing the cold and dying in worlds unknown.

When life came back for one more sucker punch, it was wholly unexpected. Death, theyd talked about. This was worse. With Kumari on his back, Neil stepped through one of the violet rectangular portals that seemed uneven and unreliable as of late. He turned to look at Ranibut the portal was gone.

Shed been one step behind, but, now, she was unknowably far away.

He just stood there and stared at the empty space for a time, praying that it would reappear. He imagined she was on the other side doing the same. He built a fire and waited throughout the night. Jolting awake at dawn, Kumari still in his arms, it began to sink in that Rani was not coming. She had also had the compass chip on her at the time.

Dirty, exhausted in every way possible, and hungry, he made the unbearable choice to continue walking. The land ahead was a vast bleak plain, with no landmarks or possible food sources to speak of, and he wandered aimlessly for an unknowable time. Kumari was old enough to eat solids now, but he saw none, and absolute despair began building in his heart as her incessant crying gave way to silent lethargy.

It was then he began to see himself as he truly was: thin, wasted, gaunt, tired. He *was* that starving distant person on some other continent whose image had always been used to guilt him into donating to charity. Hed cared, sure, but those people were a world away; now, everyone was those people. Now, he was that person. And his baby was starving to death.

More walking, more bleaknesshe stumbled on until he could stumble no more. Kumari was barely responding to his coos and prods, and he had nothing to feed her, except

He built a fire, got out his knife, and held it above his arm as tears ran down his face. Could he really do this? Others apparently had. Would it hurt? He imagined it would be more painful than anything hed ever experienced. And then he would simply be one-armed, less capable, and maimedbut Kumari was lying there quietly, and she was going to die.

He shouted, threw the knife down, and walked away. His chest shivering oddly, the voice of survival within him whispered that he should just go. He should just leave the baby. Cut off his own arm? That was insane!

No! he shouted at the dark grey sky, wondering if anything in all of existence could hear him. That wasnt just a baby. That was Kumari. *His* baby. His daughter. She would grow up and live and love and hopefully do great things. This was his one job: protect Rani; failing that, protect their daughter. He walked back across the vast dirt, hoping she would never remember that he had once walked away and left her.

Sitting by the fire again, he rocked back in forth, knife in one hand. Resolve was one thing. Actually doing it was another.

He banged his fist on lifeless dirt and screamed in anger up at the heavens. Why? *Why?* One break! he shouted. Just give me one break! *Please!*

He didnt feel it at first through the streaming tears. His eyes, blurred, didnt pick up on itand he held the knife above his arm again and screamed at himself.

But he finally felt the drops before he cut into his skin.

It was raining.

Looking up in wonder, he watched the grey clouds unleash pent-up fury. He grabbed Kumari, too, and shielded her. Was this the break he had asked for? How

Worms.

He laughed and shouted exuberantly.

They were everywhere! This entire bleak plain was flat dirt, and the rain was forcing up earthworms in a vast sea of promised protein in every direction. Running about with elation, he gathered them and crushed dozens of the mealy disgusting strings of flesh between his teeth. It was a horrible meal, but hed never been more satisfied. Spitting some back out once crushedand once they didnt immediately poison or kill himhe gently fed Kumari.

She ate ravenously, and then smiled up at him.

They were going to live! At least for today, they were going to live.

He filled his pack with worms, a wonderfully gross haul, and let water accumulate in anything he could after drinking his fill. Slogging through the mud with Kumari on his back and covered, both of them completely renewed, he began pushing forward again. There was no other option but to move forward, of course, but now he felt something more: hed asked for a break, not from any particular god or gods or other forces, but just from existence itselfand hed been given that break. The grey clouds had been building throughout his trek across the wastes, sure, but the rain had finally broken when hed needed it most. Perhaps the series of sucker punches was over. Perhaps hope lay ahead.

No, what lay ahead in the rain was something more concrete than that: a body. A man in some sort of weathered uniform lay in the wormy mud, unmoving. Neil studied the body from afar for a moment, and then moved in to see if the man had anything useful. No gun, no journal, no foodhed already been looted. Curiously, someone had left his helmet nearby.

Helmet? Was there a bike around here?! Hope indeed! He rose to lookand a hand grabbed his forearm roughly. The man wasnt dead! Pushing off forcefully, but mindful of Kumari on his back, Neil fought away and stood a few feet back. Who are you?

The man groaned and moved weakly in the mud.

Neil could now see that he had long hair, and a thick stubble. Whoever he was, hed been out here a long time. Hello? Are you alright?

Answering with a vomit to the sidea mess which contained all sorts of unidentifiable bits, including what looked like a bulletthe stranger slowly climbed onto his hands and knees, and then lifted his torso up until he could see through the rain. Im not sure He fell again, but this time on purpose, in order to rabidly eat the worms squirming in the mud around him.

Waiting awkwardly, Neil offered, Hi Not Sure, Im Neil

The response came gruffly. What?

Nothing, he said, in a strange mood. Just my first dad joke. I couldnt resist.

A dad a baby? the stranger asked, looking up at the covered enclosure on his back. His eyes seemed to truly focus for the first time. Oh my god. He looked around with greater energy. Where are we?

I dont know. Neil frowned. Had this man just come back from the dead? He was looking healthier every moment.

Help me up! Pulled to his feet, the stranger asked with alarm, The Grey Riders. You know of them?

Neil nodded. Why?

With deadly seriousness, the stranger looked him in the eyes. Its on you and me now, friend. I have to find my squad, or somebody else with the strength to do something. I figured it out. I know what the Grey Riders want, and they are gravely mistaken. He picked up his helmet and began stumbling off through the rain and mud, looking for his bike.

Whats going on? Did you just resurrect or something? Neil shouted after him, hurrying as best he could without endangering Kumari. Waitcan you help me find my wife?

If theres time! the stranger shouted back. You, me, her, my squad, the Grey Riders, even Her Glorywere *all* in more trouble than anyone realizes.

Catching up to the spot where the man was lifting up a bike from the mud, Neil lowered his pack for a moment and carefully lifted Kumari. It was going to be a harrowing ride with her in his arms, but walking meant being stranded in this place, and being stranded meant death. As he awkwardly climbed on the bike behind his new ally, he said, Im Neilthis is Kumari.

Nice to meet you two, the stranger replied, testing and revving the engine with determination. Im Edgar. </TEXT>

For a time, the bubble of happiness was back, no matter the quakes, storms, and bits of spouting lava rupturing up from the earth outside. They evacuated ever deeper into the farm realities, until there was nowhere left to go; as the situation truly grew desperate and the Crushing Fist began bringing about the end, Jeff volunteered for the Fight at the Capital Temple and did not return, but Marta and the children stayed with them.

The skies were looking stranger than usual, like water was moving behind them, when Ranis father, uncle, and grandmother found them. The reunion was wonderful and sweet, but lasted only until the grey waters of destruction poured across the worlds like a tidal wave. Neil was standing with his tiny daughter in his arms when it happened; by luck, he had chosen a hill for his walk. The high groundand the lone remaining tree he climbedlikely saved Kumaris life.

It definitely felt like the end of everything, but the other families that had climbed the tree alongside him held on and refused to lament or cry. Even the children remained hard-eyed. Neil asked them, Why arent you scared? and one mother responded, After all weve been through, whats left to fear?

Those words struck him somewhere deep, and he waited calmly. The waters would recede. He had faith. There was no other option and nothing left to do but hope.

And, as if by a miracle, the world-washing tide of grey did evaporate. Space itself seemed to stretch and bounce, and thenit was over.

There were no cheers. There was no happiness. Continuing forward was the only path. Climbing carefully down his tree, he carried Kumari back to the flattened site of their former tent and waited. Ranis father, uncle, and grandmother did not return, but he nearly cried with relief as his wife picked her way back across the wasteland and through the crowds of battered people to once again hold her daughter.

The murmurs came over the next few hungry days: the Crushing Fist was over. This was wonderful. The worried whispers followed: there was not enough food for everyone. Calls for volunteers came soon after, and random lotteries to fill out the needed number.

He would always remember that day starkly. Neither his nor Ranis number had been called by the shouting volunteer-men who were standing in the truck bed to be seen over the crowd, and he thought they were home free.

No. The last number, the *very last number*, was hers.

Stay, she told him, desperate. Keep Kumari here.

He refused, and went with her. There were three hundred and fifty billion people slated to leave as part of the New Exodus. Surely it would be like the path they had walked to the camps, he reasoned. As long as everyone stayed together and worked together in good faith, everything would be alright.

But a chill wind began to blow, and the food at these new camps ran out, and none of the Vanguard sent out to find a new home had returned.

As before, seeing the signs, Rani convinced him it was time to go. They packed up what little they had left and left their home yet again. Neil felt little of his old optimism; was *this* what life was going to be like from now on? Was Kumari going to grow up a nomad?

The flood of exiles began, spreading out through natural cracks into the multiverse located by compass chips that had been handed out systematically, and it was Rani who chose their direction. Marta and her children were still with them, then, along with her new partner, a rather unassuming but fit man named Gustavo. Neither Neil nor Rani commented on the time between Jeffs assumed death and this new relationship; life was different now, and such partnerships meant survival. Several other families went with them, adding to their combined capabilities.

It didnt matter. They werent at all prepared for what awaited them.

More or less fleeing the snow and cold, they trooped through numerous forests, plains, and wastelands. The more they separated from other refugees, the more berries and nuts and other edibles they found, so they began naturally spreading out away from the main streams of people. Once on their own, though, they were vulnerable.

One father walked through a rift first, and immediately began screaming and clawing out his own eyes. He stumbled too far in. There was no way to rescue him. From then on, they knew that purple skies meant insanity and death.

Another rift dropped them in the midst of roiling green fog, from which horrible growls and animal screeches emanated. While no attacks ever came while they remained grouped, one child wandered off, screamed, and was never found.

The next world, while a relief from the fog, was a barren open plain, and the falling snow was growing thick around them. They all wore everything they could, but the cold was still biting, and Neil worried often for the daughter bundled in the makeshift carrier theyd built to carry her on his back. It was on this open plain, and under that icy wind, that he began to truly lose hope. The food was gone, his stomach was rumbling, and life just kept throwing sucker punches. How had he gone from that beautiful warm home whose layout remained firm in his mind to *this?* He was a penniless refugee lost in the vast realities of an uncaring multiverse, and all sorts of nightmares abounded to threaten his wife and daughter. To think, there had once been a time where his greatest enemy had been a moody thermostat!

Rani sensed this loss of hope, and did her best to stay close, keep him warm, and encourage his spirits. It worked, mostly, and he laughed at how silly hed once thought marriage was, let alone *arranged* marriage. He might not have chosen Rani himself, but he couldnt imagine any other family now. They had grown and advanced together, becoming one unit, and that bond pushed them forward and kept them safe as the other families with them fell away one by one.

By the time their wandering journey began to feel like eternity, and by the time the strange violet rectangles opened and flickered in space all over the place, only Marta and her children were left. She had formerly been a bit plump, but now her features ran gaunt; what she had held in cheeriness and compassion before now showed as bitter anger and defiance. The last of her tenderness had been cut out of her by Gustavos betrayal over a deer-like animal they had all managed to bring down; hed tried to take the meat for himself, and she had stabbed him in the back with her knife.

After carving up the deer and cooking and carefully preserving its meat, the three remaining parents wordlessly looked at each otherand then at Gustavos body among the ferns.

No. Things werent that desperate. Not yet.

Though they could only imagine the food situation of those that had chosen to remain with greater numbers. A passing traveler had hinted of arms being cut off and fed to children, and the imagery had haunted Neils dreams for daysnot just out of fear, but out of disgusted hunger.

Unhallowed armadas of flying mountains and swarms of black dots began soaring overhead at times, during which the two families crouched and hid in confused terror. There was another force out here, too, equally uncaring: men in grey uniforms who rode past at high speeds. From these, too, they hid.

It wasnt enough. A battle broke out too near, and a stray mortar hit too close.

Marta lost even her defiance after that, leaving her empty. One morning, Neil awoke, and she was simply gone. She had left all of her meager gear behind: there was no need for it anymore.

	<TEXT> Neil Yadav didnt realize it at the time, but hed actually heard the noise once before. The strange screeching sound emanated from somewhere across the nearby creek with the aspect of towering metal giving way, but few of the inebriated guests at the reception took notice.

He took notice.

Where had he heard that sound before? He lowered his drink and stared down to his right as he often did when thinking hard. His gaze happened to fall upon his new wifes dress, and she flashed him a private frown.

Broken from his thought before he could really begin to search his memories, he turned away from her. Arranged marriage was a concept hed always considered a joke, but, here he was, stuck married to someone he didnt know, and for reasons he didnt understand. Some combination of loneliness, overwork, depression, and familial pressure had broken his resolve over the course of the last few years, and now, here he wasmarried.

That icy bitch now had his last name! Rani Yadav. It didnt even sound appealing. He was *married* to that woman.

No!

He took a deep swig of beer.

Yes.

It was done. Hed given up something that felt worthless unto the control of his parents and a community intent on improving social standings, whatever that meant. Was social standing still relevant in upstate Maine? He didnt know the first thing about his supposed inherited culture, and it showed in his ongoing subtle confusion about what he was supposed to be doing; that included many places and activities, and especially this reception. Both sides of the newly bonded family were as much American as they were Indian, and very different from each other besides, so it seemed alcohol was the only thing keeping any socialization going at all.

And where had he heard that noise before?

Walking by himself away from the crowded grassy area and white tables and tents, he stopped at the edge of the creek and studied the light woods beyond. The day was bright, and the weather fair, so any unseen shadows he sensed within he chalked up to the phantoms of regret and anxiety.

He heard smooshing in the mud behind him, followed by an unwomanly curse. Turning, he saw Rani approaching with a lifted dress and a glare.

You have to at least put on a show of being happy, she said fiercely, but low enough so that nobody else would hear. You think Im not acting? I dont know you either, and Im just doing this so my mother wont kill herself.

Uncomfortably surprised, he stared. Really?

Metaphorically, she elaborated, annoyed. Now get your ass back to the party and *look* like youre having a good time.

Following her back hand in hand, he forced himself to smile. He was certain that his life would contain such theatre forever. Indeed, not much changed as he found a new place in the city that was big enough for them bothand the children that both sets of parents, all four sets of grandparents, and the entire extended family kept calling and asking about. Hed grown used to an engineers bachelor life, so living with Rani was strange. Formerly, his nights had been spent alone, in the dark, watching television and drinking soda until all hours. Now, the lights were on and the pizza boxes were gone. His new wife never seemed to stop moving.

Clean this, she would say. Go to the gym, and no it doesnt matter what time it is. Iron that shirt, because you need to look good at work. Take a shower even if you dont feel like it. He chafed under these burdens until his bosses noticed and promoted him at work. It occurred to him that he might be smart at math and science, but dumb at everything else.

And the stream of visitors constantly in his house began to annoy him less. Who were these people? He started slinking out of his man cave and saying a brief hello. Oh, that one was a wife of the local District Attorney. The next weekend, it was the wife of a startup CEO; then both the wife and the husband the week after that, a dinner at which Neil drank too much and actually had fun. He woke up the next morning with embarrassment and a hangover and went to apologize profusely to Rani, but she just hit him playfully and said, No, you were perfect. Powerful people are still just people. Theyll never see us as equals if were all doe-eyed and awed. Getting drunk and slightly obnoxious is the best thing you can do, because its honest and plain. You had no idea who he was, did you?

And, of course, he hadnt known who that CEO was exactly; he chose not to find out. As an engineer, he had unspoken permission from all to focus on his work and ignore the social game in exactly the way Rani needed. Somehow, he was a perfect fit for her desired team of two, especially now that he saw what she was doing. Increasingly powerful people trafficked through their living room as she subtly networked day and night. He was happy to remain oblivious to the wealth and positions of these suited men with their wrist watches and fancy cars, and awkwardly alright with accepting the strange promotions and opportunities that seemed to be popping out of the woodwork.

For some reason, these men and their wives actually liked his obliviousness and cheesy engineer jokes, perhaps because Ranis laughter was slowly becoming real. Though they had never even so much as kissed aside from the weddings obligatory public display of affection, out of newfound and growing respect they had stopped secretly hating each other, and life had taken on the comfort of a deep and easy breath on a late summer day.

It was their first week in their third and much larger home, and he was on the back balcony looking out over the river beer in handwhen he heard the noise again. It was warm out, but a chill passed over his soul for reasons he could not articulate. He suddenly remembered where hed heard it before, this wailing of some distant titanic beast in pain. Hed witnessed stress fractures giving way in the base of a massive crane at his first job, and the true screech of dying metal was unlike anything most people would ever hear. It was *unnatural*, this failure of that which was relied upon not to fail, and he heard it now as he stood looking out over the wooded river behind their home. Something that was relied upon not to fail was now doing so on a scale incomprehensible.

The creek the river these were fifty miles apart, and neither had been near any structures that could possibly have made such a noise. Both eerie emanations had emerged from the empty air itself. Some part of him seemed to know, in that moment, that something was terribly wrong. As an engineer, he liked that the world made sense. Now that it did not, some whisper inside him said *time is short.* He couldnt prove it, couldnt quantify it, couldnt even so much as grasp it, but his instincts reacted with adrenaline and motivation of the kind one might experience on the eve of an oncoming storm.

Their dinner guests had just departed, and Rani was drunk on red wine at a level appropriate for the fun and harmless housewife character she usually played for such people.

Just like that, the new pregnancy erased any concerns he had about that strange noise. His life was suddenly full of family visits and doctors and congratulatory calls and a strange pleasant new intimacy with a wife who was newly very warm and special to himand who actually liked him in return. Drinking, dancing, music, and romance were suddenly part of his existence, and he, for once, felt like he actually belonged. This wonderful cocoon of happiness kept him insulated from fear and worry even as the world began to unravel at the edges.

He began to notice police on his drive to work. At first, he thought it coincidence that he had seen them three times in three days, but he began to grow suspicious as three days became a week, and then two. Was something up? Perhaps police postings had been increased in response to some sort of drug activity, or maybe the threat of riots. He checked his fancy new huge television at home often, but the news showed nothing amiss.

It was just worries about being a father, he told himself, even as he noticed a conspicuous absence or two at work. A fellow engineer had hastily gathered personal items from his cubicle around lunchtime three days before and had never returned. Hed looked tense, to say the least.

When a third such coworker began subtly collecting things in a box, Neil cornered the man and quietly demanded an explanation. What he was told and shown gave him pause, and his colleague of four years ran for it.

Returning home that night with a heavy heart, he found Rani sitting on the couch and rubbing a pebble between her thumb and forefinger, something she often did when she was brooding. Neil, do you remember Janice, the hedge fund wife?

He sat next to his pregnant wife and tried not to let his unease show. Yeah?

She told me somethings going onsomething big. Rani put her pebble on the table and gripped his hand instead. Her husbands been at work trying to manage some systemic financial crisis nobody is talking about. And Xiu told me the District Attorneys office has *her* husband on twenty-four-hour-a-day call for some city-wide police effort.

With a sinking feeling in his chest, he nodded. Ive seen the cops. Theyre all over the place.

She looked down and ran her free hand over her belly. I dont like this at all. I havent seen any mention online of any of this. But Xiu says people are leaving. Not vanishing, not disappearing. Theyre packing up their things and just *going*, and nobody knows where. Theres an entire empty ghetto on the south side. An empty suburb out west.

Blood rushed into his ears as he thought about the impossible things his scared colleague had told him. So the police are trying to protect these people?

She shook her head. Theyre trying to *keep them here.*

He chose a stance of optimistic reassurance. Im sure its some local issue theyll figure out. And if those people do go, its no big deal, right?

She took a few calming breaths, and then looked out toward the balconys glass doors and the river beyond. Everything weve worked forour standing, this house, the moneyit wont mean a thing if everyone else is gone. Some very powerful people feel the same way, and to a much greater degree. Im scared of what they might do. If the ghettos and suburbs empty out, *well* be the new bottom rung, and the focus will fall on us.

What exactly are we talking about here? he asked warily. How much do you know?

She pulled out her smartphone and played a video. Dana sent me this. Told me not to tell anyone.

Taking the phone, Neil watched as a slew of children ran around a brightly decorated grassy lawn. Dana had even opted for a bouncy castle, and the kids were screaming and hopping up and down as one might expectuntil many of them went silent and began turning and facing something off-screen with fearful eyes. Whoever was filming turned the recording to follow their gazes, and the image flickered as some horrible flaring point of darkness came closer over the houses across the street. It was Dana filming with her phone, he knew, because he could hear her screaming and running and directing the kids as she grabbed her daughter and bolted for safety.

He lowered the phone and stared at it as he listened to the adults in the video shout in terror and argue over what they were seeing outside. At any other time, he might have thought this a strange prank on Ranis part. Today, he felt that anxious energy return, sparked again from the tinders lain that night on the balcony months before. The storm had never stopped approaching. He had simply turned away and hidden his eyes.

Is Dana alright?

Rani nodded, her expression concerned. Whatever it was, it floated over them without hurting anyone, but it scared her enough that she said she was going to try to find people that were leaving and go with them. I havent heard from her since.

He fought with the words in his head, but he knew it was time to acknowledge that what he had been told was likely real. Ralph at work says something terrible is coming. Hes already taken his family and gone, too.

Do we stay? Do we go? Rani asked quietly. Wait it out? I dont want to abandon our home and our life because of rumors. Ive just never seen everyone I know get so privately worked up like this.

He gulped before elaborating. He knew the words would end his happy little bubble and take him from this warm home where the electricity still worked, the water still ran, and the beer was still cold. Outside this happy little bubble, there was no way of knowing what awaited, but staying held its own danger. Ralph says Chinas gone.

She frowned, and, despite that negative expression and the tension at hand, Neil still found her distractingly beautiful, an aspect which had only grown as of late. Her words cut through that emotion: Chinas gone?

Ralph says He took a breath to accept his own insane premise. He says somethings rolling across China, devouring cities. Something enormous.

What the fuck does that mean? Rani grabbed a remote and turned on the television. Flipping through channels, she found nothing but the usual reality shows and gossip news. Theres not a word! Picking up her phone again, she did a few searches. Nothing!

There wouldnt be, if the media didnt want to report it, Neil said with a sad shiver. Ralph says his wifes cousin called them from his overseas internshipjust before he died. It was his turn to show a video that hed demanded Ralph send him.

Rani watched as a gigantic tentacled beast rolled across a Chinese cityscape toward the video taker, who stood high on a skyscrapers roof. Around the recorder were dozens of shouting and pointing people. Rani was a strong woman, but even her brown cheeks paled as she watched a city full of people being pulled into the air and devoured in a massive wave. Tens of thousands of screams were audible as a high undulating wave of sound.

She turned the video off and sighed with finality. Were going.

With that decision made, things strangely became easier. Now there were actually plans to be made, things to be done, and supplies to be gathered. The illusion of control eliminated fear. Filling large backpacks that had been intended for a romantic camping trip some months out, Neil prepared as much food, water, and medical supplies as possible. Rani contacted each one of the powerful friends they had made, collecting as much intelligence and understanding as she could. She then inspected the backpacks and reorganized how they were filled to accommodate more items in a more succinct manner.

Sorry, he said sheepishly, but she just laughed and kissed him.

A loud ding broke the momentsomeone was at the door. A quick glance out the window showed a police cruiser pulled up at the end of the driveway. All of their lights were off, for they had intended to arrive unannounced.

Hide those! Rani hissed, pushing him toward the backpacks and pouring herself a quick glass of wine. She donned a perfect facsimile of a tipsy smile and answered the door. Oh, hello officer. Whats up?

Around the corner, Neil stashed the backpacks in a closet and listened as his wife tried to pleasantly talk her way out of a search of the house. The two policemen claimed someone had tipped them off about a break-in, and they *just wanted to search the premises to make sure you two arent being held against your will.*

Neil clenched his fists. It had to have been the calls Rani had made. Someone had guessed that they were about to leave and ratted them out! But *why?* Why were the polite rules of society so quickly melting down into something more base and fearful? As the two policemen pushed their way inside, he resolved to grab a beer and emerge from the kitchen with a fake drunken grin.

But they didnt care at all about his presence. The two men split. One went upstairs. Loud sounds of rummaging came from above. The first man, burlier and older, carefully watched them as he moved around the first floor and prodded things. His search was less invasive and more intelligent. Neil dared not glance at Rani, and he used every fiber of willpower not to look fearful or nervous.

You two seem pretty well off, the uniformed man said, his tone leading. He came to the hallway closet and pushed the jackets around before catching sight of the two backpacks. Hmm, you two going camping? He watched them with hard eyesbut glanced up at the ceiling, where the noises of his investigating partner continued to emanate loudly.

Neil froze at the threatening question, but Rani quickly moved over to the mantle and opened a small vase. He stared as she pulled out a movie-esque stack of bills and darted over. Its all the cash we have, she said hurriedly and quietly.

The cop eyed the ceiling again, and then grabbed the bills and slid them into an inner pocket in his jacket. Closing the closet door, he moved into the living room with them and grinned. None of them said a word until the younger cop upstairs finished and stomped down the steps.

Nothing down here either, the older man said. His partner shrugged and headed out. Following him at a slower pace, their bribed cop turned, smiled again, and said, Have a nice camping trip, you two. Dont be here tomorrow.

And then they were gone, and Neil bent down and clutched the back of a chair to keep from passing out from sheer anxiety. How did you know to do that? Bribe him like that?

Youve *been* to India, havent you? Rani responded, her humor half-hearted and tainted by fear. Even as the cruiser pulled away outside, the ground trembled under their feet for several seconds. He already knew her next words: We have to go *right now.*

Had that been an earthquake? It had been mild, but ominous. After packing the car and getting inside, they both realized they didnt actually know where to go. And who could they call and warn? Family, friends? While Rani manned her cell phone and tried to contact parents and grandparents, Neil found himself driving around almost aimlessly. A suburb had emptied out on the west side, right? He headed for the area, hoping to see something that might hint at where others were going.

It was surreal to see people still going about their lives. Commuting, walking, shoppinghe saw all of these activities going on under the calming embrace of media. Televisions in sports bars showed nothing wrong. The radio plugged along as it always had. None of these people had any idea what was really going on. Had they ever?

As evening approached, he finally saw something firsthand. Rani was still on the phone and looking out the window to the side, but Neil stared as a blob of red scooted across the street in front of his car. That was it: just a seven foot wide pool of blood, moving all on its own, right across the asphalt and down into the sewer. As he rolled up his window and sped past the drain in question, he thought he heard rats squeaking.

His confused apprehension didnt last long. He pulled the car to a sudden halt as he saw a six-person family rush around the corner behind one of the houses. They each had bags of food and water, but it was the look on their faces that tipped him off: it was the same expression he and his wife had shared ever since learning that something terrible was happening. Hurrying her out of the car and grabbing both backpacks, he ran around the same corner. Rani shouted worried goodbyes to her grandmother on the phone as the distorted alley swallowed them.

Not hesitating, Neil pulled her along by her wrist. Ralph had said something about this: Earth was doomed, but only *their* Earth. The forest around them now replaced the spots where houses and streets should be, or would have been back home. Hurrying down a leaf-covered muddy hill, Neil led them both to a worn path. Stepping out from the trees, they found people streaming along. Where were they all coming from?

A ruggedly dressed man with dark stubble stood at one split in the path and continually shouted in an Australian accent. This way! This way! Dont look up when youre in the rifts, you might lose your mind! Upon seeing their approach, he held out a hand. Ey, wait. He called to another few men working on piling supplies a little ways back in the trees. You guys got two extra shirts? Any sortll do. The requested clothing was thrown in short order.

Neil accepted the shirts from the man with confusion. What are these for?

You look like richie types, he told them, his eyes hard. Dont.

Looking around, Neil realized that the people heading down the path past them were not at all the CEOs and District Attorneys he had somehow grown used to. These people had no stake in a society that was nothing but a burden to them, and were thus the first to accept the situation and leave. The wealthy friends he had known would remain at home and desperately hold on to a darkening worldbecause they had to. Beside him, Rani was already tugging the wrinkly shirt over her top. He followed suit slowly, taking off his nice work shirt and tie in favor of his new faded red t-shirt and its soda brand logo. It was, ironically, something he might actually have worn during his bachelor years.

Looks good, the Aussie said. Now get outta here, and keep a low profile.

Thank you, Rani told him sincerely, before joining the stream of people fleeing.

Now that he was the one being pulled along, Neil tried to come to terms with what was happening. Theyd fled their home, yeah, but that had seemed almost like a movie or a game. No! They were really walking down this path, further and further away from home, and they would likely *never go back.* He still intimately knew every detail of the layout of the house, how the couch felt, the chill of the bathroom floor, the kitchens warm smells, the bedrooms comfort, the various emotions of the thermostatand all that was just *gone now?* What was even up this path? Who was in charge here? Where were all these people going? They were all just walking through some unknown forest in what was, by all accounts, another reality. It was possible that there was nothing but starvation and confusion ahead!

A bout of panic gripped himat least until he looked down and saw his wifes hand held unconsciously on her belly as she walked. If it had just been the two of them, they might have taken the chance and stayed, but they had to play it safe nowand playing it safe meant getting out of town with everyone else. As long as they were with all these other people, there would be a way forward.

The path trembled under their feet, and brief shouts and screams rang out from the people ahead and behind on the trail. Leaning against a tree for balance, he made sure Rani remained standing despite her heavy backpack.

She clutched his hand. This place isnt safe either!

Safe, a white-haired and wizened olive-skinned woman told them with a smile. Ahead. Safe. All go. A middle-aged woman and a teenage girl helped her along, glancing their way only briefly.

Four determined men of various ages ran past them, heading the opposite direction of the line, and loud little pings echoed out among the trees. *Gunfire?* The line quickened, but, to the credit of all the random scared people around them, there was no stampede. They moved away from those sounds with organized haste, held at the barest edge of panic by the promise of safety somewhere ahead.

Without warning, they emerged onto the edge of a highway. Looking back and forth, Neil laughed. I thought we were somewhere primordial or something! Looks like civilizations here, too.

Is it? Rani asked, studying the highway in both directions. No cars. Just people walking.

Her suspicions were correct. The populations of the next reality had already fledand the next, and the one after that. Their line of people grew thicker with each passing day, and more men appeared with supplies and directions. These volunteers directed them ever on, ever inward, ever toward promised safety.

That safety turned out to be realities filled with vast farmlands, where camps were constantly expanding to accommodate the displaced populations. It was here that Rani put her skills to work once more. While she scouted out the lay of the social landscape, Neil struggled to put up the complicated tent they had brought. Looks like were going camping after all, he said to the pile of fabric and sticks in defeat. They were safe for the moment, but the trials and tribulations of life remained.

A familiar Aussie accent found his ears. So nobody shanked you on the way, I see. Need help with that?

Neil looked up to see that rugged volunteer again, now with a decent beard coming in. Sure do. The man offered him a rough hand and helped him stand, and then they began to assemble the tent together. You in charge around here?

Nah. But were all in this together. He held out a hand again, this time by way of introduction. Showman.

Neil, he said, shaking the offered hand. Rani would be excited that hed made a guy friend. You from the same Earth as us?

Hard to say, Showman replied, helping him insert and lift each rod of the tents frame in turn. Theyre not so different anyhow. Men are the same, women are the same. It doesnt matter where theyre from.

Neil raised an eyebrow, intrigued by that point of view. His initial thoughts jumped to his overbearing family back in India, with their strict customs and traditions, but didnt they really want the same things as everyone else in the end? Family, security, happiness. He looked around the swelling campgrounds. This was a strange situation, sure, but everyone had brought their families. Security was present simply by weight of numbers and common humanity. Happinessthat one would be up to them. His gaze fell on Rani, who stood talking to several men in a truck.

Beautiful, that one, Showman said behind him. And your better half, I bet. Shes already found the volunteer-men in charge of this entire section.

Neil turned back to his new friend. Yeah. Shes good at that kind of thing.

Keep her safe. Thats your only job. Its gonna take more than you think. The bearded mans gaze went distant and dark for a beat.

Neil steeled himself for the unknown days to come. I will.

Good on you. And then Showman was gone, heading off for more rounds up the rows.

With the tent set up and a private space established, Neil climbed within and lay down on a spread blanket near the two backpacks. It was the first true privacy and rest hed had in quite some time, and it felt amazing to kick off his shoes and socks and lie alone. It occurred to him, as he enjoyed his rare solitude, that someone would always have to stay with the tent to guard their supplies. He didnt dare leave Rani alonedid that mean he himself would always have to be in proximity to the tent?

That was something she had already accounted for. Popping her head in an hour later, Rani said, Alright, weve made friends with the neighbors. Weve all agreed to watch each others tents and gear so we arent stuck sitting and guarding things.

He could only laugh. I see you're right back at it.

You know it! She climbed in and lay on the blankets hed left out for her. Stretching mightily, she yawned and scooted her blankets closer, curling up next to him.

This might not actually be so bad, he said softly. I mentioned Im an engineer to someone on the way in, and he said hed come find me. He said theres food enough from these farm worlds, and systems to deliver

But Rani was already asleep.

He remained motionless for a time, simply enjoying the moment as the chatter and traffic outside died with the falling of night. Funnythat big house, those powerful friends, and all that money had been left behind in an instant, and yet he felt no sense of loss. Everything he needed was right here with him.

Leaping awake, he realized that it was morning, and Rani was gone. Shot through with adrenaline he pulled on his clothes. No, wait, she was just outside talking to someone. He fixed his matted hair as best he could without a mirror and then clambered outside.

Oh, here he is, Rani said with a gracious smile. Your new head engineer.

Dumbfounded, Neil shook hands with three very tired men, one of whom he recognized from an earlier conversation.  He knew better than to undercut Ranis dealings with trepidation, so he just said, Happy to help. What can I do to get started?

The lead man pointed straight down the row. These twoll take you to the control station for this section. None of us know a damn thing about whats going on, but itd be great if you could handle the maintenance and such on the machine systems that distribute the food around. We got nobody over there right now.

Slipping into work mode as he began mentally assessing some of the machines he had seen out in the fields, Neil nodded. Ill check it out. He looked to Rani.

Ill be alright, she promised. Marta and Jeff arent going anywhere for a few hours. She waved to their new neighbors.

He clasped her hand briefly, and then followed the two men down the rows of tents.

The building itself was unassuming, as most worksites were in his experience. A chain link fence surrounded a grey brick compound filled with unidentifiable machinery crafted in shiny chrome and dull metals. Blue-collar men rushed about, trying their best to operate systems based on posted signs, guess work, and career instinct. Glad that he was in his dirty red t-shirt, Neil joined them, first observing the goings-on, and then slowly giving suggestions as he deciphered the use of each machine.

One of the men who had escorted him looked on with approval. We got less than a day before people get antsy. A lot of people showed up with nothin more than the shirts on their backs. Some injured, too. We gotta get the food moving or riotsll start.

Alright. Heading inside the building itself, Neil discovered a series of computer banks being completely ignored. Whats this about?

We dont got the password, his colleague said with a pained frown. Useless.

Damnit. Moving to each station in turn, Neil examined the pictures, notes, and old food wrappers the former operators had left behindwhen? Who had these people been, and why had they left? Judging by the dust, the whole semi-automated system had simply been abandoned months or even years before.

But engineers and operators were fellow souls. Leaving a system like this locked by password was an egregious oversight, one likely ordered by out-of-touch management, and any engineer worth his or her saltthere. He pulled the post-it note from the back of a family picture and grinned. A few typed letters later, the screens unlocked, and he sat with a sigh of triumph.

Back in his element, he clicked through schematics, design documents, and control interfaces for the next several hours. This system was amazing! Underground rail systems kept clean and functional by automatic repair mechanisms, sprinkler and fertilizer frameworks that jutted up from the earth when needed, and site-to-site transportation afforded by what looked like goddamn teleportation facilities. The underground industrial hubs could actually produce portals to other realities! The network extended to numerous other farming worlds, allowing any location to be distributed to by routing out to another reality and then back in from a portal hub on the other side.

This, in short, was *awesome.*

And underground were enormous stockpiles of stored food that the semi-automated system had continued to produce while otherwise abandoned. It looked like the people flooding in could actually reasonably be taken care of. The only question left: who had built all this? That information was very carefully absent from all documents and schematics.

But the first thing to do was get other engineers and technicians on this project. He couldnt very well sit all night and figure this whole thing out himself. Stepping out of the control station, he relayed his findings and needs to the guys, and then headed home as the orange glow of sunset deepened across the vast fields of tents. The current shift had enough information and control now to get the food flowing; more could be done after rest and sleep.

He wandered among the tents, briefly lost, until he caught on to the numbering system that someone had lain out by carving divots in the earth near the main paths. His tent was empty, but he looked for his neighbors, and found a fire in a circled enclosure behind the tents where many families were sitting, drinking, and hanging out.

Rani wasnt just pretend drunk this time. Genuinely having a good time, she held up her glass of red wine. Our new friends brought just the essentials!

He couldnt help but laugh. This was the strangest mass flight hed ever heard of; whoever was in charge at the very top of this effort was doing a very good job. Or, perhaps, it was the common bond of humanity. Things werent horrible, at least not yet, and preserving order was of benefit to everyone. In a curious way, he realized, crime was impossible here. If the food and water and shelter were being provided without charge, what was the point in stealing or hoarding resources? And without the need to steal or hoard resources, violence was useless, and hierarchies of thuggery based on violence were useless. Was this, then, humanitys ideal state? Freed from money, freed from institutional greed, and let loose upon beautiful plains to hang out, drink, and have a good time?

Children ran and laughed nearby, and he watched them for a time, wondering how long this would all last. Would his own child be born into this kind of life? That might not be so bad a fate.

The days and nights passed thus in a blur. The greater situation became clearer, including the layout of the realities they had access to and the natures of certain threats, but those were not his concern. His concern was distribution and machine management, and, at that, even in spite of the growing tremors that threatened to damage things, he excelled. It was hard work, but satisfying, and Neil found himself motivated by the fact that his efforts actually meant something vital to those around him. He was returning home with a smile born of that satisfaction the night things began to change again.

Cutting between the tents to reach the fire circle, he saw everyone gathered around a radio. A womans hard voice rang out among the listeners, punctuated by static. That heat you feel is the strain of ancient machines trying to keep our reality from imploding. They're going to fail, and they're going to fail hard. Do you know what a black hole is? It's when space is pulled down to an infinite degree, and nothing can escape. Everything is pulled in and destroyed. Well that's not gonna happen here. Quite the opposite. When that built-up force finally penetrates the golden Shieldthrough a small hole, the tiniest of breachesit's not going to pull space *down*. It's going to push it *up*, and in. It's going to lance through with tremendous force, and a white hole is going to erupt right into our front yard. And probably near here, considering the number of military bases that have drilled through the Shield for so long."

A white hole? someone else on the radio asked.

Neil moved to sit next to his wife, who was now very pregnant. Whats going on?

Rani shook her head. The Trials taken an unexpected turn.

The static intensified, but the voice continued. Where a black hole pulls everything in, a white hole pushes everything away. A black hole's singularity center can't be escapeda white hole's can't ever be reached, and space will stretch right under us, pushing everything away with forces even light can't overcome. Once it forms, it's too late. Game over.

The broadcast went silent for a few seconds, and then the static grew loud and shrill. The old man nearest to the device fiddled with the controls, but no more could be heard.

Gasps of fear ran through the encircled families as the ground gave a warning tremble. This one was different, deeper somehow, but there was nothing anyone could do. The First Worldthe people that had built all these systems and connected the farming realities; a world locked away behind a golden Shieldwas still a mysterious bastion of unknowns, and Ranis fervently forged alliances and ladder climbing had not yet produced a connection to the official Council that managed the camps in lieu of any leadership from the First World. It was like hearing about a war on the radio and waiting in fear and hope; Fates attention was on others.

But the results of the white hole disaster, once it was over, landed right on their front door. Strange bubbling portals opened the world over, depositing billions of escapees from the destruction of the First World, and Neil found himself suddenly without a job as said portals obliterated the global farming systems with widespread chaos. Not only that, but the sudden flood of billions threw their careful camps and life into disarray. Whoever had saved the First World's people had chosen a farming reality at random, and his had been the unlucky sacrifice.

Neil and Rani knew it was time to abandon their home again. Moving on to another farm reality with their neighbors, they were forced to find a new spot in even more crowded conditions. The earthquakes stopped for small span, but in their place came new threats; those creatures and anomalies that had first threatened their original home.

Life was no longer easy. Neil spent much of his time warily gazing out of his tent, on guard for threats, ready to take his very pregnant wife and run at the first sign of trouble. Around him, bit by bit, the social order began to break down as the situation deteriorated. Gone were the happy times that felt like camping. Yet humanity still worked together out of desperation, and he helped a dozen other men kill the first otherworldly creature to intrude upon their section: a giant four-tusked boar that went down only after a hundred stabs with tent stakes.

Still covered in gore and traumatized, he returned to his tent to find his wife in pain. They werent her first contractions, but they were her last. Marta and Jeff helped rush her to a medical tent, in which he also had a rare opportunity to clean up. Their daughter was born while gunfire and deep booms echoed from the east, where animated statues of soldiers made of liquid mercury were reportedly marching forward and attacking anything that they encountered.

But neither of them cared a whit about that. Their daughter was beautiful, and they named her Kumari.

	<TEXT>  Yeah, the Swedish setting was too topically relevant and out of place for me not to see it coming. Ah well, can't win em all.

I don't normally comment on stories so directly, but this one was full of surreal moments on my end. Especially the breaking news from Sweden like hours later. Believe it or not, the story is actually (mostly) about something else I can't quite discuss yet. It's like The Hungry Invader, a standalone prequel to The New Exodus Vanguard. 

That, combined with NoSleep being a far more direct and simple format that doesn't leave a lot of room for nuance, made me facepalm the next day or two as I read the news.

	<TEXT> Code. Coffee. Apply patches. Coffee. Fix bugs. Coffee. Handle service tickets. Coffee. How is this my life? I suppose I just never thought about what I was doing until, one day, here I was: twenty-eight, an IT professional working in the same Swedish town I grew up in, and a chump slaving away at three in the morning for crap pay on a Saturday night. I had to be awake and back there again at seven, so, at that point, it was looking like another all-nighter.

That was when I got a phone call from my friend, Magnus, who had just gotten out of the bars. Kurt, he slurred. Come on man. That job is killing you. Come to this after-party!

I dont know what made me agree. Not exactly. I remember staring at my half-empty giant mug of coffee. I remember my brain bubbling with caffeinated fire as I thought about the frustration boiling in my chest every day of that goddamn job. Sure, I saidand finally got up from the computer.

The office was dark, and I was alone. The moment that I stopped doing what I was supposed to be doing, the maze of shadowed cubicles became foreign and unnatural. During the day, these small spaces were crammed with busy-bodies. Now, they seemed like empty tombs. I shivered as I crept silently through them. All the while, my brain kept shouting at me to go back to the light of my monitor and back to my work, where it was safe. Did some part of me know what I was about to see?

The parking lot for low-level employees like myself was in the back; the air in the alley bore the chill of winter, but it was not as cold as Id expected. I hadnt been out much in the last few months. I often darted from the building to my car, my car to my house, and back again.

Weve all seen zombie movies. As techniques advanced, the look ranged from silly blue skin-tones and wide eyes in old Romero films all the way to ghastly animated corpses in The Walking Dead. When I saw the shambling creature in the parking lot, my first thought was: *wow, thats really good.* I then began wondering why someone would be dressed like that in the middle of the night. Was it a drunk cosplayer just out from some event? If so, the person within was oddly committed to the role.

But as it approached, one of my senses threw me something I knew to be a huge red flag. It *smelled horrific,* like someone had overcooked exotic foreign spices into burning and putrefying meat. My eyes watered, and I gagged as I backed away. No way someone could go about their day smelling like that.

That was when I first entertained the idea that this *thing* shuffling across the parking lot was actually what it appeared to be. One if its arms lifted, a hand slid forward, and it *groaned*, as if asking for something I could never give it.

Horrified, yes; near-panicked, yes; but the caffeine raging in my system pushed a simple response. I found a thick stray branch from the ground nearby and hit it in the head repeatedly, screaming all the while.

It crumpled and fell.

Pulse thudding in my forehead rather painfully, I stared down at the thing for a momentand then I looked around, wild-eyed, in case there were more. There were always more, right? Where had *this one* come from? But I didnt see any others yet.

With a chance to get a good look at it, I gagged again, but not from the smell. The thing had been a woman, and, under all the rotting gore, I think her hair had been dark. Bits of her skin still held an olive tone, at least those bits that had escaped the bulging black goop oozing from her veins. Her breath rasped in her open throat.

My bastard brain took that moment to ask: *what if shes actually still alive?*

Call someone call someone the police? The hospital? There would be questions about why Id hit her with a branch and nearly killed her. Knowing the media in my country, Id be absolutely crucified for hurting a woman, especially one in medical need.

But Magnus was going to graduate as a doctor in half a year! Calling him in a panic, I described what had happened, and he drunk drove to my work immediately while I went back inside, found a blanket, and put it over the zombified woman.

Pulling to a screeching halt, Magnus got out of his car and handed me a soft white breathing mask. He already had one on himself, which was beginning to soak through from his drunken sweat. Staring at the creature on the ground from a few feet away, he shook his head and said, Ive never heard of anything like this. What is she, a mutant?

No, I told him. Look at the flesh. Shes rotting. Shes *dead.* Shes a zombie!

But thats like, a tentacle there, Magnus said, pointing.

As much as I didnt want to stare at the putrid thing, I didnt agree. Its a strip of her flesh coming off.

Disgusting, in either case. He looked at me. Do you have a plastic tarp or anything?

Thinking back on a portion of the building that was under construction, I nodded, rushed back to get the blue tarp, and returned to find him poking her with a long stick. She groaned and moved slightly, and he rapped her on the head again, which knocked her silent.

I was too panicked to question his drunken decision, but we wrapped her up in a tarp and put her in my trunk. Why my trunk, and my basement to store her in? Because its *your* mess, Magnus told me. If shes lucid at all, she will tell the authorities about the man who hit her on the head in the middle of the night at your work building. Theyll know its you.

Too terrified to protest, I just pushed through the moments, getting her transferred to my basement and chained up as quickly as possible.

Dusty in here, Magnus commented.

Clicking the chains together with a bike lock, I told him, Im rarely home. And then we sealed up the basement door around the edges with plastic and tape to keep in the horrible smell of death and rotting spices. Just like that, we came to have a woman chained up in my basement.

I got each of us a beer from the fridge, and then we sat in the living room whispering fearfully. What was there to do now? That woman looked and smelled dead, but she kept moving; if she was still alive, we were in a heap of trouble. If she was dead then wed found a real live zombie (or mutant, as Magnus insisted) and it was possible we would become rich if we handled this right.

I hadnt thought about that part. Had he?

He left to get medical instruments. If she was alive, we could help her. If she was dead, we could study her.

Meanwhile, I sat in the dark, wondering how the hell this had happened. I drank more than I should have, and some inner darkness drew me back down into the basement to watch her gasping and writhing movements by the light of the one naked bulb down there. Was it true that zombies wanted brains?

I got a few different pieces of food and held them above her face. She held her mouth open hungrily, and then caught each piece as I dropped it. Her jaw moved, and her rotted teeth mashed together, but I was uncertain whether she was able to actually chew. The food disappeared eventually, swallowed by atrophied throat muscles. The zombie drank water, too, though most of it leaked on the floor a few minutes later with a rancid odor.

By the time Magnus came back, I was gently prodding it with the end of a tennis racket, trying to see under its oozing skin.

Its nauseating, isnt it? he asked, setting up his tools on a work table behind me. Shes loathsome. And a danger to our entire way of life. Imagine if she got out, if there were more like her? They might even be out there right now He sipped a small coffee and handed me a large one. Come on, weve got work to do.

We worked through the night, almost exactly like I had planned to do anyway, and learned as much as we could. With gloved hands, he pried out a tooth from her groaning mouth. I held her down throughout, and he also managed to take blood, which entered the syringe already black and milky. While he examined these samples, I cut a bit of flesh from her nose, ear, and arm for testing. The zombie never stopped moving and struggling like a dumb animal that operated on instinct. All it wanted was to get free, and it never once uttered an intelligible word.

Near dawn, we needed more supplies, and it was my turn to go. Heading out into the chilly grey morning, I walked down to the local grocery store, which I knew was the only place open this early. What I saw there chilled my blood far more deeply than any winter breeze.

Numerous putrid zombies like the one in our basement wandered the aisles, chasing after healthy Swedish citizens with outstretched hands. The shelves were in disarray; the ravenous creatures had torn boxes and bags and bottles down in a desperate search for sustenance. Worse, some of the decaying monsters were smallinfected children. My heart sank for them, but they were beyond help now.

I darted into the store just long enough to grab a canned double shot and an energy drink from the end-cap right at the front, and then I ran home with all haste, chugging the double shot on the way.

Magnus!

I burst down into the basementand froze.

He had her cheek splayed open, and, with gloved hands and a masked face, he used metal implements to examine the inner workings of her jaw and throat while she feebly struggled. He continued his examination without looking up. Whats wrong, Kurt?

I must have looked insane, but my message was clear. Theyre at the grocery store! Dozens of them!

That gave him pause. He put away his tools, sewed her cheek back up quickly, threw away his gloves and mask, and joined me on a run back to the market. When we got there, nothing of the carnage I had seen remained, save for the devastated aisles. A surprisingly large percentage of the food had been taken or consumed, but it looked like everyone had gotten away safely. There was no clerk at the front counter, and no clue as to where the zombies had gone next. Shit, Magnus said with a frown. Its time to call the police.

They would not crucify me for what I had done. Not now that it had become a crisis. Totally on board with calling the police, I got out my cellphone while we walked back to the house with wary eyes on the empty street. Yes, hello? Something terrible has happened. There are these What? What would I say? *Zombies?* No, I just needed to get the cops down here to see for themselves. There are *people* down here, lots of them, theyre sick andhungry. And theyre causing a disturbance.

What kind of disturbance? the man on the other end asked. Has anyone been hurt?

Well, no, I told him. But you really need to get down here. Were being invaded, and were terrified!

Look! Magnus shouted, pointing out one up ahead.

It shambled slowly down the street, suddenly lit in bright orange by the cresting of the sun.

Listen, the cop on the line said with annoyance. We cant come down there just because you dont like your neighbors. We have to avoid an incident, no matter what their behavior. Theres nothing we can do about this.

I stared at my phone. He hung up!

But Magnus was no longer beside me. Hed run up and hit the zombie in the back of the head with a stick until it had fallen onto the sidewalk and stopped moving. There cant be many more, can there?

I saw them before he did, and I pointed in horror. Theyre in the houses!

It was true. We could both see them moving around beyond the windows that faced the street. This house, that house, the next they were everywhere! Seeking security, he and I ran back to my house and pushed furniture up against the windows, wondering the whole time whether this was how our way of life would end.

Magnus wasnt satisfied with hiding and waiting. He went down into the basement and began experimenting again, this time with an almost vicious intent to cause pain to the chained zombie woman. If he couldnt stop the hordes outside, he could certainly take out his anger on this one captured example of their kind.

When it feels like the worlds ending, you just want someone to blame. I was with him, for a time, until I drank that one last coffee. It wasnt even very good; left since yesterday, the half-empty pot had chilled and staled. I just drank it anyway because I needed the fix.

The pain started in my forehead, in that place I often felt my pulse, but it quickly became a spark that would have made me scream had I been able to breathe. I knew weaker versions of this sensation well, and I knew it was the caffeine, but Id seriously overdone it this time. My senses began to stutter, and all I could see across my awareness were staccato images of Magnus applying a surgical knife to the zombies scalp, cutting into rotting skinno, bloodied hairno

A woman. A living woman. A terrified woman. I saw a brief flash of her olive skin, dark hair, and tears; a single frozen image on my retinas of her bleeding and wounded and stitched.

She wasnt a zombie.

They werent zombies at all. None of them were.

There was nothing wrong with them.

There was something wrong with *us.*

Id seen people in the grocery store panicking asoh God, the memories had changed too! For a single moment of clarity, I saw hungry families asking for food, hands reaching out in desperation, as other shoppers ran and screamed from what they saw as foreign abominations. I didnt know where these people came from, but we saw them as monsters.

And then it was past. She was a zombie again, groaning and leaking maggots and smelling of rotted spices.

Why?

WHY?!

Who or what could have done this to us?

I rose and grabbed Magnus hand to stop him from carving her any further. Stop! I dont think shes a mutant *or* a zombie. I think were seeing what someone or some *thing* wants us to see.
 
He turned his head and leaned to me, his eyes afire, his hand still clutching the knife. I suspected as much. The glamour breaks down when the pieces become separated and too generic. Her cells, flesh, bloodbecame normal under intense scrutiny.

Horrified, I asked, Then why? I pointed my free hand at the results of his torture. Why *this?*

Remember how we saw them in houses? he whispered. Theyre not just strangers wandering into town. Theyre moving here. *Living here.* Zombie, mutant, or foreigner, a flood of them will still destroy our way of life.

I let him go, and he turned back to his captive.

Id grown up here. Id dated, made friends, built a career, followed traditions

but I hated my way of life

Work, coffee, work, coffee for who? Who benefited from my long hours and mental agony?

It certainly wasnt me.

I turned a blunt instrument on the closest of many deserving targets, not hard enough to kill Magnus, but enough to certainly knock him senseless. I unchained our captive, fought down nausea and revulsion, and helped her to her feet. To me, she still looked like a gibbering corpse, and I doubted we spoke each others languagesbut, by God, this nightmare was going to end.

She didnt bite me. I wasnt sure if she even could, what with all Magnus had done to her jaw, but I was distantly thankful in a way I didnt want to acknowledge. There was still a chance Id hallucinated, and she actually was a zombie.

I thought the nightmare was over once we limped out into daylight and found the street. I actually breathed a sigh of reliefuntil we came face to face with the horde.

Marching down the street, the citizens came in unison, an armed vigilante ocean that kept shouting that they would enforce what the police would not. A crashing wave of zombies shuffled away before them, fleeing, and I found myself swept along.

I shouted that we were being deceived, that some horrible force was holding the wool over our eyes, that we were horribly mistaken, but my former fellow citizens could not understand me. All that they heard was rasping; all that they saw was decay. I had been bitten, and I was now one of *them.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do a hybrid strategy, so hopefully my comments are relevant to both.

**Serializing:**

The website you post on depends on your genre, and that's something you'll have to research. It shouldn't be too hard, though, since you're looking for the most active / biggest site.

It doesn't really matter where your content is as long as it's all in one place and organized effectively. Always link back to your blog and facebook so that people who want to follow you can do so.

It does help to post to big forums / subreddits / sites. That's basically how you access readers.

Serializing is a good way to develop a reader base because it falls under the one big rule of today's self publishing: Consistently Produce Quality Content. As long as you put out good content at a regular pace, such as the same day and time each week, you will eventually catch notice.

**Self Publishing:**

Kindle Direct Publishing and the community on the forums for it are amazing. You should just get on there and read for days. You'll constantly learn new things from seeing real self published authors talking to one another. There are good guides, too.

I haven't used Pronoun.com, but a website can't steal your intellectual property. It's yours. They look like a site that organizes feedback from multiple platforms in order to 'sell' services from editors, artists, etc to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I found the narration style of this arc pretty interesting. It's as if a story is being told around a campfire. We got a lot of "look ahead" moments where the narrator hints at some future events that the heroes don't know about yet. It's pretty different from the other stories in that way.

I'm glad you commented on this. I'm definitely trying new styles now that I'm not restricted to NoSleep's format. Have learned quite a bit from writing this new format. </TEXT>
