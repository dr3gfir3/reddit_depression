	<TEXT>  So basically because FTC rules are inadequate protection

Your statement doesn't seem to have any evidence. 

 the US government gives 0 shits about personal privacy.

No government nor anyone else gives a shit about personal privacy anywhere in the world. This is also easily backed up with a simple search.

 It doesn't take a broadcast engineer to understand that TV networks are regulated by different rules than cable companies, nor does it take a network engineer to understand that Google as a software company is regulated differently than an ISP.

This comparison doesn't make any sense so these are all the words I have for you. For someone that wants their Internet to be unencumbered you sure seem to want a lot of regulation.

If you're super secret, you can use a fresh VM to download Tails from public wifi and then use that at other public wifi spots, with obscured physical features,  while VPNing to a proxy in a non-friendly country proxying to another proxy in a non-freindly county and then exiting via one of the many TOR nodes that are known to exist on the infrastructure at a US Gov agency.

For normal stuff I use ublock origin + clear cache/cookies on browser exit with fairly regular browser restarts. I don't use bookface or twatter and if I do come in contact with those sites, or any site that I log into, then it's a browser restart when I'm done. </TEXT>

In the one I linked, he describes how the current privacy laws are flawed since they apply to Google differently than Verizon. He states he is trying to implement a consumer privacy protection framework that is modeled after the FTC's. 

He discusses his stance on the issue including some details he felt were too technical for other folks to get so they ignored them and left loopholes and that the final implementation needs to be comprehensible by people that aren't "network engineers" (which I used to be).  </TEXT>

"Acosta acknowledged to the media in 2011 that he came under extreme pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team, which included legal heavyweights such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Florida criminal defense attorney Roy Black.

"Acosta said Epstein's defense mounted "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors."

"I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," the former U.S. attorney wrote. He said his office stuck to its opening position in the case, but he also acknowledged that the ultimate punishment in the case may have been more lenient than Epstein deserved."

	<TEXT> I was really wrapped around the axle about the Israel stuff too. Got myself banned from T_D for months for implying ALL Jews don't walk on water and made a few statements similar to your own about which country should be put first.

I think the false choice presented is that you're either pro-Israel or anti-Israel and to not have a position defaults to anti-Israel. I'm open to hearing other perspectives, but from mine, here in DC, working in the mix of it, I'm unable to find an exception to this.

Therefore, in my own best interest, if I must choose a side, I will grudgingly acknowledge that Islam conquering Israel would be a pretty catastrophic event in history that I would prefer to not see.

Being honest, it doesn't matter what my opinion is, especially when it might change, and it won't affect the outcome of events. Just my $.02 from my perspective. </TEXT>

Beyond that, I have a theory that what people call "4D Chess" is really his own way of a building a Rube Goldberg of events to lead to the unveiling of information. This is due to the combination of a few different factors including control, grandeur and probably some  weird sense of destiny.

If you want to have some fun, look up the word 'mosiach' and wrap your mind around the idea that there are people that believe he's going to enable the Jewish Messiah which will usher in a 1000 years of Jewish  rule.

I think there are plausible theories for wanting to avoid beheading, but they may all be staged given the propaganda budget allocated for propaganda (they never said who the propaganda was for), but until I get some good evidence that all the ISIS videos are staged by the US, I'm going to go with the theory that many people, regardless of political affiliation, are going to avoid people that want to cut their heads off. </TEXT>

edit: We stop raising kids as fascists and encouraging them to think that as long as they *think* they are "right", it's okay for them to stop others from speaking.

The ultimate flaw in this strategy is that youth is the opposite of experience and often they lack the skills to look at a complex situation from multiple angles which would lead to a different conclusion about what is "right".

Decorum and plot may be why it's being played out the way that it is despite being so frustrating.

	<TEXT> I perceive both situations very differently than you. The first one isn't homeless hate, it's random dude that poo'ed in my sink hate. It's not definitive that he's even homeless for that matter.

The second one is practical and legal common sense. Most people don't dispute the business owner's perspective that the entry to his business must be maintained to a certain standard lest it put his business at risk. 

Neither anecdotal story conveys a trend of "hate" nor includes considerations such as the availability of homeless services or the level of crime in an area that may lead you to view circumstances differently. 

There really are an infinite number of perspectives out there and even though it may not be readily apparent, most of them are defensible in their own unique circumstances. 

Right and wrong are a bit harder to define when in many cases opposing sides of an issue are both right and wrong in some  aspects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting question. [I looked into it](http://www.irinnews.org/report/82194/bangladesh-acid-attacks-continue-despite-new-laws):

"Despite the public outcry, purchasing acid is still not difficult.

In Dhaka, sulphuric acid can be readily purchased for just 44 US cents a pound (roughly half a litre), with nitric acid slightly higher at 59 cents a pound.

You just ask the traders for acid. They will provide you with the required quantity, Gopal Das, a goldsmith in the citys Tantibazar area, said.

Gopal uses nitric acid to melt gold. Since he only needs a very small amount he has never bothered to obtain the now mandatory license." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   ubiquitously used by pedofiles across the world

But how do we know this without the doc? 

Do you know anyone that admits to being a pedophile? Do they use this symbol? 

Have you ever seen a pedo ring bust? Did the evidence include this symbol anywhere? 

Has there ever been a reference on a website? It's not on NAMBLA's. 

This doesn't speak to the sick instagram posts, twisted videos and other compelling data points, but if the symbols are that ubiquitous than I don't think it's unreasonable to find a single document in addition to what we have to corroborate the evidence. My search continues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No your not. Your shilling. 

Clearly. You can see from my post history I am a hard core shill. 

I have no problem finding the symbol. Finding the symbol on a quarter isn't the same as a source from a law enforcement agency. The only source we have came from a single document WL released 10 years ago. 

There hasn't been another document with the same info available since then? Not one I'm able to find.

Take a second look at your google search; every triangle reference is directly from the doc, the rest of images are pics of logos that have incorporated something similar but most are probably coincidental. 

No one wants to see people arrested more than me but I'm rather surprised at the hostility for trying to trying to find additional evidence towards something we both agree on.  </TEXT>
