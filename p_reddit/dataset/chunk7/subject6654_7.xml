In this application, I used Maguire's Carnauba wax.

Apply the wax, let it dry, then wipe it off with a microfiber cloth.

	<TEXT> I saw that post while doing my research and told myself to stay away from those instructions haha.  You'll read on a lot of forums that it's not about camera quality, but build quality.  Rydeen Duo feels like a rock, and is very solid/waterproof too.  I wouldn't trust a $28 camera for the same job if I want it to look and function as if it were OEM.

I would just get the Rydeen, total for it plus the harness was about $102.  10/10 would buy again. </TEXT>

That being said...  The color match was impeccable, the application was easy and painless.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started a new job with a company that doesn't use a ticketing system, and I have asked my boss if we can implement one..  Not to say that I *like* tickets, but it's a much more unified way to solve user problems instead of everyone coming to the office and making me work on their problem right away.  I've had users fight with each other for my assistance because they came to the IT office at the same time.  Just trying to save myself this reoccurring headache.

What ticketing system do you use/like to use?  Possibly one that ties into AD (not a requirement though).  Can be browser-based OR a standalone app.  

What are your recommendations?

Every time, Lenovo sent out this tech that was in his 60s/70s, had long hair and was legit always high when he came in (red eyes, smelt like weed).  We called him Shaggy.  Then I asked Lenovo to stop sending him.

He replaced a motherboard but still didn't fix the issue.  and somewhere along the lines, he lost a key so he had to come back with a new keyboard.  I told him not to, and to just send me the part to replace myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ha ha...  When coworkers would go on vacation, we'd do funny shit to their desk.  Wrap everything in wrapping paper?  Each individual keyboard key?  You bet.

One of our colleagues left for a better opportunity.  On their last day, we decorated his desk with many, many naughty toys, such as dildos and penis lollipops.  A couple of blow up dolls too.

My favorite prank though?  That'd have to be when one of my team members went on vacation.  Because of the kind of retail Spencer's is, you can get product samples rather easily if you know who to ask.  Long story short, I poured out some of his purell and substituted it with some clear lube.  He's a germaphobe so he uses hand sanitizer constantly.  That was a good one.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.

We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff. We did not get stuck once!!

I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo.  All you need are the right tires and a bit of common sense.

This car amazes me.
