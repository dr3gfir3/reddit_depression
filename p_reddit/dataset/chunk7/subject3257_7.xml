	<TEXT> I drink every day, usually for hours on end and go through ~half a fifth a day. It's awesome, and I love how I feel when I drink. The times I have with alcohol have been some of the greatest times of my life. But my habit is destroying my health and getting in the way, so I feel like I have no choice but to try to stop.

But stopping sucks. I've only been sober for a couple days now, and I already have had to call into work because of how I feel. I don't know if I can tough it out and quit while maintaining my job. And I can't lose my job. Losing my job, with my current position in life, would completely fuck me over, in short. I can't let that happen.

And I also feel disappointed knowing what I have to look forward to if I quit. Before I took to drinking, I used to be addicted to another drug. I used it everyday for years, too. But I quit, and even years later, I still want it really bad. I keep away from it fine, but I know enough by now to know that it's never going to stop and I'm always going to deal with wanting it back.  And inbetween my addictions, I did develop new relationships and hobbies and passions.. but none of those ever offer the sake satisfaction like people said they would. So there's always the feeling knowing I'm missing out in a hell of a lot of fun.

And now I have to add another substance to that feeling. I have to look forward to knowing there's even more out there I can't do, and more pleasure I can't have, and that I'm always going to want it. 

Quitting an addiction is hard, but I think I can do it again. I just wish there was more rewards to it, I guess. Something else to help make dealing with that feeling of want for the rest of my life seem a little less shitty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe this is partly because you were new to sex?

Sex can be a lot of things. I used to get it a lot, and I've.had my fair share of promiscuous sex with randoms I didn't care about. It isn't as fun as when you care about the other person by any means, but personally it was still fun. I still enjoyed it and never felt any sort of bad feelings after a random hookup, regardless of whether they were that attractive or not.

but I can see why some people wouldn't feel right after having sex with someone that's not important to them. It isn't as fun and it doesn't satisfy everything. It doesn't even highlight any of the real reasons why sex is a wonderful and natural thing. It kinda feels like another, but way better, method of masturbation only you get to please someone else in the process too. 

But I don't think I'd feel regret or anything. I might not know myself with enough certainty to be 100%, I don't know, bit I feel like I'm that sure of it. Sorry to hear it lead to harsher feelings for you when you did it.

My only hangup is that I would feel like I was using someone to boost my confidence.

	<TEXT> I get high, or drunk, or sometimes take something else. Or I go for a walk and listen to music. Or I play videogames. Or I just lay around and bask in my loneliness because sometimes I think I like that too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't had sex in a long time. Probably because I haven't been in a relationship in a long time. That's probably because I haven't made friends in a long time.

I just lack the personal connections to develop that side of my life. Mostly because I'm horribly insecure about myself and I've been that way for so long I don't remember how to even "be myself".

I remember one night I met this girl out in town and we realized we used to live in the same town. We spent some time drinking, and it was just one of those lucky nights where I was in that rare perfect state of mind where I could hold a conversation. Things went well, we drank more and more, and so on.

Eventually we found ourselves making out and doing a little fooling around. We didn't have sex, but it was something with someone else all the same. After that, I felt reborn in a way. I was happy the next day, felt more outgoing. Felt kinda like a man instead of a knitted up shell. In short, I was confident. More confident than I had been in years.

But as days went by the weeks started going by and I lost this confidence. I could feel myself losing it every day more and more and it sucked. I haven't found a way to get it back since then.

Fast forward to now. I was chatting with a girl and she confessed she used to like me so much, and she told me she wanted to have sex with me. The issue is I don't like this girl. She's dumb as rocks and she isn't physically attractive to me. But, she's someone. I'm debating taking her up on this and doing the work just to see if that gives me the same sort of rush I had the last time I had a moment of intimacy.

I think, knowing this girl, I could fuck her regularly if I feel the "rush" again afterwards. I could do it and try to maintain that rush for a longer period of time and keep my confidence up. 

Then, while my confidence is up, I could utilize this period of time to be outgoing and build other relationships with people that give me a sense of happiness. And hopefully before the rush wears off I'll have developed enough of a new social standing and become use to it again to be able to maintain it without her.

And I wouldn't feel like I'm using her, since she just wants sex. She isn't looking for a relationship, so she says. And if she develops feelings we'll deal with that when it happens... But honestly I'm not too worried there, I'm more concerned with my own feelings and trying to grasp a chance to pick myself up mentally.

If this can break the constant loneliness am I wrong to do it? Is it too drastic of a means of fixing things? Would it likely just make me develop a new problem? </TEXT>
