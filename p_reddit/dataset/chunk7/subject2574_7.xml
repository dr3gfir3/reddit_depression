	<TEXT> Check out the Alex Verus series.  Divination and diviners have always been on the short end of the useful magic spectrum, but I think the author does a great job with a main character who's magic is useful, but limited, and is outclassed in terms of power by pretty much every magic user in the series.

The main character gets by on smarts and planning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The LCD is a Dell U3415W. It's a 21:9 3440 x 1440 34" dream. I'm mostly looking at code (and recently, Star Wars trailers) at work, so I wanted something that could feasibly replace two 27" monitors. A single super ultrawide 34" did the trick!

Laptop is pretty standard retina MBP from late 2013 -- probably overdue for an upgrade, but works well enough for coding.

Keyboard is a Filco Majestouch Convertible 2 with brown switches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO, even more than "simple to learn, hard to master", Blizzard is known for iterating on their properties and games.  Diablo 3's end game was rightfully panned at launch, but since then, I think Blizzard's done a great job turning that ship around.  

Anyway, based on past history, I think Blizzard is likely to take beta feedback to heart, even if it isn't reflected in release versions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The majority of that review was editorial and should have been presented as such, not an honest shakedown of the game.

All reviews are editorials written by the reviewer. I'd argue a review that _didin't_ consider tits-in-your-face as a large part of the game's appeal is not an honest shakedown.  You may disagree.  This is why more than one person in the world reviews games. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My personal endgame keyboard: Filco Majestouch 2 Convertible with Cherry Browns and Bluetooth </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-27 15:50:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Picture**: http://i.imgur.com/yMzVaYa.png

**Features**: Cherry Browns. Bluetooth. Costar Stabilizers.

So far, I love it. I've been used Filco boards for the past 5 years or so, and this is probably my personal endgame board.  

**Quick thoughts:**

Previously, I used an original Filco Majestouch 1 with the gold label with Cherry Browns at the office.  I also have a matching Filco Majestouch 2 with Cherry Browns at home.   

One of the few things I really wanted was wireless capability.

Compared to the two boards I currently have, the Filco Majestouch 2 Convertible feels exactly the same, which fits my needs perfectly.  In all respects, it feels like a standard Filco wired board *except* that it has Bluetooth.  Nice solid keyboard with my preferred type of stabilizers (costar).

It also has the added benefit of having a removable usb cable since it's "convertible", meaning you can also plug in a USB cable to use it in wired mode.

The actual bluetooth implementation is great.  It supports up to 4 paired devices, switching between them by pressing a key combination and then the 1-4 keys.  This means I can keep my main work laptop, my phone, desktop, and a spare all on the same board.

	<TEXT> There are **200+ customer reviews** (http://www.amazon.com/Rock-Band-Band-Box-Bundle/dp/B00Z9HS664) of the game in its various bundles and platforms.

I can't really muster up any anger for 7 employees that buy their company's own game and then leave (I'm going to assume honest from their pov*) reviews.  Is it kinda scummy they don't disclaim it?  Sure.

Is it worth the moniker of "rogue employee" or indicative of some kind of sinister plot to seed Amazon reviews?  I hardly think so.

 No excuses. Companies are not supposed to reviewing their own products, PERIOD.

Employees will review their company's product all the time because, guess what, most employees are users of their company's product.

Amazon reviews are not press reviews.  They are, literally, reviews by users. That's it. No more, no less.

Yes, disclaiming would be nice. But I'm not gonna lose any sleep over it.

(the "new to rockband" thing is by an employee who isn't a dev of the game, so i can buy that. i mean, i have friends who work at blizzard who have never played WoW or touched StarCraft.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few suggestions, and I'm trying to keep them limted to first person POV books:

- Iron Druid series, similar to Dresden Files, but more light, witty, featuring the best damn dog in fantasy

- The Nightside books by Simon R Green (probably my favorite guilty pleasure novels of all time). Think Dresden with set in London with even more weird shit 

- Secret History books by Simon R Green

- Sandman Slim books. quite a bit darker than dresden, but still has its share of dark and gallows humor

	<TEXT> I don't think anonymous sources aren't inherently wrong -- but it is basically trading on the trust and reputation of the outlet.  

I think the issue with the Escapist piece on Star Citizen was how poorly they handed Chris Roberts' response, and how many holes were poked into Escapist's info subsequently.

Basically, your shit better be tight, and the story that's sourced anonymously better stand up to scrutiny.

In the case of Kotaku's article on Trendy, it was apparently accurate enough for role changes to happen at Trendy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My general take at least re: criticisms that are written in the U.S. for games that are released in the U.S: if it's sold and marketed for an American audience, then it's totally fair to criticize through the lens of an American audience.

That doesn't invalidate other forms of criticismsthere's a ton of writing about gaming that aren't written through the lens of progressive American values.  But I certainly don't think that looking at a game released in a region through that region's cultural mores is _wrong_.  It's just a single facet of what should be a healthy, multi-faceted discussion about games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is a game like Senran Kagura damaging to the industry? I dunno, probably not.  All media have its share of high and low concept artifacts.  For every timeless film you probably have ten late night softcore flicks.  

Is the game sexist? Yes, likely. While it's certainly not the worst of its kind, the game is very obviously geared towards a specific (male) audience.

Do the sexual aspects bring it down?  Probably.  Not so much in the sense that I'm deriding your appreciation of the series, but in the sense that if, as you say, the game actually has strong characterization and nuance in how it approaches morality, then the overt sexualization of its characters and its presentation of those characters limits the possible audience for the game.  And yes, I do think the sexualization makes it harder to past presentation into whatever deeper core the game offers.

(See: Bayonetta 2, and the actual great beat em up mechanics that are hidden behind a presentation that is off-putting to some)

My take? The game is controversial.  Any game like Senran Kagura is going to be (rightfully or wrongfully) criticized in the current gaming climate.  After the events of GameGate last year, and the overall trend to being more aware of females in gaming and larger diversity issues over the past few years, a game like Senran Kagura is not going to just pass by without comment.

If you like it, then that's great! I don't think you are any less of a person for liking the game, and I think any game criticism that goes beyond the game and into criticism of the players of the game is taking it a step too far.  People like different things.  IMO the goal isn't to prohibit what people like. It's to try and expand horizons, increase awareness.   </TEXT>

"I dunno how about some kind of issue that makes it so that she has to wear as little clothing as possible."

"Great! And if anyone complains, we just tell them its part of the *story*, and then they'll feel ashamed for making fun of Quiet's condition."

	<TEXT>  (ostensibly objective) 

if the review is subjective, and the review content is subjective, what makes you think the reviewer's score is objective?

Do you also think that AV Club's grade-school A/B/C/D stuff is an objective indicator of the quality of a show? Or that Yelp stars or Critic ratings are an objective indicator of a restaurant's food?

Numerical numbers is, at its most base, a quick and easy way to tell *if that particular reviewer* liked the game.  That's it.  A game with mostly high scoring reviews? Then there's wide critical acclaim.  A game with a mix of high and low scores? Then there's mixed reception.

This happens in movies literally every time a film comes out, and you rarely see people make a stink about it online.

	<TEXT> Eh, I dunno.

From what I can, most of the recommendations for Spacemacs occurs within the context of selling emacs to an existing Vim user.  In that case, how much value is gained by telling them to forget their built in muscle memory for a system of key commands and patterns that, out of the box, are not super great?

The best part about Emacs is its extensibility in all areas, and I don't know if there's a better way of showing that to a Vim user than Spacemacs.  They get the best of both worlds: a production Vim-like environment with all the niceties that Emacs offers over Vim: background processes, elisp, etc.

(Disclaimer: I don't use Spacemacs, but I have a home grown config using evil to give me a Vim-like environment. I also consider Vim style modal editing and keyboard shortcuts to be much superier to emacs style chording shortcuts) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the restaurant metaphor someone used further in that thread is apt.  To extend that:

Imagine there's this family restaurant called Reddit's Good Time BBQ, and everyone in town goes there.  It's super popular.  It's one of the biggest places to eat out around.  All sorts of people visit, and generally mind their own business.  You eat, you talk to your group, you leave.  

Then sudden a big noisy family comes in, let's call them Fred Coontown, Sally Coontown and their twins Bobby and Sandy Coontown.  They talk loudly.  They talk loudly about hateful things, and call the other members in the restaurant racial epithets.  And maybe it's just them.  Maybe they only show up one day a week, and for most of the time, Reddit's Good Time BBQ is a friendly establishment.

But Fred Coontown and family are gathering attention.  They're loud, controversial, and can't help but occasionally walk over to other tables and start up heinous conversations.  Fred might even call over Sally for support.

It's getting out of hand.  People are complaining.  The Yelp reviews for the restaurant are plummeting, and reputation is at an all time low.  

So what does Reddit's Good Time BBQ do?  

It's basically faced with two choices:

1. Kick the Coontowns out.
2. Leave the Coontowns alone, and let them eat.

Actually, I lied, and everyone was wrong because there's really a third option that no one considered.  In their brilliance, Reddit's Good Time BBQ went with:
