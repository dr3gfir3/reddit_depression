	<TEXT> Thank you. I'm still learning to live with all my problems. It's been 8 damn years but everything's gotten worse in the last year and a half. It's just hard because I was comfortably adjusted and now I have to learn to adjust again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. Most of the time I feel horrible but I agree it is easier sometimes. I find that I try to distract myself a lot to pretend I'm not bothered but it's really hard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played a lot of sims 4, watched tv, ate too much. It was good until like 8pm when I started getting really depressed and questioning my life/existence and had to act fine and couldn't have time alone because we were celebrating my sister's birthday. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Buying from steam and playing on origin </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is it possible to buy a game from steam and then launch it through origin? I want to get some more sims 3 expansions but $20 for each one on origin is a little crazy and I heard there is going to be a summer sale on steam. Do the sims games on steam have a code so I can play through origin? Sorry if this is a stupid question! </TEXT>
