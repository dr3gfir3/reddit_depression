	<TEXT> That is interesting. I guess it is just a rare thing in baseball. It is good if a player gets traded I guess. Those No runs DMC shirts or probably not worth as much. While an Andrew Miller no name jersey can still be passed off as something else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I probably did the wrong thing in picking two good players who had the same jersey number. I was asking if it was possible for people to sell old jerseys as being from a recent player for more money. Let's say Tommy Layne were to get cut and the person who takes his number becomes a star let's say Gleyber Torres gets his number. Is it possible in the future if you were to buy a Torres jersey. You could be buying an old Tommy Layne jersey since he had the same number? </TEXT>

Those people don't realize that the reason porn is on tube sites for free is because someone uploads it there for them. I no longer take part in uploading. Mainly because I no longer buy it so Im not keeping up with the latest videos. </TEXT>
