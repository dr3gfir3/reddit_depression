	<TEXT> I don't usually go through my feed much but it's a lot better now that you can block all the ebola pages and just unfollow everyone that posts stupid shit. The messaging and events is what I mainly use it for nowadays </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm guessing they only want the keys to transfer over to the killer - not sure if they can make it so when it's dropped only the pker can collect it? Idk </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually hid near the muggers in the wyvern cave while I waited for my skulls to dissapear, I only saw like 2-3 other people for half an hour which is pretty good for how populated it was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far i've collected around 15 keys (I didn't screenshot everything but you can see my bank is starting to get cluttered) but It's late, work tomorrow signing off for the night.

Some tips:


- Collect rune talismans for the areas you're roaming (self explanatory why)

- Some of the best loots I've gotten is from searching upstairs where people are trying to hide and wait until their skull is gone, always check around there

- ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INVENTORY ROOM. I've lost 5+ bank keys because they don't drop on the floor, i've lost atleast 5 keys from being stupid

Can't really think of anything else too important. Have fun boys :) </TEXT>
