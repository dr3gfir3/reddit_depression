	<TEXT> Comey sought to *appear* impartial, was still attacked for bias despite his efforts, and gave significant ammo to the GOP to use against Clinton with both his press conference and the vague letter. The public interest in the integrity of an election free from interference outweighs Comey's interest in his own reputation. Likewise, basic fairness requires investigators to shield information obtained through their broad and coercive investigative powers from disclosure if there's insufficient evidence to indict. Comey should have been prepared to take criticism for his decision. He's not an elected official in part so that he can do just that. 

[From the Rolling Stone piece I cited above](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/features/how-the-fbis-james-comey-fumbled-the-clinton-email-probe-w447597):

**His July press conference was highly unusual; as Comey himself noted, the Department of Justice usually refuses to comment on ongoing cases**. But he said he felt it was necessary to speak in detail, directly to the American people, because they "deserve those details in a case of intense public interest."

**Comey bent over backwards in an effort to appear transparent and avoid any whiff of impropriety. Nonetheless, Republicans swiftly condemned him**. He was dragged before Congress three times to reiterate his judgement that Clinton should not be prosecuted. His skewering continued unabated, to the point that he angrily lashed out at a September hearing. "You can call us wrong, but don't call us weasels," Comey told the House Judiciary Committee. "We are not weasels."

**All these failed attempts to appear impartial created the conditions for the firestorm that erupted on Friday**, when Comey  again, in the service of transparency  sent a letter to the the same group of Congress members he'd previously testified before, informing them that he had recently "learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the Clinton investigation."

Comey has not commented publicly on the situation since sending the letter Friday. But, as he made clear in an internal memo dispatched over the weekend, **he was chiefly concerned about appearances.**

"[W]e don't ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed," Comey wrote.

**What he probably should have been concerned about, though, was that he might suggest wrongdoing by Clinton in the total absence of  by his own admission  any evidence at all that she's done anything wrong.**

"[G]iven that we don't know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don't want to create a misleading impression," Comey wrote. It's worth reiterating that last point: **Comey had (and still has) no idea what the emails found on the laptop were, or how they got there**. The FBI doesn't know whether the emails are duplicates of ones that have already been turned over to them. They don't know who sent them, and they don't, in any event, suspect it was Hillary Clinton  the subject of the investigation Comey testified about and the person for whom this information will inflict the most damage.

**Comey concluded by acknowledging that many voters could read something truly damning into his purposely vague letter.** "In trying to strike that balance, in a brief letter and **in the middle of an election season, there is significant risk of being misunderstood**, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it."

**But he cared less about that than he did about the impression his congressional antagonists might have of him**. And in doing so, Comey has earned the one thing he appears to have been trying to avoid: widespread condemnation, from all corners.

	<TEXT> Maybe not WW3, but a theater nuclear war. 

We strike the test site and North Korea's nuclear reactors. NK responds with an artillery barrage on Seoul and along the DMZ. 

Tens or hundreds of thousands are killed.  Intense fighting erupts along the DMZ (if it already hasn't), with US troops already stationed in SK sucked into the mix, possibly demanding futher deployments in support.  South Korea and the US attack Pyongyang with airstrikes and possibly a full-on invasion.  The Kim Regime believes (correctly) that its existence is threatened and attacks South Korea and Japan with ballistic missiles for fear of losing them. Those or possibly an NK airstrike delivers a nuclear attack as well as chemical agents like VX or Sarin. 

The U.S. retaliates against the NK WMD sites and leadership with a nuclear attack from a Trident sub parked offshore. Anywhere from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions are killed instantaneously in the initial and retaliatory nuclear exchanges and their aftermath. 

The Kim Regime is obliterated. But fallout affects the entire region, which combined with the effects of the devastating damage on the most densely populated and economically important region in South Korea (and possibly Japan), plunges the world into a severe recession.

From there, it's hard to predict what the recession, war, and instability might trigger. 

China and/or other countries could potentially impose sanctions on the U.S. for sparking the conflict and using nuclear weapons. There might be a worldwide boycott of U.S. goods. The U.S. could retaliate by raising tarriffs, choking off trade and worsening the recession into a depression. 

Similarly, Japan and SK could potentially withdraw from their alliances with the U.S. and/or announce that they will develop their own nuclear deterrents. China would presumably respond by building up its own nuclear and conventional forces, triggering a regional arms race. China might also see the opportunity in this moment of U.S. weakness to re-take Taiwan. If the U.S. responded and China didn't back down we could get WW3 right there. Or else, maybe Putin decides to make a move in Eastern Europe as the U.S. is stretched and distracted. That could trigger the U.S.' NATO commitments and also potentially lead to WW3. 

Who knows?

A better question would be: why are we even considering opening this can of worms?

	<TEXT> Actually, this Shareblue article is citing an [on-the-record Prospect Magazine interview with Richard Dearlove, the former head of MI6](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/interview-richard-dearlove-europe-intelligence-mi6), not the Sun and Express. 

Here's the relevant excerpt:

Between 1999 and 2004, Dearlove was head of the Secret Intelligence Service, known as MI6, a tenure that included the bruising experience of the Iraq war, the drama of 9/11 and the invasion of Afghanistan. He joined the service in 1966 and in his time he ran MI6s Washington station, the most significant posting in British intelligence and was also overall Director of Operations.

So hes seen it all before. But the allegations that members of Trumps staff had illegal contact with the Russian government during the election campaign are unprecedented, said Dearlove. As for the presidents personal position, he said, **What lingers for Trump may be what dealson what termshe did after the financial crisis of 2008 to borrow Russian money when others in the west apparently would not lend to him.** I also asked Dearlove about Trumps suggestion that the US National Security Agency (NSA) or British Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) had bugged Trump Tower on the instructions of Barack Obama. This allegation was flatly rejected by both organisations and also by James Comey, Director of the FBI, who told Congress in a March hearing that we have no information to support Trumps claim. This is simply deeply embarrassing, said Dearlove, for Trump and the administration, that is. The only possible explanation is that Trump started tweeting without understanding how the NSA-GCHQ relationship actually works.

With that said, Dearlove does not appear to be claiming that he has any specific evidence of the deals, and he hasn't been the head of MI6 for 12 years.

	<TEXT> People could of course allege it was a cover up. And some would believe it. But you'd also have the evidence that the FBI (presumably the fired agents) held off on briefing him to make the revelation more politically damaging. He could still conduct the review, but without the ambiguous letter that permitted Trump to campaign on the worst possible interpretation. When the review confirmed that laptop emails was mostly duplicates and he revealed it, the story would have been a lot less damaging. In the meantime, the story wouldn't be "re-opening the Clinton email investigation" but "pro-Trump mutiny at the FBI to damage Clinton."

In any event, not conducting a preliminary review and sending the letter without knowing what was in the emails was improper. He should have been able to control his people long enough to do that. And if not, that itself is a significant failing.

Here, Republicans would be coming to Democrats for help to pass a budget because the Freedom Caucus is too extreme and the GOP doesn't have enough votes without them.

	<TEXT> After Comeys October surprise, Clintons popular-vote lead over Donald Trump in the polls dropped from 6 points to 3, according to FiveThirtyEight.Republicans grabbed some spiked bats and joined the Comey beatdown. Without additional context, your disclosure is not fair to Congress, the American people, or Secretary Clinton, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa wrote in a letter to Comey on October 31. Look, I think Comey should have said prosecute her back in July. But what he just did 11 days b4 the election is wrong   unfair to Hillary, tweeted Joe Walsh, a conservative talk show radio host and former Illinois congressman. Republican former U.S. Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told CNN that Comey had made an error in judgment, adding: You dont comment on investigations because commenting on the investigation may jeopardize the investigation.

Comey seemed to have pulled off the rarest of feats in politics: He pissed off everybody. Former FBI Assistant Director James Kallstrom said on Fox News that Comeys decision was nonsensical, adding: Its not Comeys right to sully that reputation [of the FBI].

The way the letter was written was incredibly vague and careless, a Democratic operative tells Newsweek. That was a massive hand grenade thrown into the middle of an election that was 11 days away. In addition to energizing Trump supporters, Comeys decision to publicize a tiny advance in a completed investigation angered Democrats because it came while Comey was keeping silent about reports of Russian interference in the election and possible collusion by members of the Trump campaign. In fact, CNBC reported that Comey had declined to sign an October 7 joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence that accused the Russian government of tampering with the U.S. election, because he thought it was too close to when people would cast their votes.

Two days before the election, Comey told lawmakers the bureau had reviewed the new emails and found no reason to change its decision that Clinton should not face chargesbut that was like waving a white paper napkin to stop a tornado. Newsweeks Kurt Eichenwald wrote, America has just witnessed one of the mostif not the mostegregious abuses of power in the service of one mans ego in its history. When Clinton lost to Donald Trump, the fury swelled. She blamed the FBI director for contributing to her defeat and The Wall Street Journal called for his resignation.

...

Last July, Comey took the unusual step of holding a press conference to announce that the FBI would not be recommending charges to the U.S. Department of Justice over her use of a personal email server while she was secretary of state. But instead of fully exonerating the Democrats presidential candidate, he scolded her and said his agents had found top-secret and classified email chains on her servers. Then, on October 28, 11 days before the election, Comey wrote to Congress saying the FBI had found new emails related to the case. Clinton has said the letter had a determinative effect on the election, and critics excoriated him as a self-righteous egomaniac with political motives.

...

Comeys supporters say he remains confident that the decisions hes made have been the correct ones, even those so controversial they have earned him enemies and a review by the Justice Departments Office of the Inspector General. Kelley, the longtime friend who is in regular contact with Comey, says, Hes somebody who does what he thinks is the right thing to do and isnt one who is going to yield on that based on what criticism he might get. Comey said something similar onstage at an intelligence industry event recently: I know that when I make a hard decision, a storms going to follow, but honestly, I dont care.

If the inspector general finds that Comey mishandled the Clinton email investigation, Trump could have an excuse to remove Comey, possibly before the FBIs Russia investigation is finished. On April 12, Trump told Fox Business Network that its not too late to ask Comey to step down, adding, But, you know, I have confidence in him. Well see what happens. Its going to be interesting. Steinbach says Comey isnt concerned about job security: Hes very comfortable. Hes grounded in his family. Hes got a strong sense of beliefs. Hes going to do what he believes is the right thing to do for the country, for the FBI. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Democrats are signaling theyre ready to up the ante after President Donald Trump threatened to end certain Obamacare subsidies  and risk a collapse of the individual market  in a push to make the subsidies a major issue in ongoing government funding negotiations.

Congressional Democrats will seek to create a permanent funding mechanism for the insurer subsidies, which are currently the target of a House GOP lawsuit that claims the payments are illegal because they were not explicitly appropriated by Congress.

The potential showdown over funding the government comes after Trump told the Wall Street Journal on Wednesday that he was considering shutting off the billions of dollars in payments to force Democrats to play along with his efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.

The Presidents comments on stopping the Cost Sharing Reduction payments will increase costs, is a threat to the good health of the American people and a threat to keeping government open, an aide to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) told TPM Thursday in an email.

...

A Democratic Senate aide said in an email that Trumps Wall Street Journal comments put the subsidies front and center of what Democrats will fight for while hammering out with Republicans a deal that will seek to thwart a government shutdown in the weeks to come.

...

The payments subsidize insurers for keeping out-of-pocket costs down for low income consumers, as mandated by the Affordable Care Act. If the payments are halted, its anticipated that insurers would raise their premiums by an estimated 19 percent or exit the individual market entirely.

In addition to the larger market ramifications, some 7 million consumers benefit from the subsidies.

...

This cynical strategy will fail, said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) in a statement. Our position remains unchanged: drop repeal, stop undermining our health care system, and we will certainly sit down and talk about ways to improve the Affordable Care Act.

Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction for the Affordable Care Act, said in a statement that Democrats will not negotiate with hostage takers.

There is no outcome in which the administration sabotaging insurance markets persuades Democrats to pass Trumpcare, a disastrous proposal which would only make our health care system worse, Wyden said.

Trump, in seeking to use the payments as leverage, finds himself lined up against not only Democrats, but major health care industry groups, and even the Chamber of Commerce, which joined a letter to Trump earlier this week calling for the subsidies to be preserved.

	<TEXT> The Rolling Stone piece below, from October 31, explains it well and holds up several months afterward. It's worth reading in its entirety.

Comey's July 5 press conference had nothing to do with Lynch. Rather, Comey was trying to avoid criticism from Republicans in announcing his decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution based on the private email server.

The investigative file and report would ordinarily provide sufficient justification for that decision. At his discretion, Comey took the extraordinary step of discussing the investigation publicly. There are strong norms (and in some cases explicit rules) against that precisely in order to avoid creating the appearance of impropriety even if a decision is made not to press chargesa power with a strong potential for abuse.

He could have publicly fired and censured the people who were purportedly trying to force his hand. If they leaked the laptop email story, he could then have, among other things, publicly disclosed that the FBI knew about the laptop emails for 3 weeks before briefing him, but didn't even seek a warrant during that time. That would clearly justify Comey being cautious to avoid the risk of interfering in the election. He *chose* to send a vague letter (that he knew would leak and be misunderstood) without first doing even a preliminary review of the laptop emailsthe overwhelming majority of which were duplicates of emails that had already been carefully reviewed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couldn't disagree more. 

The July press conference itself was totally improper. Comey's an *investigator*, not a *prosecutor*. If he hadn't editorialized, but simply declined to refer the investigation  to the DoJ for prosecution, he wouldn't have put himself in the position of giving testimony to Congress and then having to supplement it (at his discretion, despite contrary DoJ policies), with the infamous letter 11 days from the election. Don't forget that when he sent the letter, the FBI had already known about the laptop emails for 3 weeks but hadn't even sought a warrant to review them.

Analysis of polling and other data strongly suggests that Comey's letter to Chaffetz*by itself*swung the election to Trump. Comey's internal letter showed that he knew that it would leak and be misunderstood by the public (fact he's now conveniently lamenting). But despite this risk, he sent the letter anyway. *Three weeks earlier*, knowing full-well that Russia was interfering in the election, he refused to sign the FBI onto an October 7 statement from DHS and the ODNI attributing responsibility for the hacks to Russia. 

His rationale? *It was too close to the election.* Afterward, the Trump campaign used the FBI's refusal to endorse the October 7 statement as a way question the validity and credibility of the statement. Yet, Comey stood by and did nothing. He could just have said, "actually, we agree with this."

Now, Comey claims he will do *everything* to warn the public of election interference?

Please. You're a little late.

	<TEXT> Yeah, and there's a good chance that they'll be blindsided by the building anti-GOP wave because of it.

*First*, it's important to remember that the President's party almost always loses seats (or a share of the House, when it was still growing) in the midterm. In 39 midterms since 1862, there are only 3 exceptions to this rule, each presenting unusual circumstances: 1934, 1998, and 2002. 

*Second*, beyond this basic midterm pattern, Republicans also seem to have forgotten that [the President's party tends to get decimated in Congress and at the state level after 8 years of holding the White House](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images/KDK2016111701-table5.png). Any analysis concerning the state of the post-Obama Democratic Party should factor this important long-term pattern before drawing sweeping conclusions. 

With the Democrats' cycle of holding the White House now complete, the political pendulum appears to be jerking rapidly back to the left rather than experiencing a more gradual swing like it usually does. 

The speed of this leftward backswing probably reflects the unusual nature of Trump's election as well as the weakness of his initial mandate. Never forget that Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million, and he was on track to lose it by even more (along with the electoral vote) until Comey yanked the football away 11 days from the election while people were already voting. Before that, the Podesta and DNC Wikileaks dumps dominated media and social network discussion of Clinton, depressing her favorability numbers and limiting coverage of her issue positions (even though she was leading by about 6-7 points before the Comey letter).  

Since then, the FBI investigation announced in Comey's letter has turned out to be a big nothingburger, and the Wikileaks dumps have been exposed as part of a sophisticated Russian propaganda campaign to help Trump win. So we'd expect a return to the baseline level of Democratic support as the Comey and Wikileaks effects wane. 

On top of this reversion to the baseline, there's also the affirmative damage inflicted by the alleged *quid pro quo* and direct coordination between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin. This is a historic scandal and legitimacy crisis that could derail *any* administration. But instead of collecting accomplishments, the Trump Regime has been pouring gasoline onto the raging dumpster firewith its decision to push a hard right agenda without making even token efforts to reach out to the opposition, controversial executive appointments, blatant conflicts of interest, pathological lying and war with the media, historic understaffing, constant infighting and leaking, and shocking ineptitude at basic governance.

The result is an early and rapid erosion of public support that's *unpresidented* in the history of American political polling. Strong GOP partisans are less likely to accurately perceive and interpret this errosion because they're seeing the Trump Regime through red-tinted glasses and judging it against an alternate universe of facts.

*Third and finally*, Republicans may be over-estimating their structural advantage from gerrymandering and making faulty inferences about what that advantage means. They appear to take the success of their gerrymandering efforts as proof of a popular mandate for GOP policies. Yet, polls actually show that signature Republican policieslike repealing and replacing the ACA, tax cuts for the rich, and removing environmental protectionsare highly unpopular. The exaggerated GOP majority in the House just shows that Republicans are good at gaming the electoral system. This is dangerous for them because if the swing we just saw in KS-04namely, a +20 to +25 shift toward Democrats (depending on your assumptions about incumbency advantage)were to happen nationally, gerrymandering will actually start to backfire and take out a disproportionate number of GOP incumbents.

Take a look at these simple projections of what the House might look like on the [high](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2016_2_Houseb.jpg w=480) and [low](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/politics/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/04/2016_3_TC.jpg w=480) end of this swing. The relatively steep (inelastic) region likely shows the gerrymandering advantage whereas the relatively flat (elastic) region shows where small changes in the vote will take out a large number of GOP incumbents.

Obviously, that person would have to be one of Trump's subordinates, since he's too busy playing golf, watching Fox, and tweeting to be bothered with actual Presidenting. The subordinate would then have to develop a sensible counter-strategy and persuade the Orange One to adopt it. In light of all that, I don't find the delay all that unreasonable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read a few really good articles addressing this issue:

----

**Washington Post:**
[Why would Assad use sarin in a war hes winning? To terrify Syrians](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/04/11/why-would-assad-use-sarin-in-a-war-hes-winning-to-terrify-syrians/?utm_term=.ab7817b8b2a6).

and 

**New York Times:** [The Grim Logic Behind Syrias Chemical Weapons Attack](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.html)

and

**The Guardian:** [Syria nerve agent attack: why it made sense to Assad](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/07/syria-nerve-agent-attack-why-it-made-sense-to-assad)

----------------

Although it appears that Assad didn't use chemical weapons purely out of military necessity, there are several reasons why such weapons could be seen as useful if he misperceived or miscalculated what the American response would be. Assad didn't know that there would *necessarily* be retaliation for the Idlib attack. He could have thought that he could get away with using nerve gas in light of the Trump Regime's apparent abandonment of the US policy to pursue regime change in Syria, or because Congress previously blocked President Obama's request for authorization to conduct a retaliatory strike when Assad used nerve gas in Ghouta in 2013.

These weren't totally unreasonable assumptions on his part.

Recall that, just a little over a week ago, people like Tillerson and Spicer were publicly signalling that the U.S. would acquiesce to Assad remaining in power, which the New York Times characterized as a "remarkable reversal of American foreign policy...[b]y any measure." *See* [White House Accepts Political Reality of Assads Grip on Power in Syria](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/us/politics/trump-bashar-assad-syria.html?_r=0 referer=https://mobile-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.amp.html?amp_js_v=9) (March 31, 2017):

President Trump has abandoned the goal of pressing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power, marking a sharp departure from the Middle East policy that guided the Obama administration for more tha
n five years, the White House said on Friday.

With respect to Assad, there is a political reality that we have to accept, said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.

The United States has profound priorities in Syria and Iraq, and weve made it clear that counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of ISIS, is foremost among those priorities, he added, using the acronym for the Islamic State.

In a sense, Mr. Spicers comments  and similar comments on Thursday by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations  have merely made explicit an assumption that has guided the Trump administrations policy toward the region in recent months.


According to the New York times piece linked above, Assad has been pursuing a strategy to demoralize the opposition by conducting ruthless attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas. You can't really run a long-term insurgency without popular support. Civilian populations are less mobile and equipped to resist a chemical attack than armed rebels, so they're an easy target. To the extent the rebels are hidden and conducting guerrilla warfare, a government can punish the population they're hiding among in order to undermine the viability of the insurgency. As we've seen from the horrifying images out of Idlib, nerve gas can be a highly effective weapon of terror. If "rebellions are built on hope," Assad's goal with the attacks is killing hope. Showing that he can get away with them without any consequences from the international community might even have been part of his calculus.

	<TEXT> Seems like this was discovered by a review of previously-collected SIGINT:

**The US military and intelligence community has intercepted communications featuring Syrian military and chemical experts talking about preparations for the sarin attack in Idlib last week, a senior US official tells CNN.**

**The intercepts were part of an immediate review of all intelligence in the hours after the attack to confirm responsibility for the use of chemical weapons in an attack in northwestern Syria**, which killed at least 70 people. **US officials have said that there is "no doubt" that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is responsible for the attack.**

**The US did not know prior to the attack it was going to happen, the official emphasized.** The US scoops up such a large volume of communications intercepts in areas like Syria and Iraq, the material often is not processed unless there is a particular event that requires analysts to go back and look for supporting intelligence material.

...

So far there are no intelligence intercepts that have been found directly confirming that Russian military or intelligence officials communicated about the attack. The official said the likelihood is the Russians are more careful in their communications to avoid being intercepted.

...

For now, the official said the most specific evidence of Russian involvement remains a Russian drone that flew over the hospital that was treating people injured in the attack. The US has specific intelligence showing it was a Russian drone. While the drone operator may not have known why the aerial vehicle was flying in the area, it was a Russian-controlled asset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. Seeing roughly the same amount show up in multiple places raises serious suspicions. 

"Following the money" means looking at what was exchanged at each stage, who benefited and who paid, and laying it out on a chronological timeline. And, if companies were involved, you always have to figure out who owned them, who was associated with them or with their owners, as well as what assets the companies held and disposed of. As you do this, the nominal form and false characterizations of various transactions tend to fall away and reveal the substance of what *actually* happened.

	<TEXT> ...Dogged by revelations about past financial dealings in Ukraine, Mr. Manafort retreated from public view.

But behind the scenes, he was busy with other matters. Papers were recorded that same day creating a shell company controlled by Mr. Manafort that soon received $13 million in loans from two businesses with ties to Mr. Trump, including one that partners with a Ukrainian-born billionaire and another led by a Trump economic adviser. They were among $20 million in loans secured by properties belonging to Mr. Manafort and his wife.

The purpose of the loans is unstated in public records, although at least some of them appear to be part of an effort by Mr. Manafort to stave off a personal financial crisis stemming from failed investments with his son-in-law.

They also shine a light on the rich real estate portfolio that Mr. Manafort acquired during and after the years he worked in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort, often using shell companies, invested millions of dollars in various properties, including apartments and condos in New York, homes in Florida and Virginia and luxury houses in Los Angeles.

...

The source of the money for the real estate purchases is not clear, and Mr. Manafort never filed lobbying registrations for his work in Ukraine that would have disclosed his compensation. Such registrations are necesssary for activities that involve influencing policy and public opinion in the United States, and some of Mr. Manaforts Ukraine work appeared to fall into that category. Anti-corruption officials in Ukraine say $12.7 million in off the books cash payments were earmarked for him in a handwritten ledger kept by the political party of the deposed strongman Viktor F. Yanukovych. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shareblue has a [clearly disclosed partisan viewpoint](http://shareblue.com/company/):

Shareblue is an American media company. **We produce practical, factual content to** ***delegitimize Trumps presidency, embolden the opposition, and empower the majority of Americans to fight.***

They're not pretending to be neutral. And they're not. But they're not making shit up either. That's what distinguishes this from fake news. 

Here, they quote the relevant statement from Trump, provide a direct link to a video, and give their interpretation of it. 

I'd add that I don't find their interpretation to be off the wall. Trump's statement does read like a thinly-veiled threat (especially since Trump actually [seems to believe to this day that Comey *helped Clinton*](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-comey-clinton-bartiromo-interview-2017-4)):

BARTIROMO: scratching their heads why so many Obama-era staffers are still here. For example, **was it a mistake not to ask Jim Comey to step down from the FBI at the outset of your presidency? Is it too late now to ask him to step down?**

TRUMP: **No, its not too late. But**, you know, **I have confidence in him. We will see what happens**. You know, **its going to be interesting.**

If you *do* interpret this as a thinly-veiled threat, it's not unfair to characterize it as a threat in the headline. 

Maybe it wasn't intended as a threat? You could also read this as an impulsive and badly-worded statement by Trumpeven if it's less plausible. But the thing people don't seem to get is it's not a Democratic news source's job to help the Trump Regime by giving him the benefit of the doubt. It's on him to speak more carefully and be less belligerent if he doesn't want his ambiguous statements to be construed negatively.  </TEXT>

Democrats have a 24-seat deficit (22 if they win these special elections), and the average midterm loss for the president's party is over 30 seats. The president's party has lost seats or a share of Congress (when the House was growing) in 36 out of 39 midterm elections starting with 1862. In 2006, with Bush at 38% approval, Democrats took 30 seats in the House and 6 in the Senate to flip control of both chambers.

The Senate is harder in 2018 but could well be in play in a wave like 2010 or 1994. Democrats will have to defend their incumbents and take Arizona and Nevada. That would leave them one seat short because of Pence's tie-breaking vote. For outright control, they will need to unseat Cruz in Texas. That's not impossible. He's unpopular, widely disliked, a first-term incumbent, and people have been talking about Texas turning purple for a long time.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [T]hese are both districts that have given GOP presidential candidates 60-plus percent of the vote in recent years.

Democratic wins in either wouldn't be unprecedented. Massachusetts had just given Barack Obama 62 percent of the vote before Brown won it in 2010, and Mississippi's 1st District also gave George W. Bush 62 percent before Democrats picked it off in 2008. (The Louisiana seat went 59 percent for Bush.)

But these special elections were shocking upsets that preceded wave elections for the victorious parties. The fact that Democrats couldn't defend the bastion of liberalism that was Massachusetts in 2010 and that the GOP couldn't hold conservative districts in the Deep South in 2008 presaged very bad things for the party in power.

	<TEXT> Oh, I don't know... 

How about providing ongoing direct military support to prop up an autocratic regime as it uses nerve gas on civilian populations it purports to rule, [despite having advance knowledge of those attacks](https://www.apnews.com/19772be1238e49fbb62c509a5b659b3d)and then aiding and abetting the attacks by, at minimum, [running a propaganda campaign to blame others and sow doubt about what occured](http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-explanation-for-syria-chemical-weapons-attack-2017-4).

I don't think you'll find any US allyespecially not in NATOdoing those things.

	<TEXT> You don't have to like Clinton or Trump. Nothing I said is inconsistent with you despising them both. 

Yet, when you say that we should be **thankful** that Clinton is not Presidentand Trump *is* *actually* President because of that factyour *de facto* preference for Trump is clearly implied.  

If not, **what would there be to be thankful for**?

Suppose you think Trump is worse than Clinton on the issue of Syria. You wouldn't be thankful Clinton is not President because you'd consider what she would likely have done to be a better outcome. 

On the other hand, if you were totally indifferent between Clinton and Trump's positions on this issue, it also wouldn't make sense to be thankful, since you're getting something that you considered just as bad under Trump. 

Thus, logically, thankfulness must imply *at least* a slight preference for *at least some aspect* of what Trump has done as compared to what Clinton would likely have done.            

I'm not making anything up. I'm merely taking you at your word.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends what you mean by this going down.

Clinton *was* in favor of a coherent overall approach to the Syria problem, which included no-fly zones and ground safe zones enforced by an international coalition, as well as increased diplomatic pressure on Russia for.supporting Assad. She backed Obama's plan to conduct air strikes *with Congressional authorization* back in 2013 to retaliate for Assad's earlier sarin attack in Ghouta.

I agree that there would have been a retaliatory response to the Idlib gas attack under Clintonassuming that attack had still happened. We don't know whether the air and ground exclusion zones would have already been in place or whether they'd have been effective. Similarly, we don't know whether Assad would have conducted the attack if the Trump Regime hadn't been [signalling, not a week before the attack took place, that they were OK with him staying in power](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/64dgcr/z/dg1dkj6).

But, for the sake of argument, let's assume that the Idlib attack happened exactly as under Trump, I think we'd have seen personal criticism by Clinton of Putin for his support for Assad. A call for tightening sanctions, and probably a request for Congressional authorization to conduct coalition strikes on Assad's airfields used to attack civilians. Even if the strike were limited to the Shayrat airfield. I think we'd have seen the sarin itself destroyed, and the runway targetted so that there wouldn't be planes taking off some 12 hours later.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're shifting the goalposts. In your original comment, you said that we should be thankful Trump is President because if Clinton were, we'd already be at war with Russia. That's an outrageous and completely unsupported claim. 

Even if we accept the goalpost-shifting, Clinton didn't call for massive strikes in Syria. [Her website is still up](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factchecks/2016/01/17/the-truth-about-clintons-record-in-syria/). Check it. She actually thought about these issues during the campaign and provided her positions. Her transparent and specifix outlined proposal makes a lot more sense than what we've done so far or the muddied and equivocal message we're now sending. We still don't know what the Trump Regime's position is.

In essence, if you look at the outline on her campaign site, Clinton favored a multilateral approach including no-fly zones and safe zones on the ground enforced by an international coalition, as well as increased support for Assad's opponents and increased diplomatic pressure on Russia. She did not want WW3. You're repeating a Kremlin-sponsored talking pointI presume unintentionally.

	<TEXT> That's such utter nonsense. No one wants a direct conflict between the U.S. and Russia, which could end human civilization. Even limited strikes to deter future chemical weapons use by Assad have a nontrivial risk of escalating. 

Why would we thank having a hot-tempered know-nothing narcissist with the attention span of a gnat making decisions and managing the situation instead of someone who understands the complexity of the world and had actually thought in a rigorous way about the Syria problem *before* the current crisis arose? Sorry, but there's nothing to be thankful about here.

For all the talk of Clinton's hawkishness, here we are, on the brink of another Middle Eastern (or worse) war under the candidate who was supposedly going to prevent it with a singular focus on "America First."

	<TEXT> Some solid game theoretic strategic analysis in this article:

However justified and morally satisfying, any use of military force is serious business, and even those limited strikes could lead the United States and Russia down an escalatory path.

...

If the United States goes down this road, the prospects of a military confrontation with Moscow are real. A few thousand Russian military personnel are distributed across Syrias key military bases. Moscow has also placed some of the worlds most sophisticated air defense systems in Syria, and Russian planes police Syrian skies. So an extensive U.S. campaign aimed at coercing Assad by targeting Syrian air bases and command-and-control facilities would run big risks of killing Russian troops on the ground. The same holds for a no-fly zone, which would likely require targeting Syrian and Russian air defenses and could lead to air-to-air incidents between Russian and U.S. jets. Under any of these circumstances, the prospect of spiraling conflict is enhanced by Moscows decision to suspend the deconfliction channel between the Russian and U.S. militaries.

Compounding matters, in an effort to generate counter-leverage, Russia and the Assad regime are likely to respond to further U.S. strikes or a no-fly zone by reorienting their integrated air defense network toward U.S. and coalition aircraft engaged in fighting the Islamic State or by attacking opposition areas in northern Syria, where nearly 1,000 U.S. troops are on the ground. This could derail the counter-Islamic State campaign at the very moment when the militant groups capital, Raqqa, is under assault by U.S.-backed forces. And it could put the lives of American service members in jeopardy.

**There are also significant escalation risks even if the Trump administration** doesnt go down this path and **sticks to the narrower stated objective of deterring further chemical attacks.**

According to news reports, before the strikes, Trump was briefed on options to retaliate against Assad. One was to launch saturation strikes aimed at dozens of Syrian airfields and facilities, with the goal of destroying Assads ability to use his air force to carry out further chemical attacks. (This option was similar to the one reportedly contemplated by President Barack Obama in 2013.)


At the urging of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and national security adviser H.R. McMaster, Trump rejected this option in favor of cruise missile strikes against a single air base. This option was reportedly viewed as proportional and much less likely to kill Russian soldiers. (Although around 100 Russian troops were reportedly stationed at Shayrat, the administration warned Moscow ahead of time, and the missiles struck the portion of the airfield away from Russian barracks.)

In other words, **Trump chose a limited strike package precisely because he and his advisers understood the grave risks if the United States attacked a broader set of targets.**

**But therein lies a major dilemma for Trump moving forward. Successful deterrence requires a credible threat to hit Assads forces again if the regime continues to use chemical weapons or commits other transgressions**. Yet Trump, **having already rejected a larger military response** out of apparent recognition of the dangers, may find it **difficult to credibly signal he is willing to deploy this option in response to further actions by Assad down the line.**

***In this context, the danger of miscalculation is real.*** **The Syrian dictator (perhaps prodded by Russia or Iran) may attempt to test Trump again, hoping to prove the president is a paper tiger. And Trump, having invested his personal credibility in standing firm, may find himself psychologically or politically compelled to respond, despite the very real risks that it could result in a direct military clash with Russia.**    </TEXT>

Obama could've also tried a recess appointment between the 114th and 115th Congress (that would only last a year though and then Trump would get to fill Garland's seat on the DC Circuit). Most controversially, there was an idea to confirm Garland on January 3rd before the new class of Senators was sworn in. Garland and Obama may simply not wanted a part in any of these gambits.

	<TEXT> He's not wrong. 

Just about a week ago, people like Tillerson and Spicer were publicly signalling that the U.S. would acquiesce to Assad remaining in power, which the New York Times characterized as a "remarkable reversal of American foreign policy...[b]y any measure." *See* [White House Accepts Political Reality of Assads Grip on Power in Syria](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/us/politics/trump-bashar-assad-syria.html?_r=0 referer=https://mobile-nytimes-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.amp.html?amp_js_v=9) (March 31, 2017):

President Trump has abandoned the goal of pressing President Bashar al-Assad of Syria to leave power, marking a sharp departure from the Middle East policy that guided the Obama administration for more tha
n five years, the White House said on Friday.

With respect to Assad, there is a political reality that we have to accept, said Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary.

The United States has profound priorities in Syria and Iraq, and weve made it clear that counterterrorism, particularly the defeat of ISIS, is foremost among those priorities, he added, using the acronym for the Islamic State.

In a sense, Mr. Spicers comments  and similar comments on Thursday by Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and Nikki R. Haley, the United States ambassador to the United Nations  have merely made explicit an assumption that has guided the Trump administrations policy toward the region in recent months.

Assad didn't need to use chemical weapons for purely military reasons. But he's been pursuing a [strategy to demoralize the opposition by conducting ruthless attacks on civilians in rebel-held areas](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/world/middleeast/syria-bashar-al-assad-russia-sarin-attack.html), and showing that he can get away with these attacks without any consequences from the international community.

 Nerve gasas we've seen from the horrifying images out of Idlibcan be a highly effective weapon of terror. Assad may have thought, in light of the Trump Regime's apparent abandonment of the US policy to pursue regime change in Syria, and Congress having blocked President Obama's prior request for authorization to conduct a retaliatory strike when Assad used nerve gas in 2013, that he could get away with using it again. 

This won't have been the first time that a country potentially misinterpreted a muddled signal from the U.S. In 1991, comments by the US Ambassador to Iraq [may have been taken by Saddam Hussein as signalling that the US would turn a blind eye to an invasion of Kuwait](http://foreignpolicy.com/2011/01/09/wikileaks-april-glaspie-and-saddam-hussein/):

U.S. Ambassador April Glaspie told Saddam, [W]e have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. The U.S. State Department had earlier told Saddam that Washington had no special defense or security commitments to Kuwait. The United States may not have intended to give Iraq a green light, but that is effectively what it did."

The Trump Regime's muddled message may have contributed to something similar here.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least 86 people in the northwestern town of Khan Sheikhoun were killed Tuesday in a chemical attack that left hundreds choking, fitting or foaming at the mouth. Eyewitnesses and a monitoring group, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said Saturday that fresh attacks on the area  now a virtual ghost town  had killed one woman and wounded several others.

...

Residents cowered in bedrooms and basements throughout Saturday, underscoring the apparently unchanged threat they faced from the Syrian governments arsenal of rockets, barrel bombs and other weapons that have resulted in a majority of the conflicts half-million dead.

...

 The missile barrage is the first direct military action the United States has taken against Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government in the six-year-long conflict. Although Trump warned of possible further intervention, the Pentagon has said no other strikes against government targets are in current plans.

Although American officials predicted that the strikes would result in a major shift of Assads calculus, they appeared to be symbolic in practice. Within 24 hours of the attack, monitoring groups reported that jets were taking off from the bombed Shayrat air base once again, this time to bomb Islamic State positions.

There were also reports of Syrian government and Russian airstrikes across the provinces of Damascus, Aleppo, Idlib and Daraa, all killing civilians. However, there were no reports of further use of chemical weapons.

The American strikes did nothing for us. They can still commit massacres at anytime, said Majed Khattab, speaking by phone from Khan Sheikhoun. No one here can sleep properly, people are really afraid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right that they could do it now, but the optics aren't quite right.

Think about what it would mean. Right a.fter nuking the SCOTUS filibuster to ram through a historically unpopular President's nomination, turning around and nuking the legislative filibuster too in order to add seats to the SCOTUS. Then ramming several new nominations though for the newly created seats. 2018 would be a bloodbath.

As for the 2018 Senate map, it's bad, but it's also a midterm. No better time to defend seats as the opposition party. In fact, in 1970, with Nixon at 58% approval and 13 blue Senate seats in states he won in 1968 (Trump won 10 states with blue Sen seats up in 2018), Dems held losses to 2 and gained 12 seats in the House. At this rate, Trump could be at *much* lower approval than 58% by November 2018assuming he's still even in office and not living in exile in Moscow. 

In all likelihood, the Dems probably can't get past 50:50. But in a historic backlash wave election like 1994 or 2010, it's totally doable. Just need about 5% of the electorate to switch sides, some D outrage turnout, and some normal.R dissillusionment.

That can all be done by statute without a constitutional amendment and an 11 or 13 judge SCOTUS would reduce the excessive influence of individual justices as well as the sort of gamesmanship McConnell pulled to steal Garland's seat.   </TEXT>

**Dr. Abdel Hay Tennari** administered the antidote to sarin, pralidoxime, left over from 2013 attack and victims immediately got better:

After a chemical attack killed over 1,000 people Eastern Ghouta in August 2013, the field hospital in Idlib province where Dr. Abdel Hay Tennari works scrambled to get stocks of Pralidoxime and Atropine.

Pralidoxime is the antidote for Sarin, says Tennari  referring to the deadly nerve gas considered a weapon of mass destruction. The hospital was only able to secure a limited number of doses of Pralidoxime due to both its high cost and the difficulty of obtaining it. Instead they bought thousands of milligrams of the much cheaper Atropine, which can be used to counter moderate cases of Sarin poisoning.

Those stocks helped save lives on Tuesday. Tennari, who spoke to TIME by telephone from Idlib, says hes sure the deadliest chemical attack in Syria in almost four years was the result of Sarin or a highly similar gas. The 22 patients his hospital received on Tuesday showed clear signs of a nerve agentdifficulty breathing, weak muscles and constricted pupils. But more importantly, he says, he gave Pralidoxime to the five most severe cases and they responded almost immediately to the antidote. (Pralidoxime can also be used as treatment for other types of nerve agent poisoning, such as Soman and VX)

[AFP: 'The first thing that hits you is the smell'](https://correspondent.afp.com/first-thing-hits-you-smell)

**Munzir Khalil**, head of Idlib's health directorate, said on Wednesday that medical workers were struggling to cope as the number of victims was expected to increase.

"We can confirm the names of 74 people killed," he said, "but the hospitals expect the number to rise to 107 because many have gone missing and we suspect they have been killed in the attack."

Khalil said at least 557 people were wounded in the attack and transferred to medical centres and field hospitals across Idlib, in Syria's northwest.

"I can say almost all of Idlib's medical facilities include victims of yesterday's attack. Not to forget, air strikes destroyed a central hospital in Maaret al-Numan on Monday, a facility that once took care of up to 30,000 patients a month.

"That hospital is now out of service and we are in a state of shock."

A 14-year-old resident of the attacked town, **Mariam Abu Khalil**, said she had left home for her examination on the Quran  scheduled for early morning because fewer bombings were expected then  when the attack took place. On the way, she saw an aircraft drop a bomb on a one-story building a few dozen yards away. In a telephone interview Tuesday night, she described an explosion like a yellow mushroom cloud that stung her eyes. It was like a winter fog, she said.

Sheltering in her home nearby, she saw several residents arrive by car to help the wounded. When they got out, they inhaled the gas and died, she said.

...

Rescue workers from the White Helmets civil defense organization said that many children were among the dead and wounded. **Radi Saad**, who writes incident reports for the group, said that volunteers had reached the site not knowing a chemical was present and that five of them had suffered from exposure to the substance.

While chlorine gas attacks have become almost routine in northern Syria, this one was different, medical workers and witnesses said. Chlorine attacks usually kill just a few people, often those trapped in an enclosed space, and the gas dissipates quickly.

This time, people collapsed outdoors, and in much larger numbers. The symptoms were different: They included the pinpoint pupils of victims that characterize nerve agents and other banned poisons. One doctor posted a video of a patients eye, showing the pupil reduced to a dot. Several people were sickened simply by coming into contact with victims.

...

Witnesses to the attack said it began before 7 a.m. Numerous photographs and graphic videos posted online by activists and residents showed children and older adults gasping and struggling to breathe, or lying motionless in the mud as rescue workers ripped off victims clothes and hosed them down. The bodies of at least 10 children lay lined up on the ground or under a quilt.

A few hours later, according to **several witnesses**, another airstrike hit one of the clinics treating victims, who had been sent to smaller hospitals and maternity wards because the areas largest hospital was severely damaged by an airstrike two days earlier.

[NYTimes](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/middleeast/syria-gas-attack.html?_r=0 referer=http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39500947)

Turkey on Thursday said the first conclusive evidence of the use of chemical weapons had been found in three victims of the Tuesday, who had died in Turkish hospitals after being brought from Syria for treatment.

The Turkish justice minister, **Bekir Bozda**, announced that the results of the autopsies confirmed that chemical weapons had been used, the state-run Anadolu news agency reported.

The postmortems were conducted by officials from the World Health Organization in Adana, southern Turkey, along with officials from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, Bozda said.

Later Turkeys health ministry said 31 people injured in the attack who had been taken across the border showed signs of being exposed to the nerve agent sarin.

Evidence was detected in patients which leads one to think they were exposed to a chemical substance [sarin], the ministry said in a statement.

The medical results from Turkey came as the Syrian foreign minister denied his government used chemical weapons in the attack. He also denied Syria had ever used them, even though reports from UN investigators have confirmed previous chemical attacks by both the Syrian government and Islamic State forces.

...

The postmortem results add to mounting evidence that the attack involved deliberate use of chemical weapons by a Syrian warplane. Aid agencies, including Mdecins Sans Frontires and medics in Turkey, said patients showed clear symptoms of exposure to sarin.

Rescue workers have gathered soil samples from the scene of the attack and sent them to western intelligence officials to determine precisely what nerve agent was used.

...

Witnesses said at least one Syrian warplane dropped bombs on Khan Sheikhun at about 6.30am on Tuesday. Shortly afterwards, first responders were overwhelmed with patients suffering from acute breathing problems, foaming at the mouth and writhing in pain.

	<TEXT> It doesn't seem like some of the commenters actually read the article, or at least didn't read past the point where the author says that Trump is exploiting the situation (he is).

Here's the thrust of her argument: 

As for the left, a group of people I think of as my comrades, we sucked in our response. 

We went from horror at the chemical attack to screaming about illegal war and monstrous overreach by Trump when he launched a few missiles to avenge the poisoned. We claimed the strike was illegal (sure, maybe it was, but, dead babies scorched by Sarin gas....), we claimed innocent civilians were targeted (they werent), we claimed it was the beginning of all out war with Russia (no evidence of that at all). We yelled that he rejected refugees and if he really cared about Syria, he should have treated Syrian refugees with respect (he doesnt care, clearly, and the Syrian people dont want to be refugees in America, they want to live safely at home, without a butcher at the helm of the army). 

What we didnt do, was recognize that the laws banning the use of chemical weapons need to be enforced somehow. And that is only going to work if there is military might behind them. Sure, I wish an international coalition led by Europe was working hard to destroy Assads air arsenal and remove him from power, I wish there were international sanctions against Russia for assisting this murder spree of the Syrian people, I certainly wish it wasnt Trump who got the credit for finally doing the right thing. 

But it was the right thing. 

If we continue to refuse to acknowledge that, to fail to point out the clear political failure that let Syria turn into a bloodbath in the first place, to call Trump a warmonger instead of the political opportunist he is, we have failed our movement and this moment. 

And we have failed the Syrian people. But, to be honest, thats just more of the same from all of us. 

In other words, what she's saying is not that "the left" fell for Trump's dog-wagging, but rather, that it reflexively fell back on criticism of Trump for warmongering while failing to recognize that, despite Trump's opportunism, retaliatory action was still necessary.

I don't agree with her argument for several reasonsespecially in light of how innefective the strike apparently was (didn't even disable the runway). I'm just relaying it.

There needed to be a response to thatthough not necessarily the one Trump chose, which is looking increasingly ineffective. 

I doubt that Trump would get this reaction without the attacks fresh in the background. 

As it becomes clear that there's no viable follow up plan, the media will become more skeptical.

	<TEXT> Great headline, and true.

[President Obama on McConnell's successful hack of the basic accountability mechanism under the American Presidential-Congressional system](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/obama-reckons-with-a-trump-presidency?mbid=social_twitter):

"Some of this is really simple and its the thing that **Mitch McConnell figured out on Day One of my Presidency**, which is **people arent paying that close attention to how Washington works**, he said. They know there are lobbyists, special interests, gridlock; that the powerful have more influence and access than they do. And **if things arent working, if theres gridlock, then the only guy that they actually know is supposed to be in charge and supposed to be helping them is the President.** And so the very deliberate strategy that Mitch **McConnell and the Republican Party** generally employed during the course of my Presidency was effective. What they **understood was that, if you embraced old-fashioned dealing, trading, horse-trading, bipartisan achievement, people feel better. And, if people feel better, then they feel better about the Presidents party, and the Presidents party continues. And, if it feels broken, stuck, and everybody is angry, then that hurts the President or the Presidents party.**"   

I like to call this **McConnell's Law**. 

The underlying principle can be distilled as:

People who swing and decide elections don't pay as close attention to politics as those who read this sub. They will blame the President and his party when things don't work. The effect is magnified when the President's party controls Congress and when the President is unpopular. The exceptions are few and far between.  

McConnell has used this insight cynically to extract the maximum partisan advantage he can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I agree with you here overall. However, to be fair, the chemical weapons were intentionally avoided to prevent releasing the chemicals in an uncontrolled way. Which from my limited understanding of the chemical compound and how it reacts, makes a good deal of sense.

I think the area was intentionally avoided to prevent Russian casualties and the uncontrolled release. From my understanding, the two components (binary agents) of Sarin are stored separately. If they are released separately, they don't have the neurotoxic effect. Once mixed, the sarin has a short shelf life. Mixing and containing the mixture are supposed to be relatively complicated. So destroying the storage facility would have been worthwhile. There were also supposed to be chlorine gas on site, which would be toxic without the need for mixing. 

 ...and mainly by (4) the potential lack of follow-up options. I also don't trust Trump's basic judgment or competence to manage this situation.

 But then we get to this point... Sounds like they could just load up what they can of the stuff and relocate it. Was Trump thinking about what the following steps would be here? Probably not. He was probably presented with a briefing of current info, given 2 or 3 options, and told to pick one.

I agree. He switched positions just yesterday, and has the attention-span of a gnat. He didn't take part in the planning in any detailed way. He picked among ready-made options. 

I don't trust his judgment in selecting options, and I'm especially am concerned that he probably didn't think three, four steps down the line. In other words--if I pick this option, and the Russians or Syrians do X, what will my range of options be?

The likely choices moving forward are basically backing down or a significant escalation. Russia has said it will help further upgrade Syria's air defenses. And it's moving warships into the region. We'll have to see what happens next. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had mixed feelings about this strike since it happened.

On one hand, I had problems with (1) it being done unilaterally, (2) without Congressional approval, (3) while leaving the sarin storage area intact, and mainly by (4) the potential lack of follow-up options. I also don't trust Trump's basic judgment or competence to manage this situation

With all of that said, I was willing to wait and see.

 I've been horrified by the brutality of the Idlib nerve gas attack and [had thought](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63xk5o/z/dfxw3p8) this retaliatory strike wasn't a terrible move to at least signal that there would be direct military consequences for hitting civilians with nerve gaseven if it was mostly symbolic and wouldn't substantially degrade Assad's *ability* to conduct such attacks. The idea behind such a strike is that it might make Assad hesitate to use nerve gas having seen the bad PR, our willingness to retaliate, and not knowing if our next strike might ratchet up the consequences. Not using chemical weapons might seem to him like a path of least resistace under this scenario. So in theory it could have a limited deterrent effect.

Now, with this report the airfield was left intact, I'm pretty convinced it was not worth the effort.  

Runways can obviously be rebuilt, regardless of how they are targetted. But I'm appalled that the strike **didn't even put them in an inoperable state for a full day**. Given the limitations of tomahawk cruise missiles, it seems like they needed to drop heavy earth-penetraring bombs or specialized anti-airfield bombs, like the Durandal. They might have hesitated to do that because of the risk of flying manned bombers over advanced Russian air defenses and the increased risk of Russian casualties on the ground. Yet, the fact that we're only willing to use cruise missiles creveals to Russia and Syria that we don't actually consider this to be a vital issue. We're not willing to endanger the assets that could actually get the job done. That's not a very effective deterrent. It sends the wrong message and allows Assad to act knowing what he can expect.

In order to not look innefective, Trump may now be forced to escalate beyond what he felt initially confortable doing. So this initial move could build a momentum of its own. That's not good. If we weren't ready to do it right from the outset, we would have been better off doing nothing.      </TEXT>

But I think that warning Russia was the better of the two options given the potential for escallation.

	<TEXT> I [continue](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63xk5o/z/dfxw3p8) to have mixed feelings about it. 

For starters, I wish it had been done multilaterally with Congressional authorization. I'm concerned with whether there's a coherent follow-up plan for what comes next. But I can't bring myself to fully disagree with what was done. 

Although symbolic, this seems better to me than doing nothing in the face of the [horrific Idlib gas attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/63w8a4/z/dfxlbne). It won't have a substantive effect on Assad's *ability* to attack civilians with nerve gas. The question is whether it might affect his *willingness* to do sowhich I think depends on the Russian response.

I'm no fan of the Trump Regime. But, politically, the Orange One benefits from this move.

Without evidence, I don't buy the "Putin had Assad do this so Trump could respond and publicly distance himself from Russia in order to distract the public from Russian election interference/collusion" conspiracy theory.  (Not implying that you subscribe to that theory, but I've seen it on here.)

Rather, I think being President continuously affords opportunities to be Presidential. Trumpor someone advising himseized this one. The Pentagon is good at planning and executing these kinds of strikes. It's unavoidable that some of this institutional competence will reflect on Trump by association even if he just chose an option and had nothing to do with the planning. 

The President's ability to set the agenda, especially with foreign policy, is one of the office's most significant powers. Yes, this distracts from Trump's scandals and allows him to change the subject. Maybe that was the point here. Or maybe it was just driven by the factual reality of the situation and people like Mattis and McMaster.  

Whatever the motive, on balance, I still think this was not a terrible move.                </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my hot take. Maybe I'm misreading the situation, but on the scale of shit I was bracing for, this strike actually seems pretty restrained. 

I would've liked to see a multilateral response, preferably through the UN, with at least some Arab countries involved.

They apparently notified Russia before the attack to avoid casualties and potential  escallation (at the risk of Russia relaying the  warning to Assad and making the strike less effective). On balance, that was probably a good call. But no similar forewarning was given to our allies (reinforcing the go-it-alone approach). Not good.

We'll have to see whether this strike was a one-off symbolic slapdown, or part of a broader policy to (1) stop nerve gas attacks on civilians, (2) stop attacks on civilians more generally and force a political accomodation with the rebels, or (3) replace the Assad regime. If it's the last, we still have no idea whether this policy is coherent or realistic. Whatever the policy is, though, right now would be the ideal time for Trump to anounce a change of heart on his cruel anti-refugee policyhe has perfect cover to pull a 180 with the Idlib attacks fresh on everyone's mind.

Finally, we'll have to see how Russia, the Syrian Government and Rebels, China, our Allies, and the world at large reacts. 

I have mixed feelings. But I lean toward *something* needing to have been done. Not sure if this.  Still need to digest.

	<TEXT> The point isn't to turn a profit. It's to provide *humanitarian refuge*. Fleeing your home country under threat of violence is deeply traumatic, and adaptation takes timeand when they get here they face the same additional difficulties, such as skill and language gaps, and potential discrimination, that [foreign-born workers generally  face](http://www.economist.com/news/finance-economics/21709511-too-few-refugees-not-too-many-are-working-europe-refugees-sweden-are) (even when legal). When we accept them, we accept the responsibility to help them make this transition successfullyor we should.

I'm reminded of [this story in the WaPo](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-nebraska-syrian-refugees-find-a-warm-and-welcoming-community/2017/02/05/5615c82a-eb9b-11e6-9973-c5efb7ccfb0d_story.html?utm_term=.db2d8012fd2c):

Here in deeply conservative Nebraska, President Trumps executive order banning refugees and people from seven majority-Muslim nations elicited complicated feelings about the states relationship with refugees. Many Nebraskans had supported attempts to keep the country safe but still wanted to show their heart for people fleeing terrorism and war. Their state has taken in more refugees per capita than any other.

...

During the past two years, more than half of the 1,531 refugees resettled by Lutheran Family Services of Nebraska left the nations affected by the ban. They have settled 21 families  116 men, women and children  from Syria.

Nebraska has long been a draw for refugees. Unemployment is low, rent is affordable, and manufacturing and service jobs are plentiful, according to Lacey Studnicka, a program development officer at Lutheran Family Services.

... John Dutcher, a 61-year-old house cleaner, lives in a complex of low-rise apartments in a [Omaha] neighborhood where American flags flapped on porches. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Dutcher said he was one of those guys who would want to put a pigs head on a mosque. I never acted on it, but I played it in my head.

I hated Muslims, he said.

For years, Dutchers neighbors were meth addicts and rowdy alcoholics. Slobs. In June, a Syrian family who spoke no English moved in. Another family moved in after that, then another. Now there are six.

Soon enough, Dutcher said, empty bottles in the hallway were replaced with childrens bicycles. The loud arguments of a drug-addicted couple were replaced by the sounds of childrens laughter.

The Muslims here were all about family and they just loved everyone, Dutcher said. I remember the people who lived here before; they took for granted everything this country gave them. These people, they really changed my heart.

Through interpreters, he learned about the families stories of loss and fleeing war. It softened his stance on Islam and led him to question some of what Trump was saying. Around refugees, he never felt safer.

I used to be afraid when the meth addicts were here, he said. Now I dont even look to see whos knocking on my door. I know it will be someone with a plate of food or a kid asking me to fix his bike.

Dutcher said he continues to support Trumps views on strong borders and curbing illegal immigration, but said his experience taught him that refugees were a different thing entirely.

I like him, but I dont like the way hes carried out this ban, Dutcher said. I didnt think hed make a blunder so fast.

For the right wing militia groups, since there's no betrayal of the US in favor of a foreign power, [rebellion](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2383) or [seditious conspiracy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2384) seem to fit better and are very serious in their own right.

	<TEXT> Let's be clear. 

This is abject moral cowardice by the Trump Regime.

The protection he's supposedly offering is from a threat that already poses [10 times less risk of death than killer vending machines](https://twitter.com/FT/status/826470867945283584).

And again, we're talking about the *difference* in protection between the [rigorous vetting procedures that currently exist](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/29/us/refugee-vetting-process.html?_r=0) as compared to supposed "[extreme vetting](http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/03/27/heightened-scrutiny-of-iranians-shows-trump-administration-extreme-vetting-in-action-travel-muslim-ban/)" (*read*: arbitrary and symbolic measures, sometimes with ulterior motives, that make the successfully-terrorized *feel* safe).  Given the role of domestic radicalization in terrorism, policies like extreme vetting may actually be making us *less* safe by fomenting resentment and hatred.


We know from DHS Reports both that: (1) [country of origin is not a reliable indicator of propensity to commit terrorism](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3474730/DHS-intelligence-document-on-President-Donald.pdf) and that (2) most terrorists are [radicalized domestically well after initial entry](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3474730/DHS-intelligence-document-on-President-Donald.pdf).

Meanwhile, horrific acts of terror are being committed by Assad against people to whom we can easily provide help and refuge:

	<TEXT> It had already been reported that McConnell interfered with disclosure of the Russian meddling to the public. 

After evidence came to light that Russia was conducting more than generalized interference to discredit the process, but had instead purposefully helped Trump, Obama apparently wanted to disclose this fact.

[Mitch McConnell stood in the way](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/obama-orders-review-of-russian-hacking-during-presidential-campaign/2016/12/09/31d6b300-be2a-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.a16e9f9e6626):

According to several officials, **McConnell raised doubts about the underlying intelligence and made clear to the administration that he would consider any effort by the White House to challenge the Russians publicly an act of partisan politics**.

I wonder whether this report today is a more specific version of that very same event, or a separate instance of cover/interference by McConnell.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That would be nakedly political even for them. Dems could just change them back.

Plus, it would probably take 2/3rds of the Senate to do it.

The way the nuclear option works is by saying the 60-vote requirement would unconstitutionally raise the confirmation threshold beyond what's specified. That precedent is now set. You can't say that 51 votes is unconstitutional to re-institute a 60-vote threshold because that makes no sense. You'd have to put in place a new rule as an affirmative proposal. But Dems could nuke that when they come  to power even if they couldn't block it (which they actually can).

	<TEXT> In perhaps his most public moment on the committee, he grilled FBI Director James Comey and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers during a hearing early last month about how they knew Russia interfered to help Trump rather than just to undermine the US democratic process.

He used a sports analogy to demonstrate his point.

"My wife's Red Raiders are playing the Texas Longhorns. She really likes the Red Raiders. But all the rest of the time, I mean the logic is that because he [Putin] really didn't like ... Clinton, that he automatically liked Trump," Conaway said. "That assessment's based on what?"

Comey replied that the FBI's assessment that Russia wanted Trump to win was "based on more" than the fact that Putin didn't like Clinton. But he acknowledged that that was "part of the logic."

If you like the Red Raiders, Comey said, "whoever the Red Raiders are playing, you want the Red Raiders to win, and by definition, you want their opponent to lose."

Conaway replied that "we don't know exactly when you guys decided" it was the case that Russia preferred Trump. He argued that the intelligence community's January report on Russia's election interference - which concluded that Russia interfered to "undermine the public faith" in the US democratic process - seemed to differ from their conclusion in early December that the Russians interfered specifically to help Trump win.

...

Nunes, who was leading the Russia probe at the time, echoed Conaway's assertion that the intelligence community had changed its assessment from December to January.

"I don't agree with that," Comey replied. "We didn't change our view from December to early January."

So it's [your] statement to us then that the FBI was consistent in it's assessment that [Russia] intended to help Trump, that's your testimony this morning?" Conaway asked.

"Correct," Comey replied </TEXT>

That includes investigating the nature of **any links between individuals associated with the Trump campaign** and the Russian government, and whether there was **any coordination between the campaign** and Russia's efforts.

Both of the bolded categories encompass Trump, if he participated in any of the conduct being investigated.

	<TEXT> Republicans started this norm erosion and descent into hyper-partisanship. They made the first moves and are far more obstructionist overall. 

After packing the federal courts with conservative judges under Reagan, they didn't want Clinton to have a chance to undo their project. Every President has had it worse since then. Yes, Democrats retaliated against Bushbut if they hadn't, Republican gamesmanship would be permitted to succeed without challenge. When Obama came in, Republicans didn't react proportionally to what had been done to Bush or try to de-escalate the situation. They instead took obstruction to a whole nother level. There were almost as many filibusters of nominations during the **first 5 years of Obama's Presidency** as during the entire history of the U.S. Senate. Rather than an extraordinary measure, filibusters became a routine Republican tool (that, evidently only they get to use). 

In 2013, Reid took action to counter this unprecedented level of obstruction. But he nevertheless preserved the SCOTUS filibuster. Republicans can now try to blame him and cry crocodile tears for the demise of long-held Senate traditionsbut they are the ones who brought about that demise. 

The stats (through 2013) tell the story:

[Number of filibusters in each 2-year Congressional session \(through 2013\)](http://m.motherjones.com/files/filibuster-dead-01_0.jpg)

	<TEXT> He's under a counter-intelligence investigationwhich is even more seriousand any wrongdoing discovered will *automatically* be evaluated for whether it violated any criminal laws (such as espionage, bribery, or treason). 

Don't take my wordas Comey put it:

As with **any counterintelligence investigation, this will also include an assessment of whether any crimes were committed.** 

Counter-intelligence investigation means they are deploying one of their most elite units, who normally hunt spies, to investigate the Trump-Russia ties. Spyhunters have powerful tools that ordinary criminal investigators may not. They'll then turn over the investigative file to FBI lawyers to determine if the conduct they uncover violated criminal laws. A criminal investigation would simply use another unit to perform the initial the investigatory atep.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way the nuclear option works is, someone raises a point of order, noting that the 60-vote requirement to invoke cloture (*i.e.*, end debate on the nomination before the  Senate) is unconstitutional because it has the effect of raising the confirmation threshold from 51 to 60+ votes. The Presiding officer of the Senate agrees that it's a constitutional question and puts it to a vote by the full Senate, which then rules on the objection by a simple majoritypresumably affirming the point of order. The former rule is then gone. 

What makes it "nuclear" is that it would normally take a 2/3rds vote to change Senate rules mid-session through an affirmative proposal. This move avoids that requirement because it's raised as an objection to an attempt to filibuster (*i.e.*, defeat a cloture motion with 41+ votes).          </TEXT>

Bannon was demoted from the NSC. The NSC is where the Nunes leaks came from. The people who did the leaking, Ezra Cohen-Watnick, John Eisenberg, and John Ellis, almost certainly didn't hatch that too-clever-by-half plan on their own or carry it out without approval. My hunch is that it was Bannon's idea or at least he signed off on it. When it was exposed, and Trump's numbers went South, Bannon was politically weakened. McMaster and/or Kushner then saw their opportunity to make their move. I can see McMaster explaining how disastrous and improper the whole thing was, criticizing Bannon, and Kushner (the innermost circle) backing him in light of the numerous recent political failures.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His statements are all bluster and bungling and bosh. Our commander in chief is not in full command of his emotions or facts or geopolitics.

We may sometimes think that the absurdity of Trumps endless stream of contradictions and lies ends at the nations borders, but it doesnt. The world is watching, and the world is full of dangerous men who see killing as a means of maintaining and exerting power. They see in Trump a novice and know-nothing, and they will surely test his resolve.

Trump has exposed himself to the world as an imbecile and burned through American credibility with his incessant lying. Even many of our allies seem confused and worried about where we stand and how we plan to proceed.

Trump is full of pride, obsessed with strongman personas, and absent of historical and geopolitical perspective. This is the worst possible situation. The man who could bring us into military engagement is woefully deficient in intellectual engagement.

...

...The Syrian and North Korean problems are complex and cant be solved by a simpleton. Every action produces a reaction. Every lever you pull risks a life  or many.

This is not about Trumps ego, even though Im sure he believes that it is. It is about whether this draft dodgers ignorance and insecurities could haphazardly plunge our country  and indeed the world  into an armed conflict. The King of Chaos isnt suited for the steady navigation of crisis. </TEXT>
