**Cinema science vs. the facts**

Hollywood is known as the dream factorythe place where the best and brightest creative minds produce films that entertain, inspire and yeseven educate. But what happens when movie magic is made at the expense of scientific fact? Well watch films that tackle science on the silver screenfrom stoically serious blockbusters to outrageously campy cult classicsand hear from Museum experts as they put these movies under the microscope to determine what the filmmakers got right... and what is better classified as creative license. Join us on this sometimes shocking, often hilarious and always illuminating journey into Reel Science!

Reel Science takes place the first Wednesday of the month, from September through May, at a Cleveland Cinemas location.
