	<TEXT>  The second G6, however, was so damn impressive that it made me hate the Pixels mediocre sound output. I hadnt noticed how pedestrian the Pixel was in that respect until the radically superior Korean G6 showed up. Thats my definition of a killer feature.

Personal preference thing, but as someone who has had wireless charging capable phones in the past, I'd take an upgraded audio experience over wireless charging any day. Even with Samsung's fast wireless charging, I've always had a preference towards plugging the phone into a quick charging brick. That said, when it comes to sales, there's more money to be made selling wireless charging pads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since these are 2016 figures, I doubt the Pixel has anything to do with it. It didn't have many retail channels to give Samsung much competition. Also, it launched later in the year and then quickly going out of stock. Since Samsung had to deal with the Note 7 mess, they had to go back to marketing the S7/S7 Edge against the new iPhones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As noted in the article, it's similar to what LG did with the G Flex, but it's at least few years away from getting into consumer hands:

 Some LG phones, like the G Flex, already include a similar material on its back covers that can heal scratches. But this material can't conduct electricity, so manufacturers can't use it for screens. Most phone screens have a grid of electrodes underneath, and when you touch it, your finger (which is also conductive) completes a circuit, telling the phone what to do.

 Wang predicts that this new self-healing material will be used for phone screens and batteries by 2020. </TEXT>

That's in addition to the Fossil Q Founder, Casio Smart Outdoor Watch WSD-F10 and TAG Heuer Connected, which Google said were already receiving the update.

 But who actually likes April Fools Day? Well, theres always that one guy  And its usually a guy, for some reason, Boese says  who considers himself a prankster, and waits all year for the holiday. (The rest of us, of course, do not require the excuse of a holiday in order to make a joke.) **So maybe most of us hate April Fools Day, but the people who like it really like it.** Sadly, the dumb pranks will continue for the foreseeable future. </TEXT>

If you have a bit more time, podcasts also cover good info around the time reviews start coming out. Some tend to go beyond the reviews they posted and add extra tidbits when discussing it. The following ones are a few I listen to: All About Android, Mobile Tech Roundup, Android Authority, Android Central, Android Police, Mobile Roar, Pocketnow Weekly, and Droid Life. </TEXT>

Some quotes from the article (emphasis mine):

 **The new Galaxy S8 models have stereo speakers**

 Although Samsung mainly uses the iris scanner for user registration, the fingerprint reader is still on board, even if it now sits sideways to the rear camera. **It can also be used with some gestures to open or close apps.**

 The devices actually get 5.8 and 6.2 inch screens with an aspect ratio of 18.5: 9, where the resolution of the Super-Amoled panel used here is equal to 2,960 x 1,440 pixels on both models. **The display is even more stretched than the LG G6**

 In some countries, Samsung offers the S8 models, as before, **a program called "Samsung Guard S8"**, which can be repaired within two hours and extend the warranty by another year. In addition, a one-time free replacement of the display will be possible and the option of "remote support" is available on the devices themselves

  Samsung installed on the back again a single 12-megapixel sensor, whose sensor pixels are 1.4 micrometers large. The camera also has an F/1.7 aperture and combines a phase detection and a laser autofocus, although there will probably be an optical image stabilizer again - but we can not confirm that yet.

 On the front of the Samsung Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus is not only an 8-megapixel camera , which also has an F/1.7 aperture, but also has an autofocus. This should help "to capture highly dynamic situations". Something more interesting, however, is that Samsung's new flagship again installed an iris scanner, which is intended to identify the user quickly, easily and reliably.

 The battery of the Samsung Galaxy S8 is **3000 mAh**. With the Samsung Galaxy S8 Plus it is probably **3500 mAh**, whereby in this case confirmation is still pending </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely an interesting read. 

 Sometimes teams at X set out to build one thing, only to discover that the technologies they create have applications far beyond the initial problem they were trying to solve. This was certainly the case for Gcam, the computational photography project that now powers the acclaimed Google Pixel camera, as well as a range of other image processing products across Alphabet.

 Most recently, Gcams HDR+ technology launched as the default mode for the critically acclaimed Google Pixel phone. DxOMark, the industry standard for camera ratings, declared that the Pixel camera was the best smartphone camera ever made in 2016. Reflecting on the evolution of the project, Marc says, It took five years to get it really rightand were grateful that X gave our team the long-term horizons and independence to make that happen.
