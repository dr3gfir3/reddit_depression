	<TEXT> I'm a law librarian but it took me years after completing my masters degree to find the career job. I live in a college town that cranks out library graduates every semester; it's a college town, everyone wants to stay. Every job applied for you have sometimes up to 200 applicants. A masters degree, at least here, gets your app looked at, and might get your foot in the door. Mine helped me get an library associates job ($8/hour, so I also worked at a local bookstore). I had that for 3 years. That job helped me get a library assistant job in another branch ($14/hour...still got that bookstore job but I'm buying more books). These two jobs served as a sort of apprenticeship for the career job I eventually got. In hindsight the masters degree was a stepping stone to get me into the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I did say to **get them started** in the endeavor of reading, finding characters they identify with is helpful. It's certainly not an end point. Plus it was the kid's idea because of the AA books he saw in the bookstore. I mean you can pretend that I'm saying skin color is the only way to identify with a character, but it isn't. But it's certainly plausible that these kids key in to reading by seeing themselves reflected in books. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   If the goal of this club is to ensure that the kids read books with relatable characters, who look like them and may go through the same struggles, then that is awesome.

I think that's the point of the book club. To get kids that might not otherwise be readers reading...a good starting point would be books with characters with whom they could identify. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a key/salient point of the article suggested that when he looked he couldn't find that many AA. It's something he wanted. Frankly, finding the AA books in the bookstore is what inspired him in the first place. I wonder why you care so much? Why is it such a foreign idea that a black child would want to read books with black characters. As a Latino, I can certainly identify with the plight of not finding books when I was a kid that spoke to me (in addition to the pirate, anthropomorphized animal, knights, athlete books). Reading about an athlete was cool; reading about Rafael Septien or Fernando Valenzuela was extra cool.

He's 11, starting book club for black kids. If he wants to read books about black kids there's nothing wrong with it. And it not suggestive of what books he'll read during his lifetime. </TEXT>
