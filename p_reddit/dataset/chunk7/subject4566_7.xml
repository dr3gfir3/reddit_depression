International tribunals already exist and killing TPP does nothing to change that. Your life will not be affected one bit by other countries extending copyright protection. Your life will be affected by an arbitrary war with China over artificial islands, or Taiwan, or whatever other excuse Trump comes up with.  </TEXT>

Conservatives routinely use left-baiting, such as when the tobacco industry says taxing cigarettes will hurt the poor. In that case, they want the to bait the left into supporting higher tobacco sales, when tobacco actually kills the poor and the real reason the tobacco industry is fighting taxes is because it reduces sales (and, coincidentally, deaths of the poor).

	<TEXT> For those behind the GFW:

Taiwan moved one step closer last month to becoming the first place in Asia to legalize same-sex marriage, when a legislative committee passed draft changes to the islands civil code.

The proposed amendments have been sent to party caucuses for negotiation and possibly further revision before a final version is approved outright or goes to a vote by the Legislative Yuan, a process that is expected to take months.

Still, the development was applauded by gay rights advocates, not just in Taiwan but in mainland China as well.

Among them was Lai Jeng-jer, a leading figure in the gay rights movement in Taiwan who now lives in Beijing. In 1999, Mr. Lai, who trained as an architect, opened Gin Gin in Taipei, Taiwans capital. It was billed as the first gay-themed bookstore in the Chinese-speaking world.

His mission was to create a space where sexual minorities could congregate openly and provide a platform to work for social change. In 2012, he moved to Beijing, where he and his business partner, Yeh Kenta, established what is now the Two Cities Cafe and Lounge. In an interview, Mr. Lai, 51, discussed the progress he had seen in gay rights, how Taipei differed from Beijing and how he dealt with the occasional visit by the Chinese police.

**How do you feel about the passage of the same-sex marriage proposals in Taiwan?**

Very happy. It was just drafts that were passed, and they still need to undergo a process of consultation among political parties and more readings, and we dont know what the final outcome will be. But most of my friends are delighted because, after years of campaigning for this, theres finally some progress.

Final passage would be a milestone. Some of my friends in mainland China have told me they might go to Taiwan. Up to now, if they wanted to get married, they had to go to the United States or Europe. I feel that the gay community in China has been greatly encouraged. Since we share a similar cultural background, they believe that if Taiwan can achieve this they can start to expect more for China.

Youve long been part of the gay rights movement in Taiwan. How do you see it developing?

Ive witnessed profound changes in Taiwan society since the lifting of martial law in the 1980s. I saw a lot of civic movements emerging and people taking to the streets to protest. I was quite young at the time and greatly inspired. I started to appreciate the significance of democratization.

Now, more and more people accept that, as a Taiwanese, its right to stand up for the underprivileged and the marginalized. Not just on same-sex marriage but on other issues, like environmental protection. Those who get involved are not always the ones directly affected, but they feel obligated to do something for those who are. Thats why, this time, weve also seen so many heterosexuals joining the demonstrations.

**How have you adjusted to the move from Taipei to Beijing?**

On Christmas Eve two years ago, we hosted a gay meet-up party at our cafe and invited about 20 people. In the middle of that, some police officers showed up and asked everyone to show their IDs. I was shocked, but our guests looked extremely calm. One after another, they took out their ID cards and showed them to the police. After the police finished checking them, they said fine and left. The party resumed, and our guests acted like nothing had happened. But I found it strange that they seemed so used to this kind of police intrusion.

Most of the people who come to our cafe are supportive. There are only a few who have objected. Once I saw a customer had commented on social media: It turned out to be a gay bar. I wont go there again.

Were not even a bar, let alone a gay bar. My colleague replied: This is a cafe from Taiwan with a theme of cultural diversity. Its not a gay bar, though we are in fact gay. Even if you dont like this, please still show some respect.

**How would you compare the gay communities in Taiwan and in Beijing?**

I have great admiration for any gay organizations that can survive in Beijing.

My cafe once hosted the Beijing Queer Film Festival. This is an international event that brings directors from all around the world. And when it comes to international events, theres usually trouble. The police tend to interfere.

The Queer Film Festival has been held about a dozen times, and seven or eight times its been forced to shut down midway. Once they held it at Tsinghua University, and when the police came, even a top university like that had to compromise.

So when we held it, we couldnt openly publicize it. What we did was send emails to people in which we didnt mention what was happening. We just told them to come watch a movie on which day and at what time. It turned out that a lot of people showed up, and the police didnt.

Some people joke about this situation. They say that in Taipei its called a gay movement, but in Beijing its gay activities. You can have all kinds of activities, but you cant allow any of them to turn into a movement.

Still, its not that hard to live in Beijing as a homosexual, if all you want is a quiet life and you avoid participating in any movements. Ive seen many lesbian couples kissing each other in the subway. Gays can also host parties at home. But you cant get involved in any protests or demonstrations. Basically, if you keep a low profile, the authorities dont interfere.

**Do you know any gay couples in Beijing who want to get married?**

I attended a wedding ceremony for a gay friend of mine. Hes the founder of Feizan, one of the biggest gay dating websites in China. He and his boyfriend sent us invitations for the event. But then he told guests that they should keep an eye out for a possible last-minute change of venue.

On the morning of the event, he telephoned that the site had changed. At noon he notified me that it was relocated again. That evening, they changed the site for the third time. Afterward, I learned that the police had called the first few places, which made them too scared to go through with it.

But finally there was a place near Ditan Park where they knew some people, and maybe because it was too late for the police to intervene, they succeeded in holding it. About 200 people attended. It was a very happy day.

Do you foresee the eventual legalization of same-sex marriage in mainland China?

Its possible. But its hard to tell how long it might take. Ive been living here for a while and can see the policy-making system in China is very different from what we have in Taiwan. Things can change very suddenly here. It might not take as long as in Taiwan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, it was late when I wrote that. The primary issue with Q3 2014 / Q3 2013 is that Q3 2013 experienced tiny growth, so not only would Q3 2014 create a deceptively large -100% change if it were zero, but by being negative by a small amount, it ended up being nearly -900%. Instead of a percent change chart, a dollar change chart would show the difference between Q3 2013 and Q3 2014 was minimal.

Y/Y eliminates seasonality. If it's not obvious how dividing a holiday surge by last year's holiday surge mitigates the surge, here's the [Dallas Fed](https://www.dallasfed.org/research/basics/seasonally.aspx):

One way analysts avoid the problem of seasonal fluctuation is to compare monthly or quarterly data on a year-over-year basis.

As they point out, it's more crude than the official seasonal adjustment, but it's still seasonal adjustment.

And holiday hiring is a common metric. I didn't find something esoteric or invent it myself. I also didn't use it to prove automation as anything but a secondary detail. I used it as an additional data point to show that seasonal retailers were suffering, on top of the direct data point that their sales are down. I then used the fact that Amazon is surging in those same seasonal categories to demonstrate that e-commerce is what's hurting those retailers, given that consumer spending in those categories is up. So you could say that I indirectly used seasonal retailers' weak hiring as a secondary data point for seasonal retailers' weakness, then used e-commerce's strength in those categories to demonstrate e-commerce hurting bricks-and-mortar within those categories.

Also, I'm not going to reply to this anymore, it's repetitive and no one else is voting or otherwise engaging in this conversation at this point, suggesting few people care. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The % Y/Y chart is thrown totally off scale by dividing a slightly positive Q3 2013 by a negative Q3 2014 (Edit: It was a small divisor that was the issue, it was late at night when I wrote this), making the rest hard to see. Also, it's difficult to make out Q4, which is the only part we care about, because % Y/Y removes the seasonality. Here's the simple narrative that a chart of just Q4's would show you: Holiday hiring rose year-over-year in 2004, 2005, 2006. Then in 2007, 2008, it fell during the recession. Next, it rose in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 as the economy recovered. Now, though, it's falling again in 2014, 2015, and 2016. Something is affecting the stores that hire for the holidays, outside of a recession. A look at sales for seasonal retail categories shows they're losing revenue. But consumer spending data shows people are still buying the type of goods they sell, just not in their stores. Various research firms show Amazon is at #1 or will be this year in those categories: Department stores (NRF), apparel (Cowen   Co.), electronics (TWICE), toys (Klosters), books/music/movies (everybody). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just responded to a very similar contention about people simply being poor and not spending [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/5nyyp8/american_apparel_to_close_all_of_its_stores/dcg4i47/). As for employment, retail employmentis still growing in total, just not in certain categories most targeted by e-commerce, which also happen to be seasonal categories responsible for holiday hiring. Also, in lower-education fields, the hospitality/leisure and construction industries are hiring at a fast pace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If this were the case, I wouldn't expect total retail sales to be rising, or for consumer spending to be rising, or for new car sales to be rising faster than any major category besides e-commerce. Not only are all three measures rising, they're all at record highs. There's no sign that retail sales or consumer spending as a whole are falling, just the particular retail categories most directly challenged by e-commerce: department stores, electronics stores, apparel stores, and toy stores, on top of the previously transpired declines of music, movie and book stores.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, I'll start with the first figure in the edit, 1/4 the employees per sales volume. This is just the inverse of the more commonly expressed sales-per-employee productivity ratio. I can link to the raw data from Commerce and Labor and show the calculations, but NYT has already done the work for me [here](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/01/12/business/economy/amazon-jobs-retail.html):

The typical online retailer generates $1,267,000 in sales per employee versus $279,000 at bricks-and-mortar stores. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how I phrased it in the original comment:

 By holiday hiring, I mean hiring gains from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4, compared to the same period a year ago.

Here's a chart showing retail employment change from the end of one quarter to the end of the next:

https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=ci9h

You can see that holiday hiring (the big spikes) has been falling each year since 2013. I look at holiday hiring because there's an interesting connection between seasonal retailers (the ones that hire most for the holidays) and e-commerce. Seasonal retailers include most notably toy stores, electronics stores, clothing stores and department stores, and (formerly) music/movie/book stores. These are also the categories where e-commerce is gaining the most market share and hurting traditional retailers. Part of this connection is because people just hate the crowds during the holidays, so they buy these holiday product categories online while still going to the grocery store. But another part of it is that gifts that last for days under a tree by the fire tend to also be mailable. They're not too big and heavy (cars, furniture, major appliances, building supplies), they're not perishable (non-shelf-stable food and drink), and they're not liquid or flammable (gasoline). That neatly eliminates virtually all the major categories where e-commerce is currently weak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's if you look at total retail, including car lots, gas stations, home improvement chains, etc., where e-commerce isn't much of a factor. But if you look at department stores, apparel, electronics, toys, books, movies and music, you see where the brick-and-mortar losses are, and where the e-commerce gains are.

E-commerce was an even smaller fraction of total retail just a few years ago, but it still killed off Borders, Blockbuster, Sam Goody, and nearly all the rest of the books/movies/music categories. Now it's targeting bigger sectors. </TEXT>

Some of that is due to retiring boomers, but [just look at the massive drop-off and meager recovery.](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EMRATIO) That wasn't all due to retirees. 

In the next recession, even more industries will again scramble to automate. The employment/population ratio will fall even further. Then employment will start to recover, slowly, but employment/population won't recover to where it is now, just as this recovery will never recover to the levels of the last recovery, and the last recovery never recovered to the levels of the recovery and expansion before that. And then people will again say long-term technological unemployment is a myth, because we're currently in a slow, partial, recovery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> US manufacturing output is at a record high. US manufacturing jobs are near an all-time low, having recovered just a bit from the recession before contracting again. There is seriously a weird time-warp obsession with a high-paying large-scale manufacturing workforce that will never be recreated. There is zero reason to try to centrally plan our economy around an industry that has been shrinking in employees for **40 years** even as output rose. Because if we turn our heads just one degree to the left, we can see a whole growing army of workers in engineering, and if we turn our heads just one degree to the right, we can see a whole growing army of workers in construction, and we can realize that our tunnel vision on manufacturing is completely unnecessary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They've actually already been hiring at a very fast pace for the past few years. They will also keep growing faster than any other sector of retail and continue to have a much higher sales-per-employee ratio of any other sector of retail. Much of that employee growth is in tech support workers for Amazon's growing array of hardware (Fire this, Kindle that, Echo the other). The other big growth center is local fulfillment centers that can do same-day delivery, though Amazon is working hard at replacing those jobs with technology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Department store sales, in total, are shrinking. Real sales at apparel stores shrank in 2016, even with a huge assist from cold winter weather vs. a warmer winter last year. (Apparel retailers pray every year for a cold winter because it always drives more sales of heavy, high-margin winter clothing.) With fewer stores, total sales will be even lower as shoppers turn to the web rather than drive to an even farther-away mall.

The retail sectors that are seeing contracting sales are the exact ones that Amazon is either now #1 in or expected to be #1 in this year: Apparel, electronics, toys, and department stores. (Amazon is basically a virtual department store and competes with them to be consumers' "everything store.") Media stores (books, movies, music) already died after Amazon conquered them, with a shrunken Barnes and Noble the only national chain left. </TEXT>

My ideal apparel store would have all the merch in the backroom, and then you'd do your shopping in the changing room with a touchscreen and a vending slot. Browse the touchscreen for items, they appear in the slot like a Star Trek replicator, return what you don't want through the slot, walk out with your clothes. No more walking back and forth from the shop floor to the changing rooms, no more wandering around for the items you want, and the store is way more efficient economically. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Macy's is closing 100 stores, Sears-Kmart is closing 150, The Limited is closing all 250 stores, American Apparel is closing all 110, and these are just closings since Christmas. JCPenney's CEO says they're about to close an undetermined number of stores, Nordstrom is said to be planning closures, and other retailers have just announced some very disappointing sales numbers that would seem to make additional closures inevitable.

The thing is, total retail sales are actually up, and so is consumer spending more broadly. But e-commerce is stealing sales from the traditional stores, and the reckoning is getting brutal.

Also, e-commerce employs about 1/4 as many workers as traditional stores relative to the amount sold, so this could start having an impact on jobs. Total holiday hiring in retail, including e-commerce, was 8.9% lower in 2016 than 2015. And e-commerce-related industries don't seem to be growing jobs fast enough to make up for the losses. Combined holiday hiring at USPS, UPS, FedEx, etc. was somehow flat this year despite e-commerce growing by over 10% like it does every year, and holiday hiring at warehouse companies was actually down, perhaps due to Amazon opening a ton of its own local fulfillment centers. (By holiday hiring, I mean hiring gains from the end of Q3 to the end of Q4, compared to the same period a year ago.) And self-driving cars and trucks, and maybe even drones, could start to reduce transportation employment, while robotics continues to slim down warehouse and manufacturing jobs.

The automation and digitization of jobs should be a bigger story. It's already eclipsed outsourcing as a cause of job losses, but our headlines, and our politics, haven't caught up. </TEXT>

Incidentally, though, Trump did call for a boycott of Macy's, and on the other hand, he used American Apparel for some of his campaign gear, if we're genuinely looking for connections to Trump. </TEXT>

So you can consider Trump's horrible favorability to be about 1.1% off. As for "I've seen the Trump rallies on TV," I refer you again to the millions more who voted for Clinton. A rally just packs a few thousand supporters, less than 0.1% of the electorate, into one place for a temporary period. It has nothing to do with who wins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ABC has begun airing new seasons of Match Game, airing Wednesdays, and To Tell The Truth, which has been tweaked a bit from last season and airs Sundays. They're panel shows, but not in the British comedy quiz mold, so I may only post this once per season unless there's support for more. Here are the first new episodes. Use an ad blocker for all the links in this post.

* [Match Game S02E01](http://onwatchseries.to/episode/match_game_2016__s2_e1.html)
*  [To Tell The Truth S02E01](http://onwatchseries.to/episode/to_tell_the_truth_2016__s2_e1.html)

ABC has also renewed The $100,000 Pyramid and Celebrity Family Feud, but won't air them until until later. Here are all the back episodes of all four shows:

* [Match Game](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/match_game_2016_)
* [The $100,000 Pyramid](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/_100_000_pyramid)
* [To Tell The Truth](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/to_tell_the_truth_2016_)
* [Celebrity Family Feud](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/celebrity_family_feud_2015_)

And if you're in to this type of show, NBC airs [Hollywood Game Night](http://onwatchseries.to/serie/Hollywood_Game_Night) every year, and CBS aired [Million Dollar Password](https://www.youtube.com/results?q="million+dollar+password" sp=EgIYAg%253D%253D) in 2008-09. The Tonight Show also plays games like [Password](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hERzvxp5ab0 t=2m05s), [Pictionary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDHD5Bkxr_A t=90) and the "Would I Lie To You"-like game [True Confessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-n5vol3CEE). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please specify which theater you are referring to.

The Newberg facility has 5 classrooms because there is less demand  about 650 students a year. There is room to expand to accommodate additional demand. Newberg residents help pay for PCC, and PCC serves the community. The Newberg facility was explicitly part of the 2008 bond.

Energy efficiency, or "greening" as you scarequoted, was also explicitly part of the bond.

The 2008 bond can't subsidize tuition because it's dedicated to capital improvements and it's audited to ensure the funds are spent as agreed. [The ballot measure said](https://multco.us/file/19957/download) (PDF):

Measure would:  
 Construct, equip, furnish new buildings for additional
classrooms, other college uses at all four campuses,
at Washington County Workforce Training Center,
and in Newberg;  
 Renovate, update existing college facilities needing
heating, ventilation, plumbing, lighting, roofing;  
 Replace out-of-date equipment, facilities for
workforce training;  
 Expand and increase efficiency of classroom, library,
student support services space in existing buildings
at PCC campuses and in Sherwood;  
 Upgrade technology including distance learning
capabilities;  
 Make health, life safety, accessibility upgrades
including fire alarms, security systems, electrical
wiring;  
 Increase facilities energy efficiency;  
 Expand students childcare facilities;  
 Acquire some land, site improvements, buildings for
college services;  
 Pay associated bond issuance costs. </TEXT>

The whole reason Trump is trying to use money to coerce colleges to become free ICE employees is because they can't actually compel them to legally. Colleges have every right to tell ICE agents they need a warrant to patrol the campus and that they won't do ICE's work for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This part is interesting, suggesting Apple had a motive to take the app down:

The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the worlds biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apples largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed.

On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apples media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.

Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those behind the GFW:

Apple, complying with what it said was a request from Chinese authorities, removed news apps created by The New York Times from its app store in China late last month.

The move limits access to one of the few remaining channels for readers in mainland China to read The Times without resorting to special software. The government began blocking The Timess websites in 2012, after a series of articles on the wealth amassed by the family of Wen Jiabao, who was then prime minister, but it had struggled in recent months to prevent readers from using the Chinese-language app.

Apple removed both the English-language and Chinese-language apps from the app store in China on Dec. 23. Apps from other international publications, including The Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal, were still available in the app store.

We have been informed that the app is in violation of local regulations, Fred Sainz, an Apple spokesman, said of the Times apps. As a result, the app must be taken down off the China App Store. When this situation changes, the App Store will once again offer the New York Times app for download in China.

Mr. Sainz declined to comment on what local regulations the Times apps were said to have violated, who had contacted Apple and when, and whether a court order or other legal document had been presented.

Chinas main internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, did not respond to faxed questions.

The Times bureau in Beijing said it had not been contacted by the Chinese government about the matter. A Times spokeswoman in New York, Eileen Murphy, said the company had asked Apple to reconsider its decision.

The request by the Chinese authorities to remove our apps is part of their wider attempt to prevent readers in China from accessing independent news coverage by The New York Times of that country, coverage which is no different from the journalism we do about every other country in the world, Ms. Murphy said in a statement.

The request appears to have been made under regulations released in June 2016 called Provisions on the Administration of Mobile Internet Application Information Services.

The regulations say apps cannot engage in activities prohibited by laws and regulations such as endangering national security, disrupting social order and violating the legitimate rights and interests of others. The cyberspace administration says on its website that apps also cannot publish prohibited information.

The ruling Communist Party tightly controls media inside China and employs one of the worlds most sophisticated systems of internet censorship. Chinese law prohibits the publication of harmful information online, and officials often take action without legal procedures or court orders against material they deem objectionable.

Apple has previously removed other, less prominent media apps from its China store. It is unclear how the company evaluates requests from Beijing to take down apps and whether it ever resists them.

Apples chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, has said that the company complies with all local laws. While in early 2016 Apple resisted a court request in the United States for it to help federal officials unlock an iPhone for a criminal investigation, Mr. Cook said he would obey whatever order the court ultimately handed down. In the end, the government was able to unlock the device without Apple's help and the case was dropped.

Farzana Aslam, associate director of the Center for Comparative and Public Law at the University of Hong Kong, noted that in matters involving customer privacy, Apple requires governments to submit subpoenas, search warrants or other legal documents.

Maybe in the end they have to do it, but I think theres something to be said about standing up for what you believe in and purporting to put principle before profit in a country like China, to show that actually there is this tension there, Ms. Aslam said. Its not as simple as, Because we operate in your jurisdiction, well do anything you ask of us.

She added that it was very worrying that Apple had not disclosed what laws the authorities said were violated, making it difficult for The Times and other publishers to file an appeal or challenge the governments requests.

In the weeks leading up to the withdrawal of the Times apps, The Times was working on various articles related to the Chinese government. One of them, posted online on Dec. 29, revealed the billions of dollars in hidden perks and subsidies that the Chinese government provides to the worlds biggest iPhone factory. China is also one of Apples largest iPhone markets, though sales in that region have slowed.

On Dec. 23, David Barboza, a Times reporter, spoke with members of Apples media team about the article. Mr. Barboza had previously been in touch with the iPhone factory owner, Foxconn. He had also contacted the Chinese government as part of his reporting.

Later that day, a separate team from Apple informed The Times that the apps would be removed, Ms. Murphy said.

In another article, published on Dec. 22 as a post on its Sinosphere blog, The Times described an anti-Western internet video that had been widely promoted by Chinese public security offices.

The Times news apps remain available in Apples app stores for other countries, as well as the Hong Kong and Taiwan stores, but people must have a credit card with a billing address outside mainland China to download them. The Times crossword puzzle and virtual reality apps remain available throughout China.

When the Chinese government began blocking the Times websites in 2012, it also prevented users with Times apps from downloading new content.

But readers in China can still gain access to The Times using software that circumvents the governments firewall. And in July 2015, The Times released a new version of its Chinese-language app that adopted a different method for retrieving articles, one that the government appeared unable to stop.

Apples decision to remove the app from its China store should not affect those who have already installed it. But users in China will not be able to download new releases unless they use another regions app store.

The Times discovered after being blocked in 2012 that hackers with possible ties to the Chinese military had targeted the newspapers computer systems and that the attacks coincided with the reporting for that Times investigation.

Foreign tech companies face increasing pressure from government authorities in China. In April, Apples iBooks Store and iTunes Movies were shut down in the country, just six months after they were introduced there.

Mark Natkin, the Beijing-based managing director of Marbridge Consulting, who advises American technology firms in China, said he did not think any such company entering the Chinese market could ever fully comprehend how challenging its going to be.

Mr. Natkin said that Apple has a certain amount of leverage against the Chinese government in terms of the total amount of jobs created but that the technology gap has started to close. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were both Tesco's own brand. They weren't advertising, they weren't using different distributors. Manufacturers have different SKUs for different colors or even different ingredients with different packaging that sell at different rates while maintaining price parity, or even pricing the more popular variety higher due to more demand. Coke even has massive ad campaigns for sodas that sell at very very different rates and they maintain price parity. It's not a coincidence that the sex disparity occurs across many products, they're just charging what the market will bear. It's not sexist in a "we hate women" way, it just leaves women with less money after buying the women's variety, regardless of whether the women's product is purchased more or less often than the men's product. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was a public relations explanation. They still sold the same total razors, produced the same way in the same factory, some with blue dye and some with pink dye, and shipped the same total razors to Tesco. The pink ones didn't cost twice as much to produce. Green highlighter pens don't cost twice as much as orange highlighter pens because they're less popular. Maybe there's a fractional effect on production cost, but not a doubling. </TEXT>

Their website, [shop24global.com](http://www.shop24global.com/), is down, and their phone number, 866-973-2424, just plays a 5-second "no one is available" message and hangs up.

The most recent news about them I could find is from a [campus newspaper](http://uisjournal.com/features/2016/11/30/debate-over-resolution-readings-revived-sga/) in November saying their machine was being removed, but it didn't say whether the company or the campus had made that decision. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This chart is updated daily and is one of several hosted [here](https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf) that automatically track sea ice using US government data, in this case from the [National Sea Ice Data Center](https://nsidc.org/data/seaice_index/archives.html), funded by NOAA and NASA.

You can see that there's usually a peak in global sea ice around June, when Antarctic ice is high~~est~~, and again around November, when the Arctic ~~is usually the most frozen~~ *is refreezing but Antarctica hasn't yet melted much*. But this year, record warmth is melting ice at both poles, leading to a chart that looks like 2016 just wandered off and got lost.

This chart shows sea ice area. Another measure is [sea ice extent](https://sites.google.com/site/arctischepinguin/home/sea-ice-extent-area/grf/nsidc_global_extent_byyear_b.png). The ELI5 difference is, "extent" tries to measure the total size of partial ice cover's boundaries, including the areas within that aren't covered, while "area" tries to only measure the actual amount of ice cover, excluding the parts that aren't covered.

Usually, Arctic and Antarctic sea ice are measured separately, since they're affected by different weather events and follow asynchronous patterns.

This is sea ice, not land ice, so sea ice can melt without *directly* affecting sea levels, just like a full glass of ice water doesn't overflow when the ice melts. Mountain glaciers and ice sheets on land melting into the sea is what raises sea levels. The problem with melting sea ice is that bright polar ice reflects the sun's energy back into space, keeping the poles cool, while darker liquid seas absorb heat, reinforcing a warming feedback loop *which can lead to melting land ice and higher seas*. Ice melt also affects salinity and ocean currents. Polar vortexes can weaken and push cold air out to more populated areas. And polar ice is important to polar animals that become stranded and die as the ice disappears.

This chart will update daily, so you can bookmark it and keep track.

Edit: ~~Old text~~ and *new text*. </TEXT>
