	<TEXT> Didn't see this posted elsewhere, but don't say "fuck fired."  When cops get fired after a situation like this, that means the agency will not cover them in a civil suit... meaning this officer is on his own...

Its actually really important.  Most people are placed on admin leave while details are sorted out.  The fact he was fired so quickly afterward essentially shows he's fucked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The story is I did a ride along with a police officer as part of an entry to criminal justice/admin justice course I was taking in college.  During the ride along, the officer tried to stop a car, and got into a high speed chase.

During the chase, the cop followed the suspect through a stop sign and hit a car with some people in it.  At the time, they all said they weren't injured and refused medical treatment.  

Now, a year later, they're apparently suing the department saying the officer was driving like 100mph, no lights or sirens, and never offered them medical attention.

I've been called in as a witness by the police department to say the officer requested an ambulance, and they said they didn't want it.  Also that the officer had his lights and sirens on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If employers gave workers the option of taking overtime pay (usually 1.5*base wage) *OR* comp time, (hour for our exchange), this wouldn't be such a bad thing.  However, most people sign up for overtime with the specific intent of earning extra money.

Edit:  The choice between comp time vs overtime pay should be made before the overtime shift is worked, meaning employers cannot hold on to wages while they figure out what's most useful to them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a stolen/loaded/concealed firearm and almost 1/4 pound of meth  nearly get thrown out of court when some citizen's cell phone video showed my backup (which I hadn't yet asked for) pulling in at mach 5, and skidding to a stop inches from my back bumper.  I had only just gained consent to search the vehicle from the driver and sole occupant.

The defense lawyer argued the way my backup officer arrived on scene created a 'coercive environment,' and scared the suspect into consenting due to fear of retaliation.

The judge agreed, and almost threw it out.  Fortunately, I also included in my report, and the DA presented evidence of, the driver was on county probation with a mandatory search/seizure condition, and had lied about it.

The DA and I were able to get everything admitted under the "inevitable discovery" rule.  But ya, almost ruined the entire case because someone wanted to show off for their civilian ride along. </TEXT>
