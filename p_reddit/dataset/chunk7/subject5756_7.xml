	<TEXT> Right now it feels like when I haven't preoccupied my mind with Netflix, video games, or researching GAD and depression over the internet I am obsessing over how much I have messed up with my class this year.  Figuring out "when" will be a challenge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just went to the doctor last Thursday too and was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Major Depression, so I know what you're going through.  Haven't started the meds yet, but that should be happening in a few days as well.

This is my 6th year teaching and this year has been really rough in terms of discipline for me as well.  I've realized that it's hard to be firm and consistent with your students when you are being so hard on yourself.  It's impossible to demand respect from your students when you don't even respect yourself right now.  All of that will come with time and the support that you need.

I was also wondering if the doctor had recommended any kind of therapy so you can talk out your problems.  I'm supposed to be starting tomorrow, and the idea of figuring out my anxiety with like-minded people is something I look forward to.  If not, you should definitely look into it.  

Feel free to PM me if you want.  I'll be off work for the next two weeks getting used to the meds and going to group therapy during the day with not much else to do... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Telling them off is pretty much impossible for me.

Thank you for sharing your story, it helps me feel like things can get better.  Focusing on me will be difficult, though.  

Do you still visit counselors now when things are rough? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My doc has prescribed antidepressants so I'll be starting those, but thanks for the other suggestions.  I'll also be attending group therapy - crossing my fingers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll have to get used to being on meds while I'm at work.  I'm also a terrible liar - I just asked the principal to say I was out sick.  The thought of going back terrifies me enough for me to start looking for new jobs, more so because it's a toxic environment for me than because of the fear of talking about the anxiety/depression.  

I will definitely check out /r/anxiety - thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my 6th year teaching and I feel the same way right now.  

While I was teaching Kindergarten, I felt like I was doing something worthwhile when I saw the smiles on their faces and got hugs daily.  It means a lot to feel loved and appreciated.  

This year working with moody 5th graders and a co-teacher who treats me like her aide has just been too much.  I even have a parent this year who is trying her hardest to get me fired based on awful things her child says I said to him.  She claims he remembers everything and that I must be lying.  I'm so tired of the stress - from the adults even moreso than the kids.  It may be enough for me to consider changing professions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The therapist who diagnosed me figured out right away that I had anxiety.  I've been an anxious person for as long as I can remember, but it's just gotten worse through the years.  It was one of the reasons I was diagnosed with Major Depression instead of it just being a result of life adjustments.  Honestly, I'm excited to start therapy because I'm tired of being anxious all the time (even though when I get there I will probably refuse to participate or say anything). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The saddest thing is that I don't know if I'll be happy to go back to my 5th graders, and I don't know if they'll be happy to see me.  Part of the stress has been moving from Kindergarten to 5th grade within the course of a year.  I had worked with 5th grade like 7 years ago and had a rough time, but my principal pretty much forced me into it because she knows that every year the 5th grade teachers quit at our school.  Before this, I was a successful and happy Kindergarten teacher for 3 years running.  It makes me feel like a terrible person knowing that I just don't like working with 5th graders, but at the same time I wonder if that's the depression or just me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope you're right and that everyone at school can be understanding.  For now, I've asked the principal to just tell everyone I'll be out sick (in a generic way).  When I tried going to people for help before and during the nervous breakdowns though, I got a lot of advice that I should just suck it up and work harder to get through it.  When I tried to express my feelings and be assertive, I just pissed people off.  Part of me just really wants a fresh start away from the mess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the good things about being a first year teacher is that everyone knows how tough it is and for the most part you get extra support and check-ins.  As a 6th year teacher who is also a part time teacher coach providing that new teacher support, it's a whole other beast... </TEXT>
