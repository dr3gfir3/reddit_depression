	<TEXT> Please see the attached for an [album for examples](https://imgur.com/a/GBQDC): 

I'm willing to draw avitars that are simple for 5 - 7.50 anything more intricate will be more. there are price examples under the pictures. Those prices are examples of what I'd charge. 

Simple vector images are $5
Simple cartoon drawings like the KrakenOctodad are 7.50 and up

More seemingly realistic are above 10. 

Just a note: 50% of the proceeds are going to help me buy a bike for a needy kid. My new years resolution was to buy 12 bikes for kids with autism or that were needy. So i'm drawing pictures to raise funds for that.  </TEXT>

[](/critique) critique is always welcome. tho just to save some breath/typing i do know that some of the images aren't properly lined up. I'm going to work on that later when i do them more in depth. 

and 

if you're so inclined to suggest other bottles i may consider making more. i'm just not very smart about perfume.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a kid, I thought my mom's ghost was leaving me and my brother presents all around the house. 

We'd find things we wanted hidden in closets, the attic, elsewhere. And we thought she was haunting us with love. (She died when we were sub 8).

Turns out we were just finding presents our grandma had brought us for Christmas and our birthdays. But she hasn't the heart to tell us cuz she liked how happy it made us. 

To be young and dumb.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had an opportunity to be a jr. Accountant at a small firm in NYC. But I chose to stay as a bookkeeper at a big fortune 500 company. I figured that would look better. 

When I ended up getting married and then pregnant a few years later they basically fired me because I had a complicated pregnancy and was out 4 months instead of 3. 

I suspect that I'd not have gotten fired and have had a more flexible job and  better job opportunities further down the line if I had switched jobs. There's a very relevant XKCD for this but I can't be assed to find it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to do what is best for your son. If moving away from his father isn't the best thing then your happiness comes last. 

Is he doing well in school? Does he have appropriate housing? Are you able to provide for him? 

If all of those are met and you don't have some big actual opportunity lined up elsewhere then no, you wait til you do. Or you make an opportunity that's closer. 

Maybe move to a bigger city close to where you are now.


But if your big reasons are wanting to date, and make new friends, then no. You don't move.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to counseling and for about a year she heard tales of me getting sober for 3 months and then relasping and such. Finally, after about a year of me not keeping it together, she said, i'd have to increase my level of help (get put on meds for depression etc and maybe go to outpatient rehab) or she'd notify child services to do a welfare check on my kid. 

So basically only after I showed no signs of getting better in spite of my halfassed efforts. 

So i increased efforts, took a few drug tests and she never talked about even involving them at all. 

From what she told me "unless you aren't trying and are actually a danger, they aren't going to do anything"  </TEXT>

anyone have any experience with that?  </TEXT>

But then I have no idea how to go about getting the bikes and I'm not rich so I don't have gobs of money. And logistically speaking how would it be done. 

Anyways, anyone have any ideas on how I should set it up? Should I  just post up here whenever I have the funds for a new bike as like a contest type offer thing? or work with a local organization? 

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My son has autism and drinks pretty much exclusively from one specific cup. Anyways, the company doesn't make them any more and I've reached out to them and they wont get back to me. And i'm not good at that whole let me go viral beggy thing like that other guy. he'll drink from juice boxes so he isn't going to die. But he will only drink specific juice from drink boxes.

So the people over at r/3Dprinting  said it would be hellish to attempt to 3d it. but that you resin people might know what i can do to make [these cups](https://www.safetots.co.uk/images/products/expanded/Tommee_Tippee_Explora_Active_Sporty_Cup_12_months_plus_xl_1.jpg)

I've still got the 1 original so I suppose i should be good. it's a hard plastic of sorts. 

If you think it's possible let me know. ANd if you know exactly what i should be using to make it, then I'll totally love you forever. 

**edit**: the need for the cup comes from his refusal to drink milk, water, or anything that isn't Sugary Fruit Punch out of anything but this cup. 

Thanks in advance. 


Also... I always wondered how people made their own action figurines and shit. Now i know, and now i'm going to become really obsessed with this for 6 months before abandoning it completely. 


Thanks!

I tried getting him to use the new ones and he basically noped them all.  tried straw cups, buying water and milk in juice box forms. Nothing. 

Thanks tho.

	<TEXT> Knives if you do any amount of cooking. You don't realize it but using the wrong knives or shitty knives can really slow down the speed of making a meal. 

Jackets/cold weather gear. Buy a really good one, if you've stopped growing. I buy a mid range for my son since he's still growing. Unless you have more than 1 child. Then maybe buy a really good quality for the older one and you can pass down to the younger. 

An artificial christmas tree. If you want it looking real and lasting for long enough to not be a detriment to the environment and your pocket buy a real good tree. They can run in the 200+ range but if you wait til after christmas when they go on special (50 - 75%) off you can get a good deal on a tree that looks real AF. 

Choose the cheapest option: 

medications, since basically every pharmacist and doctor I know buys the acetaminophen instead of brand name tylenol (etc) I also always buy whatever is cheapest. 

kitchen staples, i've noticed no difference between Store Brand Real Vanilla Extract and the one that's 3x as much. same with salt, oil, butter, baking soda and the like. spices might be a trial and error thing but thus far I've never realized afterwards man I should have brought the super expensive salt.

The ipads he had, he had for 2 years each. with maybe 3 trips to the apple store for each one. 

Plus IMO apple seems to be much easier for him to navigate. Very little literacy is required. He's 9 and while he can read a bit, he can't write / spell. So, something that is primarily click and be done with it, really works to his benefit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if you ever have a kid or whatever, i suggest apple products. I brought my son an android tablet 2 years ago. In these past 2 years i've been through 5 different ones. 

not withstanding drops. (he usually has a cover)

I've had tons of random problems that were such a hassle to get resolved. Amazon fires randomly fail at the charger point for some reason. And while they're good about replacement sometimes its a pain in the ass as I can't just go to the store and say, "this is fucked, gimme another one" 

had a LG tablet. It dropped in case and while there werent any cracks the touch screen was all fucked up and they gave me a big run around about replacing it or repairing it.

	<TEXT> Opposite problem. Grew up mid to upper middle class. Parents taught me fuck all about bills, budgeting, and money (in fact, any time I asked about any bill including the phone bill, which I was sure I put a hefty mark on with 90s phone service what it was, I'd be told that's grown folks business and to stop being nosy). Whenever I wanted something I got it (mainly because they used buying me shit as a replacement for being actual good parents). 


So when I became an adult for many years. It was like I'll just buy all this shit I want. And then later realized that you don't just always have tons of money to pay everything. Even after 15 years being out of their lock, i still randomly (read: when I'm depressed) forget that I have to pay bills before buying whatever the fuck I, my husband, or my child want.
