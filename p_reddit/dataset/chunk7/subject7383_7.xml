	<TEXT> That's a good idea.  
I'm not entirely sure how to go about that though; if it helps, this is how I import data to plot.

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    
    data = np.genfromtxt("D:\\Users\\eggs\\spam\\fileToPlot.csv", delimiter=',', names=['x', 'y'])
    
    fig = plt.figure()
    
    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(111)
    
    ax1.plot(data['x'], data['y'], color='g')
    
    ax1.set_title("")    
    ax1.set_xlabel('Voltage (V)')
    ax1.set_ylabel('Current (A)')
    
    plt.show()

I'm thinking there may be some way to do something along the lines of this to plot one point at a time?
 
    n=1
    while n  #number of points:
        x=data[:n,0]
        y=data[:n,1]
        n +=1 </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do I Animate Plotting of .csv or .xlsx Data? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-23 22:43:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm using Python 3.4 and the most recent Anaconda distribution of SciPy (i.e. using matplotlib for plotting).

I'm trying to make an animated plot that traces out my data from either a .csv or .xlsx file (trying to show colleagues how data will appear when running an experiment), but all of the documentation I'm pulling up is on animating functions or random data.  
Could somebody please help me out/point me in the right direction?

Here's the closest example I've found, but it's an animation of random data:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.animation as animation
    
    def update_line(num, data, line):
        line.set_data(data[...,:num])
        return line,
    
    fig1 = plt.figure()
    
    data = np.random.rand(2, 25)
    l, = plt.plot([], [], 'r-')
    plt.xlim(0, 1)
    plt.ylim(0, 1)
    plt.xlabel('x')
    plt.title('test')
    line_ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig1, update_line, 25, fargs=(data, l),
        interval=50, blit=True)

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's probably school dependent, but I took intro level chemistry (1   2) without having taken HS physics and did fine.  
You'll likely need intro physics to complete a chemistry degree though, and I wouldn't recommend taking anything past intro and maybe organic without physics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A cold wind blew across the wet, pock-marked face of James Tarraway.  
Questions filled his aching head, he scanned the empty alley looking for somebody to ask his whereabouts.  
Finding no one, he turned around to question the source of the faint humming behind him, but was faced with only a doorway in a concrete monolith emblazoned with "EXIT ONLY."

James stumbled down the alley turning out his pockets, a sinking feeling setting in his stomach as he pulled out a pay stub.  
$5,000, he'd never received a check this large before, not even for the Russian girl he'd bedded.  
In fact, he couldn't seem to remember leaving the house that day at all. Something must have gone wrong. </TEXT>

Is leaving behind chemical waste not pollution?

Regardless of whether it was contained in the shale to begin with or introduced via the fracking solution itself, if something harmful finds its way into the water supply due to fracking then fracking caused pollution of that water supply. </TEXT>
