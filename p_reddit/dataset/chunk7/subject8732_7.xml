I wouldnt say her ideas are banal, many people still dont get them =) And her books are a good jumpstart to more serious things - Hayek, Mises, Hoppe, Rothbard and so on. </TEXT>

Traditional escape rooms:

1) The guy wanted to do a proposal. So we hided the ring in the quest. Zombie quest.

2) In this zombie quest we had a big figure of zombie (1:1) behind the steel bars. People werent supposed to get there. But guess what? They broke the bars.

3) Some obviously high guys. There were OK until one of them started smoking his joint right in the escape room (Zombie again). Had to remember him that weed is good but it won't help you fight the zombie apocalypse.

Virtual reality quest:

1) Vomiting. Few people were starting to feel nauseous in Oculuses.

2) There was a strange pair of guys. I think they were mentally disabled. Couldn't have done even the simple initial task.

3) Old war veteran (80-something) who was amazed by our VR quest and told us it's like going back to the days when he was a pilot.

And the main rule of escape rooms - people are wild beasts who will destroy everything. </TEXT>
