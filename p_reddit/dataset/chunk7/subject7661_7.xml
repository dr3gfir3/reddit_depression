	<TEXT> Maybe the small team is on a bit off a power trip. The fact alone you have to tell people not to post pics of pineapples shows the r/trees community enjoys seeing them. It's better to keep the whole community happy oppose to "small team of mods" who could easily allow pics. Only place the pineapple means something. I'm sure I've seen few pineapple tattoos that members of the community have got.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm doing the Route 66 journey from la/Santa Monica to Chicago. Going via Dallas. Meeting cousin there who's joining the journey. 
I really want to visit a medical marijuana dispensary just to see what it's like. Also would love to visit a weed farm in Cali but mainly I want to smoke the Cali bud that sells for 50 1gram in London. Obviously I know dispensaries won't sell to me but love to get some edibles that I can eat discretely while driving through non legal states. I know I won't be able to get weed whole trip. I have to smoke Cali bud in Cali. If any of you guys have any suggestions. I'd love to hear from you. Thanks   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get him some good Thai weed. Red string or even good commercial cause he not a smoker anyway. Very low thc but high in cbd. It's nice mellow buzz. Very light compared to skunk. Think that's best option. Weed is easy to find good weed very hard. This is what you want to get him.
