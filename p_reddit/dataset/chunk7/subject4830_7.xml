	<TEXT> I know lots of church going Catholics who are pro birth control, pro-choice, and pro same sex marriage. Some even send their children to Catholic schools. I think they like the communities they are a part of, and they like some aspects of Catholicism, at least enough to keep going.

Personally, I'm with you, I don't get it. I was definitely a Cafeteria Catholic for a number of years before I finally stopped going to church and finally saw myself as an ex Catholic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome. There are a number of ex Catholics here who have joined other religions, also lots of non-religious/atheist folks. It's tough talking to your parents about these issues. It didn't go well when I had that conversation. It doesn't go well for a lot of people. It can take time for your parents to see you as an independent adult who is making their own decisions, even decisions that they disagree with.

I liked how you started out with them saying you could choose any religion when you turned 18. As for why they reacted differently when you actually decided to make that choice, it's the difference between thinking you could let your child choose their own religion, and actually having to accept them doing so. Give them time, they may come around.

As for what to do, most people will start by asking: how dependent are you on your parents? Are you living at home? Are they paying for your education? If so, and if those are at risk by choosing a different religion, it might be best to wait until you are living on your own and not financially dependent on your parents.

You mention not driving or having access to a bus route to your new church. I think it would be asking a lot to have your parents take you, given their reaction to the news. Do you have a friend who attends the church? Can they give you a lift?

	<TEXT> I wonder how far down this rabbit hole goes. Are we to assume that the mass graves contains just children that were either stillborn or died very young? Is there a still darker side? Were these mothers and children neglected to the point where there were unnecessary deaths?

A few years ago I watched the film [Sex in a Cold Climate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FtxOePGgXPs) that tells the story of several women who ended up in these places, had children while unmarried, and were treated by the nuns in ways that might make ISIS blush.

Fuck, at this point, I would believe almost anything.

 In recent years, more of my friends have taken something distracting out of their life to add a practice that is more life-giving. For instance, people leaving social media for Lent and replacing time spent online with reading spiritual books, journal writing and prayer. Others give up television for hiking or eating out at restaurants for gardening.  
 Replacing a time-consuming distraction with an often-ignored practice is not necessarily about denial. Instead, this kind of choice balances us, putting us back in touch with slower, more intentional ways of life. We only have so much time in a 24-hour day. Lent offers the opportunity of considering how and on what we spend that precious resource. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's also helpful to ask the opposite question: "what if one of America's top companies replaced their CEO with someone with no business experience?"

As an example, let's use Apple. When Steve Jobs stepped down. The put Tim Cook in as CEO. Tim had been at Apple for many years. He had worked closely with Steve. He filled in for Steve when he was on sick leave. He had all sorts of knowledge about Apple's products and business.

Let's compare that with bringing in someone with a lot of political experience as CEO. We can use Hillary Clinton or Barack Obama as examples. Both have spent most/all of their adult life in politics and by most measures, have been very successful.

My guess is, if one of them were appointed CEO of Apple, or some comparable company, investors wouldn't be too happy. Their political experience would certainly be a plus when dealing with the government, but their general lack of industry experience is bound to cause problems. A skilled leader could delegate, but in the end, you still need someone at the top to make decisions.

Following your Jeff Bezos example, let's say Steve Jobs, when he was still alive and healthy, decided to run for President. Apple was certainly a success in his later years. I liked the guy, but I wouldn't have much reason to support him as a candidate for President, especially if his campaign was a Trump styled ego trip and light on any real policy details.

Donald Trump's main popularity seemed to be due to his "you're fired!" attitude on The Apprentice and his not at all subtle racist, xenophobic approach where he wouldn't apologize for anything stupid he said and would generally double down on the insanity. There have been plenty of candidates who are racist and xenophobic, but they generally don't get far at the national level. Maybe his "fuck it, I'll be a sexist asshole and get away with it" attitude also appealed to some people. Maybe it was some weird sense of looking up to him.

I still struggle to understand how Donald Trump pulled it off. Maybe he was just the right person and the right time who could tap into the deep reserves of anger that many Americas have toward their government. Combine that with most people seeing his campaign as a joke and waiting far too long to dig up dirt on him.
