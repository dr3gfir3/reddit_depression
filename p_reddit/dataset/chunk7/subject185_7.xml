	<TEXT> ["Disgustipated" -  Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kOvwc8_QXiY)

And the angel of the lord came unto me, snatching me up from my place of slumber.

And took me on high, and higher still until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.

And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own Midwest.

And as we descended, cries of impending doom rose from the soil.

One thousand, nay a million voices full of fear. And terror possessed me then

And I begged, "Angel of the Lord, what are these tortured screams?"


And the angel said unto me, "These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!

You see, Reverend Maynard, tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."


And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,

"Hear me now, I have seen the light! They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul! Damn you!

Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!"


Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus </TEXT>

It's happened before in good old New York City in 1863:
http://clevelandcivilwarroundtable.com/articles/society/nyc_riots.htm

The veterans of the Army of the Potomac imposed a hard peace.  Burrows and Wallace wrote, Troops assaulted infected districts, using howitzers loaded with grapeshot and canister...to mow down rioters, and engaged in fierce building-by-building firefights.  Rioters defended their barricaded domains with mad desperation.  Faced with tenement snipers and brick hurlers, soldiers broke down doors, bayoneted all who interfered, and drove occupants to the roof, from which many jumped to certain death below. </TEXT>

 Russian officials have optimistically called the agreement a $500 billion deal.

And looking at the image posted by /u/vicarofyanks you can understand exactly why it's worth so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Case in point:
http://www.king5.com/news/local/white-center-woman-charged-with-hate-crime-after-posting-facebook-live/384841206

 A White Center woman has been charged with a hate crime after posting a live video on Facebook that prosecutors say shows her tailing a Hispanic woman in her car, railing against the other driver for being "Spanish privileged" and threatening to ram her vehicle. ... 

 Prosecutors say Jametski blamed one of the woman's children for causing a car accident a year earlier, though police records show Jametski was at fault.

 Jametski has pleaded not guilty.

All because this woman refuses to accept the fact that she herself was at fault in the initial accident. She's going to have a swell time in gen pop. </TEXT>
