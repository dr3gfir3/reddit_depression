	<TEXT> There's a japanese artist who made music based on this effect. I forgot the name and title but what he basically did was, rather than writing the music first, he created a datamoshed/glitch art video and let that somewhat dictate how the song would go. It was pretty amazing!

My college portfolio was also inspired by the same effect </TEXT>
