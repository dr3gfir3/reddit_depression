	<TEXT> Milo is on the right side of the political spectrum, therefore he does not align with the economic policies of the alt right, as they tend to lean left even with their name.

Milo is a jew. Milo does not hate Jews. Milo isn't an anti semite.

Milo fucks black guys. Milo doesn't hate black people. Milo isn't a white supremecist.

There is nothing else to the alt right, he couldn't possibly be alt right by any standard.

I'll also drop this in here: https://youtu.be/ywmd8kR-AmI </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't that Black and White 

1. This bill is repealing an FCC regulation that hasn't taken effect yet. We all have been and are living in the absence of this rule.


2. This is not repealing the underlying statute that was the basis for this rule, which provides for generalized privacy protection. In fact, part of the reasoning for this repeal is that it creates conflicting regulatory schemes between the FCC and FTC, which already has rules in effect, requiring ISPs to provide some privacy protection.


3. The point about cable companies "buying" this bill is highly misleading. All the cable companies make contributions to nearly every candidate. In fact, the three senators who received the most from Comcast all voted against this bill. They were democrats Bernie Sanders ($64,974), Michael Bennet ($49,825) and Patrick Leahy ($41,200). Given that Comcast somehow couldn't "buy" these votes, one would think the vote had nothing to do with contributions and was straight party line - probably because it's the repeal of a last-minute Obama regulation.


4. What's being repealed is not a simple "you can't sell privacy information" but a complex, potentially burdensome set of rules that could make it much harder to do business for the cable companies. I'm not advocating one way or another, and I'm certainly not feeling sorry for Comcast, but it's worth noting that if the regulatory costs increase, you can bet the price of internet service is going to rise, too.  </TEXT>

I wanted to replace the fan like many had suggested, but when i opened up the power supply I noticed the connector to the fan is glued on, White greyish looking thing that I couldnt possibly get rid of without breaking something or electrocuting myself. I can't afford to buy a new PSU, what do?

Also while im here, on the Phantom 410 case should the CS650M's fan be facing upwards or below? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a) Life expectancy: Oh I wonder why, maybe it's because we actually have the free will to do what we want with out lives instead of being forced into a healthier lifestyle even if we don't want it. This is a non-point.

b) Debt to GDP? You forgetting who did that? The 20 trillion debt was caused by a certain if-if-if-if-if'er. Also I find it really ironic that a socialist is worrying about the debt. Considering that the debt is the last thing a socialist would care about if in power.

c) Don't fucking talk to me about wealth inequality. Wealth inequality doesn't mean anything. 90% of americans live well above the standard of living in Europe. Complaining about wealth inequality just shows you don't know shit about economics.

c) Hmm if Bernie hated corrupt politicians so much I wonder why he threw his support at Hillary Clinton after she rigged the primaries against him   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you mean globalism, I'll tackle it.

#**Globalism**

-Easier transfer of the means of production

-Easy redistribution to people in poor condition areas

-Freer trade (Also possible in a nationalistic state)

-Easier competition

-Sharing technology with poorer countries/"areas"

-Easier and more open to see and learn about others nations

#**Anti-Globalism** ^^^nationalism

-Poor countries have an easier playing field with the rest of the world

-Loss of culture and pride

-Corruption is inevitable. (Ie: EU)

-Slave trade

-Stale economy growth

-Abuse of power from elites controlling the planet

-50/50 chance of direct democracy, or corrupt politicians in power, neither of which is generally good for a state

-Jobs from hard working families taken for slaves in poorer areas

-Some cultures are not compatible, and extremes of both sides will cause violence to each other
