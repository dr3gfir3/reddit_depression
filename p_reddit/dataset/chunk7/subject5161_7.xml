	<TEXT> Loss is something I have always been accustomed too. I lost my parents at a young age, to a horrific tragedy. I lost my high school girlfriend in a fire. Every pet I have ever had, has either passed away from unknown circumstances, or ran away to never been seen again. I struggled for so long to understand why these things were happening to me, but one day I just stopped asking. I was sick of being the 24 year old guy asking 'why me'. I didn't want people to continue to feel sorry for me. 

So I moved away from my childhood town, away from all the family and friends that remained, and found myself in a strange city, 2,500 Kms from home. To start with, I was a little homesick, I won't lie, but I adjusted. It took me longer then expected to make friends, but eventually I did. I found myself a 9-5 office job, and a crappy little studio apartment, but I was happy. It was nice to not be the guy who lost everything for once, for no one around me knew my story. No one knew the pain and suffering I had endured, and it was wonderful. I even considered getting another cat. But things became eerily strange. 

I stopped hearing from my friends, which was strange as we would always meet at the trashy bar down the road for a few beers and some pool while watching the game every Friday. But they just stopped showing. I tried calling and texting each one of them multiple times, but sure enough, nothing. I attempted to find them and message them on Facebook, but it was as if they never existed. My work colleagues, who I was never close with, but was never hostile towards, started avoiding me. They would scatter when I entered the staff room, as if I was a bad smell their noses could not possibly withstand. I wondered, what I could have possibly done, to have yet again, lost everyone in my life. I kept going over the weeks leading up to the changes. Trying to figure out whether I had done something to have been the cause of the problem. But there was nothing. I could not remember anything. It was as if my memory had been erased and I had just awoken from a coma. But I knew my name, I knew all of my 'friends' names, I knew exactly where I worked and where I lived. 

I started to panic. Everyday, I tried to remember the day before, but I couldn't. I could only remember events from the current day. The only reason I know that any of this happened, is because thankfully, I kept a journal I would write in every night before bed. Corny, I know. Why would a 24 year old male who enjoys drinking beer and watching sports keep a journal. It was something I was accustomed to. I had kept a journal documenting every day since I was a child. Or so I could tell. It is a strange feeling, to know something, but not have the physical memory of it. I started to question whether anything that I thought I knew was actually true. I strained so hard just to visualise one memory, but I couldn't. It was impossible. As if someone had come along, and removed all physical memory from my brain. 

I quit my job. I was in no place to be working when I could no longer remember the day before. I didn't want to endanger myself or others. Thankfully I knew that I had enough savings in the bank to survive without working. My parents had left me a trust fund, and I had barley ever touched it. But then things started to get worse. I could no longer remember the hours before. It would be 12pm in the afternoon, and I could no longer remember waking up. I could no longer remember eating breakfast, or getting dressed. I was worried for my life. What had I been doing this whole time? I would try to make it to the doctors, but by the time I got there, I would somehow back away and go straight back home. The only reason I know this would happen is because I would write all this down. I knew I wouldn't remember the events of the day in a couple of hours, but I needed to somehow be able to tell myself what I was doing. I couldn't figure out why I never made it to the doctors. 

But the strangest part of this all, was the fact I was still functioning as a normal human being. How can one possibly remain in a normal lifestyle when they have no physical memory of the hours before hand, let alone their life? Although I knew everything I needed to know about myself, having no physical memory of this was starting to really confuse me. My sanity was deteriorating, as one can expect. Suddenly, one morning I awoke. It was as if I was okay again. But I wasn't. Memories of my life, of every single thing I had ever done started flooding in all at once. It was too much to handle. I slumped on the floor, tears rolling down my face. I held my head in my hands. The room had an unsettling feeling about it. Everything I thought I knew about myself was all a fabricated lie. The only event that was actually true was moving away from my hometown. Apart from that, it was all twisted lies I had somehow made myself believe.

I killed them all. Every last person that had ever gotten close to me.
