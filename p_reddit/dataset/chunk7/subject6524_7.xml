	<TEXT> Let me give you a completely honest take from someone who still considers Xenogears to be the greatest RPG ever made.

Has it aged well? In some aspects, yes. In many, no.

The two best qualities of the game for me, and many others, is the gameplay and story. The good news is both of these things (questionable translation at points aside) *HAVE* aged well. 

Now for the things that I think have *not* aged so well. For one, the artsyle and camera locations can make exploring and finding things a bit of a pain. Also, I find the opening few hours of the game a little bit tough to get through. But that may be because I have played through the first half so many times. 

You also can get lost in what you need to do at points if you arent paying enough attention or take a break from the game for a few weeks. Not through the whole game, but there are def points where you could find yourself not remembering what the hell you are supposed to do. 

Some people may disagree with some of my assessment, and that is OK. This is just my opinion. 

I will end this comment by saying that I still 100% recomment playing the game if you are a lover of JRPGs, because it is that good of a game. 

You absolutely get used to the negative things I mentioned after a few hours. The experience of this RPG is nearly unmatched. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first crash I had sucked. I lost about 2-3 hours of play. I fought through it. Through another 40 or so hours after that, I experienced probably 3-4 crashes. I had been saving as much as I could, but today it happened again, and happened after I did 90 straight minutes of synthesizing and then found myself at the underwater ruins with no campfires and a ton of good items. 

I had to go to work, so I left it on. Came back and it had crashed again....

It really stinks because I dont think I can go back and play it again now. The thought of resynthing all those items that I had painstakingly put together makes my brain melt. 

I was really enjoying the game....but this is a real shame. I still love the game, so I guess I will just wait and try to come back to it next year or something....but....just be really careful you guys =( </TEXT>

edit: I would really like something like the [Yamaha MX49](https://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/MX49) but have no idea if there is anything close to that for 100-200 dollars less.

	<DATE> 2017-03-18 18:14:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello sub! As a kid, I used to love messing around with MIDIs. I composed a lot of songs without even using a keyboard...just manually selecting notes and plugging them into bars. 

I forget the name of the program that I used, but it was incredibly user friendly. This was about 15 years ago, so I am obviously not looking for the same one, but one that is the easiest for someone who doesnt know what the hell they are doing to compose some simple tracks. This time around, I am going to try to get back into actually playing on a keyboard, though it has been years. 

I was wondering if you all had any advice for me as to a keyboard/program combination that above all other qualities, are easy to use and understand. 

I have zero knowledge in regards to either of these things as I have been out of the loop for well over a decade. I looked at some programs and they all seemed incredibly overwhelming. I totally understand I will have to put in some time with whatever I end up with to learn, but Id like to minimize that as much as possible.

I have a combined budget of about 400 dollars for both. Thanks ahead of time!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am incredibly ashamed and it's making me hate the country I grew up loving.

edit: lol, just came back to a flooded inbox of hate messages telling me to GTFO if I hate it so much. I can barely afford to survive at 50 hours a week, let alone be able to save the expenses required for such a move. If any of you Trump supporters would like to start a gofundme to get me to Canada, you go for it. Morons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's completely illogical to feel this way, but donald trump honestly makes me want to just kill myself.

edit: lol, dozens of Trump supporters telling me to do it. Cant you guys just take one second to look at yourselves in the mirror? Never in a million years could I imagine saying that to someone just because they are on the other end of the political spectrum of me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went away for a weekend while in college and my girlfriend slept with my roommate. The worst part was everyone knew about it. It ended up making me switch schools. It was a terrible experience. Also got a DUI that night when I found out. Had to think about them together while in a jail cell. Before anyone gives me shit for that, I was 20 at the time, and not drunk, but the legal limit for under 21 in my state was .02. </TEXT>
