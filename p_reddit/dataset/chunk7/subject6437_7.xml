After logging in to the System, please click the View or change the details of the bankruptcy claim that you have filed button, and change the details. However, regarding any changes to the creditors name which arise due to a change in the right holder of your Exchange-Related Bankruptcy Claim (pursuant to a transfer of claim, etc.), please see section IV.5 below.

	<TEXT> Hi fellow mods

As discussed in the other thread by mind_bomber, the issue of a Slack team channel was suggested. 

I've created a Slack Team channel as a result.

Please PM me with your email and I'll send you an invite. You can create a spare email to do this. Looking forward to seeing you on slack soon.

UPDATE: I've also created a Shared Google Calendar that is integrated into the Slack Channel (new event and reminders will show up in Slack) - I will add you to it at the same time I add you to the shared channel.

UPDATE 2: I've managed to integrate Reddit to Slack - so new posts in /r/futurologymoderators and /r/futurologyappeals will send a notice to the Slack Channel too. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi sorry for the late response - been away with family over Easter.

Completely agree with mind_bomber and others who have posted about being more proactive in this sub.

A great example to follow is /r/science, where they literally have an AMA every weekday, which they curate closely. They also have a mission, which is to make science accessible to a global audience, which I believe they are doing well. 

We should have a similar vision and mission, and promote the idea of a future for all. 

Great ideas from lug and abrownn re AMAs and podcasts etc.

Also, we need a mod slack - the science and defaultmod ones are very active. I note the futurology and futurologymoderators slack team names are already taken.

Let's get moving everyone! :) </TEXT>
