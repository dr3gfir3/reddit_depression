	<TEXT> Your right. I hadn't realized that about how the spread is developed. Like you said though, even with the person level stuff worked in, the line is still an attempt at determining a winner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was interested in seeing if there was a good source for predicting the Super Bowl winner. I figured that the Vegas line would be a good source. While the spread is used to make betting more interesting, I thought all the work that goes into it would make it a good source for determining a projected winner. As you can see, it isnt always right, but it doesnt do a bad job.

There is some good news for Falcons fans though. Even though the Patriots are the current favorite by 3.5, when the spread is that small, the favorite has only won 8 out of 15 times. That goes down to 7 and 14 if you take away the toss up game between Seattle and New England that we gave to Vegas as a gimme.

To create this visualization, I gathered information on who the favorite was to win the Super Bowl from Wikipedia. I used Excel to enter the data and Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) This lets people know where foreign born people live and how often people are to interact with them in each state.
2) Foreign Born is demographic trait with a smaller population. The five year estimates are more accurate in this case. I can't think of a reason that extremely timely data is needed for this population that would compromise accuracy. 
3) Tableau Public is free and something that I am familiar with using. I find QGIS less user friendly.
4) Its informational, it compares the proportions to other states. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to create a visualization showing the time that Americans say they arrive at their work place, so I gathered data from the American Community Survey. I used Tableau to create the visualization and excel to help me with some of the data editing. The data comes from the 2015 ACS 1 Year Public Use Microdata Sample which can be found on the ACS Website..

I decided to use ACS PUMS instead of the published data tables because the published tables have unequal time intervals that I think are meant to show fairly similar group sizes. The PUMS data though has this variable broken out into 5 minute time intervals except for three instances where it is a 10 minute interval. I went ahead and combined the data into 15 minute intervals using the Tableaus calculated field option, some excel functions, and the ACS PUMS Data Dictionary. I also did some work with some other variables so that you can filter the data by state of residency, sex, and the class of worker. The result of this work is shown in the visualization.

	<TEXT> Last week, I was inspired by u/iturki27s post of the Worldwide Human Sex Ratio to create a map that showed the gender ratio of the states and counties in the Continental U.S.  While I was making that I realized that there are some major differences in the data if you control for age range. That is when I decided to make this graphic which shows the differences.
I used American Community Survey data which is compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau for my dataset. I gathered the 2011-2015 estimates from Table B01001 which can be found at American FactFinder. I then used Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

Edit: I created an [interactive version](http://overflow.solutions/demographic-data/what-is-the-the-sex-ratio-of-each-state-and-county-in-the-u-s/) that lets you look at the rate by age group and filter down by state. There are also tool tips which explain the dot size so hopefully that helps clarify the confusion about the size of the dots. </TEXT>

I decided to create another visualization that shows how it differs by marital status. I did this using my initial visualization and splitting it into two groups, those that are currently married and another I classified as single which includes woman that are widowed, separated, divorced, and have never married.
I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website. I then utilized Tableau to visualize the data. </TEXT>

Are there are some initiatives that you mentioned that poll well, but they don't get anywhere because those people don't vote, the liberal stance is too far left, or they are unworkable.

The liberals have the best PR campaign in the nation and they still lost the last election because they are simply out of touch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was interested in seeing how old the woman that gave birth in the last 12 month are so I made this visualization using American Community Survey Data. I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample, which can be found on the ACS Website. I then utilized Tableau to visualize the data.

Its worth mentioning that this is not representative of the woman that gave birth in the last 12 months from today, or even 2015. The question which is shown in the post asks this question. The answer is dependent on the month that the respondent answered the survey. The data shown above is representative of the responses gathered in 2015. </TEXT>
