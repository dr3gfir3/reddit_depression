	<TEXT> Yes it pretty much maintains itself.

The only thing I really do is in the cistern that houses the pump I have a large cage made out of bonded wire that I keep filled with barley hay which is a nature algae-cide.  In front of there are thick microfiber filters.  About one every couple weeks I pull the one filter out and replace it with the spare then hose off the dirty one and it's ready to go the next time need to swap them.

I have a third filtration layer between the swim pond and the natural pond comprised of several tons of pea gravel.  This is actual the first filtration encountered by the water and allows collection of any larger sediment such as leaves, twigs, etc.  Very easy to remove from that area by hand or with a rake. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No.  I have drilled a deep well because we wanted a second one on the property anyway. 

With the two waterfalls what happens is the swim end always stays at the same water level but the natural pond end can be raised and lowered for different effects.  I have a bed of pea gravel between the two and if I lower the water level then I get an active stream that runs between the two.  If I raise it then I have a little shallow area that the minnows like to hang out in to avoid the bass.

On the far end of the natural pond section I have buried a 330 gallon cistern and the pump is inside that.  So as the water flows down over the waterfalls into the natural end it continues to feed the cistern which in turn pumps the water at 18,000 gallons per hour back to the top of the waterfall via a buried 3" PVC line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really happy with mine.  I didn't know anything about aquariums but I bought it from a guy on Craigslist and he really had it all figured out.

So I have a bilge tank that is 30 gallons behind the wall which is in the closet of our master bedroom.  I plumbed a water line to it so when I need to add water I just turn on the faucet and add water in the bilge tank up to a line marked on it.  Makes it so easy to maintain.  The tank also has my filters and bio-balls in there and then the pump sends water back up in the aquarium.  Really low maintenance.  

One of these days I plan to add a ballcock float so like a toilet so that it will add water itself when needed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My god the comments here are doom and gloom.

First, question - is the pond spring or creek fed?  Or is it a seasonal pond?  With a spring or creek fed you don't really have much to worry about - including the guy warning you about cottonmouth and snapping turtles.  Take it from a guy that pretty much lives in our small lake - and yes swims (and catches) the snakes and snapping turtles.  They will not attack you and frankly you rarely see them because they will head the opposite direction from you as soon as they see you.

As a side note, I also have built a 100,000 gallon natural swim pond in my yard that has fish in the natural end and a large waterfall feeding into the swim end.  It is fed from a deep well and circulates via high-volume submersible pump through three levels of natural and artificial filter systems.  

I still haven't put up a DIY project on this but will once the landscaping fully comes in this spring.  Three years into this build so far: http://imgur.com/a/zhfyv

EDIT:  A couple more pics as I realized from that angle (above the waterfall) you couldn't really see the full pond.  http://imgur.com/a/soSPI </TEXT>

	<TEXT> GA checking also.

Nearly the same - 1967 built.  Rehabbing and expanding.

I initially put in bat insulation and just like you - it was a waste.  Even with strapping the insulation sags between the straps.

I had foam insulation put in the walls and roof when I put in the addition and wish I had done the same with the floor.

I also just had foam put in a new outbuilding with my office and workshop.

Having it done twice now I am considering having them come back and do the crawl space to solve things once and for all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One morning we were driving down a busy road near our house when a small movement near a privacy fence caught my eye.

The privacy fence ran along the perimeter of a housing development.  I turned the car around in the entrance and went back to look.  We found an injured dog laying up against the fence.  it had obviously been hit by a car and pulled itself 30-40 feet to the fence.  There was no collar on the dog.

I wrapped the dog in my coat and carried it to the car.  While I was putting it in the back seat with the kids my wife called to me that she had found something.  It was a dog collar laying by the side of the road.  There was no ID but there was a rabies tag from Texas.

We took the dog to the vet and while they were working on it I searched around on the web to find out how to track down a rabies tag.  I can't recall what department I ended up getting but they were able to give me the number of the vet's office that had issued the tag.

I called the number and got the vet.  I explained what had happened and described the dog.  The vet immediately knew who's dog it was and said that the owner had just moved to the Atlanta area where we lived. 

He got in touch with the owner and had them call me.  It turned out that they lived in the housing development that the privacy fence was around.  Apparently the dog had gotten out of their yard and found it's way out to the road.  

It ended happy enough.  The dog lived and the lady made chocolate chip cookies for my kids.

	<TEXT> Great question. Hopefully I'll have an answer for you soon. 

I am currently building a cabin on our lake. We like this floor so much we are thinking we're going to do the same thing in the great room down there. 

However my wife also feels that it's very cold so I am thinking of doing radiant heating at the cabin which I've been meaning to take a shot at for a while now.  Seems like the perfect time to try it.

	<TEXT> So let's see.  First things first, yes you would need to pull up the base boards but those are pretty easy to remove and replace (if you are careful pulling them off).

The crack scares me a bit.  There is obviously stress on the slab at that point and some foundation movement.  My concern would be that the SLC would be very thin and I think any further movement might lead to a crack for you.

But yes, I think it would be nice in a living area.  In fact I am building a cabin on our lake right now and I think we are going to do this same thing there in the great room.  

For the electrical outlets that shouldn't really be an issue.  Just remove the outlet cover and use some cardboard to make a little raise form around the area.  You should be able to use a riser plate cover to bring the outlet up the 1/4" or so.

Some comments have indicated concerns about longevity but I have not experienced anything that leads me to believe that I will have issues.  The Sika is polymer-based and seems extremely resilient not to mention the epoxy finish on top adding quite a bit of protection.  And frankly if I ever did have an issue - so be it - I'll redo the now perfectly leveled floor with tile.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me clarify.  The 1 minute between pours is when I was doing smaller 1-2 gallon pours out of a 5 gallon mix.

When I did the larger room we initially tried using my electric cement mixer but it just didn't do as good of a job mixing it as the mud paddle.

So for the larger room there was more like 5 minutes between each pour.

One other tip - you will get some small "clumps" on occasion in mixture.  This seemed to be where maybe a small amount of moisture had clumped and hardened in the bag before it was even bought.  Anyway, if you have any of these just pick them out and the mix will settle in where it was.  If you have any small area where one pour doesn't self-level fully to the prior one I would just smooth it with my hand to nudge it together.  That would leave some very cool little marks in the finish that add some additional character/marbling to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I don't think a lot of people understand is that one of the biggest flaws in any plan is that poor people use the emergency room as their personal doctor.  When they get that for free why would they ever choose to pay for insurance?

The people that are hurt the most are lower-middle class that actually do want insurance and have some form of income and/or assets that a hospital can and would come after them for. </TEXT>

If you are getting moisture in the slab itself I'm not sure how you would handle that but the epoxy finish I think would sure the purpose of "sealing" it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes.  I would mix it in a five gallon bucket.  For the larger area I would dump the full bucket - sometimes walking along creating a "line" that would spread back and touch the prior pour.  Sometimes just dumping in one place that would spread and create a circle.

For smaller area I still mixed it in a 5 gallon bucket but I would transfer it to a smaller 2 gallon bucket or just pour a smaller amount, wait a minute or 2, then pour another small amount (maybe a gallon at a time). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All in $2.50 sq ft.  I think that's pretty reasonable.

Especially given the fact that when I started this project is was really supposed to just be used to get the floor level before finishing it with tile or something.

We ended up liking how it looks so much that we decided just to go ahead and make it the finish floor.

Edit: Oh, and the work compared to other finishes was a breeze.  I'm used to back breaking work putting down tile or hardwoods.  This was literally a standing up job.  Very easy on the back and knees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I can't give a straightforward answer because of the mistakes I made.

But the office is 450 sq ft.  The bathroom is about 80 sq ft.

The bathroom would be the best way to get to a price since I had figured things out by then.

I used 5 bags of self-leveling concrete at about $22 per bag.  This is the brand I used: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Sika-50-lb-Self-Leveling-Underlayment-517004/207086698  So $110 for concrete.

One box of the garage finish epoxy like this: http://www.homedepot.com/p/Rust-Oleum-EpoxyShield-240-oz-Gray-High-Gloss-2-5-Car-Garage-Floor-Kit-301355/206479008 - This is not the exact one but same maker.  I bought the clear gloss finish.  $90

So total of $200 for 80 sq ft or $2.5 / sq ft is a good target. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just poured.

A couple (hard) lessons learned:

- Use MORE water than the package says.  My first attempt I followed the directions exactly and it was a disaster.  It was too thick and would not "self-level".
- Mix it in small batches using a "mud paddle" bit.  Once I got comfortable with the amount of water I wanted added I used a 5 gallon bucket and marked a water line on it.  I would add the water first and then slowly add the concrete mixing as I went.  
- The THINNER you make it the lighter the floor comes out.  If you make it too thin then you end up with a bit of white coloring (caulk) on the top.  This sweeps off / buffs off very easy.
- The bathroom I am very happy with.  This was the last one I have done.  I really like the dark color which came from finding just the right level of water (a bit thicker than what I did in the office).

EDIT: I forgot one other tip.  How much marbling you want will dictate the bucket size for applying it.  The large office I used full 5 gallon buckets.  Just pour it out in an non uniform design - sometimes go in long flowing swoops.  other times more of a large puddle/circle.  When doing smaller areas like the bathroom I used a small 2 gallon bucket so that there was more marbling. </TEXT>

The purpose of this post I hope is that somewhere somebody starts to see this frequent situation before theatres become the same as drive-ins - a blast-from-the-past oddity that people go to once or twice in their lives to say they did it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow.  Not quite the response I expected but everyone is entitled to their opinion.

All I know is that for decades management seemed to control the theatres just fine.  There were active ushers standing in the front at different times to deal with people that were talking or clowning around.  So theatres can deal with it if they wanted to.  There were 7 employees sitting in the lobby at a table laughing and having a good time.  So clearly it wasn't a priority to management to ensure the patrons were following the rules.

Anyway, you won't have to worry about the old guy with his family just sitting there quietly anymore.  With the old fuddy-duddy gone you will be able to have an enjoyable MST3k experience.

I hope you have fun arranging your day to go to showings that are "less frequented".  Most people don't have that luxury. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An open letter to theatre owners - My last time visiting one of your establishments was to watch 2/3 of Logan. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Theatre owners,

Hello old friend.  Wow how we have grown old together.  I'm 52 now but I remember riding my bike to the theatre to see Star Wars.  I grew up with ritual dates every other weekend to see a new movie.

Marriage and kids came next.  While that may have changed the types of movies I went to I still came to see you several times a month.  Luckily I got to raise kids in the Pixar era when the "kids" movies really weren't that bad and had enough fun for adults that it wasn't torture to watch.

Now I have moved into middle-life and with the comic books of my youth now projected up on the big screen I find that I'm the one dragging my kids - who frankly would rather not go to a theatre.

That's right you are losing (or have already lost) the next generation.

Well guess what?  Your inability to control your theatres to provide an enjoyable experience in this age of "me-first", inconsiderate patrons has now cost you one life-long viewer.

I took my wife and youngest son to see Logan this weekend.  Behind us sat a family of 5 - mother and four kids, the youngest about 2 years old.  In an R rated movie.  The rest ranged in age from 8ish to maybe 15.  They constantly talked even after I turned around and asked them several times to please be quiet.  The mother on her phone texting and didn't seem to care one way or the other.

Finally I couldn't handle it any more so I simply left.  The "manager" who looked like he was about 12 offered us "free movie passes" but I told him no thank you.  Maybe the 7 workers sitting at the tables laughing should have been ushering (you know - like the good ol' days?) ensuring that your guests are able to watch the movie they pay for uninterrupted.

So you have lost the next generation to the convenience of digital entertainment at home.

Now you have lost this life-time moviegoer.  $50 for three people to go to a movie where the only thing we can hear is the other people that paid $50 talking and joking around?

Nope.  Thanks.  I'll wait for it to come out on Amazon or Netflix.

And I sure hope the Entertainment Industry starts realizing that theatres are getting ready to go the way of the drive-in and start releasing new movies directly to PPV.  I would have gladly paid $50 to Amazon to watch Logan at home where I would actually have been able to hear the dialog and know how the movie ends.

	<TEXT> I'm the CEO of an enterprise SaaS HRIS vendor.  Prior life I have been developer, a consultant in the space and Director of HRIS at a F500.

First question - do you enjoy working with computers?  If not don't even think about a career in HRIS.

Further, what are your interests with regard to HRIS?  You can approach it from a variety of angles ranging from:

- Corporate user.  You learn and use the HRIS that a company has in place.  If it is a legacy on-premise system like PeopleSoft or SAP you will learn one specific system and a client-specific set of processes.  If it is SaaS based you will have less access to the tech but you will be tasked with more "configuration" of the rules to implement your employer's processes.

- Consultant.  Hooking on with one of the many consulting firms in a junior position is always a good starting place if you enjoy fast paced and ever changing environments.  You move from client to client - each with differing HRIS systems and requirements.  You learn a broad range of skills applicable to many facets of corporate life - negotiating deliverables, efficient meeting management, crisis management, etc.  If you have dreams of becoming and executive one day this is a *great* path to go through.

- Vendor side.  Going to the vendor side is as close as you can get to the technology aspects.  It is daunting and painful.  The systems you have a hand in designing are *mission critical* to the customers that buy them - especially if the solution includes payroll.  

I've sat in each of the seats above and can honestly say that everyone is very different and has pros and cons.  The direction you pick is really based on our personal goals and personality.

Best of luck to you!

	<TEXT> Back then it was hard to protest in any meaningful way.  There was no internet so organizing would have been difficult.  

Also politics were not nearly as divided as they are not.  I never even knew what party my parents were because my dad said "How I vote is between me and the voting booth". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working on a large mural in my office.

One wall is Cap throwing his shield and on the other end of the wall is a Hydra agent getting hit by the shield.

So for Cap I need an action pose where he has just released his shield but every picture I can find of him throwing the shield is always coming directly at the viewer.  I need him throwing "across the page" if you will.

Can anyone think of a picture that captures this I can use as reference?

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several people have said this and while I don't disagree entirely I think it overlooks the fact that much of our cultural norms are rooted in Christianity and while we have separation of Church and State (in theory) there is definitely legislative influence that drives the suppression of assisted suicide that is rooted in religion. </TEXT>

Either there was something in the garage that got in the way of the door closing or someone jumped out of the bushes while your wife was backing out and got in your house.  They might still be there. : )

Anyway, if you don't get killed by the intruder I would look for a rake or shovel or something that might have fallen under the path of the door. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly it really depends on the employer.

Larger companies are so tied to their processes they can't see the forest through the trees.

My company has no problem promoting people directly based on their skills.

When I started this company I hired a 22yo with a finance degree.  Nothing but intern experience.  He was stellar!  So within 2 years I had him as my Director of Finance managing people twice his age.  He stayed with us for 4 years and was amazing before it was time for him to spread his wings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure of your age but I can share with you my personal story.

I was raised to believe that you work hard and you will be rewarded.  That was from my father's generation when companies were loyal and everyone had a pension.  Jobs were for life.

When I graduated college in 1986 I took my first job with a Fortune 500 company and started doing what my father had taught me.  I worked hard, long hours.  All of the things you mentioned you did.  But when I finally asked about a raise/promotion I was told "you don't have enough grey hair".  

The next time I saw my father I literally cried as I told him that I couldn't play by those rules.  And he gave me the advice that would change my life.  He said "son, times are different.  You still have to work hard and you should give an employer your all but if they don't reciprocate then you have to find the right employer that will".

I left the corporate cubicle world.  I became a consultant getting paid multiples over what I was paid as an employee to do the same job basically.  And as a consultant somehow people would actually listen to me regardless of my hair color.

After a few years, that got old.  Sure the money was great but the travel was killing me (and my first marriage).  For all the money I was making I realized that the firm I worked for was making *way* more off of me.  

When you realize that you are a commodity and profits are simply based on how many hours you can bill it becomes clear that there is a firm cap to the amount of money you can make - i.e. how many hours are you willing to work/bill?

So I quit and started my own software company.  I built and sold that one, founded another one.  Built and sold that one.  Founded another one.  

This third (7 years in) will be my last because now I'm 52 and want to relax a bit and enjoy the fruits of my labor.

Moral of the story is it takes two to tango.  Work hard and if you aren't rewarded move on.

But I have had too many hires in the past couple years of youngsters talking a big game and then when you put them in they are over their head.  Earn your right to sit in a chair people. </TEXT>

I have been building it for over a year now.  I still have a little bit of trim work and clean up to do.

Since I started working from home full time about six months ago I have been working in my bed with a laptop on my lap.

I just decided enough is enough.  Start working in your new office and you'll feel like a new man.  

So far, so good. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A willingness to work hard to earn promotions/raises.

There seems to be a sense of "well, if you pay me more then I will do more".

We were taught to do the job you want not the one you have.  Exceed expectations and show what you can do and the promotions/raises will come behind it.

Today's generation seems to want the pay and title first before proving they really can deliver on what they say they can.

	<TEXT> Well that leads to another funny story. When I was younger and a lot stupider I loaded up a lot of hardwood flooring in the bed of my truck and didn't strap it in. When I pulled out at a light the entire load ended up in the middle of the intersection and I had to reload it all with the help of strangers. Pretty humiliating.

So now the pendulum has swung the other way and I am concerned about everything I'm doing when I'm coming home from Home Depot.   </TEXT>
