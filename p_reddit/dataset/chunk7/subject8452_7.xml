	<TEXT> That's assault, Report it to your boss and report it to the police.

Many tears ago at Miami High School 1968-69 we had a PE Teacher name redacted (But can be supplied)who used to use his middle knuckle  on our breastbones, also did this with girls if we had the wrong colour t-shirt on for sports days. We put up with this as in those days we did not know better.  We had a Pommie guy stary and he decked the teacher after  he tried this on him, git expelled til his mother told the school she was going to suw fir assault, got let back in, Teacher tried it on again and had a Javelin or two thrown at him. Left our class alone after that, took his crap out on younger kids. To this day If I ever see the prick who is probably 75-80 I will belt the fuck out of him. </TEXT>

That said 20+ years ago we used to get 250-300mm of rain overnight a few times.

	<TEXT> This story is at best minor local news.

The only Australian news source that put it up was the SBS, which is a unique Australian broadcaster that has international news from most countries, It was put up by an Indian presenter.

 At last count 25+ Indian news sources have this story up.

What is it with Indian news, do they all suffer from small appendage problems when we are playing them in the Cricket?

Even though we are 3 for 71 in the second innings.

My local Sikh mates would have taken these bogans out the back and given them a fllogging, end of story. 

As for the other racist attacks in Australia, More than a few murders have been carried out by Indians. 

The murders of 25-year-old fruit picker Ranjodh Singh on 29 December 2009 in Griffith, New South Wales resulted in a protest in New Delhi. Three Indian nationals were put on trial for the murder of Singh in April 2011, with police alleging that the murder related to a pay dispute

A subsequent Indian Government investigation concluded that, of 152 reported assaults against Indian students in Australia that year, 23 involved racial overtones. 2009

	<TEXT> So a Neighbour was throwing out his Victa whippersnipper for trash ansd Treasure, I grabbed it and like all of them It basically needed the carby diaphragm cleaned, runs. I also have a 14ft Hobie Turbo how would this go on the back like those Vietnamese river boats.? 

I imagine some sort of reduction gearbox and a wider throttle range. 

It's a bugger my old engineer mate passed away, this would have been right down his alley, as he motorised a few pushbikes over the years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The neighbours daughters partners sons are miners up north Australia for  six months a year, the other six months they spend prospecting for Gold (Have found 9 oz so far this year) They have a lot of hi-tech stuff, recently they were prospecting in Woolgoolga creek area, about 5-15k's up and one of their tools is like a yabby pump which sucks stuff out of crevices. 

They have pulled 250mls of Mercury out of the creek which is /2/3rds of a coke can out of the creek which is a water supply for the local area. They have reported it to authorities but no one is mentioning it.

We have had Gold mines in the area for years, a mates wifes father worked on one in the same area until they hit water in the 60's and could not pump it out fast enough, It was productive.till then. There was a working gold mine on Woolgoolga headland.
