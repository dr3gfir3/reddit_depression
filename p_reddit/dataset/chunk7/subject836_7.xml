	<TITLE> I a [30/m] needs advice on this situation with my LD relationship with my [36/f] (Long Read) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-24 18:21:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *sorry if it reads like im rambling im real upset*

Im a 30 yr old male and for the last couple of months, ive been in a situation with someone we'll call Dionne. I met Dionne online on a Internet forum. She spark my interest with her comments on various subjects and it lead to private PMs and eventually the exchange of phone numbers.

I found out she was living in Florida and me living in Louisiana. I've been in long - distance relationships before , but never like this.

We both develop a attraction - a sexual one as well. However i made a couple of mistakes. I'll explain

When we first started talking i lied to her and told her i was living on y own. Reason why is because in my own eyes i felt inadequate. Like i couldnt match up.  

She stayed

I had situations with her where i could always reach her cause of my phone and living in a area that is out of range.  However i found a way to communicate.

Recently my father came into some property and want to move us out of New Orleans. This lead to a sort of conflict. Also with my mom, being overprotective and interfering in our relationship. (I'll explain later) 

Guys she is incredible, beautiful , sweet, nurturing. She want to deal with me, it feels odd. 

I further dig myself a grave because i made a false accusation that lead to e and her not speaking on New Years and blowing her off. the one time i do in fact decide to try and be there my mom barges in and interferes, this lead to a argument with her and it lead to a argument with me mom.


Right now im deep in the friendzone but im trying everything to win her back. Just dont know what to do then i wake up to a text message from her that says:

"Today is bad   toxic. I'm angry:

-That I allowed myself to abandon my good judgement and get emotionally invested when the signs were clear not to. Now, I have to work to fix myself - mind   emotions...figure out why I thought this was OK to do to myself. 

-That you came into my life to give me more lies, disappointment, pain   confusion than to add kindness, companionship, joy   pleasure. More negative experiences than good. All for nothing. You knew what you had going on in your life.

-That you say you need a lot of time but still in contact. Go live your life. Time waits for no one. 

-Friends? 
A true friend in honest, loyal, trustworthy   caring. In hindsight, we weren't really friends when we were together but I'm conflicted now because I know that you as a platonic friend is highly valuable. That opportunity is in jeopardy now too.

-That you constantly pushed me away and rejected me and now you say you are fighting to win me back. Let me be. You don't want me and because of that I don't want you. I want peace of mind more."


im just sad, depressed, scared and angry that i let her down. i dont want her to go guys. what do i do?

	<TEXT> British heavyweight sensation Anthony Joshua wants to see his American counterpart Deontay Wilder step his competition up.

Joshua (18-0, 18 KOs) turned professional less than four years ago, but will face future Hall of Famer Wladimir Klitschko in April.

Wilder (36-0, 35 KOs), whos been around nearly nine years, will face Gerald Washington in his next fight.

While Joshua kept it respectful, he made his feelings clear: the Gerald Washingtons of the world will no longer do.

Many boxing pundits, fairly or unfairly, agree. Wilder has been criticized for his level of opposition as hes ascended into the heavyweight hierarchy.

I think Wilder needs to fight better opposition, Joshua exclusively told Sky Sports. Washington is good, but hes up and coming still. It was a last minute call-up as well.

Wilder has been a professional for around eight to nine years and I want to see a bit more, and there is nothing wrong with that, said Joshua. Good luck against Washington, but I think the other contenders in the heavyweight division need challenging as well, so I think it would be good for Wilder to force these type of fights, rather than taking easy pickings.
