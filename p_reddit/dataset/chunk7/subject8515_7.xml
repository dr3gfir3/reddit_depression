	<TEXT> 8 is the age of accountability at which people can be baptized into the Church. My understanding was always that this is because up to that point, the human brain can't make reasonable, well thought-out decisions. Obviously some people develop that ability at a much earlier age, and some much later, but that's beside the point.

If our ability to make important decisions is contingent upon the development of our human brains, how could we have been trusted to make the decision of whether to follow Jesus' plan or Satan's plan? That's the most important decision any of God's children will ever make, and he let them make it before giving them the ability to make decisions?

I can't believe this never occurred to me. TSCC is so full of shit.

EDIT: Yes, it makes sense that we were smarter in our spirit forms than we were as human babies. But if that's the case, physical bodies are a limitation on our intelligence, and we shouldn't have to praise God for giving them to us. </TEXT>

I always thought it would be cool to see an HD remake on the Wii U, since the control scheme lends itself to the Wii U Gamepad better than any other game I can think of. Unfortunately, given the impending release of the Switch, it looks like that isn't happening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [SPOILER ALERT] My biggest sin for the movie is the fucking Obliviation rain at the end.

Earlier in the film he has this extremely poisonous venom that he says "probably has some use if diluted enough," but by the end he suddenly knows exactly what it does and exactly how diluted it needs to be, and for whatever reason, breaking the vial inside a cloud evenly distributes it throughout the cloud and immediately causes it to start raining. He says "you know what to do" to the phoenix hippogriff thing when he gives it the vial, but how the hell would it?

So then it's raining venom, but it's diluted enough to wipe people's memories instead of killing them, apparently. But it's not an Obliviation spell from a wand being controlled by someone, so nobody is controlling which memories are being erased. Do people lose more memories the longer they stand out in the rain? How many of these poor fuckers out on the street are going to forget where they live and what their families look like?

Meanwhile, a bunch of witches and wizards are walking through the city, Doctor Strange-ing it back to normal. But the rain is hitting them too, and we know from the Harry Potter movies that wizards are just as susceptible to Obliviation as Muggles are. Why aren't their memories being wiped?

We also see shots of people *inside their houses* losing their memories. Does the rain have an aura of forgetfulness instead of needing to physically come in contact with you? Fine, I can live with that. But then how can Jacob stand mere inches away from it without losing his memory for the sake of a dramatic scene?!

And then the rain takes longer to wipe his memory than it did for anyone else, purely for dramatic effect, and he doesn't just forget about magic, he also forgets about all of his new friends. If the rain is capable of that, some poor bastards DEFINITELY just forgot their families.

Fuck this movie. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [S1E7 SPOILERS] Theory about Bernard's past </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-14 04:32:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So it's pretty obvious that Ford is building a host version of Theresa so he can avoid suspicion. This got me thinking: Bernard is the inquisitive type, and even as a host he's been figuring out things he isn't necessarily meant to know (even if Ford is technically controlling it). What if he wasn't always a host? I think Bernard used to be a real human employee and figured out something he wasn't meant to know, facilitating a dramatic murder by Ford much like the one we saw of Theresa tonight.

I also wonder how many times this has happened. Ford mentioned the board's many investigations; has a board member been killed and replaced on each of those investigations? How many board members are hosts directly under his control at this point?

I think Ford is even more of a god than we know, and it's starting to scare me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh shit... maybe Bernard used to be real but learned something he wasn't supposed to know, and Ford disposed of him the same way he disposed of Theresa. Then, in order to avoid suspicion, he created a host version of Bernard, the same way he will now create a host version of Theresa. </TEXT>
