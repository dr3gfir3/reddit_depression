	<TEXT> Hey everyone - I get that a lot of these "medical" or self help books are of very questionable content but I am not going to get into banning books from here by subject matter.  That's a slippery slope and I will not go down it.

What you can do to combat questionable content:

- downvote it

- comment on it and tell people it's questionable.  Even include links to evidence of such.  

- post better things (you see a bunch of crap?  try to find something better to drown it out)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes authors or publishers reach out to me and sometimes I reach out to them.  Often I email someone at the publisher who knows reddit and ask them to help me get in touch.  Usually for bookclub I reach out to someone who has written a book I think a lot of people will like and is interesting.  

Once someone is interested we talk about dates and times to get something that works for the author.  Usually anytime that is good for them is good for me.  Bookclub AMAs are always at the very end of a month but other than that scheduling is very open.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked in bookstores for 15 years.  There is a HUGE following for amish romance novels and a lot of them are sort of weird topic wise like this one.  Ladies actually come in and ask for amish romances and probably half of the christian fiction section is comprised of these.  It's weird.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't actually think the Chtorran ecology is evil - I am not convinced that what we have seen so far is even sentient.  Much of the ecology seems quite organized but so does a beehive or ant colony.  True evil requires higher though process than that and I don't think we have seen anything capable of that. 

I also think it's very likely that whatever the intelligence is behind then invasion is so fundamentally different in though process from humans that it may not even be capable of human evil.  If you can't comprehend evil can you actually be evil?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The r/books bookclub selection for January is The Dragonbone Chair by Tad Williams! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-30 22:26:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We have not read any epic fantasy for bookclub yet so I think this will be a nice change of pace.  Tad will be doing an AMA here on 1/27. 

[From Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91981.The_Dragonbone_Chair): 

With The Dragonbone Chair, Tad Williams introduced readers to the incredible fantasy world of Osten Ard. His beloved, internationally bestselling series Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn inspired a generation of modern fantasy writers, including George R.R. Martin, Patrick Rothfuss, and Christopher Paolini, and defined Tad Williams as one of the most important fantasy writers of our time. 

This edition features a brand-new introduction from Tad Williams' editor as well as the original introduction from Williams himself! 


A war fueled by the powers of dark sorcery is about to engulf the peaceful land of Osten Ardfor Prester John, the High King, lies dying. And with his death, the Storm King, the undead ruler of the elf-like Sithi, seizes the chance to regain his lost realm through a pact with the newly ascended king. Knowing the consequences of this bargain, the kings younger brother joins with a small, scattered group of scholars, the League of the Scroll, to confront the true danger threatening Osten Ard. 

Simon, a kitchen boy from the royal castle unknowingly apprenticed to a member of this League, will be sent on a quest that offers the only hope of salvation, a deadly riddle concerning long-lost swords of power. Compelled by fate and perilous magics, he must leave the only home hes ever known and face enemies more terrifying than Osten Ard has ever seen, even as the land itself begins to die.

After the landmark Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn trilogy, the epic saga of Osten Ard continues with the brand-new novel, The Heart of What Was Lost. Then dont miss the upcoming trilogy, The Last King of Osten Ard, beginning with The Witchwood Crown! </TEXT>
