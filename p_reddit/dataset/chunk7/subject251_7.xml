	<TEXT> My basic recipe- 2.5 gallon batch 60 min boil
Steeped 1/2 lb of flaked oak in 155 F water for 30 mins and removed bag. 

Added 2 gallon of water to the steep and brought to a boil. 

Removed heat and added my liquid yeast extract (about 5.05 lb of CBW Pilsen Light)

Add initial bittering hops 10 mins into boil (citra - 0.5 oz I thinkkk) 

Add hops w 10 mins remaining (.75 oz azacca, .75 oz mosaic, .5 oz Citra)

Chill to 180F

Add .75 azacca .75 mosaic .5 Citra 

Sit for 30 mins, remove hops, and chill to 80F. Add yeast (M36 Liberty Bell Ale dry yeast - 74 to 78% attenuation) 

Transfer to fermenter and top off to 2.75 gallons 

45 hours in I added a dry hop of 1.5 oz Citra, 1.5 oz azacca, 1.5 oz mosaic

Pic was taken before dry hop was added, I added slightly after high krausen occurred. 

Now here's the tricky part... I didn't taking a starting gravity. I know I can just wait for the fermentation to be stable after 3 days, but how do I know what final gravity I should be aiming for? 

Anyone think the color is a little funky? Considering a cold crash to lighten it up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Opinions on swing top bottles?

I am fermenting my first NEIPA batch and don't want to start off kegging.  I figure bottling would also be a pain in the ass so my brew partner and I were considering filling 16oz swing tops and maybe a few 750ML growlers to give as gifts.

Any special equipment I would need for this or just priming sugar and cap? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much. I will double check on the strain when I get home and update.  

I had a 3 gallon batch that I have fermenting in a 5-6 gallon carboy at the moment.  I have an 8 gallon or a 5 gallon bucket that I could dry hop in.  I imagine I wouldn't want to drop the hop (in hop sack) in the carboy as it'd be a bitch to get out? Then just siphon the liquid into the new bucket without the sediment?  Or am I way off... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check your local distributors.  I know the A10V used to have an unreal lead time from the factory (literally over 50 weeks), but there should be a Rexroth distributor in the area.

Alternatively, you should be able to directly cross it over to a Parker P1 pump.  Parker distributors have a program that can get certain arrangements in less than a couple days if they don't already have them on the shelf.  If you need help finding a Parker Store or Truck Hydraulics Center, let me know.  I don't work for them (anymore) but have several contacts in the company still.

	<TEXT> So, there was air/pressure in the expansion tank.  The bladder was not broken.  Everything seems to be working fine now.  Woke up this morning, nothing but a couple of drops in the bucket under the relief/drip leg.

So weird... I guess I'll wait to see if it acts up again.

	<TEXT> Because opening to 12-15k essentially accomplishes the same thing when stacks are so shallow. Raising ~30% of our stack and having to fold is literally the worst option. It's also much better to raise all in than to call all in, as you are being the aggressor and will more often than not take it down pre. 

Try taking a look at some push fold scenarios and/or charts. There's tons of simulators out there  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your turn bet it too small tbh. I prob bet like $250 or so here most of the time. If he's willing to call the flop raise I think it's likely he has Qx or Axcc. As you said, c/r that flop w a made boat seems like value suicide. Just lead larger on the turn and this should play the rest of the hand out. 

I agree his river bet is troubling as he should know you're rarely folding the river given the odds/size of pot.  </TEXT>
