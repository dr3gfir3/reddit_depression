	<TEXT> Hmmm. I'm sorry I wish I could help more, but idk. I personally wouldn't try to mess with it just so that apple couldn't say it's my fault. How did it start happening?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't cut people out of your life because you feel you are dragging them down. He is your boyfriend, talk to him. Tell him that you've been feeling depressed and tell him why. He will want to be by your side and help you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Social interaction is something everyone enjoys. If you are giving someone attention they will love it. Don't force it on them, but don't be too reserved. Try talking to strangers in public. Cashiers, waiters/waitresses, people that it doesn't matter if you come off as awkward or anything because guaranteed you'll never see them again. Simple stuff like "how has your day been?" is a good starter, ask open ended questions so they can give a chance to talk a lot about themselves, people love to talk about themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone has something to talk about, just gotta find the right topics. Me and you are complete strangers and we're having a conversation right now :). I know a few people who aren't very talkative, not because they are shy, but just don't talk much. That doesn't mean I don't enjoy spending time with them, hell they're the best kind of people to have around when I'm just trying to relax going hiking or am at the gym.   </TEXT>
