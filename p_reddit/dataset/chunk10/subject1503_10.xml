	<TEXT> There is a lot of dialogue I'm reading here that concerns me. Specifically, the dialogue maintaining the "us vs them" mentality between the Democrats and the Republicans.

Lets be clear, neither side is "evil" and no one has everything right. Both sides have perspectives and backgrounds from which they hail. Granted, I'm a Democrat but that doesn't mean that my Republican friends are awful, and that I disagree with everything that they think.

Lets keep civil heads on our shoulders, and avoid the "us vs them" mentality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like we're missing Jet Li in this entire thread.

He's played gods, immortals, and just bad assess in most of his films:

- Expendables
- The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor
- The Forbidden Kingdom
- War
- Fearless
- Unleashed
- Cradle 2 the Grave
- Hero
- The One
- Lethal Weapon 4 
- Once Upon a Time in China

The list goes on.

	<TEXT> So I'm brand new to investing but have no real idea of where to even start. I make enough currently to have an extra $200/month I would like to start investing. First I suppose I'll answer all the questions above:

I'm 31 Years Old
I'm employed full time and make $25k/yr with a VA Stipend of $834/month.
I would like to build retirement savings.
My risk tolerance would be roughly 50/50.
I have no holdings currently.
My only asset would be my vehicle valued at about $4k.
My time horizon would be needing the money in the next 15-20 years.
I am still working off some debts (Yes I realize that paying off all existing debts comes first).
No other relevant financial information that I can think of.

Any advice on where to start or even things to read to educate myself on how to invest intelligently would be fantastic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most likely because leveling in Vanilla EQ required a much larger time sink to level than current games do. For example I played EQ for about 5 years and only at level 50-60 for 2 of them on one character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, being relaxed mentally is a good way to actually win more games.  Best advice I've ever been given when playing this game was, "When you've lost a few in a row, just stand up and go do something else". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only problem is that there is a large portion of the LoL community that plays nothing but normals, so for them that is the game.  So on the flip side of this when people who play a lot of ranked come into a normal game and just screw around with the reasoning of "its just a normal" it can piss a lot of people off.  

Focusing on winning is the goal of any game, fun is the effect you're after as a result of playing the game.  If you were to lose all your games in normal, you wouldn't be having fun I can almost guarantee. </TEXT>
