	<TEXT> I'm sorry if I don't respond to anyone. I'm just very tired right now, but I do want to say thank you to everyone who gave me support and advice in the last thread. It meant a lot to me and helped me see a bit clearer.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (UPDATE) I (25F) can't deal with my disabled mum (59F) anymore. I resent her and feel guilty and horrible and unstable. I wish I would disappear sometimes. How can I escape from this life or come to terms with it? </TITLE>

I left for now.

I didn't realise that my boyfriend - who lives so far away from me - would actually take me in. It never crossed my mind because of the distance and because I didn't want to impose myself on him and his family. I thought that I had no one at all, but apparently his family had offered to take me in a while ago. 

I told him I was having issues and he said that I can come live with him, his sister and his parents, and he helped me pack and leave. We'll be back later in the week for the rest of my stuff. 

When he came to see me, he saw how abusive my sisters were becoming when one of them decided to smash my door down and destroy the fifth lock I had to install, because they wouldn't stop breaking them. She started shouting some particularly nasty things at me and also tried to get him to break up with me as she was putting me down. I just had a complete breakdown. 

He also took me to see a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with depression and they suspect borderline personality disorder, which is apparently due to my abusive childhood eventually leaving me unable to cope with stress in a productive way. I'm being prescribed mood stabilisers. 

It's sad when you realise that your family has never loved you. They just said I was running away from my responsibilities and said they'd sell the animals when I'm gone. I'm at least planning to get the rabbits this week. They were the only ones who'd comfort me when I sat downstairs alone at night crying to myself. They'd always come and sit next to me when I was like that. 

I feel a mix of anger and sadness and I don't really know what to do with myself. I'm struggling to see a future right now, but I plan on just putting together a portfolio and seeing whether or not I can get into an art foundation or games design course with it. I'll also be getting a job when I'm in a better place so that I can start paying rent to this wonderful family who've taken me in, with the hopes of eventually finding my own place. 

*TL;DR I left that house. I feel very sad knowing that I meant nothing to my family at all.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always thought that I should blame myself for what's happening before I blame other people, but I don't know if that's just because I was raised to do that or not. 

I feel very guilty for not loving my family and sometimes I don't think other people understand why. I did make a small post before about dealing with my siblings and someone told me that I was likely the problem and that I was making them walk on eggshells around me and behave the way they do because I probably have something wrong with me, and that I should love them no matter what. I ended up feeling very conflicted about it. I feel like my siblings have been using me and are cruel to me but that I deserve it and that everyone expects me to love them regardless. I feel similarly about my parents and it's so confusing. 

With all the useful advice people have given me I'm starting to write out a plan so that I can finally live for myself and at least experience some of the things I've always dreamt about. I can't thank everyone enough for caring, even if they are complete strangers. I've never really had anyone support me or care for me before.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much for your advice. I'll start doing these things when I can. I really need to get out of here and just had no idea where to start. I've never lived on my own before so it's quite intimidating to think about starting completely from scratch.  </TEXT>
