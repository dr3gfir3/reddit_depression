	<TEXT> My main power animal is the red belly black snake, but i am also visited often in dreams and while journeying by the wedge tailed eagle and kookaburra, both natural enemies of the snake. In dreams I am often the snake, and often the bird chasing the snake. Both spirits have guided me through journeys in other realms and times and in lucid dreams. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol. I know, I know, correlation does not imply causation. But srsly you don't think that's a high percentage of people who are living with trauma? I've checked multiple sources and they're all roughly the same. Trauma doesn't always come about from violent crime, war, natural disaster but more commonly from complex trauma such as physical, emotional, sexual abuse and neglect from a caregiver. I'm Aussie and it's roughly the same here too, which is a high number of people but in the US that's massive, over half the population is overweight and well over half have been abused in childhood. It just blows my mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not always depression, in fact depression is often the last thing people consider. Which is why I brought it up, it sounds like OP's wife isn't only overeating but also giving up a lot of the other things she loved, and self isolating, all of those are symptoms of depression. It also sounds as if it is not solely overeating that is causing her to gain weight, she has also had a drop in physical activity.

In short, I'm not using depression as an excuse for overeating, I'm making a hypothesis based on the information I had available. It's just a hypothesis until it is tested. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I agree, but one of the hardest things to start is an exercise regimen when you are struggling with major depression. Believe me, I've been there, I used to be super fit, but it was as if I knew exactly what I needed to do, but just couldn't push myself to do it. Once I began medication and seeing a psychologist it got easier, but None of it was simple. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could it just be possible that she is depressed? I know my fitness regime went right out the window when I was, and I used to be so fit. I also used to have many extracurricular activities, dance, drumming, choir, hiking, regular catch ups with friends, that I really enjoyed but slowly gave up over time. If you love her, try and see beyond the surface issues and be there for her to listen without judgement and support her, she may not be depressed, but what she needs more than anything is your support. Nobody ever started a gym membership because someone judged them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hopefully someone with more knowledge will be able to provide an answer to that, I'm not from there, from north-western NSW, but my mum was a midwife in Yirrkala for some years before I was born. I would google the local land council and maybe find a contact you can email who could give you more understanding of the nuances in that deity's story and wether or not they thought it would be appropriate to use this as your planet name. I've seen a few posts here about cultural appropriation - and the  feeling is generally that its not a good idea. 
I'm also a big fan of sci-fi and think the sound of a planet found and named by aboriginal people sounds cool, even quite subversive of colonial motifs - having the opinion of someone of that culture might even give your story extra depth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would be so careful as so much appropriation, theft and misuse of aboriginal culture has taken place over the past 200 odd years. You really should not only rely on your internet research, a lot of what you may be reading was probably written by white people who didn't really understand or care to try and understand the intricacies of the stories they were setting down. Bamapana is cited as a Mungin deity, Murngin was what white anthropologists called the Yolngu people, perhaps reach out to Yolngu people and ask how they feel about the use of this deity in your fiction, it may seem of little significance to you but could be a major insult to them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Australian, and what you describe is very close to how I understand the world and other realms. I feel deeply connected to the land, plants, sea and animals, on both a physical and spiritual level, also to other planes of existence, the "everywhen", the lower, upper and middle realms, the before, now, next. My animals are red belly black snake, kookaburra and eaglehawk, I take their forms in dream, their energy assists me in waking life. It is difficult to describe all of it text, but it makes more sense to me than a European based paganism, although some of my ancestors came from Europe, most of them have been here for tens of thousands of years, so the connection is deep. Also, all of the solstices and equinoxes are back to front down here, compared to up there, so it just makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here in Aus we have these GP super clinics, all bulk billed, so I walk in with whatever ails me, and walk out with a prescription , a referral to a specialist (which is either free or highly subsidised), whatever I need. And it costs me nothing, sure a teeny bit of money comes out of my tax and goes towards this for everyone, but who cares. I'd rather my tax dollars went to public health than to making war. This was crucial when I suffered major depression last year, I just walked in, got a prescription and referred to an incredible psychologist, I've since been referred to a dietician and physio and I truly believe that had that not been so easy, I probably would have killed myself, I can't imagine how difficult it would be for people in places without universal healthcare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I am currently in therapy for trauma and major depression, part of my recovery has been rediscovering my spirituality, returning to practicing my own brand of witchcraft and nature worship. My therapist talks a lot about embracing the shadow and she is quite esoteric, so I'm not awfully sure wether she is talking about it in the Jungian sense or the magical sense, or wether both are the same thing. At any rate I thought I would read up on it all and get a better sense of it and how to include it in my spiritual practice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a self initiated sort-of antipodean hedgewitch. I don't follow a Wiccan or Celtic pagan path, I feel that my practice is very influenced by place and where I live. I'm deeply connected to nature, animals and do most of my magic either outdoors in the bush, or in the lower and middle realms whilst journeying or lucid dreaming. I'm quite solitary, in fact have only just started "coming out" about my witchcraft, which has helped me begin to heal from a log struggle with major depression. My husband describes me as being quite like a younger version of Granny Weatherwax in the Discworld novels, and thinks I should perhaps fashion a sign saying "I aten't dead" for when I go journeying. I'd love to meet other Aussie witches and spiritual types, and talk about how you weave your magic in this beautiful paradise where we are fortunate enough to live. </TEXT>

I believe that the essence of us moves on, but personality is made up of so much lived experience, failures and triumphs, each new journey brings new challenges, caregivers and friends who help to shape us. Don't worry so much about retaining your personality, it's not the most important part, your essence is what will live on. The Aboriginal people from the area I live believe that we are all travellers, we come here from space, live a short while and then fly off into the universe on the rest of our incredible journey. They don't fear death. I have memories from my lives before, I love this life, but I know this isn't the be all and end all and when the end comes, wether expected or not, I will be ready for the journey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of the Salem witch trials, it had nothing really to do with a belief in witchcraft and everything to do with taking advantage of the the naivety of the general populace and their belief in evil stuff and gaining the land of the people accused by putting them to death. Those teenage girls have a lot to answer for. Pretty sure that a big part of Massachusetts experienced about three years of famine after those trials as while the powerful gained the land of those they put to death, they didn't have anyone to work the land as all those able bodies were in jail. Totally backfired. I kinda feel it was all Tituba's revenge.

	<TEXT> My altar is a collection of things that a representative of the elements, the lower, upper and middle realms, my ancestors and the god and goddess.

They are all things that I've picked up on my travels through this world and then have been charged with power picked up by my journeys in other realms. A stone I found on the shore of Lake Ontario that has a spider web pattern represents earth, along with some hematite and a bowl of salt, some pumice from the volcanoes of Santorini represent fire along with some rose quartz and a candle, shells I've picked up locally and in Spain with clear quartz represent water and the plant kingdom, and my smokey quartz represents air along with a beautiful fluffy Kookaburra feather I found in my backyard where my kookaburra friend likes to visit me every morning and evening. In the centre is a sculpture of a tree with the roots trunk and branches representing to me the lower, upper and middle realms or the axis mundi. I also have a variety of candles, usually something living like a plant or flowers, and photographs,pictures and curios representing my ancestors. The assortment varies, sometimes more masculine elements lie opposite those with a more feminine feel, sometimes they swap sides, reside together, change areas altogether. It feels right to me, it feels safe, warm and loving, it's my safe space and a doorway, it a place where I can embrace both purity and do shadow work with impunity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I can really relate to you on this. I have done this again and again with my own personal trauma and the vicarious trauma I have through my profession. My only advice would be to listen to your body and be prepared that at some point you may need a little extra help to work through what you have heard in your job. And if at that time you feel you need some therapy, I would recommend t finding a psychologist who specialises in trauma informed therapy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first few visits I was incredibly guarded, they were so hard and I spoke about everything but my personal trauma, to be fair I was in an incredibly bad place physically and mentally on those visits. I probably was pretty close to making an attempt and I had been self harming and was really sick with a virus. But after awhile on some meds (SNRI's) and three sessions, the psych had set up an incredibly safe space where I felt comfortable and not judged. She also asked some incredibly insightful questions, she had guessed I suppose by my affect and presentation that I had some trauma responses so she gave me some body based interventions to do as homework and I was able to make up my mind that I needed to tell her about what happened to me. At the next visit I told her about the trauma and without crossing any boundaries she made me feel completely accepted and blameless. 

I'm still a long way off accepting what happened and I'm still fairly depressed despite the meds and therapy making me feel more at peace, but I feel I can make it through. I live in a country where we have a good public health system so I found this an easy process once I had decided to do something about it. Not sure if it's quite so easy in other countries. If I can give any advice it would be to try and find a psychologist who specialises in trauma informed therapy and practice. And good luck. PM me if you need to talk more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can relate to you on this, I have experienced personal trauma and also vicarious trauma through my profession and for the longest time I didn't seek any help due to negative experiences with counsellors at school and university. But recently I was diagnosed with major depression and found an incredible psychologist, it has helped me so much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are all individuals and on different time frames on or journey through the magic of eternity. We are all travellers in the universe. By the time your life on this earth ends your first love may have moved on to another life, plane, dimension. Meeting them again may take Millenia or seconds, you may not know them, you may know them immediately, or you may meet your second love and meeting your first love may have to wait for a later cycle. Time on this plane is complicated enough that we have to try and control it with clocks and timelines, what makes you think time will bend to these rules in the worlds beyond? I have had the experience of meeting someone who I had loved before, we both had this incredible "knowing" but in this life I am meant for another, we are on opposite sides of the world, at different stages in life. He still sends me messages every few months "someday I will come to you or you to me-perhaps in another life". It's bittersweet, but it is all part of the journey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm always thinking I'm in the wrong Sub here as I'm not Wiccan at all, although I am a practitioner of magic. I'm more of a hedgewitch or wise woman. Anyway the idea of a totem or power animal comes many indigenous cultures, and shamanistic practices. I'm Australian so it makes sense to me to practice magic with a more antipodean name slant, as such I journey a fair bit through deep meditation, to the lower realms, to a place of power. It was here that I met my power animal, the red belly black snake, who has stayed with me and assisted me despite me not asking it to. 

The meaning of your dream may be that your connection to these animals or spirits is pending, awaiting your journey to meet them. Or you might just have had a dream about butterflies because your friend mentioned it. At any rate to meet your power animal start practicing meditation, and lucid dreaming.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it makes you feel any better I'm attracted to shy, introverted guys, I'm married to one actually. I guess he probably used weed and alcohol to gain more confidence, but I knew him outside of just a social context and got to know him when he was sober as well as drunk or high, and it was the real him that I fell in love with, the sweet, shy guy. By the same token he got to know me with and without medication, on meds that didn't work and those that did. When I was mad crazy passionate and when I was curled on the couch for days. I can't speak for him as to what he was attracted to initially, but years later, I can say that it wasn't the crazy out of control me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for clarifying, I still find it difficult to understand, but whatever floats your boat. Just so you know, depression and anxiety are mental illnesses that make it difficult to control ones emotional balance, as are BPD and other personality disorders, schizophrenia, Bipolar disorder and PTSD from complex trauma (childhood abuse, sexual assault etc - also causes of depression and anxiety disorders) not going to run through the whole DSM-5 but you get the gist. As well as suffering from depression I work with people who have mental illness (probably by far not the only one out there - probably one of the major maintaining factors for my illness) so I've a fair amount of experience with the different ways that mental illness can manifest behaviourally. I can't give you any tips on how to attract this guy, all humans are different, and I can't think there is one typical presentation sexually for a person who is emotionally disturbed, some may be disinhibited, others may be terrified of sex due to trauma. I'm thinking your crush might be into the former, a free spirited type. At any rate good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure I can see how having a connection with a person who is needy due to emotional instability would be flattering, I just hate the thought of someone actively going after someone like who I used to be (probably still am tbh) because of that emotional instability, because it really sucks to feel that way, like ridiculously sucks, it hurts, it's painful to have mental illness. I also work in the industry, so I've first hand experience with women who have various mental health diagnoses. And for OP trying to get tips to act more mentally ill to attract this guy, I don't know, I mean I could give her lessons, but it still leaves me feeling a little cold ya know. No judgement, just stating how I personally find it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't use spells to heal anybody but myself (or very close friends if they ask for it) and I have never used curses or used magic in ill will against anybody. I might be in the wrong subreddit as my particular brand of witchcraft is more akin to that of the hedgewitch or wise woman than Wicca and I am very connected to nature and the land of the country I live in. 

I am an empath, in that I feel the emotions of others, and others find it very comforting to confide in me, and I can feel at them, helping them know they are understood, accepted, not judged. This skill is helpful with both the clients and those who care for them. I have a way with words that can persuade without being didactic, observing other's behaviour and planting the seeds of change within them without actually telling them what they should or shouldn't do. Nobody can make change happen for another person, but with skill you can set them on the path for them to discover how to change themselves.

For the rest, I connect to my place of power within, to draw strength, to find courage and to dissolve any negative emotions that I might accidentally integrate. For that I cast the a circle each morning and night to centre myself, but I can always connect to that place of power wether through deep meditation or simply envisioning it when I need during the day. </TEXT>
