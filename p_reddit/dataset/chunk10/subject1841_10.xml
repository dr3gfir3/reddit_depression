	<TEXT> Yeah he totally sucks sadly. No promotion of any kind for him either, he's been born into his business so he never had to work for it, he just got it by existing. I think it's a huge part of why he's an asshole (though of course this doesn't apply to all family businesses, just him).

Edit: Funnily enough my boss can't schedule his employees efficiently either! Couldn't do it if I slapped him with a diary. He leaves like two people working at the end of the week compared to say, five, and wonders why not as much gets done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that he's a fully grown baby. Bites down hard on the silver spoon he's known his whole life, thinks his problems are the absolute worst of anyones, and that everyone else should literally pick up his slack just because he's boss. When things don't go the way he envisions he has massive tantrums, kicks things and screams. Deliberately stirs shit to demoralise the entire staff and attempt to turn us against each other.

Obviously I hope to be rid of him eventually, still amazed he can maintain a business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn this dude sounds like a trainwreck! You did the right thing, definitely. Sounds like he just made the decision easier and easier over time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know exactly what you mean. I live hundreds of miles from my hometown now, and every time I go back I'm reminded of something similar cause of my shitty friend. Better to be glad you've moved on, by far! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually haven't! I only own one of his books (Misery) which I got from a used store, but haven't gotten around to it yet. I hear a lot of people praising The Stand too, so perhaps starting with these three is as good a place as any? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow what an asshole. Sounds incredibly insecure, my own worst friend was similar in this way, but I think the situation was a lot less extreme. No hard drugs or anything at that time, but desperate to get anything over me that he could. I suppose you just realised one day cutting him out was best? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn man that sucks :( it seems like drifting apart was the right thing to do, as hard or easy as it can be. If he's willing to defend those guys out of spite, sounds like he was never worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feared as much. I think I'll start with the ones I know (using the rankings for help) then move on to the collections. Thank you all for your help! Very prompt :D </TEXT>
