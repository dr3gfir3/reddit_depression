	<TEXT> CO2 would do it too, as would any pure gas other than oxygen. Gaseous exchange in the lungs works by diffusion, diffusion works by concentration gradients. So the higher the difference in concentration, the higher the rate of diffusion. So if you inhale gas with 0% oxygen, then it will actually cause oxygen to diffuse out of your blood in to the gas in your lungs very quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because most people hunch forward when driving, so they design them like that to reduce the distance your head snaps back in a rear-end shunt. Unfortunately I like to keep my neck nice and straight, so these forward-leaning headrests just give me neck and shoulder pain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Took me a while to work out how to work out the probability of this, but here goes.

There are 4! ways of arranging answers in each question.  
There are 4!^20 ways of arranging 4 answers in each of 20 questions.  
There are 20! ways of arranging 20 questions in each topic.  
There are 20!^5 ways of arranging 20 questions in each of 5 topics.  
There is 1 way of arranging the topics in the exam.  
There are 4!^20 x 20!^5 x 1 ways of arranging 4 answers in 20 questions in 5 topics.  

4!^20 x 20!^5 x 1 = **3.42*10^119 different possible exam permutations. This is more than the estimated number of atoms in the observable universe.** I wouldn't bother asking about changing the order of the topics.

	<TEXT> Total cunt. She used torrents and I asked her to limit seeding to off-peak times, so we didn't get our connection throttled (read: major lag on any online games). She agreed to that and I helped change the settings so that her torrent client wouldn't seed on weekday evenings. I didn't realise that peak times included weekend daytimes as well, so I asked her again to change the settings and she blew up on me. Something about trying to control her. I just explained that seeding can be done at any time, and doing it outside hours which will affect me (e.g. weekdays and nights) would be the decent thing to do. She refused, so I blocked her MAC address on the router (the internet was in my name). She went and unplugged the router, so I called her a bitch and ended up moving out shortly after.

	<TEXT> I know all of this, but couldn't be bothered to articulate it. You're obviously 100% correct. Due to the short-sighted way a lot of people see money, quite a few people may be happier paying less per month, but more overall. People already do it with phone contracts, car payments, insurance policies, etc. </TEXT>
