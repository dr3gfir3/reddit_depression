	<TITLE> Blue Boar Inn </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I feel like this story won't get yall as scared as most of these stories but this scenario scared me shitless. 
    So about 3 years ago my gigantic family, 22 people, rented an old hunting lodge/bed n breakfast for a week. It was called the blue boar inn and has had multiple renovations dating back to being an old trading post when America was being explored. I could be incorrect about that part but it's extremely old. 

About halfway through the week I go into my moms room to get some ibuprofen because i had a headache. I promise I'm not retarded but I was having issue with the child lock because I was being impatient. So when I rip the pill bottle open I'm looking forward toward the bathroom mirror. Behind me I see a blonde boy wearing a plain red tshirt. Scared the hell out of me but I quickly turn around thinking it's my little brother who's blonde. No ones behind me. I think maybe he ran off so after getting the pills I go into the living room. My brother is wearing a green long sleeve and playing cards with my grandpa. Says he didn't come into the room. They're midway through the game so it's impossible for him to have had been tricking me. I'm scared but I don't tell anyone thinking id sound crazy. That night I lock my rooms door using the slide chain just as a precaution. My cousin and older brother ask me why and I jokingly say "so uncle David doesn't fuck with us." They're okay with it cuz no one wants to be woken up. Well that night someone is banging on our door and I mean it's loud. Wakes my cousin, brother and I up. We crack the door and no ones there. So we close it again and about 5 minutes later the banging continues. That happened randomly throughout the night and kept waking us up. I hadn't told them about the boy cuz my family does have a couple jokester and we say one of them was just messing with us. 

Two nights later the entire family is awoken to screaming. My younger cousin, 10, is yelling at the top of his lungs "GET AWAY FROM HER GET HIM AWAY FROM HER" pointing at the crib of his baby sister. Everyone goes to their room and checks what's wrong. No one his tbere. After calming the boy down we ask him what happened he tells us "he was messing with olivia" we ask who and he says "the boy with the red shirt" at this point I ask if the boy was blonde and he says yes. I'm about to tell everyone my story but my mom pulls me aside and says she knows what I saw because she thought she saw the same thing and that I shouldn't tell anyone because it might ruin the vacation. She tells me she doesn't think anything bad will happen and that he's probably not mean or anything so it won't matter. After that I stay up all night unable to sleep. I then hear my door knob jiggle and it try to open. The slide chain is locked of course so it only cracks and then the door slams. My cousin wakes up and we go investigate to no avail. After that I always believed in ghosts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my friends exes came to his grandmothers funeral for the sole purpose of making it awkward for him to talk to family. She had told her friends what her plans were and they told him later. Basically every time he tried to talk to a family member she would run up and get in the conversation until he eventually told her to fuck off in front of his family. I'm sure he was super embarrassed. He and the girl had been broken up for almost a year. I hate when people call there exes crazy but she actually was crazy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Spanish teacher at my school was showing a YouTube video in class. School computers block YouTube so he hooked his phone up to the board so they could watch it. Suddenly he gets a text and tries to swipe up on the message to get rid of it. He accidentally clicks on it and messages comes up. The entire class sees the teachers dick pic on his messages. Not only was there that but the entire class found out he was gay because the person who he sent it to was named matt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I'm saying is that in order for that ability to be useful you need to use manipulation so that you can either control the tendrils or set pre-existing commands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Manipulation is the only category togashi hasn't been inventive with hatsu wise even though it has nice possibilities. They don't have to manipulate people, it could also be objects (gido) but what I want to see is them manipulating elements of nature. Not create things like transmutation but manipulate what's around them. I have an OC which can manipulate the polarity of objects and can cause things to attract of repulse each other which would be a very interesting nen ability. I think abilities like this are possible but haven't been explored in the manga enough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not so sure about that. Some things will always be looked at negatively no matter how excited you are about it. I'm a muscular, mediumly attractive guy who secretly is super into animation, and because America doesn't make enough adult animation in consequently into anime. Every girl I've had a romantic relationship hates if I talk about anime. I don't watch hentai or any of the big boob shit. I just love animation but the second anime leaves my mouth they don't ever want me talking about it. The stigma against it has always beat out my enjoyment of quality shows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What abilities or powers from other anime and manga would work well and be balanced in the BNHA universe? I'd think the sound ninja who fought in the chunin exams who had holes in his hand and could suck/blow air to attack someone.


By the way I want specific abilities from a show. Don't just say nen from hxh say the character specific ability which would work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely love this ability but on thing I'd say is that ability 4 needs manipulation and transmutation is so far away from it. It would have to be an extremely experienced nen user for this to work at all and would probably be one of the hardest abilities for the user to perform. I don't think it's needed either. All the other abilities are great and work cohesively  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's crazy that everyone keeps saying this because for me it was the opposite. I used to come home every day and watch TV until I fell asleep. I never went outside. I have almost fond memories of staring at nothing in my desk just imagining shit but was too introverted to go out and hang with people. My grades we're also shit. I started smoking and I was less stressed. It even affected me after it wore off. Like all the tension in my head was gone. I started hanging out with people just to hangout or smoke. I used to be a straight C student but my senior year when I started smoking my lowest grade was an 87, a B. It's helped a lot with the stress I felt and I was able to do stuff instead of being terrified of how to do it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gon before he trained with kite. I believe leorio could defeat gon. Warp punch seems incredibly versatile and it's implied by ging that warp punch can warp inside the body to destroy tumors which is an instant win if he can get an opportunity to use that and hits someone's vitals. Although it's all speculation  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This wasn't in my adult life but I was far too old to shit myself. I was about 14 on a school bus going to the beach. It was headed to a retreat hosted by my schools FCA, Fellowship of Christian Athletes. So we just got back on the bus from a Mcdonalds break. Everyone's laughing and having a good time. We're a mile or two down the highway when I hear a growl in the pit of my stomach. As someone with irritable bowel syndrome I know this sound well. I have to poop. I raise my hand and the teacher, who hated me because I once ate 14 donuts and threw up right beside her, walks down the aisle to sit beside me. I whisper "I have to use the restroom very badly. Can we stop". We're about an hour away from our destination at this point. She instantly tells me I have to hold it and that it was my fault for not going at Mcdonalds. She leaves and I'm stuck. Luckily no one was sitting beside me. I hold it for as long as possible until we hit a pot hole. The force propels me up and I unknowingly unclench my asshole. I shit extensively in that second and land on it. At 14 you would never let another teenager know you shit yourself. It's social suicide. So I sit there. As the smell fills the vehicle you can hear people screaming of an awful smell. Attempting to be coy I say we may have run over a skunk or broken sewage pipe. This seems to work as no one suspects poop to be the cause.  For the next 45 minutes I sit there in my feces. Every bump and turn only pushes a different body part into it. As time goes on the poop slowly makes it way down my jean leg. Luckily we reach the camp before I leave a calling card on the ground. I instantly go the that teacher and explain what happened. She rushes me to the bathroom and I change. It took ages and I missed an entire day of camp activity because of washing clothes and showering. Only a handful of people know this story because I told them later in highschool.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted someone similar to that but I had it be manipulator. You could manipulate the polarity of someone or something. With this you could make yourself have a positive charge and an enemy also have a positive charge forever keeping them away from you. It can also be used similar to bungee gum except no actual nen is attached. Give a multiples rocks positive charges and the enemy negative. When the enemy gets near all the rocks magnetically fly towards them. Very good for traps </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Transmute the nen around your hands to be a muscle relaxing agent. So if you were to touch an organism whichever muscle you touch would go limp and be unable to move until it wears off. Perfect for a bounty hunter who doesn't wanna kill.  One way that would be a restriction is that the agent works on you as well so if you gathered it around your hand you wouldn't be able to grab and do things with that hand. Maybe throw a little emission in there if you wanna use it on someone and not yourself  </TEXT>
