The Kurds are the ones there that want to fight and secure their own futures and they hold some of the same interests as the US does. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hillary couldn't even win a primary without it being rigged by the DNC for her and even then Bernie still got 43% of the vote against her. Despite being unknown to most of America a few months before.



Then she lost it all to Trump of all people. 


Now she's trying to start a counter "resistance" group as well. I'd rather still back Bernie than the idiot who put Trump in the White House and the GOP the House and Senate. </TEXT>

Someone is preaching and converting people.


Nobody said they were automatically a terrorist but when you follow an ideology that was created in a time of great struggle and conflict, and 1,400 years later followers are still killing people for it, it doesn't look good for said ideology. </TEXT>

Well I'm an atheist, so it doesn't matter to me what Christians do either, I'm against their ridiculous reasons for hate and oppression as well.


As for the EDL, from what I know of them they're Christians who don't want to see Islam become a part of their society. Muslims march and protest all the time in the UK and you don't mention any of them. But at least both sides normally stick to protesting and not violence, and a lot of yelling.  </TEXT>

Of course it is. But the motivations of terrorist attacks and hatred cannot be ignored because they fuel the flames.


Islam openly preaches hate and oppression towards others through the Quran and Hadiths. We must challenge the followers of such ideologies on a daily basis to change the hearts and minds of individuals.


Far better to argue openly than strapping a bomb to your body and murdering innocents.

	<TEXT> That was an edited video cutting out her parts of egging him on and arguing to while she was filming him to gather up more blackmail "evidence" on top of her other false accusations.

Amber waited till Depp's mother died to make sure he was emotionally comprised to file for divorce just 3 days after to try and score a payday.

Instead she failed as her claims fell through and went to save her career by "donating" her settlement for good PR.

	<TEXT>  Hiring vets is a bad thing?

"There's a reason you separate military and the police. One fights the enemies of the state, the other serves and protects the people. When the military becomes both, then the enemies of the state tend to become the people." -Adama


The training is much different and considering the actions in Iraq and Afghanistan towards civilians, it's a valid concern I think.

	<TEXT> The Punisher version of "#BlueLivesMatter" with this makes it trashy.


Mainly because thanks to cameras everywhere in this day and age, we get to see police shootings and beatings on citizens on a daily basis. Punisher extorts, tortures and kills criminals who deserve it in his eyes as a vigilante, something the police aren't.


The militarization of our police forces with surplus military equipment and vehicles plus the increases in hiring of veterans is pretty worrying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She wanted more but after her blackmail attempts with false abuse charges, that they police didn't even see evidence for at the time or after, didn't work; the edited video of Depp yelling drunk came out but it was said in the whole version she was egging him on and was recording it so that bombed as well.


This is all after she waited till Depp's mother, who he was really close to, died and she filed for divorce 3 days after to make sure he was fully emotionally comprised.


In the end her payday scheme didn't work so she went to save her career by "donating" the money for good PR after months of shit slinging but California tax laws says she will get a $3.5 million write off for a $7m donation. Something she fought for in court because Depp was going to just donate the money for her and her lawyer's argued that if Depp were to do that he had to donate $14m to still pay at least $7m in her eyes. Just weird.


Hopefully Elon Musk wears a condom and gets a prenup before he does anything stupid.

	<TEXT> Both sides were using the internet to push propaganda and set up their own "troll factories" to push their narrative. 


I think anybody who has survived the last year and a half on Reddit and other social media knows this pretty well. 


The Dems are just outraged that Hillary gave Trump the White House and the GOP the House and Senate in her spectacular cascade of failures.


Hillary couldn't even fairly beat a no name candidate who still got 43% of the vote in the primaries without having the DNC rig it, so how did they expect her to win the general?


You know who wasn't under FBI investigation or had 30+ years of scandals attached to them? Bernie.


I'm a Wisconsinite and Hillary didn't even bother to visit our state after the primary, despite the fact Bernie won our state. Wisconsin turned into a swing state and was a big reason why Trump won.  </TEXT>

Kind of like their stunt during the crossover episodes earlier this year where they brought back Laurel and it backfired. Just rubbing salt in old wounds by reminding people how badly the writers messed up.


Crossover episode for Arrow was the only time in all of Season 5 that they had their old viewer base back and they blew it. </TEXT>

Also Hillary Clinton said she wanted to drone Assange and also aided in the torture and imprisonment of Chelsea Manning (a Wikileaks source) so it is understandable why he would be anti-Hillary.

	<TEXT>  The opposite applies to us atheists as well. It's better to be a Catholic than a hypocritical atheist that points out the evils of religion while being a total asshole.


Morality is subjective and atheism is a person by person case basis.


Just because you don't believe in fairy tales, doesn't automatically make you a good person or gives you any obligations to be one. </TEXT>
