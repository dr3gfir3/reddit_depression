	<TITLE> The FCC claims it was hit with a DDoS attack at the exact same time as John Oliver's viral segment on net neutrality </TITLE>

	<TEXT> UPDATE: The FCC is [now claiming](http://www.politico.com/story/2017/05/08/john-oliver-net-neutrality-238132) that it was also hit by a DDoS attack back in 2014, the last time John Oliver did a segment about net neutrality. This makes me even more skeptical. These are serious claims -- they need to show us the proof. The only way we'll know what really happened is if the FCC released their logs to an independent party who can verify their claims.

UPDATE 2: Now we are pretty sure the FCC is lying. Our software dev has confirmed that the FCC's site [went down again](http://imgur.com/a/cALQp) last night around 8:30pm EST, shortly after the John Oliver segment would have aired again on HBO. He also confirmed that their servers repeatedly fell down under net neutrality comments coming through [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com) over the last two weeks. It seems extremely likely the FCC is attempting to cover up the fact that their comment system simply cannot handle large amounts of feedback from the public. 

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  just issued a [press release](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-344764A1.pdf) claiming, Beginning on Sunday night at midnight, our analysis reveals that the FCC was subject to multiple distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS). 

The FCC is saying that the site hosting their comment system was attacked *at the exact same time* comments would have started flooding in from John Olivers viral Last Week Tonight [segment about net neutrality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92vuuZt7wak). The media [widely reported](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/05/john-oliver-tackles-net-neutrality-again-crashes-fcc-comments-site-again/) that the surge in comments crashed the FCCs site. 

Disclosure: I am a a net neutrality activist and I work for [Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) one of the groups behind [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com). I have been paying close attention to the issue since 2014, and have been part of efforts that [overwhelmed](http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-fcc-website-net-neutrality-20140715-story.html) the FCCs comment site in the past. 

The FCCs statement today raises two concerns for me. It strikes me that either:

1. The FCC is being intentionally misleading, and trying to claim that the surge in traffic from large numbers of people attempting to access their site through John Olivers GoFCCYourself.com redirect amounts to a DDoS attack, to let themselves off the hook for essentially silencing large numbers of people by not having a properly functioning site to receive comments from the public about an important issue, orworst caseis preparing a bogus legal argument that somehow John Olivers show *itself* was the DDoS attack.

2. Someone actually did DDoS the FCCs site at the exact same time as John Olivers segment, in order to actively prevent people from being able to comment in support of keeping the Title II net neutrality rules  many of us fought for in 2015.

Given the current FCC chairman Ajit Pais [open hostility](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/apr/26/trump-overturn-net-neutrality-rules-resistance) toward net neutrality, and the telecom industrys [long history](https://news.vice.com/article/cable-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of astroturfing and paying [shady organizations](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/shady-conservative-group-is-flooding-the-fcc-with-anti-net-neutrality-comments) to influence the FCC, either of these scenarios should be concerning for anyone who cares about government transparency, free speech, and the future of the Internet. 

One thing that we can do right now is call for the FCC to release its logs to independent security analysts so that we know what actually happened. The public has a right to know. You can email the FCCs Chief Information Officer asking for them to do this at David.Bray@fcc.gov or call 202-418-2020

	<TEXT> Hey everyone! Evan here from Fight for the Future, the group who put up these billboards (with your help!) Just wanted to let folks know that given the huge response, and some new donations that came in, we're already planning to put up two more billboards targeting Rep Darell Issa (who likes to pretend he's a pro-internet guy) and Rep Leonard Lance. If you want more boards, we can make it happen! The crowdfunding page [is here.](https://donate.fightforthefuture.org/campaigns/you-betrayed-us-billboards/#page-1) If one of your representatives voted for SJ Res 34 and you want to see a billboard targeting them, we could possibly help you with the logistics of it, so get in touch :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That seems a little dismissive of people who live in rural / conservative areas. Polling shows that voters from across the political spectrum overwhelmingly opposed this move. Hopefully these billboards will help expose these lawmakers' corruption to their constituents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. So the money we're talking about here comes in as campaign contributions. Companies are able to give large donations to members of Congress to support their campaigning efforts. THEORETICALLY that is not supposed to influence how lawmakers vote, and they are not supposed to do "tit for tat" stuff ie "you support my campaign, I'll vote on the thing you want," but of course that's how it ends up going down. https://www.opensecrets.org/ is a great resource for checking which companies / industries members of congress are taking large donations from, and how much those industries are spending on lobbying.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Spotted driving around the FCC this morning </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-21 02:55:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This morning, this mobile billboard [was spotted](https://twitter.com/fightfortheftr/status/855144442898132992) driving around the Federal Communication Commission (FCC)s headquarters in Washington, DC, while the agency held its monthly open meeting.

The billboard was paid for by American Commitment, the shadowy anti-net-neutrality astroturf group with [ties](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/net-neutrality-is-marxist-according-to-this-koch-backed-astroturf-group) to the Koch Brothers that was [caught](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/03/net-neutrality-email-american-commitment-116553) red handed in 2016 flooding the FCC with fake comments against net neutrality, and comments essentially [purchased](https://www.techdirt.com/blog/netneutrality/articles/20150401/07000630513/massive-anti-net-neutrality-e-mail-campaign-shows-signs-identity-fraud.shtml) through a network of misleading petitions and ad buys. 

The message on the billboard is pure falsehood. [Millions of people](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/16/6257887/fcc-net-neutrality-3-7-million-comments-made) from across the political spectrum spoke out in support of net neutrality, not just tech socialists (whatever that means.) In fact, thousands of startups, entrepreneurs, and most prominent venture capitalists [supported](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/tech-investors-venture-capitalist-fcc-net-neutrality/) Title II based net neutrality rules. 

This is just the latest episode in a [long history](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/cables-companies-are-astroturfing-fake-consumer-support-to-end-net-neutrality) of the telecom industry using astroturf lobbying groups to create the appearance of grassroots opposition to basic open Internet protections like net neutrality, which prevents ISPs like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T from discriminating between different websites, throttling, or censoring online content.

If you want to make sure that decision-makers hear from real people about why the free and open Internet matters to them, you can find a Congressional town hall near you using [BattleForTheNet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com), or use [this site](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dont-mess-up-the-net-with-partisan-politics) to contact your lawmakers and the FCC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think either is fine -- it's best to memorize what you are going to say but it's fine to have paper to refer to. The most important thing is to know your facts and have a question prepared that doesn't give the member of Congress any wiggle room. For example, instead of saying "Do you support net neutrality" (which lets them say "Well yes but not this current form" you can say "Last year, millions of people spoke out and the FCC enacted some of the strongest net neutrality protections in the world, using Title II authority to prevent companies like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T from throttling, blocking, or otherwise censoring the websites we visit. The new chairman of the FCC has said he plans to repeal these rules that the public overwhelmingly support. What do you plan to do as our representative to stop him?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! And yes, this is absolutely right on. The fundamental problem here is that Team Cable, the big ISPs including AT T, Verizon, Comcast, etc. have chosen to leverage their political and lobbying power to push toward near-monopoly status, rather than innovating or providing better services to consumers. That means that many people living in the US have basically no choice between providers for high speed Internet. That lack of competition allows these companies to abuse their role as gatekeepers, squeeze customers for more money, throttle our connections with arbitrary data caps, etc. The first thing we need to do is organize to stop them from dismantling the strong net neutrality protections that are preventing them from doing even more "Cable company fuckery" (as John Oliver put it.) But in the long run we also need to push to remove legal barriers to municipal broadband and and make it easier for people to start small, local ISPs. It's notable that a bunch of small ISPs spoke out last month when the big ones lobbied to strike down the FCC's Internet privacy rules. We need more of that!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It won't be easy if we have anything to do with it! But the net neutrality protections that we won are at the FCC, which is an independent agency, so the new administration does have a fair amount of power to change the rules or refuse to enforce them. That's why it's super critical that we generate a massive public response right now -- so the new FCC, and Congress, know that they can't come and try to take away these rules without a huge fight. </TEXT>

Without net neutrality protections there is nothing to stop a company like Comcast (who owns MSNBC) from slowing down websites like Breitbart or Newsmax while speeding up the New York Times and Huffington Post. This of course cuts the other way as well. The bottom line is that the companies that connect us to the Internet should get to control what we can see and do once we get there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey reddit,

The FCC just held a closed door meeting with lobbyists from the Cable industry, and now the Wall Street Journal and others [are reporting](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/u-fcc-chairman-plans-fast-024351516.html) that the new chairman is moving fast to dismantle  the Open Internet order / net neutrality protections that we won last year. If this happens, it would open the flood gates for a tiered internet with fast lanes and slow lanes, throttling, and censorship. 

This news does not come as a surprise, but its coming faster than we thought. So now is the time to mobilize. Members of Congress are in their home districts this week and next, which makes this a particularly critical moment for us to make our voices heard. 

**Heres what you can do:**

**1. [Find a Congressional Town Hall Meeting near you](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/urgent-theyre-coming-for-net-neutrality-sooner-than-we-thought)** and show up to ask a question or hold a sign in support of net neutrality.

**2. [Request a meeting with your member of Congress](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/request-a-meeting-with-your-lawmakers-to-defend-net-neutrality)** while they are in district over the next two weeks.

**3. [Sign this petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/dont-mess-up-the-net-with-partisan-politics)** telling Congress that net neutrality is not a partisan issue.

We need to make sure that there is someone asking a question about net neutrality at every single Congressional town hall meeting taking place over the next two weeks. This is a task that redditors are perhaps uniquely positioned to accomplish. In addition to asking questions, we encourage redditors to use the comments section or create threads to organize meet-ups or support each other in attending events and speaking to members of Congress about why net neutrality is important to them. Search for town hall meetings near you [here.](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/urgent-theyre-coming-for-net-neutrality-sooner-than-we-thought)

We represent just a handful of the massive coalition of organizations, startups, tech experts, and individuals that banded together to fight for the net neutrality protections that we have in place now. Some of us helped launch the Battle for the Net campaign, which was part of the effort that helped drive nearly 4 million comments to the FCC. Ask us anything!!!

	<TEXT> The FCC [just held](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-internet-idUSKBN1790AP) a closed door meeting with lobbyists from the telecom Industry, and now theyre [moving fast](http://mashable.com/2017/04/07/internet-ready-for-a-fight-over-net-neutrality/) to undermine the Open Internet order / net neutrality protections that we won last year and open the flood gates for fast lanes and slow lanes, throttling, and censorship.

Members of Congress are in their home districts this week, and many are hosting town hall meetings where constituents can ask questions and speak directly to their Senators and Representatives. 

Speaking up for net neutrality at one of these events is perhaps the single most effective thing you can do right now to fight back against Comcast, Verizon, and AT Ts attack on the basic net neutrality protections that keep the Internet awesome.

You can find a crowdsourced list of Congressional town hall meetings happening this week and see if there is one near you [here.](http://www.townhallproject.com)

If you cant attend one of these events, you can use [this Fight for the Future page](https://actionnetwork.org/forms/request-a-meeting-with-your-lawmakers-to-defend-net-neutrality) to request a meeting with your lawmaker.

If youre able to attend one of these town hall meetings, here are some tips:

1. Do a little research. Each meeting is different, so click the link for more info to find out what time to arrive, and whether you need to register ahead of time in order to ask a question.

2. Dress nice and be polite. Lots of us are angry right now, but we need to convince these representatives that their constituents really care about this issue. Make your point firmly, and with conviction, but carry yourself with respect.

3. Bring a friend. Bring a friend or two, or more, who can show their support by applauding after you ask your question, or holding signs outside. Have one of them take a video of your question and the representatives response, and post it or send it to us.

4. Be prepared. Prepare a short question thats backed up by facts, and identify yourself as a constituent. Heres an example:

*Hi, Im [NAME]. Im a constituent and I work as a teacher here in [CITY]. The Federal Communications Commission has been meeting behind closed doors with lobbyists from big cable companies, and say that they are planning to repeal net neutrality protections that prevent companies like Comcast and Verizon from scamming consumers, and blocking, throttling, or otherwise censoring the websites we visit. Net neutrality is an essential protection for freedom of speech. Id like to know what [LAWMAKER NAME] plans to do to defend Title II net neutrality, which protects our right to a free and open Internet.*

Talk to any Congressional staffer and they will tell you how big of an impact it has when people actually show up at these town hall meetings and speak directly to their representatives. We need to make sure there is someone asking a question about net neutrality at every town hall meeting that happens over the next two weeks. </TEXT>

It would be awesome if redditors started using this thread to organize meet-ups at these town hall events or drop-ins to their lawmakers' offices. Even if you can't get on the schedule, you can still stand outside with signs, talk to the media, deliver letters to your lawmakers' office, and get all your friends to call them. The bottom line is we need every member of Congress to feel like they are constantly hearing about net neutrality from real constituents. That's how we beat the lobbying power of Comcast, Verizon, AT T et al. Let's do it! </TEXT>

I would remind him that more than 4 million Americans from across the political spectrum spoke up to support the current FCC rules that we have in place -- which prevent Cable companies from censoring websites and creating fast lanes and slow lanes on the Internet. Since he's a Republican, he may be swayed by some of the conservative arguments linked below. Good luck!

	<TEXT> Hey reddit,

So as you probably already know, last week Congress [voted](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/29/technology/internet-privacy-outrage/) to gut Internet privacy rules and allow Internet Service Providers like Comcast, Verizon, and AT T to monitor, collect, and sell your online browsing habits to advertisers. Without the rules, ISPs can do all kinds of other [creepy stuff](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules) too like track your real-time location, install malware on your phone to record what youre doing in real time, and inject ads directly into your web browsing.

The Senate and House already voted for the bill, and President Trump [signed](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-internet-privacy-fcc-20170404-story.html) it last night. 

The vote generated a lot of public outcry, but one thing thats interesting about it is that people from all across the political spectrum are outraged. Progressive groups [condemned](http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/3/23/1646500/-Republican-senators-vote-to-repeal-all-of-our-broadband-privacy-rights) the move, but a ton of Trumps top supporters in r/TheDonald were [also](https://www.dailydot.com/layer8/reddit-the-donald-internet-privacy-crisis/) up in arms about this.

So, heres my idea: what if redditors from radically different ends of the political spectrum meet up and take a photo together with a sign showing that they both agree that Trump should veto SJ Res 34. Im imagining someone in a #MAGA hat and someone in a Bernie t-shirt standing together holding a sign that says We both agree: ISPs shouldnt be able to sell our online habits without our permission. No more attacks on our Internet freedom.

Even just one photo like this would be great, but if a bunch of us started posting them I bet we could make a big news story out of it.

If you remember SOPA, that was a bill that EVERYONE expected would pass too. Its too late to stop this legislation now, but if we can cause a huge stir over this, it will make a big difference with the fights for our Internet freedom and privacy ahead.

If you email me your photo: evangreer@gmail.com, the nonprofit I work for, Fight for the Future, will help make sure it gets spread around. Thanks reddit! Lets do this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The House of Representatives will [vote today](https://www.savebroadbandprivacy.org) on a Congressional Review Act (CRA) resolution to gut the FCCs broadband privacy rules that prevent Internet Service Providers like Comcast, AT T, and Verizon from selling your personal information  -- like browsing history and real-time location -- to advertisers without your consent.

The rules that could be repealed also [prevent](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-ways-cybersecurity-will-suffer-if-congress-repeals-fcc-privacy-rules) ISPs from injecting ads into your web browsing, installing undetectable software on your devices to track your activity, and deploying systems to undermine encryption. When ISPs collect and store this information, they will also be making it available to the Federal government and law enforcement through bulk surveillance programs. 

The measure passed the Senate last week, and it was a strict party line vote with 50 members of the GOP voting to gut the rules. Given that many members of the House Freedom Caucus have taken strong previous stands for Americans right to privacy, its very important that we make sure they know that voters from across the spectrum want them to oppose this attack on our basic rights. Below are the names, phone numbers, and twitter handles. Please contact them now. The vote could come within hours.

Heres a sample script of what you can say if you call:

	<TEXT> On Thursday, March 23rd, Congress [will vote](https://consumerist.com/2017/03/08/senators-officially-introduce-resolution-to-reverse-isp-privacy-rule/) on whether to use a special legislative mechanism called the Congressional Review Act (CRA)  to roll back the FCCs landmark broadband privacy rules for Internet Service Providers (like AT T, Comcast, and Verizon) that many of us fought hard for last year.. The 22 senators behind this controversial resolution have [received](http://www.vocativ.com/411479/senators-online-privacy-money/) more than $1.6 million from the very same companies that would profit from this. 

If these privacy protections are removed, ISPs will be able to [do the following](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections): 

* Monitor and sell all your location data, search history, app usage, and browsing habits to advertisers without your permission
* Hijack your search results, redirecting your traffic to paying third parties
* Insert ads into web pages that would otherwise not have them

Read the full text of the resolution [here](https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/03072017-flake-cra.pdf).

This is going to be a close vote. Below are the names, numbers, and twitter handles of  key members of Congress who could vote to uphold current broadband privacy rules. 

If you want to call them now to ask them to protect our privacy, heres a sample script you could use: 

Hi, my name is ____ , Im calling to ask Senator ____ to vote against the CRA proposal to roll back the FCCs broadband privacy rules. Please dont let Internet Service Providers sell my personal information without my permission.

You can also tweet at your representatives, something like:

Dear @RepTwitterHandle please protect #BroadbandPrivacy. Dont let ISPs sell my personal information.

	<TEXT> The site actually strongly encourages you to NOT memorize a ton of passwords, and instead to use one really strong password for your phone, one really strong password for your computer, and then a password manager for all the rest. Locking yourself out of your phone is annoying, but if you're backing it up regularly it's not a catastrophe. Getting your phone hacked and your photos leaked or credit card info stolen is a much bigger headache. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wrote this, and figured i'd pull out the section I think is maybe the most important:

But the groundwork for this cruelty was laid long before Trump was even a candidate. As a young queer person, it often seemed like the organizations that were supposed to advocate for me were primarily interested in getting me married and into the military as quickly as possible. Mainstream gay and lesbian rights organizations, though they were slowly adding a B, T, and Q to their mission statements, spent millions of dollars lobbying for marriage equality and repealing Dont Ask Dont Tell, while largely ignoring the struggles of anyone who was not the white, gay, cisgender men that made up their donor base.

With assimilation, rather than liberation, as their driving principle, these organizations systematically excluded the voices of transgender youth, people of color, working class gays, queers in prison, and sex workers, while advancing an agenda that did little to confront the extreme forms of discrimination and violence that the most oppressed members of our community continue to face today. </TEXT>
