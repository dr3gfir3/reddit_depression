Regardless of how the GT2 shakes out, the one bit of good news is that Preuninger was adamant that manual transmission options on GT cars are here to stay. 


What was the short hand saying?  GT3 is 99% track focused, the GT2 is a turbo'd version of the GT3 that is given an allowance for driving on the road?

That's what I assumed would be the case going forward.   </TEXT>

1 Racist South.  The Magnum was seen as "a black person's car" (whatever the hell that meant/however the hell people came to that conclusion) so all the racist shit heads would turn their nose up at it.  Playing blues shows in redneck bars.  They can listen to black music but I can't drive "a black car"?  Get the fuck out of my face.

2 FCA product, so my decent people in my social circles who were car folk bummed on it for being FCA.

3 The rest of the people just thought it was ugly.  And honestly, it kinda was.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is TxTag running a racket? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-06 02:16:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seems every few months I get a notice in the mail about unpaid toll and toll violations, violation fees, etc.  

Today I received a letter in the mail from a collections agency over unpaid tolls from September of last year.

The problem is is that I have an online account and an associated bank account that auto drafts for my fees and even drafts an additional $40 buffer amount.  I have transponders on both cars, I pulled my TxTag statements from the time frame last year and the month afterwards both showing I have 0 late payments, fees, or violations.  I've eMailed the collection agency those two statements as well as my most recent statement showing 0 violations and that my account is in good standing.  It also shows both of my vehicles passing tolls and being charged without a problem.

This happens every few months and every time in the past it's been a "Oh it must have been a glitch in the system we'll just square up the tolls and delete the violation fees".

I'm gonna call TxTag Monday, see if they have a record of the last time I called in, ask them why they didn't advise me of violation fees then, etc.

Any other advice would be appreciated.  .



edit

The collections agency is closed on the weekend but someone got back to me via eMail.  Basically said they're 100% hands off, just take the info that TxTag sends them.  They told me I can call TxTag and if it gets sorted out on their end then they're automatically updated on theirs.  We'll see what happens Monday.



edit

Yup.  "Sorry, system error.  We'll take the fee off and you'll only have to pay the actual toll." 

Same song and dance.  I got a confirmation number this time though.

	<TEXT>  What is Alfa waiting for?

For the QV and Stelvio to release properly, them to sell out or sell all of the first run/reserved.  

There's a bunch of demand for these.  Alfa San Antonio had a QV on display only.  I stopped by to check it out and there were at least another 12 there.  I was told that reservations were lacking.

They called me the other day to let me know they'd have a Stelvio in for inspection as well, not even the Quadrifoglio.  I'm not gonna show up for that but it's in demand as well.

No point in running a special on a vehicle they can't provide just yet.   </TEXT>

They were.  Someone was braking super hard in front of him and going under the speed limit.  He has visibility and the ability to get around quickly.  Top comment is just being an angry pedant.   </TEXT>

How serendipitous.  Just yesterday I was asking about the 1M and even talked to /u/TheSmokingTire about it very briefly [after finding their great video on it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSDYvUkclFM)

Any idea why it's the 1M instead of the M1?  Didn't want to tarnish the name?   </TEXT>
