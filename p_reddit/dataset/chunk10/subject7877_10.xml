	<TEXT> Hello,
I'm a freelance column writer and screenwriter. I just got a break with a production company. They're asking me for a feature length script. Since most of my screenwriting experience has been with comedy shorts, and commercials. I don't really know what to ask for in terms of pay. This is my first feature length (with someone's story and guidelines), I don't want to high-ball them but I also don't want to be taken advantage of. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I graduated a year ago with a degree in film production, since graduation I worked at a small production company in south Florida. I just quit to pursue screenwriting full time. I want to eventually move to LA. How hard is it to get a writer assistant job? How hard it it to become a script doctor? In the stage i'm in right now, Do I have to move to LA first or can I do the same amount remotely? Thank you for taking the time! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working a production job right now and I hate it. I actually just gave them a months notice. I started this job with the intention of getting experience before I move to LA. I got the experience I want/need and now I plan my next step. I would like to focus on my writing for a good 6 months and treat that as my full time job. I get it, it's a weird feeling, quitting a job that pays and so forth. As long as you do what's best for you and stay focused on your goals.  </TEXT>
