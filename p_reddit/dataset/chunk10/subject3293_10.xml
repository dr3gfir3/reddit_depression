	<TEXT> Seconding the idea of finding a student doula. My husband and I ended up with two doulas this way. Even though we were both on the fence about having a doula, now that we have ours I wouldn't change a thing! I am SO thankful for my doulas and I haven't even given birth yet. They are seriously amazing! This is your birth, follow your instincts and find a doula! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I have it too! It's a frustrating symptom to have as it makes it difficult to write or do anything with fine motor skills required. I am using voice to text on my phone right now because even texting is difficult. :( I got some braces at Walgreens to wear at night and that seems to help along with staying hydrated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dietician I've been seeing about my GD recommended a high-protein snacks such as cheese or almonds without any carbs, sugar and/or fruit at night time. The toast is probably too high in carbs for a nighttime snack. My fasting numbers were also too high until I started limiting myself to only cheese, nuts, or olives at nighttime.  </TEXT>
