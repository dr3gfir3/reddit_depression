	<TEXT> It was a regular evening in a swedish summer and the clock started to tick towards 5, so my friends and I decided to go by the local supermarket and buy some grill compartments, things like sausages and buns with ketchup etc and some soda. We were really prepared for this evening just like every other in summer break.

We were heading for the pier to set up a fireplace and make some delicious sausages and maybe take a few jumps from the tree that is hanging over the still water reflecting the sunset.

After eating our sausages and taken a swim in the lukewarm water we sat there around the fire with swim clothes on and wrapped in towels, it started to be dark and we discussed whether we would all go home to respective houses or if we would change our clothes, dry up and do something teenagery.

The result ended up being that most of the party left because they were cold and tired.
In the aftermath there was only me and my closest 2 friends, Dan and Carlson.
We had come to a conclusion that we would do something, but exactly what, we had no clue on what to do.
Standing clueless for a couple of minutes Dan comes up to the idea of that we could take our skateboards over to Aspudden (another area close to Mlarhjden), and this place is quite known for being a slum area and the sun had just set so that didnt really make the safety improve.

For being as stupid as we were, we decided why not bring some spray cans and practice our graffiti skills while we were on the go.

All of us splitted up to our homes to get our skateboards and get changed to a bit darker clothes so that it would be harder to bust if someone caught us spraying graffiti over walls. We decided to meet in 10 minutes again at the local supermarket.

When getting there 2 minutes late I see that only carlson is standing there with his skateboard and backpack, arriving close to him I ask where Dan is and he says he got a call from him and Dan said that his mom needed help with some things and that he couldnt join us.
Being bad friends or caring friends we thought it was maybe for the best, Dan isnt exactly the fastest of them all when it comes to running away from people.

We dropped our boards on the ground and kicked it towards Aspudden.

After rolling in a slight downhill for like 15 minutes we finally see the familiar buildings of a hairdressers salon, tobacco business and a chinese restaurant. There was not many people on the street at this time, which was good regarding our practicing.

We went to an alley that is created from an empty space between a store and an apartment.
It was famous for the walls were completely covered in spray paint from top to bottom in all the colors that you could think of. The ground is wet from beer remains and other scents that I cant identify. You could really feel the weird atmosphere sleeping in that alley.

We pulled out some white and black and started to do some basic tags, representing that we were here and warming up our wrists while waking up our artistic senses as Carlson said.

In the end of the alley there is a staircase deep in close to a wall which goes as a spiral up until you reach the roof, up there, there is not as much graffiti because of the huge metal cage that surrounds the bottom of the stairs, only way to access this staircase is to try to climb this huge cage or trying to get the steel door open.

We didnt want to waste time on a single lock that would probably never open if we used force with only our bare hands, so we decided to try and climb the cage.
Me being most fit in this story, I am going to try to get over this fence first. Carlson sits down on his knees and ready to boost me up next to the metal. I run towards the cage and manages to grapple the cages edge and is now hanging, I find Carlsons hand and I place my foot on it so he pushes me up. When I get up, carlson throws up his backpack, I catch it and I drag him up to me on the cage.

From the top of the cage there is a thin opening where you can squeeze through and get to the stairs. We get through and start to walk up the spiral stairs and finally reaches the rooftop.

Its beautiful, seeing the street lights and empty roads from this height. It gives a feeling like you could overcome all the problems that youd ever face.
On the roof, people have managed to drag up old couches, tables and there is a fireplace on the top that seems has to been recently put out. We dont think much about it and starts to unpack our spray cans and getting ready to make art.

Midway through our work, I hear a small thud sound. I look over to Carlson to see if he noticed it too, and  yes, there he is standing like frozen, listening for more incoming sounds. No more sounds are coming, so we tip-toe over to the edge to look down to the staircase to see if someone was coming. But the staircase is empty, not a soul is moving in the alley.

We figure it mightve come from one of the rooms in the apartment that we actually are standing right above so continue with our work. After 5 about 5 minutes we hear a chatter that we really notice is extremely close to us, we walk over to the staircase but see nothing, still the chatter continues. Were confused of that we hear the chatter but still cant identify where it is coming from. We search the whole roof and checks over the other edge of the building down to the road and there we see it.

There is an old man across the street, standing on his balcony, looking at us with a phone in the hand. We freak out and swiftly gather all our cans and throws them down in the backpack and rushes towards the staircase. We hurry down the stairs feeling like every step is an eternity. We start to hear sirens - the man on the balcony mustve called the police. This sets our adrenaline to an even intense state, frustratingly taking step after step downwards. Thats when Carlsson loses it of stress. He tells me that it takes too slow and he skips over the fence and jumps down to the ground from at least 3 meters down. On impact he gives a painful sound before disappearing into the woods defining Aspudden from the forest.

When I finally get down I hear the sirens are extremely close so I start taking pace into the forest.
Running through feeling like an eternity but then finally seeing the square of Mlarhjden, takes up my phone and sends Carlsson a message, lol. </TEXT>
