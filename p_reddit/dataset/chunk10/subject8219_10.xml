	<TEXT> I started smoking weed, then became obsessed with acid, then alcohol, then the crystal....then strangely ecstasy started me turning away from meth. Then  brief spell of cocaine abuse. Then back to alcohol and anti depressants. Then mushrooms.

Now I dont do anything except smoke cigarettes and have a big drink a few times a year  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still believe in jehovah. As a loving god. But reject that religion. They cause followers to live in perpetual terror of the end times. Seriously it messes with your mind as a child.

	<TEXT> Ex drug user....

I suffer from insomnia really badly. And sometimes when you are really lacking sleep you experience some pretty altered states...

So looking back to the times I would go out on a Friday night and come home on a Sunday night without sleeping in all that time, taking lots of ecstasy acid and coke....i wonder how much of the high experience was just lack of sleep vs being off my tits  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mephedrone aka bubble aka miaow miaow aka mkat. 

I had had a break from drugs for a long time (5 years) and went on a mad night with a very crazy guy. I had some coke and just did that as anyone does...meh it was ok but its boring really...

Anyway ended up at this party. This was when legal highs were legal in the UK.  And this guy had like an ounce of Mephedrone. I bought a few grams and proceeded to snort and share, the promise it was like E but lasted half an hour was bullshit. I found it to be nothing like E. It was literally the most chemical high i had ever felt. After a few hours I felt so strung out...but not like off E. Just wired like my brain was frazzled. Jaw clenched and eyes rolling. 

It was not anything id do again. I was experienced with all drugs pretty much but hadn't had anything like that. A week later a guy died in that house, he thought he was snorting Mephedrone buy it turned out to be bzp. So God knows if it was even Mephedrone i did.

	<TEXT> I drink maybe twice a year now. I have been an alcoholic and addicted to most drugs. So my opinion does come from my own experiences..

Alcohol is a drug for the masses. It is overrated shit.

All you are doing by getting drunk is making sure you feel rough as fuck the day after. Its bad for your body and mind. And makes you fat. I lost 4 stones when I gave up drinking! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a nervous reaction to things that makes me laugh innapropriately i cant control it.  This is a list of times I laughed. And no its not funny:


Every time at the dentist. Just as he is about to start drilling. 

When we found our friend had committed suicide.

When I heard someone I know had a stroke.

I cant help it. It's not good. Often if i hear something bad I will take myself off out the room so I don't laugh in front of other people cos they think im a sick bastard.
