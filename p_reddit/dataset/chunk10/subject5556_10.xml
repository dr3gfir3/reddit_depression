	<TEXT> They are hoping to create the perception of widespread anger and unrest, which then makes a lot of on-lookers and media viewers and readers think, "There's a lot of problems in our society, we need change!" And that instability is a valuable initial step to bringing in some sort of change against whatever is around now. But the question is, how exactly did this new protest get organized around the world and agree on their messaging, slogans, methods, and tactics so quickly? Is it being funding and directing by others behind the scenes, or is it really mostly spontaneous?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely! Imagine uncovering a 36-year-old safe, and breaking it open only to find nothing more than a few hundred dollars in *cash?* Some might wonder: Who the hell would only say a few hundred dollars in a safe? 

Well, $500 in January 1981 = $1,401 in March 2017.

And $500 in March 2017 = $178 in January 1981. 

(180% down in value one way, 64% up the other way)

(Yes, the official inflation calculator now includes months!)

Thus, the ratio is nearly 25 times higher today than it was in 1981. (Note: the article mistakenly says "46 years ago," not 36.) </TITLE>

	<TEXT>  ***Lysistrata*** is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BCE, it is a comic account of a woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early expos of sexual relations in a male-dominated society.

	<TEXT> I saw an interview from '79 or '80, I think it was with Dick Cavett, where they were talking about the fact that he was known for just walking around the city all throughout the '70s, just as you see in that footage. I myself live right near Central Park and have seen several famous people jogging or walking with a friend or two, and it's true that NYC is generally okay for famous people to be out and about, unlike LA, where there are swarms of paparazzi everywhere, whether or foot or in cars, but still it's pretty crazy, yeah. One of the sour moments I saw the TV actor Hank Azaria running, and he was drenched in sweat and started walking to catch his breath, and some big fat dude came up next to him with a little notepad and a pen and was begging for an autograph, and Hank Azaria waved him off, and the guy was like "You're a real jerk!" Ridiculous.

	<TEXT> I think it's simply just a matter of more people--and specifically more young males between the ages of 13 and 25--saying more online, and then talking the way they actually do among their siblings, friends, and peers, including peers they don't like or even hate. Do teenage guys curse at each other when they are joking around, or when are playing a video game in the same room, or even playing a game of table tennis or basketball? Do they not regularly get annoyed and pissed off and insult each other, threaten and mock each other, and try to embarrass each other in front of someone else? At frat party or in a car or in a text conversation, do young guys not talk in a way that would appall and offend most females and adults and senior citizens? Did young guys never say things like "You're a fucking idiot, fuck off, your mother's a whore, you're a fag, eat shit and die, go suck a dick" before the first time that Internet forum users began popularly saying "OP is a fag"? And were they not already talking and acting that way in real life, face to face, in the early '90s, and the '80s, and the '70s? 

The difference online is that guys are expressing that familiarity and "comfort" level with total strangers--and the phenomenon has a name: the online disinhibition effect, as explained in the article below--but I really see it as just ongoing bullshit-talking from guys who talk shit; it's not some degradation of human nature at this point in the history of human evolution or society. One factor is that now, nerds are able to talk shit, because everyone is equalized by the fact that all they have is the same means of representing themselves, namely, words on a screen. Wherever there are more guys trying to looks smart, cool, or tough, like on Gaming forums, or on the Bodybuilding.com forum ("Misc.," which now calls itself "legendary" in its tagline), or in U.S. political arguments (where the definition of what it means to be an American man is the underlying matter being debate), the shit-talking frequency and intensity, as are that of the vulgarity, insults, and threats. Verbal abuse typed between people on the screen of their computer or smartphone is a new phenomenon, yes, but verbal abuse and the common activity of guys ragging and ripping on each other--whether they are jokingly making fun or maliciously bullying--was not somehow invented by Something Awful.

	<TEXT> I didn't even know it existed until i googled "book shelf porn" and got /r/BookcasePorn and then the much more active /r/BookPorn! Here are other "sfw porn" subreddits, though I think the use of the word "porn" is stupid, as there are many people who'll skip them because of the name alone -

https://www.reddit.com/r/sfwpornnetwork/wiki/network

There are awesome subreddits about so many things; Reddit could do a lot more to promote them, for instance, by featuring like a few every week among the usual default subreddits, but I think the reason they don't is that there are too many big-paying brands and organizations paying to place advertising in the form of images and written propaganda, in the most active subreddits. Hence, /r/HailCorporate! Go through the links in the right margin and see what it's all about here:

	<TEXT> I spent hours putting this together and hopefully you like some of these! This is the Archive page for each, so, to prevent your browser from getting stuck after scrolling too far, just load several months, and then click the next month from the menu at the top so you can continue. Typically, Tumblr blogs have more images in the earlier months, but most of these are still posting a lot. And if you wanna know the source of any image, try searching it with Google Images.

	<TEXT>  Are people really counterfeiting 1 pound coins?

Sure, there's a demand. Just imagine being very poor, or even lower-middle class. They aren't throwing pennies away. I mean, what is the highest amount of money you would not bother picking up if you dropped it on the sidewalk while walking alone? Would you bother picking up a penny? What about a dime? A quarter? I live in NYC and an old woman asked me for "two pennies" just last night, April 2, 2017.  </TEXT>
