	<TEXT> High school art teacher said we had a $20 art fee. I asked my mom for the money, she gave it to me in cash, and I gave it to the teacher. A week later she asked me for the same fee. I told her I gave her the money and she said "oh don't you try that on me!" So I went to my mom and asked for $20 again. My mom gave me another $20, I gave it to the teacher, and a few days later she posted our grades on the wall. I had an A on every project, but for my overall grade she knocked me down to a B. I asked why, and she said "you know what you did." I was a junior in high school at the time so this was when my gpa really mattered, I was so angry but I didn't know any better so I didn't do anything about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I felt really shitty in high school because I didn't get top grades like most of my classmates (I went to those super academic intensive high schools where half the population was Asian) and one day our teacher told us our assignment was to write the first chapter of a novel. I got overly excited and wrote 15 pages when the requirement was 10, whereas my classmates who were going to MIT and Yale all choked and didn't have a creative bone in their bodies. It made me realize I was at least good at SOMETHiNG.

So far I have only published a novella with small press (have nonfiction writing too but that doesn't count) and am trying to get something bigger out. By day I work as a data admin. </TEXT>

Turns out he was a rags-to-riches story about an uneducated guy teaching himself mathematics until he became a professor, which was printed out in communist propaganda back during the Cultural Revolution. So he was temporarily famous, like Balloon Boy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I don't know whether you are a tenor or baritone, but what I do know is that it's easier for everyone to sing low than high when they first start out. I was convinced I was a very low alto myself because my lowest note was (and still is) a very loud E3. I was confused when voice teachers and choir directors kept saying I was a soprano, I started tensing up badly whenever I was expected to go into the 5th octave instead of opening up, hence painful squeaking.

Since it sounds like you don't take voice lessons it is highly possible your technique is all wrong. You can't expect a shower singer to nail Pavarotti's high notes, natural tenor or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read it and saw the movie. I enjoyed the book a lot, one of the biggest changes is that Cosette is a much bigger character in the book. In fact I'd say she is the next biggest character after Jean Valjean. Victor Hugo can't write decent young female characters so she is pretty much brain-dead and idolized, but she is so crucial to the story. They fleshed out the relationship between Marius and Cosette as well, in the book they dated for a year before the battle. 

But yeah Victor Hugo wrote Les Mis and The Hunchback of Notre Dame and he definitely has some parallels between the two. If you turn out liking Les Mis I would recommend Hunchback next, it is VERY different from the movie (torture, creepy old man tries to rape a high school aged Esmeralda, public floggings, etc.) </TEXT>

I like looking at videos of people dying, you can find that on certain parts of the internet. I will watch a video of an Isis beheading and stuff, or a mob violence in another country where they all attack a thief and torture them. Some people can't stomach that whereas I find it interesting. People wouldn't expect that from me, I am constantly described as innocent even, because I also sing in a choir and dress like a girly-girl.

I also go on walks on my own late at night, I will sing songs from musicals and pretend I am acting in front of a group of people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in this situation, eventually it got so bad and I got so miserable that I just had to move out for the sake of my own sanity. Then when I finally moved out I was annoyed with myself for holding out so long. That would be my general advice - to move out before it weighs down on you any further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Young - because young people are more likely to be poor, and liberals are more likely to be poor

Women - because liberals tend to be pro-choice and support programs for single mothers, women feel liberal ideology looks out in their favor

Starbucks - I don't think there is really a correlation

White - I don't think this is true, so many SJWs bash white people and say white privilege this and white privilege that. SJWs come in all colors. </TEXT>

I work a simple job as a database admin rookie, pays 60k a year which is livable but not great in Southern California. I am an only child and the friends I do have are scattered all over the world. I joined some social groups, one for writing and one for choir, and but don't have close friends. </TEXT>

I moved out very fast. As in, my mom was screaming at me and I was crying and just grabbed my purse, climbed in my car, and drove out with nothing else. I spent the next day buying a pair of jeans and cheap shirts that I could rotate through, along with toothbrushes and other things I needed.

	<TEXT> Even when I was a little kid, my mom would always point out I had single eyelids and a flat nose, and that I got that from my dad because she had a very straight nose and double eyelids. If someone complimented my appearance my mom would quickly counter it with "no she's not."

Then when I was in the second grade and had to wear glasses, my dad and mom got in a HUGE fight. My dad told my mom that he would divorce her if she made me wear glasses, and when my mom won out my dad would see me walking around with glasses on and comment that I was ugly. When I pointed out he wore glasses too, he said it was different because he was a man.

Then when I was 16-ish I was five foot 7 and 130 pounds. My mom started always yelling at me, saying I was a fat pig. When I told her to stop saying it, she would say "If I don't tell you who is going to tell you?" She only shut up years later, when her friends told her to stop. She would make a comment about how big my thigh is, or how big my butt is, when I walked by.

Once when my mom was talking about how ugly I was at a big dinner, this old lady who knew my mom ever since she was little said, "Actually, your daughter is prettier than you were when you were her age" and that shut my mom up (at least for that meal).
Then when I visited my dad in China, I had dinner with him, my aunt, and my cousin. My aunt called me pretty and my dad quickly rejected her comment, talking about everything that he felt was wrong with my appearance. My aunt was so shocked that she told my other aunt, and my other aunt said my dad isn't normal for publically criticizing his daughter's looks in front of other people.

Anyway, as an adult I looked back at old pictures of myself from when I was certain I was ugly. I was surprised to see I was actually a cute kid. I later asked my mom why she constantly insulted my looks when I was a kid, and she said it was because she didn't want me to have a big head. Fuck that bitch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Roald Dahl's books when I was little, but when I went back and re-read it as an adult I did see some serious flaws with the prose. It made me realize just how much the books were dependent on having a picture every few pages so you follow the story better.

On the other hand, Judy Blume and Louis Sachar's prose remained on point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And she is every bit as good as the other soloists, maybe even better. When she sang Dulcissima, the whole room went silent because she was AMAZING!!! I am fangirling over her right now even though I am normally such a critic. Her voice was crystal clear and resonating beautifully throughout the whole thing. The choir director was all smiles and gave her a hug afterwards, apparently he originally planned to hire a professional soloist but someone had recommended her, so he auditioned her privately first and then realized she really could do it. She was prodigy level good. I really wanted to post a recording here but it's against the rules.

Anyway, I have a few questions about that. Usually people here would say that your voice is all over the place at that age or that music like that is way too challenging for someone so young, yet clearly this girl was an exception.

Someone that young can't possibly have had many years of vocal training, can they? I have heard lots of voice teachers won't even work with someone under the age of 16. If that girl is 16/17 she must have gotten crazy good in a short amount of time. I feel bad by comparison, having taken lessons for 4 months and done choirs for 3 years, but nowhere near that good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually I find the plots of classics to actually be slower and milder than contemporary fiction, (exceptions of course with stuff like Alice in Wonderland, although it doesn't have any literary merit). But they are definitely coming-of-age, which may be why they are relateable for little girls looking for role models. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading Anne of Green Gables for the first time this week and couldn't believe it was middle grade fiction. It could easily pass as adult fiction, especially in the later books when Anne is an adult dealing with adult problems, and the books have adult prose and are of an adult length. I found it interesting it is middle grade.

It got me thinking, Little Women is also young adult. What are some other kid and teen books with literary merit? I am especially interested in modern ones.

Edit: I meant to say "WHAT are some children's and teen books," not why, oops!" </TEXT>
