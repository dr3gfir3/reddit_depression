	<TEXT> Ever since autofill was implemented the rule has been if you queue up for ranked you better be prepared to either a) play every role, even if you're not good at it b) dodge if for whatever reason you don't want to play the role you're assigned. Can't do that? Don't queue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So now that 2016 is drawing to a close I wanted to make a tribute to the scene's storyline over the year (and those preceding it!). I was really really amazed when [Monte came out with his parody lyrics](http://ggcmontecristo.tumblr.com/post/151829351167/i-asked-a-long-time-na-fan-about-league-of#notes) to "Miss American Pie", "NA's Apple Pie" and equally so when TBSkyen posted his [sung rendition of it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc8sztpxO34), so I decided to make a music video/montage of sorts set to the song! 

Took about three days to put together, clips mostly taken from reddit, twitter various Riot vods, TSM and C9's Legends/Genesis shows, and a few other vids here and there. Some parts didn't come out as well as I'd like but to do the song justice, but I hope y'all enjoy this little thing. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Zed "rework" helped him achieve his in-lore goal! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was reading through some of the lores today with the universe update and was reminded of the fact that Zed has lets just say a bit of a *vendetta* against Jhin.

From [Jhin's lore](http://leagueoflegends.wikia.com/wiki/Jhin/Background):
 When they caught Jhin, young Zed marched forward to kill the cowering man, but Kusho held him back.


  Zed, disturbed and haunted by the murder scenes he had witnessed, was unable to understand or accept this mercy, and it is said a resentment began to bloom in his heart.


 "You know what that... thing is capable of." Then Zed leaned over the table, well within Shen's range - his neck intentionally exposed. "And you know that we are the only two people who can get close enough to stop him."


 Shen remembered the first time he'd seen the body of someone killed by the infamous Khada Jhin. His skin prickled from the memory; his teeth clenched. Only his father had been strong enough to still believe a merciful justice could be served. Something in Shen had changed that day. Something in Zed had broken.


 There was still no sign of Zed. It was disappointing. Very disappointing. He certainly must have sought out his former friend. It was likely Zed was hiding, watching. Jhin needed to be careful.

Basically Zed was traumatised by Jhin's actions, swore to kill the guy and is in fact actively hunting him. 

Now, the recent "rework" gave Zed incentive to kill targets with high AD. Due to his passive, Jhin is capable of hitting the highest AD in the game. Indeed, I'm pretty sure the "new Zed" was advertised as being a Jhin counter. I see what you did there Riot. </TEXT>
