	<TEXT> Good question! When I [did this last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/), nobody knew ahead of time because it was a spur-of-the-moment decision when I realized my first three picks all had J-names. 

This year, the league commissioner did email me ahead of time to ask if I was doing a gimmick again, for his own curiosity and so he could "get out of my way" and avoid M-names if he was torn between two players. I don't know if the rest of the league remembers me from last year, but prior to the draft I changed my team name to something innocent like, "David's Great Team" to hopefully throw them off the scent.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It varies depending on the state. But it's pretty normal for the primaries. 

For the general election, you're absolutely right that anyone even asking which party you plan to vote for is a big no-no. But for the primaries it's whatever. 

**EDIT**: the thing about Virginia is that you don't register for a party. You get to choose which primary you vote in on primary day (but not both!). So even if I'm a Democrat, I could choose to use my vote in the GOP primary to vote against someone if I wanted. Hence them needed to ask which Primary you want a ballot for. 

It's actually pretty nice since it gives the voter *more* options rather than fewer.  </TEXT>
