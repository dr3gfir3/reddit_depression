	<TEXT> Recently, I purchased a laptop for pretty cheap from craigslist. The seller seemed really, really normal in retrospect, almost painfully average to be completely honest. Im not here to talk about him though. The laptop booted up fine and had microsoft office and chrome pre-installed. I ran a few system checks and downloaded my anti virus software and started making some new folders for work. While I was working I noticed that the recycling bin wasnt empty. When I looked in the bin I found a folder titled masks. Curious I opened the folder to find several video diaries and pictures. 

Ill compile the contents of the folder into a video soon, but for now I will transcribe the videos into text for safe keeping (and mostly because I suck at editing).

Video Diary One:

The video begins with a young man with relatively long hair and a scraggly beard talking about his day. Behind him are what seem to be a hanging potted plant and an electric fan. He recounts his encounter with a man at the bus stop.

So, I almost missed my bus this morning because of some tweaker he pauses for dramatic effect Crazy right? This guy didnt look well at all. He kept looking around as if the cops had just busted him and he was on the run. He wouldn't stop coughing and scratching himself, probably withdrawal now that I think bout it. The dude actually grabbed me at one point and started shaking me with this wild look on his face. He kept flipping through this black notebook and muttering to himself. At one point he shoved the damn book in my face he holds up a black notebook, I grabbed the dumb thing and had to push him in order to make my bus in time. he sets the book down and looks at it, pausing to think for a moment. Guess it must have been important ill flip through it later. Yknow there's one more thing now that i think about it, as the bus was leaving i looked back at him his greasy dark hair fell over his face in a weird way, kinda like a hairy mask y'know, but what really freaked me out was that he  grinning ear to ear. Anyway, Second period was a total pain in the a- The video cuts there.

As of right now Im pretty exhausted Ive viewed around 4 diary logs so far and to be quite honest i'm a little worried about the previous owner of the laptop. Now that I think about it the guy who sold me the laptop looks nothing like the guy in the diaries, if the events in the diaries escalate any further Ill try to contact him again. Anyway, Im almost positive I transcribed the first video exactly as it appeared on screen, but Im kinda tired so I might has messed up his wording a little. Ill try to update these text transcriptions as I edit the videos together. Stick around for more. Im open to suggestions on how i should update these text posts and videos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> im not actually sure she loved almost all of them. I wish I had been closer to her to know for sure.

She was pretty fun to play video games with. She kicked my ass in dragonball z and mortal kombat. </TEXT>
