	<TEXT> Doesn't it take 2 weeks to disable the bank pin? Shouldn't nothing have been taken out of the account if he was legitly hacked and had all the security he said he has. Personally I think something fishy is going on here but it still sucks if he lost his stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have never liked recovery questions because they are usually questions people can figure out just through Facebook like pet names and mother's maiden name. I think email recovery is the best personally as I have different passwords for each and I trust gmail's security more. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The origin of the Piata </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-01 19:44:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It started as just Getaway and I. We started together in a lonely chat of two people. We didn't understand what was going on but I got a vision. A vision of a revolution. I did not know the true meaning of the revolution so I just screamed "Viva la revolution". 
In that moment Getaway got a true crystal clear vision. He spoke to me "I do not know that language but I love Viva Pinata" . 

That is how our lord and savior Piata was born. Let us soon find the origin of ranch311.
