	<TEXT> Hello everyone!

So I just finished Monsters of Men, the third and final book in the Chaos Walking trilogy and I really enjoyed it. One thing I was curious about is how you all felt about the third book. I flew through the first two books in about a week and then the last book took me over 2 months to finish. I'm not entirely sure what it was about it but I kept putting it down. It just wasn't keeping me on the edge of my seat. Then, yesterday, I read the last two hundred pages in one sitting and did enjoy how everything was wrapped up. Overall I think I'd give the series about an 8/10. I'm curious to know your thoughts!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couldn't agree more. I think this was the only game I've ever played that made me tear up. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your reply and for clearing that up. You're definitely right about me generalizing it as a cuff tear. That was just my initial guess and an opinion of another person I play with who's a physical therapist. He guessed the same but recommended I get it checked out. Also, I appreciate the links to the articles. I'll be sure to post an update after Friday morning's MRI!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was very helpful. I'm going to record my swings on Friday, since it could possibly be my last game for a while, to see if this is what I'm doing wrong. But that would make sense as to why I hurt the shoulder. Thanks for the tip and link!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot! I've been dealing with it for a few months. A lot of the time it's manageable but usually that first hard swing at the beginning of the night is pretty much agonizing. It kinda feels like it tears right then and there but then I'm able to swing no problem after that. I'm sure this is certainly not recommended but just commenting on what it feels like when I start to play. I'll be so bummed if I can't play for a few months even though I know it's a necessary surgery :/ </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Getting an MRI on my hitting shoulder on Friday. Almost positive I tore my rotator cuff. Looking for a little feedback from people who've gone through a similar injury. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone!

I've played volleyball competitively for about 12 years or so and I am an outside hitter. First time posting in here and like the title says, I'm going in to get an MRI on my hitting shoulder this Friday and have a couple questions for people who have had a similar injury. I know each person is different but I'm curious as to the average healing time for a torn rotator cuff (I know it depends on how bad the tear is) if surgery is required. If the tear doesn't require surgery, has anyone had experience with going through physical therapy for this injury? If so how was the physical therapy process and about how long did it take you to get back to playing? 

Lastly, I'm wondering if this injury is typically due to something I'm doing wrong in regards to my swing or if it's a typical injury that occurs due to constant swinging (I play about 3 times a week for hours at a time depending on the night). I plan on posting a video in here this weekend to see if anyone can critique my form for my swing as well. Because if it's something I'm doing wrong I'd like to improve that after all this is done. 

Really just looking for general insight here as I'm nervous about getting the MRI done and possibly having to get surgery to fix the issue. Any advice you all have would be greatly appreciated!  </TEXT>
