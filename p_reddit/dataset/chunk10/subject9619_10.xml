	<TEXT>  she went from someone who didn't follow politics

That seemed to be my experience with people on r/politics. Especially after the election and with the formation of the new administration. They literally had/have no idea how the US government works. "A coup from the top" was my favorite article post.  
  
to someone that seems legitimately racist against white people.  
  
But with how scary all the media, not just news, makes Trump sound of course it brings out the crazy with people. Look at the ridiculous protests and reasoning you see, yet no one is willing to run for office, put money into candidates they agree with, or actually switch parties.  
  
Granted I've said this several times, but even my coworkers that complain are the same way, they get angry, post on some social media outlet and complain, zero participation in politics at any level. </TEXT>

One officer explained that 10 years ago if a suspect was stopped in a high-risk neighborhood, that person either ran or complied. Now, suspects are refusing to comply with lawful orders believing that law enforcement can't or won't do anything about it.  
  
http://media.washtimes.com.s3.amazonaws.com/media/misc/2017/05/04/study.pdf  
  
I think most of those *lawful orders* were actually unlawful and thanks to the internet and videos that teach about cop interactions we've learned the BS cops act like is legal and now we know we can tell them to "fuck off." </TEXT>

Manufacturer Liability: Gun manufacturers should not be held liable for the misuse of their products, just as any other industry isnt held accountable for how end-consumers use their products.

	<TEXT> No. You don't understand what he's saying with the suing thing. Under the law you can't even sue them for negligence. He's also said you should be able to sue anyone, but not for just manufacturing them.  
  
He's never made any moves against assualt weapon as he called them. He's also pointed out city and rural differences. I could only find one source on the blaze confirming any thing about him banning assualt weapons, never semi auto. And in politics we know those are different.  
  
No backpedaling. You just seem to put your own ideas of what he's said or what happens and act like it's truth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If ISPs were allowed to go wherever they wanted this wouldn't be as much of a problem. Comcast used government regulation and anti-government owned/operated company regulation to stop the competition. The problem with only doing some things regarding a product in a libertarian way but not all or most aspects of it is you end up with lopsided outcomes.  But as a country we dabled with zero regulations and lots of people died and everything got polluted. A counter argument though is that people didn't care as much about that kind of stuff then. So it's hard to determine exactly what would happen since we now have much more readily accessible information about corporations and their practices. Yet people still buy Nestl.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most gun regulation is BS. Suppressors shouldn't cost $200 in a tax stamp and $800 to buy one. The price is artificially inflated and I think most people would prefer to hunt and shoot with suppressors if they were like $50-100 which is very likely if they're made unregulated.  
  
A fully automatic weapon is not going to cause mass deaths like the media acts. It just doesn't work that way when shooting them. Personally I'd love to have a 3 round burst capable gun that didn't cost $30,000. That's the thing, there are people that pay the giant fees and buy tanks and buy or make rounds. They have full auto 50 Cals on old jeeps they've bought. But the right to bear arms shouldn't be predicated by my paycheck being in the 2% territory.  </TEXT>

Yup, I know.  
  
On July 27, 29, and 30, 1974, the Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, for obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress.  
  
Since he resigned before the process was completed, Trial and Vote, he was not "impeached" like you are trying to say. But for normal purposes, he was, he just resigned nulling the impeachment process.

	<TEXT> There's quite a few sayings that do that in English. Some we've changed the meaning of. Some we haven't.  
  
I think the biggest difference is now everyone has access to dictionaries and ethnologies so the excuses for people misunderstanding words or phrases should be less. And why people think the rules are more firm than linguists like them to be.  
  
Spelling of words was arbitrary until we got our first dictionaries. Then suddenly we had rules based on what one man thought the spelling should be.

	<TEXT> Most the reason for marriage my grandma points out, it's outdated. There are lots of common law marriage laws around. People saw their parents or friends parents get divorced. They go to college so they're already postponing marriage knowing that.  So automatically they're having kids and getting married later than the HS leads to a career generations. Then millennials realize they change. And they want to fuck other people. Even people that are older than me are getting married later and keep separate financial accounts. Always ready for divorce.  </TEXT>
