	<TEXT> "People come to Cauteville all the time. And there they stay. They don't leave Cauteville. No one ever leaves Cauteville." - Fr.Deacon.

Mr.Black and Mr.Grey drove along the country road for hours. The endless landscape of nothing but fields and grassy plains as far as the eye could see was almost hypnotising. It had put Mr.Black and Mr.Grey in a sort of trance. It seemed as though they were driving past the same fields and hills for hours over and over. They hadn't met another car in hours. They would've thought that they'd made a wrong turn but there was no other way to go other than that straight, endless road.

Mr.Black loaded six bullets into his revolver as Mr.Grey drove. They'd been partners for nearly eight years but hadn't learned each other's real names. Something like that could be dangerous if either of them were caught. One usually doesn't make an abundance of "work friends", being a contract killer, but they'd decided to become partners as they worked so well together on their first job. So Mr.Black chose his alias from his ethnicity and Mr.Grey chose his based on his grey hair and personality.

They generally didn't travel too out of their way for work but they would have been stupid to turn down such an easy job for such a handsome fee. Mr.Black slid his gun back into the inner pocket of his suit.

Eventually, a sign came into view. "Cauteville", it said. Mr.Black found it strange that it didn't say "welcome." Most towns he'd been to's signs said "welcome."

They drove past a homeless man happily slurping soup out of a rather over-sized looking pot on the side of the street. Mr.Grey pulled over and parked on the curb. He got out and walked into a shop. Mr.Black didn't argue. Mr.Grey rarely spoke, and when he did, it was usually to tell other people to cease speaking. Mr.Black had learned not to question him.

As he sat there, Mr.Black noticed a rather confused looking old priest coming over to the car. Mr.Black opened his window. The old priest leaned in suddenly and panicked. 

"Murder isn't the worst sin a man can commit !", yelled the priest into the car.

Mr.Black was taken aback as the priest sauntered away. He turned on the car radio and tuned into the local station. The news came on.

"Good afternoon people of Cauteville. This is your newsanchor, Newscaster Carol bringing you the local news that you've probably already heard through the proverbial grapevine. Mayor Caplan has publicly assured the civilians of Cauteville that the velociraptor that has been causing carnage throughout town since Sunday has been successfully captured and put down by the hard working scientists in the Cauteville Scientific Research Facility and that the memorial for the victims will be held in the courtyard of his mansion on Justice Hill. Isn't he just fantastic, ladies and gentlemen ?

In other news, the case of the unidentified serial killer that has claimed the lives of over a dozen Cauteville citizens has been solved. Sheriff Woody Crouk has made a public statement saying that the "serial killer" wasn't a serial killer after all. After some tests done by Doctor Doalot, it turns out that it was just a very lethal and very contagious form of eczema and that there is definitely no need to panic.

And now some advertisements :

 'Let's be honest, a lot of weird shit happens in Cauteville. The chances are, you probably need therapy. So call me, Cauteville's resident psychoanalyst, Wanda "Understanding Lee" Lee.'

'Spouse cheating on you ? Think your kid is doing drugs ? Suspect your parent are actually ghosts ? Then call me. Cauteville's leading and only private investigator, Samantha Psykes.'

'Want to know your future ? When you're going to die ? Because we can do that. No, really. We actually can. Don't believe us ? Then we call your bluff and offer you one free session. Madame Voyante's. We are real, motherfuckers.'

Mr.Black quickly flicked off the radio, wide eyed. He looked out the window at the seemingly idealic town. Mr.Grey climbed back into the car, holding a box. Mr.Back jumped when he saw that the box contained a tarantula.

"What the fuck ?", shouted Mr.Black.

"What ? It was half price."

"If they had a chainsaw for half price would buy that ?"

"Maybe."

"I don't like this place you know, man. I've got a bad feeling about it. Like something real bad's gonna happen."

"You and your feelings."

"Me, my feelings and the fucked up news report I just heard. Some lady from the local station was talking about dinosaurs and killer egzema going around the town."

"Perhaps she was crazy."

"When's the last time you heard of a town that lets an insane person read the goddamn news, Grey ?"

"Listen, that isn't our problem. Our problem is getting this job done asap and getting paid after. Then we don't have to worry about this town for the rest of our rich lives."

"Fine. Where are we meeting our contact. ?"

"Some bar around here somewhere. Shouldn't be hard to find."

Several minutes later, the two men pulled into the parking lot of Cauteville's most popular bar, The Butcher Wife. They both walked into the bar, polar opposites. They wore the same, black and white suit, but Mr.Black's was loosened and worn, whereas Mr.Grey's was pristine, creased at the knees and perfectly tailored. Mr.Grey had meticulously trimmed white facial hair and slicked back grey hair. Mr.Black had frizzy black hair and erratic facial hair.

Mr.Grey took a seat at the booth in the back corner as Mr.Black ordered the drinks. He couldn't see a bartender but saw the open door into the back. 

"Two whiskies", he called into the doorway. He turned around and looked around the bar. There were several people scattered about the room, sipping drinks and making light conversation. He couldn't help but shake the feeling of unease about the place even though, aesthetically, everything was fine. 

He turned around and there were two neat whiskies sitting on the countertop, directly behind him. They had ice and tissues and were definitely fresh. There was no sign of a bartender, however. Mr.Black was sure no one had made two whole drinks behind him without noticing. He shook his head and carried the two drinks over to the table, where their contact was already seated in front of Mr.Grey.

She was a smoking a cigarette and was taking her sunglasses off, despite it being nearly ten at night. She had icy blue eyes and jet black hair down to her neck, framing her face.


"Your friend isn't much of a talker is he ?", she asked.

"No, not all", replied Mr.Black, sitting down. "Hey, how come the barkeep managed to serve me two drinks without me seeing ?"

"Oh, Frank ? He's a ghost."

"Wai- hold up-"

"Was I mislead when I was informed you two were professionals ?"

"No bu-"

"Well then let's get on. I'm Sam Psykes, the P.I from around here. Okay, so you two will be posing as new scientists who'll be trained in at the C.R.S.F. Here are your badges."

"Wait, wait. Hold on, how do we know we can trust you ?"

"Carlos Cortez gave you my info didn't he ?"

"Well, yes....bu-"

"And he hired you two to kill Mayor Caplan, right ?"

"Correct...."

"Well then you two are going to be scientists who are gonna be inducted into a highly secure facility that no one has access to except the scientists and Mayor Caplan. What you do from there is your business."

"How do we know this isn't a trap. Isn't he your mayor ?"

"Mayor Caplan is about as good for this town as Carlos Cortez is for society. Listen, I know Carlos. If anyone crosses him, they die. Mayor Caplan obviously did and now he's going to pay for it. I don't personally like doing favours for Cortez but if it means Caplan is gone, I'm all for it. You have a meeting with Caplan tomorrow. Good luck."

With that, she left the bar, leaving a trail of both smoke and mystery as she disappeared into the night. 

The two men left the bar with their badges. The walked down the street towards the car, before encountering a rather important looking man leaning against a cop car. 

"Hey !", shouted the man at them. Mr.Black went to reach for his gun. "You two are the new scientists, right ?"

Mr.Black relaxed.

"I'm Sheriff Crouk", he stuck out his hand. Mr.Black looked at his badge. It had the name Phillip Craig written on it.

"Phil Craig", said Mr.Black shaking his hand.

"What about you ?", asked Sheriff Crouk, looking at Mr.Grey.

Mr.Grey looked at Mr.Black, unamused and unwilling. 

"Ah, he doesn't talk much", stated Mr.Black.

"Alright. Well Mayor Caplan wants to see you two in his house, now, before you have an official meeting tomorrow."

"Right now ?"

"You betcha. Hop in."

They arrived at the mayor's mansion in no time and the pair stepped out of the cop car and entered the house.

They walked into his expansive office and saw him drinking vodka from a ludicrously expensive looking glass. He turned around and revealed himself. He was a large, vaguely Italian looking man with a silk suit and a gold chain around his neck. He opened his arms wide and smiled warmly at them.

"Welcome", he said in deep, husky voice. "You can close the door behind you, Sheriff."

"Hello", was all Mr.Black could think to say.

"I trust you have aquainted yourselves with some of our towns wonderful facilities ?"

"Ah yes, I suppose you could say that. I, uh.....was just curious about some, well, not quite off colour behaviour necessarily, but just a series of odd.....occurences."

"Well this is a unique town, there is no doubt at all about that, but I'm afraid Cauteville does not apologise for it's perculiarities."

"O-okay", said Mr.Black, unsure.

"Now", began Mayor Caplan. "Have a seat."

As they sat down opposite him, the mayor slid two identical forms in front of them. 

"If you sign these", said the mayor, darkness growing quickly into his eyes. "You give your consent to everything that being a member of the staff at the facility entails."

"And what might that be ?", asked Mr.Black, swallowing thickly.

"You will live in the facility. You won't ever leave there the same way no citizens will ever enter there. You will be provided with suitable living quarters. Also signing this contract states that you won't ever reveal any of the things you see or do in there. A word of caution. There are experiments and procedures that will harrow you and probably haunt you for the rest of your life. There will be things that you can't unsee and things that you won't believe, 
even if you do see it."

"I'm quite sure I've seen it all", chuckled Mr.Black, attempting to break the tension.

"I know you haven't seen these things", said the mayor, his whole expression turning dark. "If you sign this, you agree to everything. If not, you can walk away right now."


Mr.Black and Mr.Grey looked at each other and signed their false names.

"Wonderful", exclaimed the mayor, that warm smile returning as easily as it went.

The pair of hired guns made their way back outside and Mr.Black stopped.

"Did you hear that ? There must be all kinds of weird shit going on in there. I don't know if this is such a good idea."

"Do you have any idea how much we're getting paid for this ? A lot. A whole lot. We come in tomorrow and bust a few caps in his Italian ass and then peel the fuck outta here."

"He just said we won't be able to leave. What if we never leave that place, man ?"

"He said that not knowing that a pissed off drug lord wants him dead. Once we end him we can do whatever the fuck we want. No scientist is gonna stop me from claiming this motherfucking bounty."

They both returned to Sheriff Crouk's car and were sped back to their hotel in no time.

The following morning, the two men congregated at Mr.Grey's car. Mr.Black looked around as they drove and could've sworn he saw a cow grazing atop The Butcher Wife. He shook his head and tried to ignore the flock of butterflies skydiving manically in his stomach.

Eventually they arrived at the Cauteville Scientific Research Facility. It took them several tries to get on the right track that led to it. The facility sat in a circular area that had been cleared in a massive, dense forest full of tall trees. They had to drive through a total of four gates just to gain access to the car park.

Mayor Caplan was waiting on the front step, smiling widely. He welcomed them in and had them change into biohazard suits. Luckily they hadn't searched them when they'd come in as Mr.Black had his revolver tucked neatly in his pocket. He stuffed the pistol into the small pocket the suit provided.

"Due to the decidedly small population of Cauteville, I'm afraid we could only amass a security presence of a dozen in the facility but they are well trained and, along with the various technologically advanced security systems, we have no problem with intruders", stated the mayor.

He invited the two of them into his office and sat down. They both looked around. It looked almost exactly what one would expect to see in a rich, corrupt, public figure with authority's office; wild animal's heads mounted on a wall, japanese samurai sword replicas, bookshelves full of tomes that most certainly never got read, large leather chairs and expensive bottles of scotch.

He told them to go to lab number 26 to get inducted. They obliged and left, deciding not to embark on their task while there were three security guards in the room. They headed down several, long, identical corridors.

"What do we do now ?", whispered Mr.Black.

"I guess we circle around until his security leaves."

They both wandered around the endless hallways, not once meeting a soul, before finding themselves back outside the mayor's office. They knelt down and peered into the room. The security were still there and he was on a heated looking phone call. They walked off again down the maze of similar halls, waiting to find themselves back outside his door.

After a few minutes of walking, they heard footsteps behind them. The turned and saw the mayor standing behind them with two security guards on either side of him.

"Ah there you are", said Mr.Black nervously. "We, uh. We got lost."

"Oh you got lost, did you ? Mr.Black ?"

The pair of assassin's faces went slack.

"Turns out it wasn't me who Carlos Cortez wanted dead after all, fellas", shouted the mayor. "Get them guys."

Both the security guards revealed handguns from their pockets and opened fire at the two men. They both dove down another corridor and sprinted into the first unlocked door the could find and slammed it behind them. There, they found a group of scientists crowded around a restrained dinosaur. The scientists looked panicked, dropped their tools and ran out of the room. Suddenly an alarm rang out throughout the whole facility. The velociraptor jerked quickly, tearing out of it's restrainments.

Before they could react, the reptilian monster dove at Mr.Grey, latching onto his neck, tearing a chunk out of it. Mr.Grey collapsed whilst the prehistoric beast ate his way through him. Mr.Black screamed and lunged out of the lab, closing the door behind him. Mr.Grey had died how he had lived. Silent and unwilling.

Mr.Black stumbled down another corridor, pale and frightened. The hallways were now filled with panicked scientists running amock. He saw another group of three guards coming towards him and he ducked into another room. In this room, a team of scientists were crowded around the naked corpse of a young woman. They injected a green substance into her arm and, upon seeing Mr.Black, dropped what they were doing and scuttled back out of the room also.

The dead body then leaped up, fighting against it's restraints, full of life and apparent rage. Mr.Black ran back out of this room and once again found himself outside the mayor's office. He rushed in, jelly legged and panting. He was surprised to find the mayor standing behind his desk. 

"Well hello again, Mr.Black. As you can see, once there is an intruder in the premises, we deal with them very seriously. Terrible shame, about your friend. We could never let him live, though. Not after seeing what he's seen. You should never have come here. You should never have accepted a job from that meth head in the first place. But, I suppose it's best not to dwell on the past, eh Mr.Black ?", spoke the mayor calmly.

"Oh I shouldn't of come here ? I'm the one who should be afraid ? It seems to me like I'm the only one in this room with a gun and your little experiments didn't faze me, neither. So I suggest you either give Carlos Cortez a call or bend over 'cause I am gonna pop so many caps in your ass, you're gonna be sneezing gunpowder for weeks."

"You might have eluded the laboratories and escaped my security but just because I'm the only one without a gun doesn't mean I'm the only one without a weapon. Let's see how you fare with a little friend of mine I like to call The Shape."

With that, the mayor pushed a little red button under his chair and exited his office through a small door behind his desk. The doors of a large oak wardrobe flung open behind Mr.Black. Out stepped a thing that had the approximate shape of a man but was easily twice as tall as Mr.Black and had no bodily features whatsoever. It had a cylindrical, blank head, had skin made out of some kind of black fabric material and it's limbs ended in dangerously sharp points.

The figure swiped it's razor sharp arm at Mr.Black, who easily dodged it. It came at him slowly and then suddenly thrust it's arm at Mr.Black, who had to duck to avoid it. It's arm got lodged in the wall. Mr.Black took out his revolver and shot it twice in the back. He put the gun away upon realising that The Shape simply absorbed the bullets. The Shape, now free of the wall, turned just in time to see Mr.Black plunge a scissors into it's empty face. Again, it didn't even react and the scissors just slid out of it's face and the gash sealed itself up immediately.

Mr.Black stepped back, trying to think of how to stop this thing. He sized it up and noticed it's legs, with ended in fine points. It must be unbalanced. Mr.Black looked around the room and saw one of the mayor's pretentious props on the wall. He hoped to God that it was a convincing replica of a samurai sword. He grabbed and umbrella from behind him, swiped at The Shape's legs, causing it to do the splits.

Mr.Black then lunged for the antique and pulled off the case, surprised to see a very real katana. He placed the blade between The Shape's legs and thrust upwards with all his might, tearing through it's strange skin. The Shape split in half, it's two sides collapsing onto the floor. The now severed halves of The Shape vibrated and flailed about on the floor unthreateningly.

Mr.Black vomited from fear and exhaustion. He walked out through the same door the mayor did and stumbled down a narrow hall, his vision blurring. He fought the urge to faint. He came to a door out into the car park and saw Mayor Caplan getting into a black jeep. Mr.Black shot clumsily at the car, causing a window to explode. 

The mayor ran out from behind his car and Mr.Black pointed his gun at him. The mayor froze. Mr.Black waited for his vision to focus and for his hand to steady. He pulled the trigger and shot four bullets at the mayor, each one ripping a bloody hole in his chest. The mayor collapsed, dead.

Mr.Black dropped his gun. He didn't claim his bounty that day. Instead he ran far and deep into the thick forest and was never seen nor heard from again. Yet another life lost from one of Cauteville's many atrocities. Another healthy mind warped by the sunny town of Cauteville's dark underlying mysteries. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tales From Cauteville - Story 1 : Silence of the Cows </TITLE>

	<TEXT> "People come to Cauteville all the time. And there they stay. They don't leave Cauteville. No one ever leaves Cauteville. No one." - Fr. Deacon.




Henry Robinson and Kate Ming walked hand in hand out of Cauteville High. They walked down the lane opposite their school, towards their houses. They stopped just before the housing estate, and gazed into the field adjacent to the estate.

"So these are the cows huh ?", asked Kate, looking at the herd of cattle, casually grazing in the silent field.

"What cows ?", inquired Henry.

"The 'disappearing cows'. You haven't heard that rumour ?"

"Of course I have. It's wrong, though."

"Of course it's wrong", said Kate.

"They're teleporting cows."


Kate cocked her head, not dissimilar to that of a confused hound.

"Teleporting ?"

"Yup, not disappearing."

"Why ?"

"No one knows why the cows in Cauteville teleport. They just do. That's what they like to do. So they do it."

"How do you know ?", asked Kate.

"I witnessed it."

"When ?"

"A couple months ago. I heard a sound that woke me and as I arose from the bed. There she was. A cow. In my bedroom."

"Did she smell ?"

"Like gunpowder."


Henry and Kate looked on at the cows in the field. Suddenly, the cow closest to them was gone. She didn't run or fly or drive away. She was simply gone with a loud sound similar to a gun shot. The sound echoed through the farm as Kate's eyes widened.


"Some people say that it's Old Farmer Milton keeping an eye on everyone in town. People say he was always nosy", said Henry.

"That makes sense", said Kate. "That must be why he was in my garden last night, looking at me."

"Most likely."

"Have you seen my cat by the way ?"

Henry shook his head.

The pair of teenagers sauntered up to Kate's bedroom. She switched on her tv and left the local news channel on in the backround. The two chatted about school, their personal lives and life in general.

The six o'clock news came on. Newscaster Carol, as the town knew her, came on, as irreverant and erratic as usual.

"Goooood evening ladies and gentlemen", announced Carol. "The Cauteville police have officially solved the recent case of the liquidised human remains found in a trash can just outside the community centre. It turns out they weren't human remains at all. After doing some tests, they quickly realised that it was in fact soup, that Homeless Horace had been storing for the winter. Oh, Horace, you lovable vagrant ! I guess the real mystery is why the police told us that they'd found human remains immediately, before even doing any tests.

 In other news, the mayor, whom we all know and love. Yes, we all love the mayor. Cauteville would be nothing without Mayor Caplan. Hail Mayor Caplan. Anyway, he will be hosting a charity dinner in his mansion over on Justice Hill in aid of adult illiteracy. As far as we know, there aren't any cases of adult illiteracy in Cauteville, but who are we to question Mayor Caplan's judgement ? 

And now the weather. It was raining cats and dogs yesterday in Cauteville. Literally. The mysterious string of missing pets in Cauteville of recent has come to an end, as of yesterday. Several eye-witness reports have stated that they saw 'some kind of portal type thing' open in the sky above the Yellowleaf retirement home and a group of household pets glided, unscathed back down to the streets of Cauteville. The reunited owners of the aforementioned pets have stated that they've noticed a significant increase in the intelligence of their pet. Several pet owners have said that their pet has begun to speak English since their return from the 'portal type thing'. They claim that all the stress is now worth it and whomever was on the other side of that portal should 'keep up the good work.' Thank you and good night".

Hours later, Henry and Kate found themselves on top of Kate's roof, gazing at the stars.

"What do you think it all means ?", asked Kate dreamily.

Henry suspected that Kate had engaged in the type of philosophical and ultimately fruitless conversation that the night sky seemed to elicit.

"What does what all mean ?", he asked.

"Life. What's the point ? Happiness ?"

"One would assume, yes."

"But how do we find it ? Can we ? Is there such thing as a truly content person out there ? And, if so, how do the rest of us follow in their footsteps ?"

"Being someone who has been happy for a significant chunk of my life, I can offer you some wisdom."

"You can ?"

"Indeed.  I believe that if you make human connections that you truly cherish, that's the key to happiness. Love, I believe is the correct term. Then, you treat the rest of life as one big, long and occasionally bland adventure that you embark on with your loved ones. So they can support you. Then, you embark on their adventures and support them."

"It sounds so simple to obatain. Yet, it's the single thing people can't seem to get the hang of."

"I think people are too fragile. Too sensitive to the wrong things. They get hung up about minute details. Silly things. And then life slips away. And so does love. And, in turn, happiness."

Henry and Kate awoke on the roof. It was Saturday morning. They got up and looked at the view from Kate's house. One could just about make out the abandoned mental asylum on Minor Mountain, which was really just a glorified hill on the outskirts of Cauteville that no one ventured to any longer.

Henry and Kate climbed back into Kate's bedroom and they both knew what was happening that day.

"So", began Kate. "Are we going to do this ? Finally ?"

"You mean see inside the Minor Mountain Mental Facility ?"

"Yes. The one we've been planning for weeks. I think we're ready."

"Just don't get too excited. There are rumours that some of the patients haven't left there since it was shut down in the sixties. You might not like what you find."

"Oh, come on Henry. We'll go in, take a few photos and show everyone at school that we are the first ones to go in there. Today might be our only chance. My parents get home from work at six and they'll be home during the day all of next week."

Henry looked at his enthusiastic girlfriend and relented. 'Anyway', he thought. 'Most of the dead people in Cauteville are friendly anyway.'

The couple made their way down the streets of Cauteville, towards Minor Mountain. They passed the church and spotted Father Deacon wandering outside the church. Father Deacon was Cauteville's last surviving priest. Everyone in town knew him, more for his having Parkinson's since he was in his twenties than actual religious work. Deacon's unusually long lasting disease caused a major decline in religious activity in Cauteville since he developed it in the sixties.

He was hobbling along the street outside the church, mumbling to himself.

"A man without empathy is a man without weakness", he whispered to himself. "A man without empathy is a man without weakness."

"Morning Father !", chirped Kate.

The priest turned around suddenly and looked, wide eyed and alarmed at Kate. He took a step back, looking frightened.

"See the man with the white eye and don't expect not to die", he chanted. "See the man with the white eye and fly, fly, fly. See the man with the white eye and the end is nye."

"Father ?", asked Henry. "Are you okay ?"

"Any of you kids got five dollars ?", he asked casually, relaxing.

"Five dollars ?"

"Yeah, I wanna get my coffee but the Starbucks across the street's corporate money vortex is keeping this old guy from getting his cup of joe."

"Sure", said Kate, handing him a fiver. "Have a nice day !"

"Not if Starbucks has it's way", he groaned as he crossed the street.

Eventually Kate and Henry found their way to Minor Mountain. They stepped over the poorly constructed fence, seperating the large, prison like institution from the rest of Cauteville. The pair of teenagers walked cautiously up to the excessively large front doors of the ugly building.

They walked in seeing exactly what one would expect to see in an abandoned mental asylum; randomly abandoned wheelchairs, weird greenish lighting that makes everything look terrifying, ominous scents, occasional holes and sporadical drops of blood.

It sent shivers down Henry's spine and goosebumps along Kate's skin. They traveled into what they presumed was the canteen as there was a vague smell of dried gravy, just barely noticable over the smell of a decomposing asylum. It was a long hall with half of a table overturned in the middle.

"Take a picture !", said Kate excitedly as she sat on one of the two corners left on the table.

Henry held up his phone and looked through the screen. His face turned deathly pale just as he pressed the button. Kate's face went slack when she saw his. He was standing completely still and staring over Kate's shoulder.

Kate turned around in a panic. There was nothing there. 

"Don't scare me like that", said Kate.

Henry didn't answer her, however, as he was staring at his phone. Kate walked over to him and looked at the phone. She peered at the screen and saw, quite clearly, a figure, bolting behind her, just over her left shoulder. It was tall, too tall to be a person. Kate guessed around seven or eight feet. It had clammy, grey skin and had a bald, shiny head with gills in it's neck.

Both of the teens looked at each other.

"I think we'd better get going", said Kate.

They rushed out of the room and headed back towards the entrance. They kept running and running, hall after hall. They ran for mintues, without finding the door.

"I could've sworn the door was around here somewhere", panted Henry, looking around nervously. 

They both entered another room, with an old tv set from the sixties. The screen was long gone and there was some kind of growth spurting from it. The looked around the gloomy room and screamed. They saw a body tied to a giant spinning target. The body consisted of several different parts from several different people. The skinny torso had a gaping hole and several ribs missing. Stitched to the left shoulder was a long, pale arm. Stitched to the right was a short, pudgy one with some kind of yellow liquid on it. The legs were equally disproportional and a rather large doll's head was stuffed into the top of the torso. There were a few knives protruding from it's forehead with frightening accuracy.


"I really think we should leave", stated Kate.

"Okay, let me try and find a window. There's got to be some around here."

Just then, the green gloomy light that seemed to surround everything died down and the whole room turned pitch black. 

"Henry ?", called Kate. "Where are you ?"

"I'm here. I think I found a window. I'll be back in a sec."

"No. Don't leave me here !"

"I'll be right back."

"Don't say that. That never works in movies."

"Just sit tight."

After a couple of minutes waiting in the dark, Kate felt around the room until she felt a doorknob. She pushed open the door and was relieved to see that this room had some source of light. As her eyes adjusted, she saw Henry tied by chicken wire to a rusty metal chair. Looming over him was the creature they saw earlier. 

The creature was easily several feet taller than Kate. The green light created a eerie gleam over it's grey skin. It's gills were fluctuating and it had fingers three times longer than a normal person. The nail attached to each finger was the size of a regular finger. It had a wide, thin lipped mouth that didn't seem to close and had a cave of stalactite-like teeth grinning at her. And it had one eye. One huge, white, unblinking eye. 

It gently wrapped it's bony fingers around Henry's head, easily encircling it twice. The creature yanked calmly upward, seperating Henry's head from his shoulders with unsettling ease. Kate spat out a mouthful of vomit. She stumbled back, watching as whatever chance she had at having any kind of happiness or contentment at all drifted away just as quickly and easily as the tall being ripped Henry's head off of his shoulders.

Kate jogged down a corridor, her head bobbing around, despite her vision deteriorating as she went. Just as she was about to collapse, she spotted a window, just in arms reach, above her. She heard a blood curdling screech and turned around to see another one of those creatures bouncing towards her. It waggled it's long fingers at her playfully as it neared her.

Suddenly, she heard a loud sound, like a gunshot and smelled gunpowder. She nearly fainted as she saw a bull charging down the corridor. She stepped aside as the bull leaped, thrusting it's horns into the creature's neck. The bull stepped back, two streams of black blood jetting from the two holes in the creature's neck. The bull looked at Kate with kindness in it's brown eyes.

Kate thanked the barnyard animal before sprinting at the window. She had gotten half way out when she felt an over sized hand grip tightly on her ankle. Another of the creatures tugged at Kate, pulling her back down. Just as she was about to subside, she heard the sweet sound of hooves. The bull charged into the thing, catching it in the belly, pinning it against the wall. 

Kate escaped into the cool night air and ran. She ran and ran and ran. No one saw Kate Ming after that day. Nothing changed in Cauteville after that. Upon hearing that he'd broken into Minor Mountain Mental Facility, no investigation was launched into Henry Robinson's death. Cauteville knew what became of him. He had been warned not to go there and yet he did. Cauteville blamed Henry for his own untimely demise. They had given him, like so many other teenagers, a verbal warning about the asylum, after all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   [Episode 2]

Carla screamed as the clown happily jumped up and down in his chair, munching the remainder of the cockroach infested lung. He hadn't even made a sound as of yet, other than the sound of him chewing. Upon seeing that Carla did not, in fact, have an appetite, the clown got up and dragged her in the chair over to a pile of boxes, several of which had body parts hanging out the sides of them.

The clown released her from the chair and bound her hands behind her back. He then pushed her towards an empty box. When she resisted, he pushed her into it and closed the lid. She hit her head on the wood when she fell in and was knocked unconscious.

Several hours later, Carla woke up to the gleefully smiling clown. He reached his gloved hands out and gently lifted her out of the box. He led her over to a separate room at one end of the warehouse. It contained a bed, a set of shelves (which contained several jars of teeth, eyes suspended in water, nails, fingers, noses and genitalia), and a table with different kinds of knives layed out on the table, each encrusted with dried blood.

The clown carefully picked a jar of teeth from the shelf and rattled it in Carla's face as she sat back, screaming on the bed. She leaned back, detecting a newly horrible smell. She looked on the sheets and saw that she was lying in layers of dried urine. The clown, dissatisfied, picked a new jar, of what looked to be some kind of vein or tendon, and handed it to her. He sat down beside her, smiling sheepishly at her and giggling slightly. She took the jar, confused, and smiled weakly as a realisation came over her. This clown wasn't trying to kill her. He was trying to court her.


 [Commercial Break]


Oscar, the newly appointed producer of Tormented, averted his gaze from Carla's horrified look. He looked around the studio where the show was being written and aired from and saw The Director. He walked over to the creator, director, executive producer and occasional writer of Tormented. He was a stylish man who demanded that everyone call him The Director. He had oddly shaped facial hair and always wore a suit.

"Hey", said Oscar to The Director. "Are you seeing this ? This wasn't scripted, was it ?"

"No, but that's the beauty of this show. We just some unscripted tv gold on the second episode", smiled The Director.

"Are you sure we should be doing this ? I mean, we could just hire an actress instead and set the whole thing up, and tell people it's real. This just seems kind've barbaric."

"I've been hearing comments like that since the dawn of this concept. It's 2059, Oscar. This isn't 2010. Do you even remember a little thing called the fall of the United States in 2050 ? The Sickness took the lives of over half the population of the U.S.A in that year alone. We thought that The Sickness would take the other half too, but we prevailed. Because we are strong. And here we are, going strong with a population of 160 million. You may have been too young to appreciate this, but over 160 million American lives were lost nine years ago. The fall of this great country caused what was basically the collapse of our American society. Politicians, soldiers, cops, actors, business people were among the deceased and the whole country went into decline. The government, the law, hospitals, schools and police stations all shut down. People were murdering, stealing, pillaging at leisure. It took nine years, but finally we are still re-establishing a new government with a new constitution, new schools, new hospitals, new law enforcement. And more importantly we are re-establishing a new economy. Which means every person in the country is working long hours in a shitty job for little pay. The people need to know that someone is having a worse day than they are. Enter Carla. We are in the dawn of a new country. We are the first generation of New America", professed The Director.

"But how is this even legal ? How did this even make it on the air ? Is the government okay with this ?", asked Oscar.

"The government gave this project it's full blessing. They're the ones who funded it. Besides, we need new entertainment. Tvs have only begun to come back into production again and the only movies and shows airing are the ones from before The Sickness. We're the first production in New America. And that's a big responsibility. We needed some revolutionary, something ground breaking, not another scripted, wooden trash tv show. And that's what we're doing. Do you see this ? This is a thirty minute commercial break. It's advertising hundereds of businesses in New America. And they're paying us a lot to promote them. Why ? Because we got over 85 million viewers for the first episode. Every business in this country is going to want their spot on this show. We'll be generating billions in no time. We'll be both the fastest growing and most profitable business in the short history of New America soon enough."

"How did you get an actor to eat all that shit last episode by the way ?"

"Oh the clown ? He isn't an actor. Just some crazy off the street who said he'd do it for free."

Oscar looked at him skeptically. 

"Have faith. Trust me. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go shoot a promo.


   [End of Commercial Break]


Carla forced a smile at him and took the gruesome jar gratefully. She didn't exactly know what to do next so she carefully laid down the jar, as though she were saving it for later and slowly walked out of the tiny bedroom. The clown tentatively followed. She looked around but couldn't see any of her belongings. She held her hand up to her ear.

"Phone ?", she asked. "Where's my phone ?"

The clown shook his head furiously. He didn't like that. He didn't like that at all. He took her by the arm and began to lead her back to his bedroom. Upon leading her back to his cramped room, he left and locked the door behind him. He came back minutes later carrying a body with him.

He laid the body down on the bed and handed her a knife from the table. He gestured excitedly towards the body. Carla saw her opportunity. She slashed at the clown, but he dodged her swipe, batting her hand away. He swung his hand, striking her across her cheek. She fell to the ground and feigned unconcsiousness. When the clown reached down to her, she kicked out sending him across the room.

She ran out of the bedroom, racing down into one dark corner of the warehouse. She found a door and ripped it open. She found a group of people with several computers with feeds of the warehouse on them. They looked at her, shellshocked. She stumbled backwards. The clown came from behind and rushed into the room. He carried a machete. For a second, everyone was still. The clown seemed confused and irritated.

The clown slashed one of the crew's necks, sending a stream of blood out everywhere. He embedded the machete in another crewmember's back.


  [Technical Difficulties]


The Director's face went slack. All the screens were static. 

"SOMEONE GET THOSE CAMERAS BACK UP AND RUNNING !", he roared.

Several people ran around The Director, fussing about trying to get the cameras back up.

"I DON'T CARE WHO NEEDS TO DIE NEXT, JUST GET THIS SHOW BACK ON THE GODDAMN AIR !", he screamed.

         
 [Return to Tormented]



Carla, screamed and ran toward the other end of the warehouse. She found the door outside. She ran out into a dense forest. Carla sprinted through the forest and skidded, falling just before an open manhole leading to a sewer. She got up and turned around, just in time to see the clown bounding towards her, his eyebrows arched, screeching manically.

He ran straight into her, causing her to topple over and into the hole. She fell and fell, eventually splashing into a sea of human waste. </TEXT>

[Episode 1]
















Carla Mouer sat in her kitchen reading the note over and over again. It said that she'd been fired from her job. It provided no explanation why and plainly stated that it was in effect immediately. She sat back in her kitchen chair. Why had this happened ? She hadn't done anything recently that even closely warranted her getting fired. In fact, she never did anything that warranted her getting fired.

She hated that job but it was the only one she had. Now she was going to have to go job searching again. God, how she hated fucking job searching. She pried a bottle of wine from the top shelf of her cupboard and sank into the couch in the living room. She began texting a guy she'd met on social media. She was planning on meeting up with him.

Carla woke up an hour later to a heavy rapping on her door. She jerked awake, spilling some of the wine on the floor. She stumbled over to the door and opened it. It was her landlord. She was a squat, pudgy old woman who always smelled like earth and had several warts on her face which she made no effort to cover up.

"I wanna see you downstairs in fifteen", she growled in a raspy voice.
"What, wh-", Carla was cut off by the sound of her landlord slamming her door in her face.

Carla begrudgingly trudged down to her landlord's office. She was waiting at her desk which always had a smoke cloud enveloping it.

"Sit down, Mouer", she groaned. 
"Yes ?", asked Carla as she sat down.
"I haven't gotten any rent from you in over two months. If you don't cough up soon, I'm gonna have to force you out."
"What ? No, I've been paying you. On time. Every month. I leave it in the box outside your door, like you asked me to. Every month."
"There's no use in lying to me, sweet cheeks. The jig is up."
"I'm not lying. Someone must have taken the money out of your box. I told you that thing was a bad idea.

Her landlord looked at Carla with conviction.

"I can take you to court, you know, if your trying to scam me. I have proof of payment."
"Lemme see it."
"Well, it's upstairs."

Suddenly, Carla's landlord's face went slack. She opened her mouth and a stream of blood spewed out and across the table. The blood was thick and sludgy, as though there was some kind of innard mixed in with it. Before Carla could react, her landlord collapsed and had begun gyrating on the floor, foaming at the mouth.

Carla sprinted back up to her room to get her phone. She called an ambulance and came back down to find a group of tenants crowded around her landlord. She didn't look good. She was pale and she wasn't moving. There was a pool of dried blood around her head.

Carla went to the hospital with her in the ambulance. After waiting in the waiting room for over an hour a doctor came out to Carla. He told her she didn't make it.

Carla made her way home, in disbelief about how awful a day she was having. She walked into her apartment block to find the other tenants whispering and looking at her. She frowned and went back up to her apartment. After a few minutes of texting the guy she'd met online she heard another knock on her door. She was tempted not to answer it but after a minute of persistence she gave in and opened it. It was her neighbour from downstairs.

Her neighbour stood there, looking at her. She was a tall, thin woman with wispy blonde hair and a timid face.

"Are you Carla Mouer ?", she asked quietly.
"Yes."
"I'm sorry.......is this a bad time ?"
"No, well, yes but.....what do you need ?"
"Well, I just got a package delivered to my apartment in your name."
"Oh, okay."

The woman stared at her blankly.

"Well, do you have it ?", asked Carla.
"Oh no,  it's in my apartment. I wanted to make sure I found you before I brought it out with me."
"Oh, well you can just drop it outside my door whenever you get the chance", said Carla slowly shutting the door.

The woman jammed her foot against the door abrubtly.

"Why don't you come up and get it now ?"
"Look, I'm having a really shitty day and I don't feel great."
"Oh, do come up. It will make you feel better, to be around people. I don't get visitors very often. It would make my day", she smiled sweetly, but her eyes purveyed no emotion.

Carla eyed her up and down carefully. 

"Okay. Fine. Just for a minute."

Carla followed her up a floor to her apartment.

"Aren't you going to ask me my name ?", asked the woman.
"Huh ?", asked Carla.
"Isn't that the polite thing to do, when you first meet someone ?"
"Okay, what's your name ?"
"Rita. Rita York."
"Okey dokey then."

Rita opened her door and Carla waited outside.

"Won't you come inside ?", asked Rita.
"Oh, no that's okay, I think I'll just wait out here."
"No, come in for some water, you look thirsty. I'm not taking no for an answer."
"Alright, but just for a minute."

Carla went inside and Rita gave her a glass of water. 

"You look like you've had a rough day", she said plainly.
"You have no fucking idea, sister."
"You shouldn't curse so much, you know. It's a sin", said Rita sharply.
"Oh, okay", muttered Carla.

Carla looked up at Rita. There a blood stain on the crotch of her jeans.

"Oh god", chirped Carla, looking away. "I, uh, I think you've had an accident, there."

Rita continued to stare at Carla, she didn't react to anything Carla was saying. Her eyes were glazed over, as though she was day-dreaming. 

"Do you have any....you know", began Carla. "Sanitary products ?"

Rita just kept looking at her with the same vacant, empty eyes. Her head was cocked to one side like a confused dog.

"How about that package, then ?", asked Carla tentatively.

Rita came back to reality.

"Ah yes. Of course. I shan't be a minute", she tittered politely.

After several minutes of waiting on the couch, Carla wandered into the kitchen to find Rita gazing at the wall. She seemed to be in some kind of trance. Her eyes were once again void of any expression. 

"Rita ?", she asked.

Suddenly Rita spun around revealing a kitchen knife and thrust it at Carla. Carla just caught Rita's wrist in time. Rita forced her to the ground and forced her hand towards Carla's neck.

Carla screamed out for help. She managed to force Rita's knife over to the side and she gathered her feet under Rita and pushed her away. Carla screamed out for help once again at the top of her lungs. Rita tried to slash at Carla's stomach.

"I WANT YOUR BABY !", screamed Rita. "I NEED IT !"
"I'm not fucking pregnant you psycho bitch !", yelled Carla. "HELP ME !"
"They're not gonna help you", spat Carla. "They all think you killed old Mrs.Kane."
"What ? I didn't kill her."
"You left her there to die."
"I went to get my phone. Is that what everyone thinks ?"

Suddenly Rita fell off of Carla. Her face went blank again and she stared emptily at Carla. Carla sprinted out of the apartment and hopped in her car. She drove straight to the police.

After several interview with the cops, Carla had given them an accurate idea of what Rita looked like and there was a cop car dispatched while she waited in the police station. After only a couple of minutes, Carla was called back into the interrigation room they were using. She walked in.

"Have you got her already ?", asked Carla.
"No, we haven't heard from them yet but we want to talk to you about a crime you may have committed."
"What ?", asked Carla, in shock. "Me ?"
"Yes. Ms.Mouer, do you realise that by not responding to an emergency that endangers a person's life immediately, you are partly responsible for their demise ?"
"What ? You mean Mrs.Kane ?"
"Yes, we've had reports from various other tenants describing you fleeing the scene upon Mrs.Kane suffering the mysterious ailment which doctors cannot seem to diagnose. This has led us to believe you were in fact responsible for her death."
"No, no.....", began Carla.

The cop shoved a phone in her face. It was playing a video of Carla sprinting out from Mrs.Kane's office.

"I wasn't running away, I was running back to my apartment to get my phone to call an ambulance", explained Carla. 
"Then why weren't you the one to call the ambulance ? We've looked at the records and they show another tenant calling the ambulance."
"Because, I went back downstairs, about to call an ambulance before seeing that someone already had. Before me."
"And why hadn't you called one from your apartment ?"
"I don't know, I was in shock, for Christ's sake."
"There's no need to get hostile, mam."
"I'm not getting hostile, I'm getting interrogated for a vague kinda sorta crimish thing, immediately after getting attacked and nearly murdered by some lunatic who lives below me !"

After hours of waiting while the police interrogated Rita after they caught her trying to escape the apartment building in Mrs.Kane's car, Carla was finally allowed to go home. It dark by the time she got back.

She flopped down on her bed, shaking from the days horrific events. She looked up therapists in her phone just as a message from the guy she met online popped up.

'Wanna meet up tonite ?', it read.

She thought about it. She nearly immediately typed no but then thought it would probably be better to be around people tonight, rather than being alone in her empty apartment. She agreed and sent him her address.

She slapped on some makeup and put on one of the only dresses she hadn't sold for rent money. She washed her blondey brown hair and slipped on a pair of heels. She looked at her phone. It was the guy. He was outside.

She gladly left the apartment and walked outside to the shiny, black jeep that was waiting on the curb. She looked in the window and saw that the drivers seat was empty. The engine was still running and the drivers door was open. She jumped when she got a message alert on her phone. She relaxed when she saw that it was him.

She opened the message to find a picture of her standing in front of the jeep, taken from behind. She turned around just in time to see a man dressed in a full clown costume bounding at her. Before she could scream, he slapped a cloth saturated in chloroform over her mouth and nose. She forced her into the back of the jeep until she subsided and stopped struggling.

Carla awoke. She was in some kind of warehouse, God knows where. She opened her eyes to find the clown sitting opposite her. She screamed at the sight of him. He had wild, wiry, stringy hair, poorly dyed purple. He had white makeup all over his face and streams of black eyeliner encrusted to his cheeks. He had orange lipstick smeared all over the bottom half of his face. He wore an old fashioned clown outfit. He shifted excitedly in his chair. He turned on the lamp on the table separating the two. 

Upon him turning on the light, Carla saw a human torso laying on the table. It seemed relatively fresh. Carla screamed and cried. There was a deep slit in the pale, skinny torso. The gash was open and was full of maggots and cockroaches. The clown dug his hand into the torso and pulled out what appeared to be a lung.

The clown opened his mouth and sunk his black and yellow teeth into the lung, and ripped off a chunk. More cockroaches streamed out of the lung. The clown licked the roaches off with his browning tongue and cheerily munched them too, blood dripping down his chin. Carla nearly fainted and eventually puked all over her shoes.

She looked up and saw several human eyeballs, hanging by the optic nerves from a bar above the table. She continued to cry for help. The clown noticed her and pulled an eyeball from the bar and gently tapped the eye on Carla's screaming face, leaving wet marks on her cheeks as it slapped wetly on her.

Carla cried desperately

The Director grinned widely as he watched Carla's terrified face on the multiple screens in front of him. He folded his arms. This was gonna be huge. </TEXT>

[Chapter 1]https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/64dv38/motel_demille_chapter_1/


Grace screamed as the knife pierced her skin and she lashed out her high heeled foot and caught Elanora in the eye. Elanora shrieked in frustration and fell back. Grace lunged towards the door and stumbled out into the hallway. She slammed the door behind her and pushed the maid's cart in front of the door to slow Elanora down. She ran down the hall and struggled up the stairs. 

Elanora lay in her room, unconscious. She had knocked her head on the corner of the table and collapsed onto the floor.

The next day, at dawn, Constance woke up to find Elanora looming over her bed.

"Jesus Christ, what are you doing ?", asked Constance.
"I need your help", she pleaded.
"With what ?"
"Come with me."

Elanora led Constance to her bedroom where Grace had escaped.

"What am I looking at ?", inquired Constance sleepily. 
"Last night I invited Grace in here to ask something of her. A favour. Anyway as I was about to tell her the rules, she told me knew what I do to the guests that stay here. And she shot me. Three times. After I got back up I managed to stab her but she knocked me unconscious and I just woke up now. Do you know what that means ? We have a guest who knows our secret on the loose and someone else knows and told her."
"Our secret ? This is your secret, Elanora."

Elanora's face turned sour. 

"This is our problem. Both of us", she said quietly. "You have just as much to do with this as I do. You're the one who did the voodoo shit in the first place."
"Because you threatened to kill me."
"Listen, Constance", sighed Elanora. "We need to do something about this. We need to find and kill Grace. And then we need to find whoever told her about this."
"Well how are we gonna do that ?" asked Constance.
"Time to get out your couldron and broomstick, witch."
"That's technically racist."

Several minutes later Elanora and Constance were standing in the second floor corridor. Constance was flipping through an old, leather book.

"Find anything ?", asked Elanora. "We need some kind of detection."
"I can't seem to find anything that I'm capable of. There isn't exactly a whole catalogue of options in here."
"Come one, you brought me back from the dead with that thing. There's gotta be something."
"Okay, here. There's a hex where I'd be able to basically booby trap the hotel, but we need some kind of trigger specific to Grace."
"Okay...... well can it detect what she looks like or her clothes or something ?"
"No, it has to be simpler than that. So if she's bleeding and in pain, then maybe we can use sound as a trigger. If someone screams above a certain decible, it'll trigger it."
"Is that it ?"
"It's the best I can do."
"Fine", sighed Elanora, taking a set of long metal blades out of a bag.

Constance incanted something unintelligable and a small, rectangular slot opened in the wall next to them. Elanora slid the blade in and the slot closed up.

"Okay", said Constance. "The next time someone screams loud enough, they'll be sorry they did."

They did the same around the other corridors of the motel. 

At around two, Cordelia came stumbling back in the doorway and headed towards her room. Eve, meanwhile was going the book she'd found the previous night. Every guest since the motel had opened twenty years earlier had been murdered by her aunt and stored in the basement. Her aunt was a serial killer and she couldn't go to anyone. She couldn't go to Dennis in case he was in on it and she couldn't go to Linda because she was criminal and couldn't trust her and she couldn't go to her mother because she was always incapacitated with alcohol. She decided she needed to take matters into her own hands. She decided she needed to see what was in room 29.

Cordelia fell into the room just then and flopped onto her bed and curled up, falling asleep. She lay there, thankful for the peaceful darkness alcohol lended her.

Cordelia awoke suddenly. It was six o'clock. Her black out blinds seemed to be working as she couldn't see anything in her room. She felt as though someone was present in the room. She looked up and barely made out the figure of Kitty, the maid. Cordelia moved out of the way just in time to avoid the axe that Kitty was holding. 

Cordelia rolled off the bed as Kitty embedded the axe into her pillow. Cordelia screamed and ran out of the room. She ran down the corridor and up the stairs to the second floor. Kitty pushed her from behind and they both fell onto the floor. Kitty raised the axe above her head and brought it down. Cordelia blocked it by pushing the handle of the axe towards her.

"You stole my finacee you bitch !", shouted Kitty.

Cordelia's face went white. 

"Katie McClure ?", she whispered.
"Of course it's fucking me you idiot ! You know I didn't think that dying my hair red and some botox would fool anybody but apparently it makes all the fucking difference."

Cordelia pushed the axe to the side and crawled backwards. 

"You stole my fiancee and then you let him die ! You let him die you asshole !", shrieked Katie.

Cordelia got up and ran back towards the stairs back down to her room. Katie got and screamed.

"YOU'LL FUCKING PAY YOU BITCH !", she screamed, running at Cordelia as two blades came out of the wall and sliced her head clean off, sending a wave of blood back down the corridor. Cordelia continued down the stairs, without seeing the decapitation.

Cordelia climbed into her bed after locking all the doors and took several sips of whiskey before drifting off.

Grace sat on the roof of the Motel DeMille. She had stuffed a towel she'd found on the maid's cart over her wound, but it was already saturated. She sat against a vent, looking at the sunset. This was gonna be a long, long night. </TEXT>

Elanora and Constance stood over the body. The teenager lay there, with a fire poker sticking out of his chest.

"We have to get this cleaned up. And quick", said Elanora to Constance.
"Jesus, Elanora. I thought we agreed you'd never kill kids", said Constance disapprovingly.
"He came in here. I told them what would happen if they did that. Now hook him up to my corpse and put the other body down with the others. I think he's all dried up."

Constance waved her hand and the body that was currently attatched to Elanora's corpse floated across the room and was dropped down the hole in the floor that led straight to the basement. She waved her hand again and Peter's body floated over to the table next to the one on which Elanora's corpse lay. The tube pierced and entered his arm and began to draw blood into Elanora's body.

"There", said Constance. "That should do it for about four days or so."

Hours later, Cordelia woke up. It was eight o'clock. She decided to head out again. She grabbed her bottle of Jack Daniels and sprayed some deoderant over her. She didn't bother changing her clothes or showering. She grabbed her bag and sauntered downstairs and into the lobby.

She called a cab and was on her way into town. She found a busy looking bar and settled herself on a bar stool. She ordered a screwdriver and waited for someone to notice her. She waited until a shady looking man sat down beside her. He had facial hair covering most of his features and it seemed to be travelling down his neck and onto his chest also. He had injection marks in his arms and a white substance on his nose.

"Hey baby", he slurred.
"Yeah, hi", sighed Cordelia.
"Can I order you a drink ?", asked the man.
"Let's just cut the shit", said Cordelia. "Come on."

She took the man's hand and led him to the car park.

"Which one's your car ?", she asked.

He clumsily pressed his car key and a car beeped.

"Let's go to your place", said Cordelia.

After a few minutes of dangerously drunk driving, Cordelia found herself in a damp, smelly apartment with a toilet in the kitchen. He led her into his bedroom, which was just barely big enough for them both to stand in.

Cordelia told him she was going to freshen up. She went to his shitty bathroom and began to apply make up. She looked at herself. She had an alcohol stained dress that was several sizes too small and covered far too little. She was away from her family. She was in some low life druggie's three room apartment. She laughed at herself. How had her life gotten so awful ? She knew of course. Ever since her husband died, the only thing to keep the demons at bay was the bitter sweet taste of alcohol. She began to cry.

She smeared the navy lipstick all over her cheeks and chin. Her tears caused streams of mascara to stain the rest of her face. She looked like a very dishevelled clown. The man walked in and she turned around.

"You still wanna fuck me ?", she asked, smiling. She knew only the scummiest dirtbags would still want to have sex with her in this state. He grabbed her hand and led her into the bedroom. Of course he did. They always did.

Eve came down to the lobby after deciding to look for clues as to what Elanora was doing. The lobby was empty. She tip toed across it and jumped when Linda appeared behind her.

"Have you seen Peter anywhere, Eve ?", she asked.
"Uh, not since this morning", replied Eve quickly.
"Okay", sighed. "Let me know if you see him."
"Will do."

When Linda was gone, Eve searched behind Constance's desk. She found a metal, locked box. She lifted it up onto the desk. In the middle of the rack with all the room keys on it was a small key with no number. Eve tried it and the box popped open. Inside was a large book.

Eve opened it and read. In it was the name and check in date of every guest in the hotel. Beside that was another date. It said date of "departure" and beside it was a method of death. Axe wound. Stabbing. Gunshot. Throat slashed. Every single guest since the hotel opened twenty one years prior. 

On the latest slot was Linda's, Peter's and Grace Wilkinson's name. None of them had any "departure dates" beside them except Peter. It said that day's date and wound to the chest beside. Eve went pale.

Grace Wilkinson sauntered down the corridor to her room, before running into Elanora.

"Grace ! Just the person I wanted to see. How about having a drink in my room ?", tittered Elanora.
"It would be my pleasure", smiled Grace.

Grace sat at the extravagant tea table in Elanora's room. Elanora served the drinks and sat down.

"So, Grace. Do you remember the rules I told you about on the telephone ?", she asked.
"Of course, yes. May I ask if these rooms are sound proof ?"
"As a matter of fact, yes. Each room is nearly completely sound insulated."
"Great. I recall you telling me that you had a proposition for me ?"
"Ah yes. I have an opportunity for you. It's very simple. Given that I have to run this motel constantly, I rarely get enough time to go out. I want you to go to  the nearest shop available and purchase me some.......items. I have a list. I will provide you with a sufficient fund and a handsome fee for doing the job."
"I'm afraid I must decline."
"And why's that ?", asked Elanora.
"Because, what am I going to do with a handsome fee when I'm dead ?"

Elanora looked shocked.

"I recently received some information about certain morbid fates that the guests here succumb to."

Elanora was taken aback. Just then, Grace pulled out a pistol and shot Elanora three times in the chest.

Elanora stood up, the three black holes in her chest closing up.  Grace looked horrified. Grace tried to run but Elanora took out a kitchen knife and thrust it into Grace's side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Secondary school is bullshit. There literally isn't any other place on earth that's filled to the brim with the type of immature people in our school. The same goes for a lot of the girls our age. Eventually as you age, so will the other people our age. They'll possibly mature. Some won't. Some will realise they were stupid assholes in secondary school. Some won't. Just wait Secondary school out. If you were a care free brainless stoner you'd probably have a good time for the six years in school and then regret it for the rest of your life. Also even if you were going out and getting stoned, I doubt you'd enjoy the company..... I sure af wouldn't. You'll find someone subtle someday, and if it is after secondary school, who cares ? G'luck Manus


P.s next time you see that girl you should just drop a hearty "go fuck yourself" at her </TEXT>
