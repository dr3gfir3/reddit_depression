	<TEXT> Movies like that give much needed perspective. I would love for it to foster an honest conversation with reasonable people. Rhetoric of today destroys that perspective and divides us all when unity is what is needed. The SJW usefulness withers and dies when we are not at each other's throats being divisive and racist. They exaggerate our differences and fabricate malice to inflate their cause and usefulness. We are individuals. When you begin your declaration by talking to a specific race and stigmatizing them all with a demoralizing stigma, then you are racist. We are individuals. Our unity threatens the SJW. Race relations in the real world have only gotten better with time. The degree that they will continue to improve will be in spite of the SJW, not because of.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are these supposed to prove? I find all of these things disgusting. I voted for Bernie and Hillary. Is this proof of racism? Here we go. 

Fails to disavow support of the KKK-- Trump  

That makes his shameful, not racist. It is also a voting tactic. He is not a good person, did you figure that out?

Attacks Muslim gold star parents-- Trump  

They were worse than him. Why the fuck does what they say hold any water because their son died in battle. They used the death of their son as political influence and that is disgusting. Just using the name "gold star parents" is disgraceful. If we are talking about the sacrifice they made in losing a child in war, fine. Don't use the death of someone who is not here to advance your political ideology. I despise Trump, but I despise this as well.  

Attacks federal judge saying that because he is Mexican, he can't be impartial  

People lied about his comments regarding Mexico. People in powerful positions. They were bad enough on their own. They were in fact not racist. He shouldn't say that his comments would influence a judge because he is Mexican, but it is not an outrageous statement. It shouldn't be said, but look at who we are dealing with. 

A ban on travel that has been legally determined by the United States judicial system to have a religious basis in part because of the many, many repetitions of the exact phrase "Muslim ban"  

I disagree with the judge. I think the ban was a horrible idea. The fact that 100% of Jihadists are Muslim remains. The way he dealt with it is wrong. The vast majority of Muslim majority countries had no travel ban. This is a dishonest way to stop him from doing something stupid.   

I don't have time to go over every one of these things. You should just give your best three. This is exhausting.  I simply don't have the time to address all this. I appreciate the time you took to send it though. I hope you understand and hope you don't see it as an inability to discuss it. I agree with some things and disagree with others.  

One thing we agree on, I cannot wait until he is out of office.   </TEXT>

Not too far, lies. Outright slander. Often to people on topics that both are totally void of anything racial.

Demonstrate it and talk about it.

Or? Calling swaths of voters stupid and having it become part of a political parties rhetoric is what got two time Obama voters to vote for Trump. You let me know what else got two time Obama voters to vote for him, because that is what they are telling you. Tell me how they are lying and what the real reason is. Entire counties that went to Obama TWICE went for Trump. How about people looking at safe spaces, deplatforming speakers, false accusations of racism, bigotry, homophobia, islamophobia, white supremacy, and fucking Naziism recoiling for the blinding stupidity. They may have seen Trump as the lesser of two evils. What do people like you do? Convince them that they are wrong? Nope, you insult them. 

The only way forward is for people like you to own your mistakes. Telling you that you are fucking up, or have fucked up, is not calling you stupid. It is asking you to change.  </TEXT>

Nonsense. Be specific. The mentality is poisonous because it tries to silence people. Objecting to that is not halting dialogue. 

I'm not saying there isn't an underlying kernel of truth  

It is just true. Be specific. What is the kernel? 

but you're literally doing that which you rail against  

Not in the least. Demonstrate this in any way shape or form. Objecting to what they do is not doing what they do. You are embarrassing yourself.

	<TEXT>  When convincing someone of something your argument is irrelevant, it's about how willing they are to hear what you have to say, and whether they feel attacked.

First off, it depends who you are talking to. Second off, they are often not the only ones listening. Third off, your argument may take multiple times. Fourth off your argument might fucking suck. 

Arguing isn't a zero sum game, you can't win most of the time, most you can do is pass some time and realize how dumb someone is.

Exactly. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. Get it motherfucker? It is really that easy. They don't have the right to make you listen to them. They are not trespassing, they are invited. Just because someone disagrees does not mean they have the right to shut them down. 

Silencing them helps nurture bad ideas because you shelter them better ideas. Where have I heard that before? Oh yeah, I fucking said it in the first post I put. If you are going to keep going in circles, then just stop wasting our time.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Because of the standards that society places on how women

Which is exaggerated and is equally contributed to by women themselves. The same standard is put on men. We hold ideals for every aspect of life, whey shouldn't we for appearance. I don't look like models who sell my clothes. I don't have the abs, I don't have the jaw, and I am not as tall. But I want them to sell my clothes. 

Dustin realizes that these standards have effectively prevented him from interacting with women who, while he might not be attracted to physically, might have liked personally very much.  

No, Dustin's own prejudiced has. He is very sneakily trying to pin the responsibility on society instead of faulting on one of the simplest lessons we have all learned as children. It is very subtle what he did.

EVEN IF he was placing the responsibility solely on himself, which I don't think he is, he is exaggerating to a degree where mockery is appropriate. He is distorting reality, and exaggerating his own emotion in order to gain attention by showcasing how virtuous he is.  </TEXT>

This is the majority. People who stray from it like to pretend that it doesn't exist. Just because there is variation to the majority doesn't mean you cannot have a conversation about the majority.  

Can we stop this already? Seriously. Nobody every means "everyone", they are talking about the majority. When will this shit stop? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is nothing shocking in this what so ever. People are not behaving ignorantly, they are acting quite reasonably to the norms of human psychology. On the social media front, it is a fraction of a hair or a fraction of a hair in the timeline of our communication with one another. We need to adapt to it. I use it as a tool. If we are more aware of our tendencies, then we an adapt to the pressures that our outside environment has. I only use Twitter for politics and make sure half of the people I follow I disagree with. 

So you value your opinion? Do you think you think things through and don't let nonsense influence your opinion? Read ["Thinking Fast and Slow"](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Fast-Slow-Daniel-Kahneman/dp/0374533555). You wont trust yourself for shit anymore. You will be more cautious on quick opinions and try very hard to reserve judgement and rely on the "thinking slow" part of your brain". Sad part is, even when you know about your brains tendencies, you are still victim to them 80% of the time.   </TEXT>
