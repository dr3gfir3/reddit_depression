	<TEXT> I know what you mean. People just call them bad because they're not exactly the positive experience that we have on our best trips. They can get bad for some people. I, for instance, was experiencing sensory overload for about an hour, but what seemed like forever, and it was pretty scary. 

But like I said in my other comment on here, the thought process after is extremely revealing. I realized how I felt must be how a person with extreme Autism must feel all the time. That said a lot to me about other people's experience that I have none with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depression is not an excuse. It's a reality. You need to stop thinking that people suddenly give up on trying when they suffer from a mental illness. That's not the case, they didn't just grow lazy, they just need a bit more support.

	<TEXT> I'm happy you've taken precautions on all those measures. Young teens shouldn't have all that free reign. 

I know it's probably not looking the best from your POV, but believe me when I say it's not unusual at all. Some kids and teens just need someone there not only as a friend but to supervise. You could also think of it as a tutor when he works on school work. 

I'm no expert OP, but I wish you the best and highly suggest reading and researching up more on current and future diagnosis's of his.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry that this is happening to you, OP. Consistently unruly kids are never easy for anyone.

First off, take this kid to get some counseling. It can save you years of emotional and financial damage this kid can do when he grows. 

Why does he have a cell phone? Get rid of it when he's misbehaving. Get rid of his video games if he does something he's knowingly not supposed to. I grew up without the luxury of these things, and as a 21 F, I'm fine now. 

Think about getting a babysitter, even if you don't necessarily need one. Some kids feel they relate better to teens/young adults than to actual adults, and it could change the moods of things; you could have more free time and he will be monitored. 

Get locks on your fridge, freezer and pantries. I once had a friend who's family had to do this because of their weight issues. These things can't be opened without a pass code, that you should NEVER tell him. You're not starving him, however he needs to learn about impulse control. This has worked out well for my friends family (except for my friend, who now works as a mechanic's apprentice and buy's all the junk food he wants outside of his home, unfortunately.) 

Lastly, OP, lay down the law. I had a tough, old-school dad growing up. And in many ways, I appreciate it, because I learned to be a self-sufficient, healthy person. He was not the nicest most times, actually, and had a very condescending demeanor. But he made sure to let me know very sternly whenever I wasn't doing something correctly, wasn't going to get something I didn't need or was acting like a child. Maybe not in the right ways, but he did. Basically, don't be afraid to play the bad dad, but don't be a dick or abusive about it. He needs you to do this and you need to do this.  </TEXT>

 This means that while 90% of the deaths were caused by disease remains true, some portion of that number would still fall into the category of genocide as that portion was intentionally exposed to potentially deadly diseases.
