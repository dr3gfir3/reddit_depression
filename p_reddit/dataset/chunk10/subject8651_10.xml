	<TEXT> The thing is, the investigation was purely a Republican move to defeat Hillary. Yes, Hillary fucked up and shouldn't have been doing shady stuff in the first place. But, how hard is it to conduct investigations without sounding the alarm on someone? It's funny because Trump blames the media but the media is what elected him. </TEXT>

EDIT: to clarify my own opinion, Comey is unfit to be director. He's been unfit since reopening the Clinton case. It's just slightly odd that Trump has been almost supportive of him and he is now firing him. Firing Comey is good, but the events that led to it are up in the air IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. We're not saying he has no motive, we're saying there is no proof at this moment and to insinuate anything would be unjust. He was not involved in any groups on campus, so none of them can speak for him. 

And my two cents, saying liberal rhetoric causes attacks is the same as saying Trump rallies cause attacks. We only see what the media reports, and they tend to sensationalize things. Not everybody is as bad as you think they are.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Killer was a junior at the school, Kendrex White. Nobody is sure of the motive yet, initially the rumor from students is that he was talking about Greek life, but this has been said to be false from cops. Story I heard from a student is that the man walked up to students eating outside, stabbed his knife into the table, looked everybody in the eyes, then pulled the knife out and slashed someone in the back of the neck and then someone else in their lower body/kidney area. That's all they saw before they ran away. 

Police have said today, May 2nd, that White had "no vendetta against any group", and "may have been suffering from mental health issues".

Before anyone calls that bullshit, I'd like to clarify that multiple students made false claims that White was muttering about frats and made false claims of people being threatened to show their Greek letters off-campus yesterday. Kendrex did not have a strong social media presence so as of now, there is not any evidence that this was a premeditated, political attack. If evidence does come up, that's a whole different news story. And since people are asking, multiple races were victims. Asian and white. Victims appear to have been at random as they were all just eating in a communal area and nobody was wearing anything that identified them with any group. 

IMPORTANT EDIT: so apparently all the Greek life targeting was pure speculation by students and this guy was mentally unstable. considering it was May Day and there's been a strong anti-frat climate right now, thats why so many false claims were made in the beginning of this story. Feel kinda bad for spreading that it was anti-Greek considering a ton of people probably got info from this comment. Have added police statements from today. **Let this be a lesson in not overreacting to news until it develops and not jumping to conclusions.**

The strategy is very simple, bat like you're actually an MLB player. 

This sounds dumb but it's true. This game lets you hit bad pitches that players would normally whiff at, and those result in pop flys or weak grounders. You have at least 3 pitches each at bat, that's 3 chances to get a nice, hittable pitch. Don't let your opponent get 3-6 pitch innings.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok it's not a pitch out but it's the equivalent of it for a third base steal. I was attempting to steal third and this was definitely an attempt at throwing him out.

Edit: how is this downvoted. This is exactly what it is lol </TEXT>

DAMN is a more cohesive project to listen to than GKMC is, making it more mass appealing. I'm not saying the man has sold out, I'm saying he's found a way to make something beautiful and have meaning while still having the ability for those who aren't big hip hop fans like me to appreciate it.  </TEXT>
