Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and counselled him for to send for all the lords of the realm, and all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to London...And when matins and the first mass was done, there was seen in the churchyard, against the high altar, a great stone four square, like unto a marble stone; and in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high, and therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there were written in gold about the sword that said thus:Whoso pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king born of all England. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ha yeah but I actually prefer it to be the same sword.  it works better that way.  but I appreciate that the stories malory copied down makes the distinction. 

fun fact: theres a second sword in the stone in malory's collection that belonged to sir balin, the knight of two swords, which he'd gotten from a damsel.  he was the only knight worthy enough to pull it from its sheathe.  and in a twist, he kept it though she asked for it back and this eventually led to his death  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At this point, Merlin supposedly arranged the test of the Sword in the Stone, which only the true king could draw. This sword is often confused with Arthurs most famous weapon, Excalibur, the legendary sword said to have magical powers. In fact that blade was given to Arthur later by the Lady of the Lake (a faery woman who appears in the stories), after the sword from the stone breaks during battle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With it coming out in two weeks, wondering what you all are feeling.

it's got Guy Ritchie who's made classics like Snatch and Lock, Stock along with big Hollywood movies like Sherlock Holmes.

It's about the legend of King Arthur which has been ripe for another reimagining.  I enjoyed the last historical approach with Clive Owen but am more excited for this as this seems to take it back to its fantasy roots mixed with Game of Thrones and Guy Ritchie's style.

It's got a great cast: Charles Hunnam from Sons of Anarchy, Jude Law, and Eric Bana.

And it has one of the writers of Edge of Tomorrow. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Saw the Sam Rockwell post and thought of the question.  I saw him in Moon and will always be interested in a movie he's in even if I don't end up watching it.

Same with Tom Cruise though he's had so many I can't really just pick one.

Pulp Fiction made me keep an eye out for Travolta though I'd already seen him in Look Who's Talking.

Will Smith is actually because of the Fresh Prince.  

Had liked Jim Carrey a lot in Truman Show but Eternal Sunshine made me a forever fan.

How about you?

	<TEXT> Whites play different nationalities all the time, it's no different with Asians or Hispanic in your case.  And again it's about Asian Americans or any minorities in America being represented on screen in roles originally theirs no less, not what other countries think.  Why are you so eager to lay down and be a doormat?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> saw it, absolutely loved it, it's out in theaters now, go check it out!

and heres my short review of it

I originally wanted to watch last year but it only played one week.  Now it's back in theaters and I just got back from a packed screen filled mostly with teens, couples and even a few over thirty, from all races.

The movie is about a girl and boy who switch places when a comet appears in the sky.  That's the story in a nutshell but it's so much more and I think that's why it was the number one movie in Japan last year and is second only to Spirited Away's box office.  It's also a coming of age story, a romance, about the culture of the countryside versus the city, the vanishing culture of parts of the country, and about the 3/10 tsunami.  The story is told with humor, without cynicism which is probably why the writer/director has been called the new Hayao Miyazaki although they are very different.  If one wants to understand Japan, this may be the best movie to convey where it is at this moment.  Both boy and girl roles are equally strong and developed so it's also a good date movie.  

It's really just a great movie period and I recommend it wholeheartedly. </TEXT>
