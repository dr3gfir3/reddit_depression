Funny story: someone actually came up to me and said, out loud, "Ankh Wedja Seneb." I roared laughing. So there was actually ancient Egyptian spoken on Boston Common that day. 

But other people asked me about it too--I like that about signs that need a bit of explanation. Conversations are better.

	<TEXT> I will take a look at these later, thanks very much. 

I've been thinking a lot about the success of the PWA (People with AIDS) activism because I'm reading "[How to Survive a Plague](http://surviveaplague.com/)". Seems to me that this movement was the most effective contemporary science + societal change movement in my lifetime, and I think there's a lot to learn from it.

One of the threads of this was [Bobbi Campbell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobbi_Campbell) and his work, including the campy [Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisters_of_Perpetual_Indulgence). 

I'm not saying this is the only route, but it's one that works for some people and some topics.  </TEXT>

The package also came with an etiquette guide, which I did try to use once. But the same city asshole keeps parking in the same city hall spot whether they need a charge or not. Makes me insane. But at least I tried a gentle nudge. Next time this bugs me I'm calling the city.  </TEXT>

But I am enjoying your reconfiguring of the goalposts again. Because you actually said it was about safety yourself:
Or do you think it is more risky, but that the regulatory framework is good enough to make it effectively safe.

But now it's not safety. Gotcha. 

So ok--you have some other theory there is environmental-but-not-safety issue at risk. Your ideas are intriguing to me and I wish to subscribe to your newsletter. Maybe you can come up with something resembling actual evidence for this and it will appear there. Because it's not appearing here.

	<TEXT> Yes, right after you support your claims. 

But you don't have a really good track record of responding to evidence. Let's say I give you this link--will it have any effect, or will you just move the goalposts again? 

Let's say I have a National Academy report that says this:
In contrast, induced mutagenesis is the most genetically disruptive and, consequently, most likely to display unintended effects from the widest potential range of phenotypic effects.

Would that change your mind? Let me just get your claim copied so you can't go back and change it later:
You clearly don't believe that the ability to transplant a set of genes in their entirety from one phylum to another is any more inherently risky than random irradiation-mediated mutation. I'm not convinced.

What would it take to convince you? Scicomm pros keep telling us that facts don't work. Will that change your mind?  </TEXT>

**To the NH March for Science Community:** 

Given all of the feedback and responses over the last 24 hours, we wanted to take a moment to reach out to all of you who have shared your concerns. We have removed our post regarding the NH March Against Monsanto event. Going forward, we want to be sure to get your feedback and input on the causes that we, as a community of scientists and science supporters in NH, could throw our support behind.

We also want to take the time to apologize for deleting comments last night. As organizers new to this work, and overwhelmed by the volume and vitriol of responses we did not understand how this could insult others. For this, we would like to truly apologize.

As we move forward, we would like to encourage followers to post their comments and opinions regarding this and other topics relevant to the science community, as some of you have already. At the same time, we want to keep the discussion productive, encourage respect, and keep things appropriate for science enthusiasts of all ages, so we ask that posters refrain from using profanity and making personal attacks. If we focus on scientific research, this can be a great space for evidence based dialogue. Appreciate everyone's passion for science, and look forward to having open and educational dialogues.

	<TEXT> I'm not on facebook, but someone gave me a screen cap of their deleted comment. It's astonishing.

Check out the March Against Monsanto (MAM) letter to supporters. It includes a lot of trash, but this should make anyone remotely claiming to be a supporter of science run very fast away from MAM:
As if we needed more of a reason to shout a big resounding "NO" to the CDC's eugenics-inspired vaccination schedule, research funded by Moms Across America has determined that five different childhood vaccines are contaminated with Monsanto's weedkiller. 

CDC? Eugenics? Really? 

The letter is linked from this page: http://www.mamyths.org/take-action/ See the "MAM's campaign for 2017" link.

	<TEXT> Well, you don't seem to have a strong grasp of how plant breeding works, so it's hard to assess. 

Are you aware that with conventional breeding you can release a new trait that storms the world really quickly? If you were, you'd know this isn't a GMO issue. 

Here's a good example. The herbicide tolerant sunflowers--a new mutation, nobody knows what it is, nobody had to test it. It's worldwide in a really short time. http://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/03/12/148312077/how-a-sunflower-gene-crossed-the-line-from-weed-to-crop

And yes, it was your argument that traits weren't useful to you, so who cares. That's self-centered. 

Your argument about the speed of this trait is entirely bogus as well. These peaches were introduced into the environment not in any kind of fundamentalist viewof  co-evolution that you imagine. Boom--there they are. The point is that breeding has no magic properties that are different from a GMO trait. It's a huge misunderstanding of evolution which always shocks me among people who claim to have biology degrees. 

And that's great that you have the priviledge to take the time to cut those apples up for your kids. Lots of people have to rely on schools and daycares which do large-scale food prep. You should really get out of your own kitchen and understand the wider world.

You are free to use terrible reasons to avoid things you made up. But you are going to get called on them, especially when you ask for that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't farm peaches, do you? Yeah. It's not marginal. And it's also not GM. Why do you hate conventional breeding? And if you aren't a hypocrite, you have to dislike this waste of breeding time (it can be decades with conventional breeding) when your other priorties in your priviledged existence apparently aren't being met.

Personally I think farmers are worth helping as well. We've put a huge burden on fewer and fewer farmers. Sustainable also means financially sustainable.

Yeah, there is [data on the apples](https://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/2013/04/kids-more-likely-eat-apples-when-fruit-sliced). But you should definitely assume this is marketing, instead of the organic industry being nothing but marketing. 

If you are a parent, I'd also be interested to know how your 5 year old does with a knife. Or do they eat whole apples without wasting any? 

What percentage of increase in consumption do you require to approve a product for kids?

	<TEXT> Food waste is a serious problem--from picking through shipping to consumer's homes. Adding time to their use really has value.

There's a [peach that was developed](https://www.biofortified.org/2012/08/fruits-of-climate-change/) (and also patented; who knows how it was mutagenized) that was a huge boon to farmers and consumers because it wasn't mush in shipping. 

Also, in the case of the non-browing apple, it may encourage kids to eat more apples than other crap.

So no, selfishly looking at your own raspberries may seem like navel gazing, but if you think about the larger picture of the food life cycle it does have impact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This hints at a strategy that I use. I chip away at the misinformation. I don't expect that every comment section will result in a take-down. In fact, I assume that it won't.

But--I try to find something at their core and undermine it. For example--on GMOs: do you want to reduce insecticides? GMOs reduce them. That data is solid. Farmers in Bangladesh who lack protective gear reduce their exposures if they grow GMO eggplant. Period. 

Not everyone will pursue the actual info and data. But some subset of them will. And if they have any integrity (and those are really the only ones worth trying to turn into allies, conspiracy theorists will always make shitty allies), they have to admit this is true.

Science by the pint talks: [Second Mondays (usually, some Thursdays now)](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/science-by-the-pint/)

Long Now Boston: [First Mondays](https://www.meetup.com/Long-Now-Boston/)

Boston Skeptics: [Fourth Mondays](https://www.meetup.com/BostonSkeptics/)

Science in the News: [alternate Wednesdays](http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/seminar-series/)

And I go to Museum talks, aquarium talks, city stuff (last night there was a public health meeting I went to). 

I'm also kind of booked up with protests every week now. 

These existing organizations could use your enthusiasm, and you wouldn't have to build it from scratch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kind of early to conclude anything from this. But I was incredibly relieved to see the support from the public and the first time ever that scientists aligned in such numbers in public. 

I was listening to [this podcast today](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2017/04/25/why-a-decentralized-swarm-of-resistance-is-the-best-way-to-contain-trump/?tid=ss_tw utm_term=.dd121bee2ebe#comments), and it made some very good points. We need to have groups active on many fronts--which we have already seen--women's issues, immigration, taxes, science, and more are coming like the public education march. 

And a key feature of these is this (from the podcast):
"It is the company of others. It is not being alone. It is being reminded that you are not only in fellowship, but you are in a community of purpose."  

And now, the March for Science folks have the best mailing list in science. This can persist over the next years with awareness of the issues and calls to action as specific issues arise. Not only nationally, but locally as well. 

If anyone told you it would affect policies on Monday morning, they were lying to you. Nobody thought that, and nobody said that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I did it 30 years ago. Things may have changed. But I didn't have a college degree. And I was a science major, interested in a job at a historical park. That said, almost everybody at my park was a biologist too.

As I remember it, there was some kind of tedious federal form. Fairly basic stuff. 

They had a training period beforehand, so you could learn the local topics. They give you reading time during the period between tours, so you can keep learning. 

But some jobs just require you to check the reservations, not give tours. 

On the other hand, some are dangerous--people don't realize that park police are constantly at risk of encountering bad actors is remote places, or even urban places where I was. Those jobs require different training, though. 

Find your closest park and give them a call, or even better--a visit. Park rangers love to talk to you and help you out.  </TEXT>

They are on the front lines of public education. People are now saying how all of us in science have to get out there--and these folks are on it. 

The park I worked at talked about renewable energy (waterpower) and technology before that was a climate thing. Our park talked about immigration to work in the cotton mills. And ours was a historical park, not even a natural park where the geology and biology might be the most visible parts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone asked me recently if this was the first time I've been political on science issues. And I said: hell no. 

I've been marching on DC since the 1980s. We didn't call reproductive rights a science issue then, but it is. We have the evidence to show that making abortion available reduces abortions. We have the evidence to show that funding birth control improves women's use of it, and saves welfare dollars. We know that abstinence only sex education is ineffective.

I've been at CDC public meetings on vaccines, where I was one of a tiny group of science-minded folks showed up.

I worked on the ScienceDebate2008 effort. 

I am *so* relieved that other scientists are finally showing up. I am excited that for the first time they are publicly stating how important it is to support evidence-based policies. I am glad they are fighting for the research that improves our lives, our health, and our prosperity. 

Where have y'all been? 

But I'm delighted that you are showing up now. And please promise me you won't stop after this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say, though, that at least at the skeptic groups the folks seemed more open to evidence. I watched as the skeptics approached Kevin Folta after a conference talk, and listened to what they asked. And they seemed to really be interested in finding resources that could help them work through it.

At an early point in my life, before I got science degrees, I was anti-nuke. Not because I understood it, but because my tribe was anti-nuke. And I think that's true on food issues too. The misinformation swamps the good info that's out there because the activists shout about these things. It takes extra effort to overcome that, and not everyone has done it yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you given talks at skeptic events? I'm curious what your experience is with them.

That said, I'm sure his counting skills are fine. And at these events, it's clear what the turnout is.

I have given talks at skeptic events--on GMOs. I've also watched a lot of talks by others. Skeptics are assholes--I know, I'm one of them. They are people who aren't afraid to disagree. And I've seen this happen at skeptic events that you have to pay big money for: conferences. Not just pub talks.

A lot of people who are pro-vaccines, pro-climate issues, pro-fluoride, still lose their minds on GMOs. It's not just his word, and it's not just pub talks. It happens here all the time too. 

If you would design a proper survey, I'd love to get it out there. I wish we knew more about the amorphous skeptic community. But there are many data points on this one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been marching on stuff since the 1980s. It certainly hasn't all worked like we'd hoped. At the Women's March the signs carried by ladies of my vintage with "I can't believe we still have to do this" cracked me up. 

But I think we've sat on the sidelines far too long. I hope this spurs more local and national action on issues where we deserve to have a voice. 

I also think that our neighbors are counting on us to lead on this issue. I know my neighbors want to support a healthy planet, healthy communities, and a prosperous future. It's not their job to carry this--they have plenty of other things to carry right now. 

If it makes science more visible, if it starts conversations, and if we get any fraction of new folks active on evidence-based policy, it will be a win in my book. 

But it's gonna be a long 4 years. And it won't always be obvious if we are winning or even just holding ground. But I can't imagine not trying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, it's not just Trump--be sure you realize that this is a general call to evidence-based policy on all fronts. The current threats are worse than they have been in the past in many ways, but it's not all new.

For me, it includes the people who are running the science-based agencies. And the fact that the education department is run by a woman who wants to use tax dollars to teach kids creationism. It's the risk to our health by underfunding NIH, CDC, etc.
