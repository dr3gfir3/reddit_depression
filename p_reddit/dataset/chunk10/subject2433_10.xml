	<TITLE> [NeedAdvice] I feel its to late to improve myself and there is no point </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was hoping someone can help me out with my situation here. I'm going to be a senior in college, and I'm overweight, feel depressed, u disciplined, and have low confidence and self esteem.

I've read many different articles, posts, etc, on how I can get out of this rut and the steps to take. but then I see that it takes a year or more before I would even see results, and I just do t bother.

Its not the fact that it takes a year that bothers me. its the fact that by the time things get better I will be out of college and into the work zone. I basically wasted away the greatest times I could have had in highschool or college. Had I followed the advice and those steps earlier maybe I could have enjoyed college as a whole new and confident person. but those times in life are gone and I will never get the chance.

so why bother trying to improve, its to late. I will be working my ass off all day at a career with no friends and little social interaction or activities. there's no point in trying to improve myself, the prime times in my life I could have had are all gone. now there's nothing left but working a career for the rest of my life. no chance of having exciting opportunities with friends or my peers, or road trips, or anything else exciting and fun. only work

maybe I'm wrong though. I guess that's why I'm posting this here, I want hope I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done some thinking as to why I may feel depressed, and one thing that stood out is the fact that I'm always looking for new things in my life to fill some kind of hole or need

this has become destructive though, as I will eat a lot just for the sake of eating because it feels good and different from feeling g depressed, or I'll just by random crap just because it is new

and the this gs I used to like to do, like programming or reading, I just don't find as fun anymore

I'm not sure if this is just a part of depression or if its entirely something different. life feels so unfulfilling and rather boring, and I just keep trying to fill the emptyness with food and useless junk, and I feel jealousy towards those I know who get to live an exciting life and experiencing new experiences I wish I was able to

I'm not sure what exactly to do </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so so much for writing this man. Ive been just out of it for the last few days and visited reddit again and found your reply. I can relate a lot, and I'll admit too I'm gay as well, though very few people know as I'm not very comfortable with coming out yet

I really like your advice and it was inspiring to read. 

Also a question, do you think the depression ever goes away, or is it always kinda there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I ask is because I want to know that there has been someone who has been through what I have and made it to the other side.

right now I'm 280 pounds and trying to lose weight. however, making things much harder is a battle with clinical depression (and constant changes in medication), and a  hard past with many depressing moments (including moments where I acted like a friggin bitch) which are hard to escape from

I'm not asking for sympathy or pity. I'm asking for hope. I want to know that there was someone out there that went through a similar battle and came out a changed person, a confident, fit and healthy person, someone completely different from who they were. I want to know that there is hope for me

If anyone could tell the story of their journey, I would really appreciate it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm afraid of being judged or rejected by people, or somehow looking like an idiot. Take going to a bar for example, I would be too afraid going alone because I would think people would think I'm some fat loser going alone, and also because I wouldn't know where to sit or what to do at a bar alone so I'm afraid of looking like an idiot. I don't have much high self-esteem I guess </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [NeedAdvice] How do I overcome boredom? life seems pointless, dont have the motivation or discipline to do anything </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> this entire summer break from college I've done nothing every day except for sitting on my laptop playing video games and other forms of escapism like reading reddit. other than the days where I go to work (which is in a small warehouse by myself) and going to the gym to do the elliptical for 10 min every day (my small goal to do everyday) life seems boring and pointless

I want life to be more exciting and filled with more than just video games and reading. but I don't know what to do, I don't have any friends nearby, dont have much money, and when I do get an idea (like go to a bar) I don't do it because I'm scared.

any time I do try to do something, I feel like I don't have the energy and I just go lay in my bed reading reddit from my phone.

what can I do to overcome this boredom? what can I do to get myself motivated and going? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Lament and confession </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-31 18:40:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like the best thing to do to make me feel better is to confess what I feel is something Ive done terribly wrong, and to lament on why I'm feeling depressed. Ill explain my logic for this at the end of my post. Andy feedback or advice is extremely appreciated.


As for the terrible thing I did wrong: Right now, im in college and about to go into my senior year in college. My parents are paying for my whole college since I am unable to take out a loan because of my parents finances, and they have set very high standards for me in terms of grades. not even a B is enough for them. They plan on moving to the other side of the country in a year next summer, and they expect me to graduate on time this next summer.


The problem is I wont. I lied to them, I told a big lie saying I was going to graduate on time, I even went to the extreme of pretending to be my advisor saying that I would graduate on time. The reason I wont be able to graduate on time is because I failed calculus (something they would get extremely pissed about and might have even cut off my college funding), and some courses from a community college from a while back didnt transfer over to this college. 


This is bad, my parents want to be able to move and have their plans all set for next summer, and I still wont have graduated. My plan for this was to save up as much money as I can so I can get my own apartment, and take out loans without them knowing when I turn 23 in a month, since FAFSA does not take your parents finances into account for loans once you turn 23. Then I would break the news to them sometime around christmas that I wont graduate on time.


Even though it seems like I solid plan I feel guilty as fuck and feel like a piece of shit for doing this. I dont deserve anything. I dont deserve happiness, I deserve to be depressed, I lied to my own parents, such a big lie


But I had no other choice. I'm so afraid of talking to my parents, and a few months ago I tried telling them the truth, but the moment I did I saw my mom getting furious at me and I got so scared and had to make up a lie saying I didnt know for sure whether I would graduate on time or not, and from there I formulated my bigger lie


I've always been afraid of my mom, I could never go to her for advice because she was always condescending and critical, and always easy to piss off, and extremely stubborn. I know she cares about me, but her attitude prevents me from confronting her about anything. I dont even know how I am going to break the news to them about not graduated on time, im really afraid. My mom has overacted to things many times before. I even remember once she threatened me saying she could make my life hell. yet at the same time she will do things like get me a birthday gift, she pays for my college, she sometimes makes breakfast.



The lament: I seem to have confused hard work and suffering, and used to think that because of the suffering I have endured in life I would be rewarded. I now know thats not the case, you have to work hard to be rewarded, and I feel like the suffering I have gone through in life is extremely unjust.


I missed out all of my highschool because I was very afraid of people, had low confidence and low self esteem. Im still rather afraid of people. Im not sure why im so afraid of people, maybe it was because there were times I was made fun of during middle school or when I was a kid. Maybe thats why i'm so self conscious as well about my weight and stuff


And yet people ask me to help out other people, be a kind person, turn the other cheek, and I dont see why. Why should I help others when there was never anyone to help me out in life during those hard times?! All I would have wanted during those times when I was lonely and depressed, those times when I was laying in my bed crying and weak, I just would have wanted a friend who cared enough to say its ok or to talk to. But no people are so busy with their lives they cant bother to help me when I was in pain or when I was suffering.


There was a time a few years ago when I was near suicidal, where I fucked up a friendship I had with the best friend I ever had, had to take a leave of absence from school for a semester because of it, and go to a community college which was in a bad neighborhood and nowhere near as good as the university I was at. I was at rock bottom, I had pushed away the greatest friend I ever had by being to clingy (he was the greatest friend I ever had and who cared and who I trusted), i was in a shitty place in life, and no one was there. I was alone, no one was there to say things would get better or things would be alright, or to try and cheer me up or keep me from being lonely. NO ONE was there, fucking no one, I had to go through half a year of shit all by my self with no help, and I feel so fucking bitter about it 


tl;dr I think this guilt is the root of my depression, my lack of motivation, my anxiety, and all these other mental problems. I dont see a light at the end of the tunnel, I see this problem as a huge mess that will destroy my life and everything I know in my life will be crushed. why bother trying to accomplish anything or improve myself when my doom is only months away.


The reason why I did the lament, I listened to a speaker at a retreat about a year ago, and he said that something like this:
Trauma - lies - feelings - behavior - circumstances

1. feelings drive the behavior
2. lies drive the feelings
3. trauma drives the lies

and one of the ways to address the trauma is the write a lament. without healing the trauma, we cant change our behavior </TEXT>
