	<TEXT> I usually just eyeball it on Strats/Teles, it really has come from years of trial and error. That's the fun thing about bolt-on guitars, unless you wrench the screws too much, you really can't hurt them. I've taken necks off, shimmed them, taken neck off, re-shim, etc. till it's right.

One tip, instead of restringing every time, I take a Capo or Gaff tape an place on the first fret to hold the strings on (after slacking them of course). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm more of a technician than a player, but I found the best way to get better is to play in a band. That could be just jamming with friends or actually playing shows. Playing with others (even those better than you) will up your game.

Also, if just starting out I think a lot of bands rehearse too much trying to make it perfect before playing a show. I say learn the songs to the best of your ability then play a show, might not be the best, but it will get better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really want to go into calling out brands I don't like, but I prefer either Switchcraft, G H, or Neutrik connectors when soldering and George L's and now my own 3 Monkeys Solderless connectors for solderless.

In particular, I prefer the Neutrik SilentPlug over the Switchcraft  1/4"Silent plug, because it works with acoustics better than the Switchcraft. 

For cable I like Mogami or Canare for soldered cables.

I rarely buy off the shelf cables, preferring to make my own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It should work with 1/8" connector supplied with the DP-1. Polarity is where you are going to run into problems. If possible check the polarity (tip positive?) of the original adapter with a Multimeter and make sure it matches the one from the DP-1. </TEXT>
