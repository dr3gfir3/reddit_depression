	<TEXT> It is difficult to overstate how essential the peddling of outright lies was to the House GOPs ability to pass the morally obscene American Health Care Act last week. Much has been made of the fact that Republican leaders railroaded their members into voting for an ink-wet bill that hadnt been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office, but one of the main reasons they did so was to make it easier to lie about what the legislation would do, rather than respond to what non-partisan experts say the bill would do.

What an amazing thing for a government to do. Pass a bill quickly before it's consequences could be analyzed, in order to hold a kegger celebrating its passage. </TEXT>

But people don't seem to be bothered that Obama ruled this out before even starting health care discussions. And FWIW, I was around in the 90s, I remember. But if the left is afraid to even propose single payer, then we're pretty well stuck. </TEXT>

Try to picture, for even a second, a world in which enough Democrats and Republicans struck a deal that preserved Obamacares foundation and put an end to the health care wars of the last eight years, allowing the political system to move onto other issues once and for all. Is this a world anyone would want for their grandchildren? This is a choice the Freedom Caucus members, Ryan implied, will have to make. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just hard for me to imagine that 2 WH staffers gave Nunes info and he believed he was the first to tell Trump. That would be a special kind of stupid. Instead, I think they told him what to do, and ever the loyal subject he obeyed. I can buy the stupid theory too though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just can't come up with an explanation for what Nunes has done over the last 2 weeks that paints him in a flattering light. The best thing for the country is for the two parties to be as non partisan as possible and have a public hearing into what if anything went on. Nunes and the House Republicans weren't up to the task. I hope the Senate is. Regardless, the FBI will be doing this behind closed doors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do not disagree with you concerning what we know. But there's more to it than that, specifically the contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia. And those could also be nothing, but they've already led to Flynn being fired. Really, if we get details of this   there's no evidence then most people will calm down.

Nunes' behavior this week really looked bad, but the reality could be as simple as the guy being a complete moron   Paul Ryan not being willing to have him step down under pressure.

To a large extent, this was what this whole statement was about: Not pre-judging in either direction and figuring out WTF if anything went on. </TEXT>
