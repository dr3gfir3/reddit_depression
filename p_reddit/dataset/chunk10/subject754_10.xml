	<TEXT> True, it just raises a flag for me. It could be nothing, but it could be that the prior owner added some not-quite-up-to-code circuits. It's just something that I look for. I caught two mis-wired outlets at my house this way. 

Exposed J-boxes or wiring in the garage or attic can also be an indication of how the place was wired. Most of the times it's fine, sometimes it's not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One minor thing that might be a red flag is the screws for the electrical outlet and switch covers. If a homeowner or a rushed contractor put them in, chances are that they just [tightened the screws until they held](http://diedrikbuilders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/worn-out-screws@05x.jpg). A craftsman will align the screws [vertically or horizontally](http://diedrikbuilders.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/job-done@025x.jpg). It's far from a dealbreaker, but it can be an indication of rushed/ unknowledgeable home wiring. Tread especially lightly if some covers have mismatched screws that have been cobbled together </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too had a lacing issue, and I had to send my boots back (and pay for the $30 shipping to do so). The knots holding the base of the laces aren't tied well and can come undone, which can lead to you ripping out the entire lace which you can't re-thread yourself. When that happens, just hope you're not in the backcountry and can limp down the mountain with undone boots. 

The very first time I tightened my second brand new boot after getting a new set mailed to me, a knot came undone and I lost the pullcord handle. Ridiculous. 

Another gripe I have is that the cinches on the sides of the boot come undone all the time. It seems that they've added some protection around them in the newer models, but it's frustrating to have to constantly be re-tightening your boots.

The idea of the boot is great, the execution is terrible in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish I did, but I do have quite a few harpoons for it. My grandfather (born in 1895) owned the rifle, and judging from the rifle's condition I'd be surprised if he didn't hold on to the box for most of the time. Unfortunately in the past 20 years or so since he passed away I haven't found any box or other documentation on it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an almost mint-condition Jarmann M1884 Harpoon rifle. I've got about 15-20 harpoons for it, and it's been in the family for just about its entire life. The serial numbers are stamped on just about every single part, and they all match. 

Only about 30,000 of these rifles were made, and only approximately 1,911 were converted into harpoon rifles.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmann_harpoon_rifle

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jarmann_M1884 

It's a beautiful rifle with a silky smooth action which is also capable of firing the 10.15x61R cartridge (assuming you can find one). 

The blank harpoon rounds I have use a fire-formed .348 Winchester case (again, very hard to find), and are filled with unknown powder and sealed with wax. Manufacture circa 1970. 

I don't have any packaging, but it's in surprisingly good condition for being actively used in the ~1940-1970s and earlier as a harpoon gun to catch seals and other harpoonable sea animals </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My apartment sits right next to the community pool. Once it's summertime and the pool is open and the college kids are out of school it's nonstop drinking, yelling, and splashing until 2am at least a few nights a week. I don't mind much on Fridays or Saturdays because those are nights to cut loose and have a good time, but god help you if you wake me during my precious Tuesday night slumber. 

The problem is that getting up and yelling out the window, while effective, wakes me up even further. I have a hard time sleeping, so all I wanted to do was press a button and have the problem go away. 

So after a bit of research I bought a wireless relay, some nichrome wire, a bit of conduit, and scrounged around for some wires and an old cell phone power supply. Finally, I acquired some bottle rockets. 

After a little bit of building, I now have a 4 shot remote controlled bottle rocket launcher. It's marvelous. 

When people start getting rowdy I just have to groggily reach over for my remote, hit a little button, and a bottle rocket gets launched from my balcony over the pool. The loud noise generally snaps the partiers out of their drunken stupor long enough for them to realize that it's late, they're drunk, and they should quiet down. Either that or my neighbors think that the partiers are setting off fireworks at night and they get up to yell. Being a selfish bastard I don't mind either way, as long as I get my sleep. 

**TL;DR I made a remote controlled bottle rocket launcher for $20 and spare parts so I can get my beauty sleep**

	<TEXT> I agree with your thought of taking a semester or two to see what you like. Once you get into the general classes and start seeing some of what the more advanced classes will hold it will be much easier to see what really interests you. Almost all colleges have general classes for the first year so it's easy to change majors if you find that one class in particular is interesting to you.  

As for consulting, that's exactly what I do. I've designed natural gas pipelines, programmed controllers for 4000+hp compressors, and made entire pumping stations work. I personally love consulting because of the variety of jobs. I'm constantly working on new things which I really enjoy. You're not stuck designing a single button for an F-16 for two years straight like you would in aerospace. So you don't need a petro degree to get into the petroleum side of consulting, although if you take a handful of classes and absolutely love the geology and fluids aspect of it, then by all means go for it. 

If you do choose petroleum engineering just know that you will likely be working in petroleum the rest of your life and it has a very boom/bust cycle. One week you're making ridiculous money with housing and food provided, then the next you're out of a job with literally no other jobs available in the entire industry. Also, get to like either Houston or (if you're in the field) the middle of bumfucknowhere in North Dakota, Montana, South Texas, Bakersfield, or the gulf. North gets you -20F days, and south gets you +120F days.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's similar with Mechanical Engineers. It's extremely easy for a Mech E to get into petroleum, but very hard for a Petro to get into Mechanical Engineering. I'm currently a mechanical engineer doing pipeline and station design, so not quite pure petroleum engineering, but I had two job offers from different oilfield service companies within the week I graduated college. 

What gneiss_k and I are saying is that a petroleum engineering degree is highly specialized in that you can easily get jobs in only one field. Currently most petroleum companies are laying off thousands upon thousands of workers so you may be competing for jobs against people with years of experience once you graduate with zero experience. 

With a more general degree like chemical or mechanical engineering, you can easily change from petroleum to any other field like refinery design, pipeline design, or even pharmaceuticals or aerospace if you find petroleum isn't your thing (or if there are no jobs available as is the case now).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh definitely, I always wear mine while grinding. And I keep mine in an airtight tote box when not in use so it doesn't get particulates on the inside of it while not in use. I have a fairly small shop, so even an hour or two of cleaning metal can get large amounts of dust in the air. 

Hell, I even wear ear protection when using my shop vac to clean up. 30 extra seconds of time to put on PPE can save you years on your life expectancy. Why more people don't realize this is beyond me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really easy to do as long as you're patient and measure twice. Don't rush your cuts and it'll turn out well. I've been using my DIY board for about 4 years now and it's still working great. 

Just look up some youtube videos (there are several good ones), measure twice, measure again, and cut and drill to your heart's content. Super easy and it'll save you mucho dinero over a pre-manufactured board.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Designing and building a trophy truck for the Baja 1000, building a CNC plasma cutter, and building a turbojet engine, etc. all are on my plate at the moment. The first two projects are about 30-50% complete.

Money is a finite resource however, so these projects are moving along more slowly than anticipated. 

I've made a bamboo and carbon fiber bike, a tallbike with arduino controlled shifting, and a large cargo carrying bike, along with several welded art pieces and other random small jobs in the last year and a half though. My friends and I enjoy making ridiculous designs for projects, and every once in awhile a few of them find either personal or external funding. 

Whenever my day job starts getting monotonous I find myself designing something new, so I'm always thinking.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's no way you can shut down a major gas pipeline when many thousands of customers (or more) depend on uninterrupted gas service from that line. If gas flow is interrupted to your house and your pilot lights go out, once the gas is returned you basically have several small gas leaks that could end up blowing up your entire house if not dealt with properly. Multiply this by a city of a hundred thousand and you can see why shutting down a gas main isn't an option. Not to mention power plants, industrial boilers, etc. all need uninterrupted high pressure gas to operate. 

[Hot taps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_tapping), stopples, bypasses, etc. are an everyday occurrence in the gas industry. 

Here's a nifty little video on the basics of how in-service lines are bypassed in the field if you're interested.

	<TEXT> I have an insulated camelbak and pack which has a sleeve for a hydration line, and it'll still freeze up if you're not extremely careful to blow out all the water when you're done sipping. But then again I generally ride backcountry and it can get pretty cold. A zero degree day is still warm for me. 

When I'm riding backcountry I generally just bring a 1.5L Nalgene bottle which is plenty for a day of skinning and snowboarding. The additional volume is nice because it takes longer to freeze, and I can throw it in the center of my pack where I generally stash an extra layer which provides some additional insulation. 

At the resorts though, I don't wear any pack and just drink some water before I head out in the morning. I usually make some tea at lunch as well which helps with hydration.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As long as you're reasonably competent at drilling holes and aligning measurements, making your own splitboard is very easy. If you have access to a drill press and a circular saw then go for it!

Honestly, I was a bit disappointed at how easy making my own splitboard was. I made it over the course of 1 week, and the most time consuming part was waiting for the epoxy to dry on the T-nuts and inside edges. I like a challenge, and this was surprisingly easy. I've had my homebrew splitboard for about 3 years now, and it's carried me to some [intense couloirs and chutes](http://imgur.com/a/AV2b2) without any problems at all. 

Would a manufactured splitboard be nicer than mine? Yes. Would it be 5x the cost of mine? Definitely. 

There are a ton of helpful tutorials on youtube, so before you make your decision watch a few and decide whether or not you think you can build one. If you're confident in your abilities and want to save some money, then definitely make your own. If you've never used a drill press before, then maybe spend the dough to buy a new one. 

In the end, it's up to you. If you have the extra cash for a new splitboard (and shovel, beacon, probe, skins, poles, pack, avy safety course, etc.), then by all means get one. They're nice. But if you're like me 3 years ago, the savings from building my own board allowed me to buy all the safety gear and an avalanche safety course for about the same price as a new splitboard.  </TEXT>
