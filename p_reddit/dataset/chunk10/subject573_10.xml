	<TEXT>  I hold three patents because of the latter. I couldn't tell you exactly what the patent covers, after the lawyers got through describing my invention (and the patent office got through cutting half the claims, because the lawyers tried the most aggressive possible claims). I certainly couldn't tell you whether someone's already invented itthe thorough investigation isn't worth doing unless a lawsuit materializes.

According to the [USPTO](https://www.uspto.gov/patents-getting-started/patent-basics/types-patent-applications/nonprovisional-utility-patent#heading-21), to receive a patent one must have stated a belief of being the original inventor.

Each inventor must sign an oath or declaration that includes certain statements required by law and the USPTO rules, including the statement that he or she believes himself or herself to be the original inventor or an original joint inventor of a claimed invention in the application, and the statement that the application was made or authorized to be made by him or her.

	<TEXT> Thank you for the links. I'll try to go on a tour when I'm in the area.

There seems to be a huge discrepancy in the Daily Beast reporting. About $20,000,000 was reportedly raised by 2011, but the Propublica accounting lists only about $4,700,000 in total assets with only $11,000 in contributions that year. Also, the 2011 email indicates that someone was going to donate $1,000,000. Propublica shows no year where revenue exceeded $600,000 or contributions exceeding $30,000.

Maybe we are looking at the wrong thing? </TEXT>

CoP didn't go into detail about the praise. I'm not sure what it was related to.

And I assume you're referring to donations that went to fund the Diplomatic Reception Rooms?

I don't know what the donations would have been for. I did a search for "Endowment 8th floor", but couldn't find anything.

The Reception Rooms don't use taxpayer dollars but instead rely on donations for their preservation   upkeep.

Interesting. Do you know if the Rooms are open to the public? Do you know where to find the donation accounting and preservation/upkeep expenses? I couldn't find it on that site. </TEXT>

One way to bring down the requirements is to assume less transactions (maybe you convert into a local currency once a month?).

    10,000,000,000 * 250 bytes / 30 days ~= 7.7 Mbps

    10,000,000,000 * 250 bytes / 30 / 144 ~= 579 MB blocks </TEXT>

Can you provide more information on this point? A google search for "Bitcoin 300k unsustainable" didn't seem to return anything relevant. I also don't see anything in the original Bitcoin paper about "300k" or "unsustainable".

If 300k is the theoretical limit, why are we using 1MB right now? If transactions were cut to a third of current traffic, that would further limit the network unless the rate of block production was increased. If 300k blocks came out every minute (on average), we could have a threefold increase in current capacity? </TEXT>

Can you explain in more technical detail? What class of problem is a fully qualified CNF statement?

That is not what the pdf says. If you think it is 1 you have read it wrong.

I think page 2 may contain errors. The subscript labels seem off for one (the first page uses 0-index, the second uses 1-index).

If you compute c0 for `a v b v c v d` by the rules on page 1, you get `0`, then 2^0 = `1`. The choice of 0 vs 1 is arbitrary, so I believe there should be a second understanding.

What do you mean?

It would be 22n-1. You can check his example for the case of n=4. His first clause is a v b v c v d and he gets 215 = 224-1.

I actually think it is `1`. `c0` will evaluate to `0` and then you are left with `2^0 = 1`. `1` in binary is `1`, so you look up the first entry of the appropriate truth table and get that all assignments except `a=false,b=false,c=false,d=false` satisfy the input statement.

	<TEXT>  The example only has 4 variables, yet his result is 1000010000001000.

The result tells you that the 1^st, 6^th, and 13^th entries of a truth table with 4 variables do not satisfy the input statement. All other entries in the truth table are satisfying assignments. You can extract the assignments by treating the index as a binary number and looking at the positions of bits.

The first example they give does not include only full CNF clauses.

They are just using a shorthand notation then.

I'm not sure what that is even supposed to mean.
If there is 1 clause of the form (a_1 v a_2 v ... v a_n) with all variables positive. The input is n bits. 

The size of the problems are `m * n` where `m` is the number of clauses and `n` is the number of variables. In your case, there is only 1 clause, so `m = 1` and the input size is `1 * n`.

Now what is the associated number of that clause?

I believe it would be 0, but I'm not 100% sure at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A 1 means that a particular configuration is not a solution

My understanding of the pdf is that a result of `1` corresponds to an assignment `a=false`.

Where does the ""paper"" say that I mustn't or how to handle redundant statements?

You are referring to the pdf? I think it is in the definition of the problem. Redundant clauses should all be assigned the same subscript labeling.

That is definitely not the SAT problem. I'm not sure what else you could mean.

I think it is the 'SAT problem'. Can you give an alternative definition? The input is a fully qualified CNF statement.

The fact that I can write that derivation down from the top of my head is a very good indicator that it is indeed both.

Not so hard, once you read it.

I'm not sure how that is supposed to not be at least an exponential amount of memory.

The input is O(m*n). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This just tells me that the output of the formula doesn't actually tell me if the SAT is solvable.

Page 2 of the pdf gives the correspondence between the output and the satisfying assignments.

It yields 2n+1-1 if the SAT is not satisfiable. 

Perhaps. I may be off by some number of ones. I haven't calculated it out recently.

It doesn't tell us anything new.

Where was that told to us before?

All he's done [...]

You also have to invert the bits.

Shouldn't the simplified form and the longer form yield the same result? Because they don't.

Why should they? Should you be passing redundant statements?

The important bit here is that in his version every clause has to use all variables.

That is the problem.

No.

Well, your result is not trivial or boring. If it was, I imagine you could have linked or copied the result from some other triviality generator.

It is however impressive that your algorithm is using O(2n) space (and hence time) with n being the number of variables when O(m*log(m)) with m being the number of clauses is easily enough.

I'm not sure which algorithm you're talking about at this point, but I believe my algorithm only requires O(min( m, 2^n )) space. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The formula is not mine. The author apparently claims to have copyright on it, but I don't believe formulae can be copyright.

Now your formula will yield 2^0 =1 - FALSE. But clearly this formula has the solution a=FALSE.

I don't see the problem. You are saying the formula yielded a solution?

Or does your formula say nothing about the solvability directly and only tells me about which configurations solve the problem?

Again, it's not my fomula. I think the formula says a lot of things. It gives a correspondence between CNF and arithmetic. It implies algorithms to solve a large class of problems. I believe the formula yields 2^n when the equivalent satisfiability problem is unsatisfiable.


Or does your formula say nothing about the solvability directly and only tells me about which configurations solve the problem? In that case I present to you (~a) ^ (~a) ^ (~a) which according to your formula yields 20 + 20 + 20 =3 -  FALSE, FALSE

It's not my formula. Your case can be simplified to just `~a`.

Or does your formula only apply to full CNFs without repeats?

Not my formula. I believe the SAT problem only refers to CNFs.

That result is pretty trivial and boring.

I don't know if equations have points. The author may have one.

Again, the paper doesn't say what the equation is intended for.

What paper does? Why is this worth repeating?


It seems to me to show how arithmetic can be related to something like `SAT(v0,...,vn-1|c0,...,cm-1)` . Was this a widely known relationship?

But for it to mean anything, the paper needs to address how this can be applied to whatever general problem it is trying to solve.

May papers only be complete if they address a general problem?

	<TEXT> [Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/24/us/cash-flowed-to-clinton-foundation-as-russians-pressed-for-control-of-uranium-company.html):

As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium Ones chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2.35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. </TEXT>
