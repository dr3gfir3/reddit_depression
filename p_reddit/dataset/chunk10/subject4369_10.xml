	<TEXT> Funny you should ask because for some reason I remember even though I was very young.  

The explosions on the water was a fire boat testing the equipment.  

We spoke to the scuba divers and they were taking a class.  It was really miserable that day and I didn't understand why people would jump into the cold water like that. </TEXT>

 This is very true. Homosexuality is a sin. But so is polyester mixed with cotton. Sleeping with a woman on her period is a sin. So is not paying your employee a good wage.

 We all sin. But that is why Jesus died for us. We cannot judge one another.

Agree or disagree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the people marching have no real understanding of science, let alone a degree in any of the Scientific disciplines.  Even their spokesman, Bill Nye, just has an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering.  No doubt a great accomplishment, but he's not a scientist.  This was a political march.  That's all it was. </TEXT>
