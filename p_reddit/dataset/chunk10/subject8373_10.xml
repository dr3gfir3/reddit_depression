	<TEXT> I currently use my old Tascam DR-60D and send the audio back into the camera via the 3.5mm like /u/I_Pee_In_The_Sh0wer 

Definitely not the most ideal set up, but the redundancy is nice and it works. Using the slate tone makes syncing the two audio tracks simple. Planning on buying the DMW-XLR1 eventually to eliminate some of the bulkiness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone have a cage for their GH5? I'm trying to decide on one. 

I'd like to buy a generic cage, but I'm afraid the XLR-1 adapter won't fit with those. 

It looks like there are only a few GH5 specific cages coming out listed in [this article](http://www.4kshooters.net/2017/03/31/gh5-cages/).

The Smallrig cage looks promising. The price is low for a pre-order right now too.

Anybody have some input?

	<TEXT> Thanks. I think it's a good choice to take on job when I'll need all my gear. My concern for the 450 is when I'm traveling for vacation.

I'm wondering how much of a pain it would be to remove most of the padded dividers to make room for other things like clothes and food. I only really need to take the body and another lens or two. How is the bag as far as bulkiness? I can't really tell the difference in pictures between the 450 and the 350. </TEXT>

Seems like everyone loves their Lowepro bag, which is why I'm leaning towards the Protactic.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Suggestions on camera backpack for gigs and travel </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-04 23:52:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been researching camera backpacks and am having a hard time finding the right one. One bag to do both would be great, but that may be asking too much. Upgrading from the Amazonbasics backpack.

Fully loaded for gigs, I'll probably be packing the following:

- GH5
- 2 medium size primes
- 1 large and 1 small zoom lens
- Tascam DR-60D (Eventually the Panasonic DMW-XLR1)
- Shotgun mic
- XLR cable
- Wireless lav system
- Small LED light
- Batteries and other small accessories

For traveling, I'm looking to fit the camera body and maybe two lenses with space to spare for clothes, snacks, etc. Quick access to the camera from the side or top of the backpack would be great. 

Here are two bags I've been looking at:

[Lowepro Protactic 450 AW](http://store.lowepro.com/protactic-450-aw)

[Incase DSLR Pro Pack](https://www.incase.com/shop/bags/incase-dslr-backpack-pro-pack-for-camera/)

For traveling only: [Pacsafe Camsafe v17](http://www.pacsafe.com/camsafe-v17-anti-theft-camerabackpack.html)

Does anyone have some experience with these bags? Any input would be great.

	<TEXT> Same here. First time on M43. I've decided to get the Panasonic 12-35mm 2.8 I, not II. Apparently the difference between Dual IS 1 and 2 is not noticeable for video. For photo, it makes a bigger difference.

	<TEXT> Oh wow, I'm going to read about it right now. So Dual IS 2 will work with the older lens with a firmware update? I thought Panasonic had come out saying that they weren't going to be able to update it? 

Edit: Sorry, read your comment wrong. So in-body stabilization only was just as good as well as in-body+optical stabilization? I read through the article and it looked like they only tested the in-body and electronic stabilization, not optical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking about getting a cheaper adapter to use my EF-S glass just to learn the camera since I'm not decided yet on what route I want to go. I feel you though on not wanting to deal with the complications of using an adapter. I think I'm going to buy the 12-35 2.8 regardless of what else I buy. Seems like a great lens for almost everything. 

I love reading everybody's different reasoning for making the decisions they did. I'm pretty addicted to it actually haha  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, I may have linked the wrong article. The only thing I noticed in that one was that it says "EF-S: No under the speed booster section. But this (https://suggestionofmotion.com/blog/canon-efs-vs-apsc/) says EF-S is not compatible with the speed booster.

"For example, Metabones EF Speed Booster (used with the Panasonic GH4, Sony a7S, Sony FS7, etc.) is only compatible with the standard EF mount, not the EF-S mount. This means that Canon own crop sensor lenses are not compatible with the Speed Booster, while third-party crop sensor lenses are compatible because they use the standard EF mount."

Also here: https://m.dpreview.com/articles/5547568336/metabones-speed-booster-ultra-for-micro-four-thirds 

"The adapter will be available in Nikon F-mount and Canon EF-mount versions (meaning that Canon EF-S lenses can't be mounted, but third-party APS-C EF mount lenses can)."

So those have me thinking that my EF-S lenses won't work. That leaves me with the Canon 50mm 1.8 and Rokinon fisheye. Ive been meaning to replace the 50mm anyway, so that really only leaves me with the fisheye to use on the speed booster.

But, your point about the Sigma lens is good. It seems like a lot of people love the combo. I'm having a hard time deciding between that and going native with the Panasonic 12-35mm 2.8  and a fast prime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have a good point about that. I'm currently working full time in an office, but have recently been picking up a lot of gigs on the side. I do value using tools that simply work, and not having to fiddle with little things. 

For low light, do you think getting the fast Panasonic lenses will do? Such as these?

https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/986097-REG/panasonic_h_h020ak_lumix_20mm_f1_7_ii_asph.html

Or should I spend a bit more to get the Voigtlander 25mm f0.95 for when I catch myself in low-light situations? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have considered it. The Voigtlander 25mm f0.95 is on my list for low-light scenarios. I find myself in those situations pretty often for events. A fast zoom for those types of situations would be pretty helpful, which is why I was thinking about the 18-35 f1.8 Sigma + Speedbooster. But, after reading, it looks like it's pretty heavy and you'll need it on a rig or a tripod to get usable video. Maybe that's not the case though. 

Right now, I think I may be leaning towards buying the Panasonic 12-35 ii for now. 

What "quirks" are there with the speedbooster? Things like AF not working or what?

	<TEXT> Autofocus isn't extremely important. I mainly use manual focus while filming. 

So you're saying the Sigma 18-35 1.8 with a speed booster? I know that lens is made for APS-C size sensors. I've also read that Canon EF-S (APS-C) aren't compatible with the speedbooster [here](https://suggestionofmotion.com/blog/panasonic-gh4-lens-options-canon-ef/).

I have a Canon 50mm 1.8 (old version) with what feels like sand in the focus ring. I bought like that super cheap from a friend.

Canon 28mm 2.8 pancake lens

Canon 18-200mm 3.5-5.6

Rokinon 8mm 3.5 fisheye for skateboarding

They're not that bad, but they're all crop sensor lenses and I've been wanting something more professional and higher quality.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help me pick lenses for a GH5 ($3k budget) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-25 00:31:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just preordered the GH5 and now I'm looking at lenses. I'm coming from a Canon 60D and I have basically all APS-C lenses, so I'm planning on building a whole new kit.

I'm using the GH5 mainly for video. Going to be using it for promotional, corporate, event, documentary and action sports.

Budget: $3000

I can't decide if I want to get native lenses or Metabones Ultra and Canon mounted glass.
One lens I know I want is the Panasonic 12-35 f2.8 II. Was thinking about getting the earlier version, but I really want to take advantage of the Dual IS the GH5 offers.

If I went native, I was thinking of buying the Panasonic 12-35 f2.8 II, 35-100 f2.8 I or II (Don't know if I'll need Dual IS since I probably wont' use this lens handheld much), and the Voigtlander 25mm f0.95.

If I go with the Speedbooster, what lenses should I get that will cover a good amount of focal lengths? I want to invest in good, fast glass, so I know this route limits me to only 1 or 2 lenses considering my budget. I figured the extra stop of light from the speedbooster will help me out with the event gigs, so that's making me really consider going this route.

What should I do? </TEXT>

Edit: I've partially decided. For now, I'm picking up a used Panasonic 12-35mm f/2.8 I. I read that for video, Dual IS I isn't much different than Dual IS II. I'm going to try out some Canon FD lenses, specifically the 50mm f/1.4 S.S.C. and the 28mm f/2.8 S.C. I'm holding onto my money for bit before I invest in a prime like the Voigtlander 25mm f/0.95 and a longer range zoom. I want to play around with these lenses and learn the camera before spend a lot more. I may put that money instead towards a rig, the DMW-XLR1 or maybe even the Zhiyun Crane. I'm not sure yet. </TEXT>
