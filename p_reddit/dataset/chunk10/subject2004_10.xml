	<TEXT> If you live in Dallas don't bother going to any of the places here they all suck. Source: I was raised in Nova Scotia. Honestly if you make your own fries, get some McCormick gravy packets and fry up about 4 slices of bacon you'll be in good shape. Try to find cheese curds, if you can't, use mozarella balls which are almost everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The longer you're with a woman, the more you pick her apart in my opinion. I don't care who it is. Maybe she has bad skin, fucked up hair in the morning, little bags under the eyes, vagina stubble, anything. You'll find reasons to be like "I should try something new". It's male nature!
