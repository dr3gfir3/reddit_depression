	<TEXT> If humankind could have shed off the belief of the supernatural to explain natural phenomena, perhaps we could have ended up in a better state.

We tried that during the French Revolution and various experiments with communism, and it turned into a murderous bloodbath. The Crusades and the Inquisition were perpetrated by papists, not true Christians. We know this because the Protestant Reformation put an end to the Dark Age and freedom of religion, press, conscience, became possible after America was founded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The type of people willing to engineer WW3 are not necessarily solely motivated by profits. The most dangerous are in fact religious zealots. 

Neocons are merely playing their part in a Jesuit agenda. [Jesuits aka the Illuminati.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Weishaupt)  

Jesuits are in fact loyal papists with a long track record of instigating wars since their inception. They see themselves as a military order. Perhaps that's why Hitler modeled the SS after them. Do yourself a huge favor and look into it.

	<TEXT> As we speak, Trump is being co-opted by the same neoconservative types who had foreknowledge of the 9-11 plot and allowed it to happen so that we could live in a police state under mass surveillance and be in a perpetual state of war against enemies we literally created. 

Why would you put it past these people to launch a false flag EMP strike? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're needlessly grasping at straws. Very serious people talk seriously about this threat being real. And when somebody like Woolsey talks about an EMP as an imminent threat, you have to consider the possibility of a false flag EMP blamed on the North Koreans to justify WW3. Kindly take your head out of the sand and face reality for the sake of your loved ones.
