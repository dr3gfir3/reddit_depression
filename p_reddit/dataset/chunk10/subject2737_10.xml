	<TEXT> When Harry Potter was big and someone went around telling everyone Dumbledore died, people were literally crying, it kills the adventure cause you know whats going to happen. 

If you check the Game of Thrones Reddit, it's very strict on not letting people spoil stuff, I think all post have to say of they contain spoilers or not.

What about if you go to read The Wasp Factory and you find out the main character is really a "...." the entire time, it would have killed it for the reader.

Or when I read Flowers for Algernon, I didn't know what it was about, but if I read the synopsis or looked anything up, it would have spoiled what was going to happen, and the regression wouldn't have been as impact if I knew it was coming.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'll spoil it for yourself. 

This isn't even slightly a joke, I was interested in seeing what Frank Herbert had to say about Dune and watched an interview, and it wasn't even to Frank Herbert's part yet and the host told what the whole series was about, and it just ruined what was coming after book 1.

Also I looked up something about Old Man and the Sea while I was taking a break reading it, and someone's review gave away the ending I'm their first sentence. 

I was on Reddit and someone gave awww the ending to Gone Girl in their title post lol. 

Last one doesn't really come, but is still true, so have you had anything ruined by just looking up something about what you want to read? Do you have book LPTs? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't if it's because I saw the movie first or what not, but I felt it was just ok. I don't know if there's something I'm missing, but it was enjoyable, just not this superb masterful work which I was going in expecting. I feel that he's like Hemingway with kinda short to the point stuff, which I suppose is a good thing, but McCarty being one of the top American authors right now, I think I was wanting...a bit more. Though it could just be The Road, I've got All The Pretty Horses on my shelf that I'll read sometime soon and then Blood Meridian when I get a chance to pick it up. 

But it reminds me of The Old Man and The Sea, another Pulitzer prize winner, and another book I went into with high hopes, and another book I felt kinda let down after. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand what makes either masterpieces. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked how they built the guy up to be this big mythical creature and turns out he's and old withering dying dude.

I feel that it was important for the story to show that even legends can die and I think it parallels with the story, because the story gets you all pumped and then when you meet him there's almost a small disappointment, just like the main character felt. 

Also I enjoy how book shows how someone can just completely lose themselves and take a back seat from the real world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes books can really put your life into perspective.

For example, The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum, though based on true events it's still a fictional book. But after reading that and reading what that poor little girl weren't through, I stopped and told myself "I can never complain again in my life" because no matter what happens, I will never have had to go through what that child went through. It also made me realize though I may not be perfect, at least I'm not a monster, the way some people can just fall in line and do those things, no thank you. It helped me gain a new respect for the person I am. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Naaaa just go for it, the second Stephen king book I read was The Stand: uncut edition, and that's the longest book he's written, IT is the second longest. Just take it one page at a time, don't get discouraged because it'll take a long time, but just remember, you're reading the equivalent of like 3 books. In fact I think in The Stand there are books 1,2,3 lol. 

Or do like I did, read War and Peace (which is amazing btw) and then just realize pretty much everything else is smaller than that ^^ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get the ending, but I didn't like it. The story isn't about the house, it's about that lady becoming obsessed with the house, she became "haunted" by it, hence The Haunting of Hill House, so she didn't want to leave, she was in love, enthralled, ravaged by it, so the other people who are just like, "hey it's a creepy house and you're crazy now lady" are able to just take in what's happening, the girl was the weak one of the bunch, the easily influenced, so the house took her, and when she was almost to get freedom, she gave it away for love. How many love stories have ended with a character giving everything for lost love?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just finished The Wasp Factory, I get it, but I don't know how to explain it, spoilers </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So first of all, wtf with this damn book, I mean seriously wtf did I just read. 

Ok so my thoughts, if I'm able to find a way to put this into words. I feel that the story represents a misspent youth and Frank is trying to imitate Eric to some extent. With the animal mutilations, his rituals, his worshipping of the wasp factory itself and it's predictions, the connection he wishes to share with Eric and his hatred of women to find out later he's the thing he hated the most and everything he did was for nothing. I feel that there is an undertone to the story that it's never too late to change even if you're forced into that change. Eric was forced into the change with the maggots in the baby's brains, the father was forced into a change when Frank was a girl and he wanted him to be a boy and when Paul was just dropped off from the mother, and Frank was changed when he found out that he is really a girl. So I think all through story, all of the terrible things that happen are all symbolism for the bad that needs to be let go before you can grow into the person that you really are. Maybe it's also a telling of letting nature take its natural course for example with the wasp factory and the wasps deciding their own deaths. But it also might be about your inner subconscious taking over because there were moments when Frank had clarity and knew certain situations were wrong.

Please, anyone who has suffered through this book, what's your take? </TEXT>

The Exorcist did not scare me at all and The Haunting of Hill House was beyond a let down. I haven't read Heart Shaped Box yet.

The two books that have actually made me feel uneasy though were American Psycho and The Girl Next Door.

Also just for good measure, the book Psycho by Robert Bloch was pretty unsettling and cemented Norman Bates as my favorite bad guy ever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nothing to write home about, it was very easy to get through and not really any deeper meaning besides what happens. I don't know if I even think it was well written but it was enjoyable. It was my first romp though a werewolf book and it does a good job of explaining everything from both sides of humans and werewolves. 

If you get a chance maybe check it out, only about 200 pages, goes quickly and is fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I had put off reading The Exorcist because quite frankly, I was scared to read it. I was getting myself all pumped and yesterday I decided to read through the book. So I started and it moved very quickly and was enjoyable but I was never scared, even at like 2am even while I was reading and all the creepy stuff was happening, I just never felt scared. I was hoping to be terrified, I was yearning for chills down my spine, but nope, nothing. I was told by many people that this book was supposed to be one of the scariest ones out there, so now I'm in a lull because I'm afraid I won't find something to make me...afraid. 

I'm thinking about picking up Legion though because I'd like to see where the author took the story. </TEXT>
