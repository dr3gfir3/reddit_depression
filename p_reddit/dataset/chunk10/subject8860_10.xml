	<TEXT> Lately I've had to invest any money I would normally spend on Sci fi  and dark fantasy novels on school textbooks and supplementary reading. The libraries in my city are garbage if you don't want young adult novels or stuff thats older than the hills. If you want to order anything, it takes 6-8 weeks to arrive.

I'm kinda at my wits end. What comprehension skills i have are almost entirely due to the volume of stuff i used to read, and everytime I would come home with a new book and a new video game I would read the book first. I almost wish I didn't read so much so that I wouldn't be so picky/discerning now.

How do you guys cost save when buying books?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know what? I'm gonna be controversial here. It is a much better deck.

Its faster on average, plays more disruption/ more varied disruption, plays protection in addition, plays less "dead" cards, and actually kills the opponent upon assembling the combo. also it has a plan b that actually works some amount of the time, and a sideboard plan to dodge hate.  

This isn't actually a glowing recommendation of breakfast, so much that its a harsh commendation of sneak and show. That deck is a freaking pile of crap if its worse than this in this many ways.

That being said, the reason breakfast is in my flair is because all the other decks I played/was building got splashed by the top ban, and none of them were miracles. I was tuning this in the interim while I traded/ bought the stuff for Painter, burn, and Ug post, while i was maybe thinking about giving miracles another chance. 

They banned top, hitting everything I had cards for directly or indirectly, and leaving alone this and death and taxes, and ive mentioned before on here that my local meta has very few good taxes matchups.

If D T becomes good again ill play that, when i finish getting the pieces for burn ill move to that for a while. Right now, of the available decks to me, this deck is giving me positive results so this is the one i'm playing.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have not tested it yet, but I've been thinking about it. the thing that puts me off is that every time someone else tested it circa 2-4 years ago, they concluded that shuko opens you up to losing in ways that are actually just unacceptable.

That said, and this is going to sound weird, +1/+0 equip 0 is an enormous deal. Its not even corner case, there are just a pile of situations in which having that power boost would make my opponent have to care way more about my random dorks.

The questions to be answered there are going to be:  
- How often will this be a miserable topdeck vs how often will this be a topdeck that kills them.  

-Do I have room for this card, because right now the cuts for this are Mom, shaman en-kor, SOFAI, or a daze. 

- This thing requires 2 creatures in play, illusionist and a seperate shuko target. This makes removal live in a way that it wasn't before,
and may make this card a nonstarter.

Its on my shortlist for testing though.  

Stuff that I just need an excuse to put in the board as a 1 of: Magus of the moon, leovold/notion thief, Outrider en-kor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> your list is landstill. I'm not putting standstill in landstill, I'm putting it in tezzerator to cast off of mox diamond and a land, hence the second question.

I want to try it in a vial combo deck, hence the first question.

I have no idea where either of you got landstill out of what I said outside of making incorrect assumptions about what I wanted the answer for instead of actually answering the question.

i need to know how the fish is caught here, so i know if i even want fish instead of jerky or something. Stop handing me fish. If i wanted a fish, I'd get it from the guy who discovered the fish.
Locally, that means that if i want a landstill list i would ask the guy who top 8ed jersey with landstill.         </TEXT>

	<TEXT> heyy i was going to try something like this in modern!

This has been a budget option for legacy players for years. The problem has always been that black does not provide options for card selection nor effecient options to dodge or fight most hate.

If i was to play this, my sideboard would transition into full on pox. Your enemy is still disruption + clock, smallpox is good against those things, but you need to supplement a bit. Being a combo deck both ways opens you up to overlapping hate.

I'd go - leyline/helm - hymn and start by testing  + 3-4 sinkhole, + spheres + skelatal scying/ read the bones/ some monoblack x life for x cards thing.

Caveat - If you haven't played what you've drawn up, do that first before taking my suggestions.

The best thing you can do to get better with a stompy deck is to learn what other decks are doing at what stages of the game. this will allow you to sequence your lock pieces to maximum effect.

	<TEXT> True. Even so heres a rundown on some gotchas:

-Aluren is a symmetrical effect. You can also cast creatures for free!

 -Food chain is a mana ability, you cannot shut it off with needle, though you can name it just fine.

- Once you say "okay" to your opponents vial activation, its too late, the man/woman is in play and taxing you.

- for the love of god, don't use removal on infects guys on their combat if you can help it. If you can, mainphase that stuff or cast it on their end step.

- Standstill retriggers everytime a spell is cast. So yeah be careful.

- Dredge is a replacement effect, its really hard to interact with. I don't think it even uses the stack.

thats all for now, just the stuff i thought of off the top of my head. It would be cool to compile all these nuggets in one place and sort them by category, but thats... a lot of work.

	<TEXT> on azami vs hapless resercher: researcher could easily be better, but azami protecting you at the end is more and more of a relevant thing. Does that outweigh azami costing 5 freaking mana? idk. Needs testing.

I made this build to ensure Mentor had support. After this, I'm never playing Mentor over true name again. Was way too unreliable as a kill card. i would play it, it would stick, and it would just beat for 2 a turn, 3 sometimes. I strongly suspect the problem with mentor in this shell is it rewards proactive spell casting, and this list has not nearly enough of that.

On stoneforge: They're going back in and they're staying there unless something weird happens. having a plan b is way too good in way too many situations, and honestly the creatures are very resillient against other creatures. Also you have a ton of incedental guys.

On the amount of mana: This is going to blow your mind, but if it wasnt for color considerations and to a lesser extent the current  sideboard plan, I'd look hard at cutting another land. Yeah. I didn't believe it either, I kept telling myself it couldnt be correct, but honestly, With a vial in play your lands are entirely irrelevant outside of casting cantrips and activating stoneforge.   Without a vial, you still only have to cast maybe 6  mana worth of spells over the course of an average game, with that number going up the longer your deck feeds you garbage. Your combo only costs you three mana. 3 for recruiter if something goes wrong with a piece, 1 for a cantrip, its not much at all.

	<TEXT> round 1 vs burn loss 1-2.   
game 1 I didn't force vortex because i'm an idiot and it beat me.  
game 2 He tapped out for double rift bolt on turn 3 and just died to my combo.   
game 3 We both drew like garbage but i also played like garbage.   

round 2 vs UB reanimator win 2-1 (this one went to turns!)  
Game one: I  resolved a Vial through a pregame Chancellor reveal. He cast Careful study into Lotus petal- Reanimate on Chancellor, I had the combo in hand but had to wait a turn. He had Thoughtseize for my other half, so i just Vialed in creatures and started the race. I lost because i let him hit me one too many times with chancellor and forgot he could dome me for 2 with brutality like the idiot i am.  

game two: He went dread of night into needle, so i recruited lab man and beat down with blue 1/1s and that guy  while holding countermagic+ surgical.    

game 3 was weird, involving celephid beatdown from me and a mull into awkward 1 lander from him. I eventually counter all his reanimators on the crucial turn, followed by an attack for lethal. He had entomb  on his turn one, but i Surgicaled his grislebrand then therapied his brainstorm leaving him with a bunch of dead stuff.      

round 3 vs death/taxes win 2-0  
game 1:  

my turn 1 :fetch for tundra, vial.   
his turn 1 : cavern, mom.  
my turn 2: vial nomad, play cavern on wizard, cast illusionist, kill you.  

game 2 was bizarre, I cant give full details. the board state at the end was:  

Me: Vial on three, combo in play, recruiter in play, Labman and Disenchant in hand, tundra island untapped,    plains tapped.  

Him:  Thalia in play with a Jitte(2  counters) and a sword of war/peace equipped, three vials and no cards in hand.   he also just had a Stoneforge come in off the vial, so he could Jitte equip swing. He was tapped out, but had 4  plains 1 port. Jitte has 2 counters.

It is his end step. How did i win this game?  
We will come back to that mess.  

round 4: vs MUD loss 1-2.  

Honestly I was tired here, but here is what i remember:  

game one: We had some back and forth, my opponent had a chalice which was invalidated by vial except in two ways that only came up because I drew the one of dread return and the game one configuration of the deck couldn't cast it naturally, which if I'd realized so earlier I could have just spent 2 turns drawing up to 8 cards so I could discard it, as I had dealt with the first bit of pressure. Whatever, happens, play better/ build better.  

game 2 I disenchanted his chalice on end step, then cast the other half of my combo and killed him.  

game three: I don't remember except  that his hate was multiple torpor orb, and a chalice. i was stuck with 1 drops and recruiters in hand, and then he dropped platinum angel and beat me up with it.  

overall 2-2 in matches. I accomplished what i wanted, which was to test mentor over true-name in the board and practice playing the combo through hate.  

Shout out to the poor guy who came from the next town over to play only to find out from hearing me talk to my first round burn opponent what he thought of the banning that top got banned. If you want to test to see what you want to play, there's cheap beer and cheaper pizza across the street here and I'm buying.  

Props to  the lgs giving that guy a refund, it was the decent thing to do.    
 
The Breakfast Tax Dodge/ Solution to the above d t match puzzle:  

Go to my turn, Disenchant the Jitte on upkeep while paying for Thalia. Combo off, putting library into yard. Vial in lab man, go to draw step, win game.  

Getting to this line required some thinking ahead, as I needed to recruit for lab man the turn prior. I don't always play like garbage.    

list at  http://manadeprived.com/showdown-recap-march-5th-legacy/.  
- 2 stoneforge, 1 jitte, 1 SOFI, 2 mother of runes, 1 shaman en kor, 1 scrubland.  
+ 3 probe,  3 swords, 1 recruiter, 1 tundra.  

The sideboard changes per event. This time:  
1 swords, 3 mentor, 1 underground sea, 2 unearth, 2 disenchant, 1 daze, don't remember the rest(probably wasn't good)

	<TEXT> the mana in ub is way worse though. grixis has 16-17 souces of blue mana and 14 sources of black, and whatever red sources vary (I have 11-12.)

UB has 13 blue sources and 12 black sources. good luck casting double color spells, tell me how that goes.

keep in mind, grixis usually doesn't even try, and also lowers sol land emphasis.

its possible that there is a ub build that cuts some signets/ talismans for mox diamonds, and maybe plays some future walker    that is good and doesn't stress the mana as much as jace, but casting that card in  UB is usually a pipe dream.

Infect is probably the deck you want to run for that "tempo feel" if you can't splurge on real duals, control and combo are hard and would require some not-really-recommended brewing.

	<TEXT> For leyline, its not the 4 cmc, its the double black. 16 black sources is not even close to enough in a wasteland format, and even the karsten methodology calls for 18 sources of black for that.

Dareeti is way better than dack with thopter sword. also dack's +1 is really the only reason you would even want it, and its just not very good. 
One of my biggest problems with dack is that on an empty board, it doesn't put any pressure on the opponent or defend you at all. Ive lost a lot of games because my opponent has just let me resolve dack and then ignored it for  3-4 turns. There is just no mode on that thing that puts you up cards without more help than  just sword can give you.

I think that if you decide to run dack, yeah go ahead and run coating. you'll need it or something similar just to make dack worth a card.

I would cut all dacks for daretti's, move all forces to the board, play another diamond, main padeem, cut a thopter foundry, and then start thinking about putting 1 ofs in your deck that your opponent can't usually afford to let resolve/stick.

The list posted has 28 sources of mana, then 6 cards that don't do anything on their own,  and then you also start 2 for 1ing yourself with force of will? Then dack is card disadvantage and jace is difficult to cast.

And then you want more blanks in leyline of the void? Uh uh. No thanks. As is your opponent is just going to let you resolve  half of whatever 2 card synergy you try to set up, then counter/ break up the other half, leaving you with dead cards.

Lastly, twenty blue cards for force is pretty deceptive here right? Most of the spells worth protecting are blue, so you have to calculate with 3 cards for force when you use it offensively, which i haven't done the math on but seems so unlikely here that it wouldn't be worth it.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, it seems like most people don't understand how much the mana matters here, so here goes. 

First, leyline of the void is highly unlikely to be cast, so take the suggestion to play it with a grain of salt. 

Compounding this, this deck cannot support both leyline and force, you then start to cave to hard countermagic. A single force of will backed by a clock will kill you.

On top of this, you cannot play dead cards in a deck that has 28 mana sources and low impact stuff like sword of the meek. Get liquidmetal coating out of there.

As a result of coating being gone, dack fayden is now the worst card in the deck, so cut that entirely.

Add more daretti, that card is the best in the deck not close. 

If you want to know what 75 I'm playing this weekend, ill send you a list. 

The thing you have to remember about grixis
Tezz deck construction is that half your deck doesn't do anything most times, so each card has to be worth a LOT. Otherwise your control and midrange opponents will just counter your first key spell and you cave. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did, on account of this not being the first time something like this has happened with crystal commerce. It wasn't on this scale, but it definitely has happened before.

As for the main question, I was thinking more locally than buy/sell on obv unreliable tcg, but I guess the answer is more or less the same either way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the thing that people who look at the reserved list statements to find ways around them are missing a crucial fact: It doesn't actually matter what they said in their promise anymore. 

As soon as they said "Spirit of the reserved list," nothing factual mattered anymore. Now if it feels like it gets around the "agreement," it's not happening.         </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tried guys, I really did. 
After playing a bunch of fighters that did not appeal to me at all, I discovered Blazbue when Calamity trigger came out.
 I followed along with the story, picking up each game for that. I picked up a ps2 copy of Guilty Gear: Accent core r  at the same time as Continuum shift,
and then tried going into the mechanics of the game when I stopped being able to beat the comp in story mode. I got most of my friends up from "button masher" to the point where they can Dragon punch, hodoken, and dash when they wanted to most of the time, even the ones who didn't play video games that often. For the ones who did, I ran them through all the basic systems involved. None of us could remember all the things all the time, but we all knew a couple of ways to at least try to get out of bad situations.

Here's the thing though: the ability to think fast enough to  solve problems presented at this speed is either the sole province of supermen or the result of way more practice than I can responsibly put in, and I am pretty certain the former is a myth.

So I am out, maybe I'll try again later, but demands on my time are getting heavier as of late. I could be convinced to get back on the horse if 2 hours of practice a week is going to cut it, but I strongly suspect it is not.

If anyone having trouble with basic execution has questions though, I did teach a bunch of complete casuals how to stop a lazy approach with Sol badguys sick "fire wall shoryouken " variant, so yeah.

Btw, taking someone from " I only play clash of clans, and sometimes Civ5" to "I just spent my previous evening curb-stomping my boyfriend with Noel vermillion"  in less than 8 hours over 3 weeks is immensely satisfying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolute law is  without bolt or lands in your meta. if we're comparing to absolute law, then absolute grace is a better consideration if the meta shifts, which it has. 

Unless you're saying absolute law is also not playable, you've just convinced me to try this out when I would believe that the meta I'm preparing for mostly doesn't play red.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay infect is a bust, but rw painter can find this with tutor and its creature dodges -1 -1 effects anyways.

Really though, This is a question about this card more generally than this. My question is more " does this card meet the general standard of playability for the format, and if so what kind of deck would want it" than does "this fit into existing archetypes that are also tier one."

I'm starting to feel that to get people to even care enough to talk I have to mention a "real deck" instead of the deck i actually want to talk about.

	<TEXT> Do you guys think this card could be good in the board in meta's that lean BUG? I'm thinking more about in splash white infect, or RW painter or other combo decks that need guys to kill more than in taxes, but taxes might use it too.

	<TEXT> Then I Just have to say I strongly disagree with you and move on I guess, because  to say interaction doesn't matter as a blanket statement  is factually incorrect on a completely fundamental level that contradicts all reasonable game design.

For god sakes, almost every conceivable definition of "Game" in the Merriam-Webster dictionary strongly implies interactivity, and almost every example of usage of that word involves some amount of interactivity.  </TEXT>
