	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Personally, I got into them in the winter of 8th grade on 12/21/14. I remembered seeing a tweet from Dan Avidan from Game Grumps the year prior talking about a Rush fandom holiday. I decided to dig out my dad's 2112 CD and was instantly hooked. I probably listened to that thing almost 100 times!

Then I listened to Signals and Subdivisions connected with me like nothing ever before had. I felt comfort in the fuckfest that was my life. This album solidified my love of Rush.

Then I got tickets to R40 the day of my final show with the Michigan Honor's Choir. My dad showed me Witch Hunt on the way home and we extended our drive home by taking backroads so we could bond more over Rush, specifically Subdivisions.

Another major bonding event was my family's road trip to Florida in which my dad and I spent a large chunk of the driving listening to Rush. I'll never forget when he first played Manhattan Project for me. Or when we stayed up at night after I ate some bad food and watched Rush In Rio.

2 years in and I'm still just as hooked. Because of Rush I've minimized suicidal tendencies, become a bass player (I can play YYZ too!), become mod of this wonderful community (one of my proudest achievements), and abandoned my old life that had hurt me more by the day. Without them I don't know where I'd be, but I know it'd be worse.

So thank you, Rush, for helping me through the hardest part of life so far.

And thank you, Rush fans. You're the family that accepted me with all my flaws when I needed it most and are probably the greatest and loveliest fan base ever.

Cheers! 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly agree. There was the one guy who had every Rush ad ever and it's like, I've come across some that I snag, if I see a Rush record I'll most likely buy it, but what the hell do you do to afford/have time for that?! I mean there was the one awesome girl who runs Rushcon that worked for the president, and she I can understand, but most of the other guys. Like the one who offhandedly mentioned how he saw 30 shows on the Clockwork Angels tour. How do you afford that?! That's still at least $1800 for only bare minimum tickets with no fees and excluding travel. What the hell?! I'm totally not jealous or anything... </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-01 23:14:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think definitely Snakes And Arrows Live for its variety, production, and crowd noises. It sounds really good and has my favorite versions of many songs.

On the other hand, A Show Of Hands is really cool and has a rad extended version of Closer To The Heart. Maybe it isn't as good as the versions on some bootlegs that I know (Philly show from Counterparts tour) but it's definitely great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This song is badass and almost reminds me of Muse. And by that I mean it sounds like Neil heard something by Muse and said "I like it, let's play with it" and that isn't bad! The dissonance is used as a key feature in the song and it works. The clashing notes sound just as melodic as any other song.

In my eyes they perfected the Vapor Trails sound here. And those bass runs from the end of the live version before they play one of their "faves" are sublime.

	<TEXT> I *love* this episode. May be one of my all time favorites of BM. I'd like to just ask a couple things.

1. Did anybody else know vaguely what was going to happen once the Bioshock reference was made? Deceit from higher authority is a common theme among the series and that just made it click that it was still fake.

2. Did anybody else get MASSIVE Resident Evil vibes from the mansion?

3. Did the end remind anybody else of the end to Jacob's Ladder? </TEXT>
