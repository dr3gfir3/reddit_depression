	<TITLE> I'm celebrating my birthday alone. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> When I was in 1st grade, I had a birthday party for my entire class to come to. Nobody came. I was alone for my birthday then. At a skating rink we rented out. My mom and dad were there and held me when I was crying. It was my worst birthday ever. 

I'm turning 21 Thursday. I've been so excited about it for months, because I finally get to do things with my friends like go to casinos and drink downtown on the weekends. 
Well, everything has fallen apart this week. My best friend is moving in with another friend so they're both busy. Another one is out of town for work. Another one is stuck at work until 10 pm that night. 
I have work the next day so I can't wait for them to get off work and celebrate. 
I'm celebrating my most important birthday alone. All I've ever done is put my friends first. I always planned things for their birthdays. Made sure they were never alone. 
Only to be left alone for mine. I don't even matter. 
I don't live in the same state as my parents because I'm in college and live in that city. 
I feel so pathetic. 
It's my worst birthday since 1st grade.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple things I guess. 

Probably the top was when my friends were seniors in college and I was a sophomore. One of our friends had graduated a year early, but he still hung around us a lot. Anyway, it was a Thursday night and we were all planning on going downtown. We were pregaming in their dorm room. 
Note: the friend that graduated early and I had been hooking up since my freshman year. 
So we were on a friends bed with a blanket on our laps. I guess he was feeling horny because he moved my hand to his dick under the covers. Which got me going. 
He left to "go to the bathroom" and I left shortly after him to do the same. 
We met in the hall bathrooms/showers and hooked up in one of the showers. It was super hot. Especially considering there were people in there. 

Another time, me and the same guy were mad at one of the friends. So we hooked up in his bed while he was in the other room.
