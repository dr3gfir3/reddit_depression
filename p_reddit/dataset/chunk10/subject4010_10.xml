	<TEXT> I get what you mean, having the story only focus on one assassin in one time period would be awesome and perhaps what they should've done in the first place. I'll agree with you that the future setting in the recent games has been relatively shit. But I still enjoyed it.

What I meant by the series not making any sense without the modern setting was that the story of the games wouldn't make sense without it. They're all about finding this or that piece of Eden to save everyone some bullshit. Without the modern era it would just be us finding a piece of eden for no real reason, why bother showing us this story if there's no point in it?

That being said the modern era story in the movie was a little weird sometimes and they probably could have made the story more intriguing and mysterious if they had a limited amount of story in this era. Like the first game did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It being terribly handled is one thing, it being necessary is another. Sure it would be cool to play assassins in this or that era but it wouldn't make any sense at all they way they have done it this far if they did that. There wouldn't be any point to even have a game in that era without the modern day because the entire reason for us players even playing through it is because we need to save the future. REGARDLESS IF YOU LIKE IT OR NOT, that is the way the games are set up, that is the whole ordeal with Assassin's Creed and the concept that the developers came up with. If you don't like that then too bad, guess this franchise isn't for you people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. The entire series wouldn't make shit sense if the modern day wasn't there. Feels like a lot of people don't get that. Only reason for going into the past is to prevent something from happening in the future. Just because the modern day era hasn't been presented well doesn't mean it should not exist at all. Tbh I just wish they fix the modern day era and get a new protagonist in both the modern and ancient era so we can just finish this series on a high note... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well from what I understand HL3 has always been in some sort of development but just never branching out. Many people at Valve have tried to develop it, they draw concept art, develop ideas for the story, work on other projects like the source 2 engine. Then people leave that dev group to work on something else like a new IP, an new engine, Virtual Reality, etc. It's not just new hats for TF2, it's a whole company with a ton of property making money and they're constantly working on something. At the moment they're currently working on a new and old IP(I'm not completely sure though, said to be both multiplayer and singleplayer.), integrating source 2 into their games(Dota2) and making billions of money of the big three, CS:GO, Dota2 and Team Fortress 2. I really hope HL3 will be released some day, and I hope that we may see some easter eggs for it when they eventually come out with a new game. But I wouldn't think much of it because they're probably never going to :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the problem is that one person wanting to work on it isn't enough. There has to be a whole group of people joining in to work on it. The way Valve works is very different from other game companies, they have way more freedom when it comes to development. If someone don't want to work on something they just hop on over to another team/project. That's why HL3 has been in dev hell for almost a decade, because there haven't been a group effort or anyone wanting to make it. New people won't fix that problem. </TEXT>

Fortunately I had backed up the save files in case of this happening and replaced the current empty files with the backed up ones. After that the game just won't load at all. Help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the vents wouldn't have opened if Rory left the lab with the flamethrower, only reason they did was because the tip of the flamethrower got close to one of the sensors. Maybe he stayed because Calvin could easier find a way out of the lab due to his small size? Maybe he thought that if he let Calvin eat him and get bigger, he would be too big to escape from the lab?..
Tbh I can't find a good reason why Rory stayed :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish they could make movies like this where the characters aren't always making such idiotic decisions. I'm not saying all of them we're idiots but just one scene that did not make any sense to me. [When Rory(RR) goes in to save Hugh from Calvin, he gets attacked and manages to get Calvin off him. Why didn't he just leave the room when he had the flamethrower ready and Calvin at the opposite side of the room? Or better yet, WHY LOOK FOR IT WHEN HE'S OUT OF FUEL? Sure there was a couple of scenes where the characters fucked up but this one was just a bad, stupid, shitty way to continue the plot..](#spoiler) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. The way I understood it was that basically the bad guys don't have any power over them when they cross the border, their jurisdiction ends because it's not their country anymore. Also because the people at Eden we're waiting for them which could probably stop them from getting the kids. Most likely a mix of the two though.

2. They didn't. They only put the claws in. In the scene from the nurses phone we only see them put the claws in at the arms and feet. Not a whole body laminated with the stuff cause like you said, she wouldn't be able to grow.

3. Maybe, but I highly doubt they would have any with them and Logan's wounds seemed too terminal for it to save him in time, plus even when he was on the stuff earlier it didn't seem like it helped THAT much. </TEXT>

Only way I know what file is taking up 16 gig of space is because if I copy the disk and paste it somewhere else  I get access denied.
