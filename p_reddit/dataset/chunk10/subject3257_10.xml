	<TEXT> The worst symptom of a condition to hear about is malaise. It's the seemingly uncaused feeling of general uneasiness or just feeling unwell. And on top of everything, a ton of serious medical conditions cause it. Including cancer... That is awful for a hypochondriac. I wish I never even knew </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds awful haha. I went into a patch of I guess chiggers, I'm totally unfamiliar with them but all my friends said that's what they were. Bumps all over the top of my feet and ankles, and scratching them just once made them bleed. I went to the ER over that one.. itchy red bumps on skin are a total no go for me  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Severe hypochondriac over here. I've got lots

If I stumble onto a patch of grass that causes bugs to bite me up, I spend a lot time looking into it. I take pictures of bites to post online and to get feedback I don't have some serious skin condition surfacing. I know it's just bug bites but I have to hear it over and over.

I had heart palpitations once at 18. I spent a year visiting doctors and insisting on more tests. I'm still really in debt over that.

Things go and come off and on. For a few months I'm sure I have a heart condition, in summers it's a serious skin condition. One really common thing is brain cancer. If I forget something like someone's name, or a task I was sure I wouldn't forget. Or if I just slip mentally and screw up a normal task, my mind always goes to brain cancer/tumor. I know that's stupid bit its just always the first thing it jumps to. "I messed that up, that doesn't make sense because I totally should have known this. Maybe a tumor is growing into the part of my brain that stores that knowledge?"

It's really dumb and prevents me from doing a lot of things. Like people have offered for me to go on summer vacation trips with them and I think "that's too far from a good hospital. What if something happens to me? I'll die." so I wont travel places too far from major hospitals or hospitals that I'm familiar with </TEXT>
