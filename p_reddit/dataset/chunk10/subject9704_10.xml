	<TEXT> Here is an article asking if Bush's US attorney purge was unprecedented:

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/so-is-this-us-attorney-purge-unprecedented-or-not/ 

Last night, Fox News' Brit Hume kicked off his show by criticizing the media for "news stories reporting that the Bush administration had considered firing all 93 U.S. attorneys across the country [that] failed to mention that that is exactly what Bill Clinton did soon after taking office back in 1993." 

This argument has been making its way around the conservative echo chamber. Wrote Brent Baker: "The broadcast network evening newscasts, which didn't care in 1993 about the Clinton administration's decision to ask for the resignations of all 93 U.S. attorneys, went apoplectic Tuesday night in leading with the 'controversy,' fed by the media, over the Bush administration for replacing eight U.S. attorneys in late 2006." 

In light of all this, I thought it was important to compare the two cases.

The Washington Post laid it out like this: "Although Bush and President Bill Clinton each dismissed nearly all U.S. attorneys upon taking office, legal experts and former prosecutors say the firing of a large number of prosecutors in the middle of a term appears to be unprecedented and threatens the independence of prosecutors." 

Former acting attorney general Stuart Gerson, meanwhile, wrote that it "is customary for a President to replace U.S. Attorneys at the beginning of a term. Ronald Reagan replaced every sitting U.S. Attorney when he appointed his first Attorney General. President Clinton, acting through me as Acting AG, did the same thing, even with few permanent candidates in mind." (Hat tip on this and the Post piece to TPM.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bahara was part of the bulk resignation action though, he was only fired because he refused to resign. Yates was fired for not acting on the EO, whether or not the EO was unconstitutional. Hind Sight allows for the connection an an investigation to be drawn now. I think it is hard to separate the months of Russia this and collusion that but it is revisionist history to claim yates was fired for any reason beyond refusing to follow through on the President's EO (whether it is constitutional or not), you may think it was not a justified firing but it is the reason she was fired.

I know we are going in circles here but for fun here is another take on the Russia investigation if you are interested.

	<TEXT> It wasn't a convenient excuse, she was a hold out from the previous admin who was a placeholder waiting for Sessions. She then refused to act on his EO. Only now that it makes for a nice story are people claiming she was fired for investigating Trump.

He also ask for the resignation of 46 US Attorney's around the country, were they all investigating him?

It's only a distinct trend when you focus on three people. Is there confirmation that Bahara was investigating Trump? Can you link?

	<TEXT> Are you claiming he fired Yates and Bharara because they were investigating him? The Yates firing was part of her highly publicized refusal to follow through on an EO and Bharara was part of a mass firing of DA's that was not totally uncommon.

Without context, you're right it looks like he is firing people 'investigating' him but in context it is a totally weak argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So that's what's left to hang on to for the Russian conspiracy theorists. 

Why did the President wait until General Flynns false assurances to the Vice President and others become public before removing him from his post, Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, which is pursuing its own investigation into Trump-Russia ties, said in a statement.

After the Senate Judiciary subcommittees hearing ended, Trump said in one of a series of tweets that Yates had given the media nothing but old news. He went on to say, The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?

Why did he wait? Who knows, but when this is the nitpicking this investigation is coming to then who cares. I am going to agree with the President on this one this is old news, which this media outlet is running with.  </TEXT>

The idea that Hillary Clinton is going to join any kind of #RESISTANCE shows what kind of establishment marketing scheme this shit is.  Resist by supporting non Republicans or non Democrats, resist by insisting that the corporate parties have taken our country down the wrong path.

If you are standing next to Hillary Clinton and claiming resistance it better be because she is in handcuffs and you are an FBI Agent.  </TEXT>

At least if the government isn't forcing people to purchase insurance and artificially limiting where and how they could sell it we would see more competition and flexibility.

	<TEXT> Yes, and right now so much of that power is in the hands of insurance companies which our government has had no problem with supporting. If I got to choose what the situation was I would want to see people having a direct financial relationship with their doctor and insurance for major incidents. Having public corps handle healthcare is not good because their primary responsibility is to Share holders not doctors and not patients. 

For this conversation the power we are giving the government is only supporting insurance corps not people or the HC industry.  </TEXT>

All the more reason not to give them more and more power. </TEXT>

Sort of un-related but Dr. Umar Johnson talks about schools categorizing kids as special needs who really aren't, primarily young black boys, because they get extra funding.

	<TEXT> Trump has undone some of Obama's ethics rules but has instituted a five-year ban on former government officials lobbying their former colleagues. Trump is facing similar challenges to those Obama encountered in attempting to change Washington's culture, including congressional inaction on key lobbying laws.

There has been so much focus on Trump lately we have lost focus on a rallying cry of both the President and Bernie during the campaign, we have corrupt representatives. 

People like Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, etc. are completely OK with the level of corruption and how they have been able to personally enrich themselves on our behalf.  </TEXT>

Stop calling people names like 'libtard' you are braving the wilds of Reddit and exposing some seriously shillary, but I am willing to bet you turn a lot of people off to reading your comment by adding the useless insult. 

Your whole comment, read in aggregate is one big 'fuck you' to these people, so let it be subtle and you will be able to engage more people who are otherwise shut out by being called names.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey sorry for the delayed response...

In the end I thin the Hysteria is over hyped, but I respect your opinion and I am glad we got to have this 'chat'

I wanted to make a point about the Green energy movement and my perspective on it. Focusing specifically on Solar;

I am a big fan of Solar Energy but it has nothing to do with the environment or climate change. I support Solar because it is a huge step towards the democratization of energy. The more we can create energy independence for the homestead, the more liberty we can achieve. I find this argument to be way more persuasive than any moral environmental argument. 

Imagine each American home utilizing it's local resources to generate energy, it is a beautiful thought. 

Well anyway, thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. You clearly understand the naysaying, probably better than I do. I have a couple of follow up questions. 

What do you think about the ice core data that showed CO2 rise following temperature rise? This is explained by the ocean releasing more and more CO2 as temperatures rise. 

Second, do you think we have the capability to generate enough energy through green energy tech to replace fossil fuels? Is there a projection for when we will? As an aside, how come so many people who advocate the catastrophic climate change theory are against nuclear power?

One counterpoint I want to make is that people can respect and use science and still reject the climate change hysteria. I think this movement to support 'science' as one big idea is getting to close to religion for me. I see way too many people who are just saying 'science' as an excuse or explanation and it is framing tactic to try to imply people who doubt the CC hysteria reject science wholesale and that isn't true. Also implying everyone who does this is in the pocket of big oil is disingenuous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you talk about paying the current cost how do you mean? We see Green energy rocketing into the future wether big oil companies want it to or not. So what cost beyond energy generation should we pay?

As far as large scale societal movement goes, it is traditionally on an individual level but large numbers of individuals are driven to the change. Trying to change things top down often times gets messy and allows for this win power to control the change. Unfortunately if you're right about our future this will only happen when people habitats become inhabitable. 

I am skeptical of the predictions. I have read from both sides and one of the major sticking points I see is the traditional movement of CO2 upwards being to follow temperature movement upwards. There are other common data points like the correlation of sun spots to temperature, which can be mapped similarly to the modern maps we see of CO2 and temperature. Also the declining temperature between 1940 and 1980 while carbon emissions rose significantly, let alone all of the past temperature fluctuation when humans were not emitting CO2 at the scale we currently are. 

I can appreciate the theory and I appreciate you taking the time to lay out your perspective on it but I am currently undecided between it is not happening and if it is, then it is. The world changes and if it changes because of our progress we need to decide which is more important, I am going to side with progress. 

I also believe in human ingenuity so if the sea level rises to a point of major land changes then I couldn't think of a species I'd rather have to deal with it.  </TEXT>
