	<TEXT> Comey was leading an investigation into whether Trump's campaign colluded with Russian attempts to interfere in the election. He also appeared unduly critical of Clinton's email practices in an announcement during the election, and announced that they were "re-opening the investigation" four days before the election when emails (that turned out to be irrelevant) were discovered on Anthony Weiner's computer. This was widely believed to have swung the election to trump,  but he may have been given too much blame for the second issue, since it wasn't him who leaked that info.

If Comey was fired to disrupt the investigation that is very, very bad. </TEXT>

Prostitution is legal: Some prostitutes are victims of gangs / pimps. The others are living a rather normal life though, albeit with an unusal job.

 The second option seems to be preferable. 

... if the number of prostitutes are the same. If you trust the data in OP, there are *more prostitutes who are the victims of gangs and pimps* when prostitution is legal. I don't think many would agree that allowing for non-victimizing prostitution is worthwhile if it results in more victimizing prostitution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not necessarily. The study was performed on fit men under highly controlled conditions. The subjects also reported significantly increased appetite; these results do not suggest whether salt intake would be more (or less) sustainable than simple caloric restriction. 

What they do make clear (if I am reading them correctly)  is that salt intake does not significantly affect water intake or urination, so salt restriction when trying to make weight for competition is probably counterproductive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [NYT article: Why Everything We Know About Salt May Be Wrong](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/health/salt-health-effects.html)

 The salt equation taught to doctors for more than 200 years is not hard to understand.

The body relies on this essential mineral for a variety of functions, including blood pressure and the transmission of nerve impulses. Sodium levels in the blood must be carefully maintained.

If you eat a lot of salt  sodium chloride  you will become thirsty and drink water, diluting your blood enough to maintain the proper concentration of sodium. Ultimately you will excrete much of the excess salt and water in urine.

The theory is intuitive and simple. And it may be completely wrong.

**New studies of Russian cosmonauts, held in isolation to simulate space travel, show that eating more salt made them less thirsty but somehow hungrier. Subsequent experiments found that mice burned more calories when they got more salt, eating 25 percent more just to maintain their weight.**

[JCI paper one: High salt intake reprioritizes osmolyte and energy metabolism for body fluid conservation](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88532#SEC3) 

 Natriuretic regulation of extracellular fluid volume homeostasis includes suppression of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, pressure natriuresis, and reduced renal nerve activity, actions that concomitantly increase urinary Na+ excretion and lead to increased urine volume. The resulting natriuresis-driven diuretic water loss is assumed to control the extracellular volume. Here, we have demonstrated that urine concentration, and therefore regulation of water conservation, is an important control system for urine formation and extracellular volume homeostasis in mice and humans across various levels of salt intake. We observed that the renal concentration mechanism couples natriuresis with correspondent renal water reabsorption, limits natriuretic osmotic diuresis, and results in concurrent extracellular volume conservation and concentration of salt excreted into urine. This water-conserving mechanism of dietary salt excretion relies on urea transporterdriven urea recycling by the kidneys and on urea production by liver and skeletal muscle. **The energy-intense nature of hepatic and extrahepatic urea osmolyte production for renal water conservation requires reprioritization of energy and substrate metabolism in liver and skeletal muscle, resulting in hepatic ketogenesis and glucocorticoid-driven muscle catabolism, which are prevented by increasing food intake.** This natriuretic-ureotelic, water-conserving principle relies on metabolism-driven extracellular volume control and is regulated by concerted liver, muscle, and renal actions.

[JCI paper 2: Increased salt consumption induces body water conservation and decreases fluid intake](https://www.jci.org/articles/view/88530)
 A 6-g/d increase in salt intake increased urine osmolyte excretion, but reduced free-water clearance, indicating endogenous free water accrual by urine concentration. The resulting endogenous water surplus reduced fluid intake at the 12-g/d salt intake level. Across all 3 levels of salt intake, half-weekly and weekly rhythmical mineralocorticoid release promoted free water reabsorption via the renal concentration mechanism. Mineralocorticoid-coupled increases in free water reabsorption were counterbalanced by rhythmical glucocorticoid release, with excretion of endogenous osmolyte and water surplus by relative urine dilution. A 6-g/d increase in salt intake decreased the level of rhythmical mineralocorticoid release and elevated rhythmical glucocorticoid release. The projected effect of salt-driven hormone rhythm modulation corresponded well with the measured decrease in water intake and an increase in urine volume with surplus osmolyte excretion.

Humans regulate osmolyte and water balance by rhythmical mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid release, endogenous accrual of surplus body water, and precise surplus excretion. </TEXT>

 like what the fuck do you want us to do, seriously? You can't claim to be an ally if you're going to say we can't use the methods that help us, just because of a minor inconvenience to you. You don't have learning difficulties, you can get the fuck over it and leave us to do the things we need to get on with our lives.

I think they were pretty clear - use a fidgeting tool that isn't unnecessarily distracting to other students. Saying people ought to "get the fuck over it and leave you to do the things you need to get on with your lives" simply because they don't have a (diagnosed) developmental disorder is an awfully rude thing to say, to somebody who was frankly quite understanding and is ADHD themselves.

Education in classroom and lecture hall environment is already extremely challenging and requires cooperation from everybody, including people who aren't neurotypical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for an LGA-2011 or LGA-2011v3 platform to upgrade my gaming computer to a hybrid gaming/science workstation. There are two setups on local Craigslist:


Component | PC 1| PC 2
---|---|---
CPU | Core i7-3930k at 4.5GHz | Core i7-4930K at 4.2Ghz 
Motherboard | ASUS Rampage Gene IV x79 | ASUS P9X79 LE
Cooling |  Corsair h100 GT | Corsair H110
RAM | 4x4GB | 8x8GB DDR3-1866Mhz
PSU | XFX XTR-750 | Silverstone Strider 1200W
Case | Corsair ATX case | Corsair Carbide Air 540
GPU | GTX 780 Gaming 3G | No GPU
SSD | No SSD | Samsung 840 Evo 120GB
Asking | $950 CAD | $1100 CAD

I'm more interested in the second system since I can make use of the SSD and huge amounts of RAM and I don't really need GPU (I'll be using crossfire R9 285s,) but that asking price seems steep. What would be a fair offer? How about System #1?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is it because the convection from the oven dries the food out more than the microwave radiation does?

This is a big part of it. Microwaves heat most of the food evenly (assuming even distribution of moisture and fat,) and food in a microwave is typically covered to prevent mess, which also tends to prevent liquid from escaping. Because the container and the air in the microwave aren't heated, the moisture will evaporate, then condense on the container or the surface of your food.

Ovens expose the outside of food to high heat for long periods of time, which (by design) cooks the outside of the food more thoroughly than the inside, and the hot air whisks away moisture from the food's surface, leaving a crispy, tasty texture without drying out the inside of your meal.  </TEXT>

I tried to make comparisons between Witcher 3 and Fo4 on the collective reaction was that I was mentally slow and should just kill myself idk _()_/

I really don't understand why Witcher fans are so damn defensive. I mean, yeah, The Witcher 3 was one of the most critically and commercially successful games of the decade, but yes, please tell us more about how we are wrong for liking Dragon Age.

	<TEXT>  I had a rottweiler mixed with god knows what years ago. I know that breeds obviously have differences in behavior and physiology or whatever, but aren't they all just as close to their ancestors as each other?

Purebreds are often highly inbred, which obviously causes problems and puts them at significantly higher risk of genetic defects and other inherited diseases.

Aside from that, since selective breeding occurs outside of natural evolution, a lot of pure breeds have health issues related to the traits they are bred for - for example, bulldogs [frequently have breathing issues and have trouble mating or giving birth due to their stocky frames.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/although-purebred-dogs-can-be-best-in-show-are-they-worst-in-health/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But, like - do these people think that if this bill passes, they'll just move on and people won't be talking about health care anymore?

This bill won't pass the senate, though.  It will bounce back and forth between the houses for a long time, and eventually either dropped or revised into something workable and passed.

The point of tabling this bill now and passing it through the house is to get a good news cycle and look like they are doing their jobs.  </TEXT>

 3) Think the bill is bad policy, but think the electoral effects of not passing it are still worse than passing it.

A little of #2 and a lot of #3. The bill (in it's current form) will not pass the Senate, but if it passes the House, the Republicans will have (what appears to be) a badly-needed legislative success. They can workshop the bill into something passable later. </TEXT>

All those pathetically eager freaks who thought they could buy Winning and Greatness for three bucks a hit. But their loss and failure is ours too. What Trump took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... a generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers, who never understood the essential mystic fallacy of the Trump Culture: the desperate assumption that somebody... or at least some force - had a fucking clue what they were doing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are confusing support for unauthorized **immigrants** with unauthorized **immigration.** Support for stronger boarder controls and immigration reform are popular - these would ideally decrease the amount of illegal immigration (and make legal immigration easier.) But support for immigration reform and boarder controls does not mean support for deporting unauthorized immigrants.

[Undocumented immegrants make up 3.5% of the US population and 5% of the US workforce, and a majority of the undocumented immigrant population has lived in the United States for over ten years.](http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/03/5-facts-about-illegal-immigration-in-the-u-s/)

Deporting 11.1 million people would be **hugely** disruptive and, frankly, cruel. We're talking about separating people from their families (including possibly their children, who would have citizenship by birthright if they were born in the US,) their employers and/or employees, their, friends, their landlords or their mortgages, etc. Why? Essentially out vindictiveness - [undocumented immigrants have a net positive impact on both the economy and government finances.](http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/203984-illegal-immigrants-benefit-the-us-economy) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I genuinely do not understand the huge fear of increasing the minimum wage. I certainly see immediate drawbacks, but I don't understand why minimum wage doesn't increase to reflect inflation. 

There isn't a huge fear of increasing the minimum wage. However, beyond certain point an increased minimum wage will cause job or business losses that outweigh the benefits of increased pay for low-wage workers. In particular, it is thought that raising the minimum wage to $15 presents a serious risk to the low-income and low-cost-of-living regions of the United States (source is in the drama.) 

Also, a majority of economists think that subsidies such as an expanded [earned income tax credit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earned_income_tax_credit) would be more effective than a high medium wage, since they would not depress the market for unskilled work and can be need-based (the EITC is currently much larger for those with children.) However, some folks on the left dislike this idea because they see it as the government covering for Evil Large Corporations who underpay their workers, and many folks on the right are uncomfortable with blatant wealth redistribution.  </TEXT>
