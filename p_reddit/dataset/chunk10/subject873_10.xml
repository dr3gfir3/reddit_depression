	<TEXT> this is a great illustration of film making vs. "like-mining." while the first video is a well-crafted piece of storytelling, the ripoff version was clearly made to just get likes on youtube. the thing is, the person who made the original video has a clear understanding of film making and film language and will be able to continue to make successful videos with creative ideas behind the stories and artistic choices. the person who ripped it off, clearly has no idea how to make a film and will not be able to make another without ripping someone else off. it seems easy to just rip off a video but without understanding film language you just end up with a piece of shit. </TEXT>
