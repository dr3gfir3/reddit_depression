	<TEXT> UPDATE 3: Updates   Mini VENT: Moved Out, Mental Health Triggers, Jobs/Money, ETC.

This is an update from my other posts. Titles of Previous Posts Below:
Original: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT. 

Update 1 UPDATE: 24 1/2 Years Old Female: No job living with parents in squatters' condition   depressed VENT. 

Update 2 Vent Post: Process of Looking for Apartments/Moving Out, Fear, Doubts, Setbacks, "Good Faith Deposits," Intuition vs. Paranoia 

Quick Updates 
- I moved out a month ago   I'm under a 6 month lease. 
- Unemployed/Jobless but taking it easy/trying to work on myself. - Started a business a little under a month ago but no sales.

Mini VENT 
After a terrible year living in Squatters conditions. I moved out and have my place with some roommates (not friends). My life has improved   I am grateful. That aside I am still not all there yet. I am realizing that I suffered from a traumatic personal experience. Some of my reactions: 
- I am afraid to go out (though I do leave the house occasionally at least 1 or 2 times a week). Get anxiety/overthink. 
- I am funny around bathrooms, toilet humor, looking at toilets, and hearing about others bowel movements. I am also sometimes disgusted   ashamed of myself when I have to use the bathroom. * that was hard to write.*
 - Realized that I have a hard time living in the present/enjoying the present. For all that year before I moved out. I had to detach myself to cope; so it's hard for me to break that habit. Naturally when I am upset, I detach, brood, and retreat. But for that year I detached even more for my survival not only just because I was upset/natural for me. - hard for me to control my thinking. Someone says something to me   my mind races and I think of bad things.
For all these reasons I am still not ready to commit to a job. Which I hate. I ashamed not to have a job or be working because I know I am judged about that and seen as lazy/etc. I don't want to enable my fears but at the same time I don't want to ignore them either. If I get a job before I am emotionally ready. I am afraid I will get fired because I won't be giving it my all   and frankly I am simply not all there yet.
At this point I really want to work from home; but I don't think I have the expertise to do that. Anyone have any suggestions on how I can find a part time work from home job? I live in a big city, so finding a job won't be too hard. I am also college educated.
Lastly I started an at home/product based business almost a month ago. I don't have any sales but this is something that I always wanted to do (owning a business/being an entrepreneur). It's a small simple business, nothing massive. It's more like a side hustle than a business (for now ;). I want to be independent, work for myself, and be in charge of my own career. I don't want to join the rat race or be owned by the MAN (whatever that means). BTW I know right now that I need a job and probably need a job for the next 5-15 years. This is more for my future.
Details I have savings, so I am not broke. I can pay for the whole amount of my lease terms and my basic expenses (food, utilities, phone). I am disciplined and good with money. I just want a job because I don't feel comfortable relying on my savings alone. I also want to save even more money, so I want more active revenue coming in.

Lastly I hope this doesn't come across as me being ungrateful or me portraying myself as a victim/troll. I am not. I am struggling but I am also trying to self improve. I'm on here because I need more perspectives and other people's advice. Idk why but doing this really helps. I tried journaling a couple of months back but it was all just this big shame/negative thinking/trigger fest. Conversation/Venting Online to others really helps me :)
Questions How can I cope   deal with my triggers/anxiety? How can I find work from home/freelance jobs in the meantime?

Thank you </TEXT>

Mini VENT
After a terrible year living in Squatters conditions. I moved out and have my place with some roommates (not friends). My life has improved   I am grateful. That aside I am still not all there yet. I am realizing that I suffered from a traumatic personal experience.

- I am afraid to go out (though I do leave the house occasionally at least 1 or 2 times a week). Get anxiety.
- I am funny around bathrooms, toilet humor, looking at toilets, and hearing about others bowel movements. I am also sometimes disgusted   ashamed of myself when I have to use the bathroom.
* that was hard to write.*
- Realized that I have a hard time living in the present/enjoying the present. For all that year before I moved out. I had to detach myself to cope; so it's hard for me to break that habit. Naturally when I am upset, I detach, brood, and retreat. But for that year I detached even more for my survival not only just because I was upset/natural for me.
- hard for me to control my thinking. Someone says something to me   my mind races and I think of bad things.

For all these reasons I am still not ready to commit to a job. Which I hate. I ashamed not to have a job or be working because I know I am judged about that and seen as lazy/etc. I don't want to enable my fears but at the same time I don't want to ignore them either. If I get a job before I am emotionally ready. I am afraid I will get fired because I won't be giving it my all   and frankly I am simply not all there yet.
