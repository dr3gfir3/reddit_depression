	<TEXT> [Here](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/column-psychology-behind-clowns-creep-us/) is a column by one of the authors of the McAndrew and Koehnke (2016) article "On the nature of creepiness" discussing the psychology behind why clowns creep us out.

He notes that

 The results are consistent with the hypothesis that being creeped out is an evolved adaptive emotional response to ambiguity about the presence of threat that enables us to maintain vigilance during times of uncertainty.

Essentially, clowns may disrupt some heuristic we have for how things are supposed to be.

He further notes that:

 This is perfectly consistent with my hypothesis that it is the inherent ambiguity surrounding clowns that make them creepy. They seem to be happy, but are they really? And theyre mischievous, which puts people constantly on guard. People interacting with a clown during one of his routines never know if they are about to get a pie in the face or be the victim of some other humiliating prank. The highly unusual physical characteristics of the clown (the wig, the big red nose, the makeup, the odd clothing) only magnify the uncertainty of what the clown might do next.

The article lists factors for creepiness (correlations in parentheses)- you can see that a lot of them can apply to clowns.

	<TEXT> Hi there,

The peer-reviewed title for the first post is almost identical to the post title, and describes the finding of the research, so it is fine:

Meltzer, A. L. (2017). Wives with masculine husbands report increased marital satisfaction near peak fertility. *Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences*, *11*(2), 161-172. doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ebs0000083 

As for the second one, it slipped through and has since been removed. If you see anything (posts and comments) that you feel violates the sub rules, please report them so the mods can review it. 

As for this research, the paper can be found [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886917303094). The NYMag title is considered clickbait because it doesn't tell the reader which Big 5 trait predicts domestic nudity - you have to "click" to learn which trait is it. The other problem is that the title focuses on the sexiest findings of the research, instead of describing the research fully (see the Highlights part in the abstract). The researchers explored Big Five associations with a large range of everyday behavioral acts as can be seen [here](http://pixel.nymag.com/imgs/daily/science/2017/05/04/04-big-five-personality.jpg). The abstract concludes that "findings may help ground trait scores in emblematic acts, and enrich understanding of mundane or common behavioral signatures of the Big Five" which is really the key takeaway.
