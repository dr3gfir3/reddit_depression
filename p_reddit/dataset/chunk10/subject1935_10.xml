	<TEXT> I know it's hard, but I'd stick with the manual for your test. Anyone can drive an automatic. That's what is great about them. But you never know in the future where you will be put in a position to drive a strangers car and that car could be manual. Especially in Ireland.

A lot of commenting seem to have a 'Real men drive manual' attitude and you can ignore that. The very real issue is that if you learn to drive auto, your license will only cover auto. It also means that you can't drive other peoples cars, if you would need to (especially in an emergency), and you will be limited in future car purchases.

And remember any new car is going to feel like driving a cloud, compared to any older car you've been practising, regardless of transmission.

EDIT: Tip on gears. No need to look. If you pop the gear stick out of position it will rest in the center between 3rd and 4th. Use this. When driving, changing from first to second is easy. Just left and down. To move to third, move the gear stick pops out of gear and rests between third and fourth. Then just push up to move to third. Straight down to fourth. For fifth let it pop to center again, then right and up for fifth. 

Going down gears? From fifth, pop to center, down for four. Pop to center, down and left for second. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only the first game in the Penumbra series offered combat. They removed it for the second and third instalments because when you gave a player a way to fight they did. Combat was suppose to be last resort.

I think the early Silent Hill games did this well. You were forced into combat a lot, but you quickly learned that running was the best way to play the game in most cases.

Even in SH4, a game that gets a lot of bad press as a Silent Hill game (Critics may have been more favourable if it was spin off, as originally intended and not in the main series) you are given guns, but because you are an average joe and not trained, they are pretty useless except as a last resort in close combat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I don't get the criticism of copy paste dungeons. I mean they did look the same, but that was a design and narrative decision, not a lazy decision. The dungeons look the same because they are the internals of the Divine Beasts, all built with the same purpose and technology. Same with the shrines. It would be a design mistake to make them look aesthetically different, just for some faux idea of variety.

It's like complaining that all the locations in Alien Isolation look like spaceships. No shit, they are all spaceships. We have come a long way since games would have a Ice Level, a dinosaur level, an Egypt Level and a Grass Level. If I'm suddenly fighting mummies I want to know the reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well people aren't going to want to buy a second hand game if it is crap. If you love a game you may keep it, but most people I imagine play a game and move on to the next one. If they are not buying it on the first month, they will pick up a digitally identical cheaper copy, where none of the sale price goes to the publisher/developer.

If this was actually a thing, the only games left would be multiplayer games and procedurally generated games like Civ, Minecraft and Binding of Issac. No one will pay full price for a story based game like Bioshock or The Last of Us when they can get it cheaper from someone who has played it and finished it.

Would you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion they had a strong enough story. The first twist was fine. The second twist just sort of cheapened things.

Like imagine a movie where it turns out a character we saw die on screen turns out to be alive after all. That's fine. Then another dead character pops out of nowhere and says 'Hey I didn't really die either, surprise'. One or the other would be fine in my opinion.. Not both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think consumers need to know that everything they purchase will not be a gold star purchase. They have tools like consumer reviews right on the page, professional reviews, curators, You Plays and refunds at their finger tips. Generally it is easier now to inform yourself about a game than it ever was before, and to return it. All the consumer benefits Steam can grant to consumers still doesn't negate Caveat Emptor. I can't remember the last time you could get a no questions asked refund on a PC game since CD and DVD burning tech became common. </TEXT>

Right, but also both Steam and Minecraft are doing really well, so they probably really don't care. Also I wonder if Minecraft would have lost any of its 1billion dollar price tag, if Microsoft had to share it sales with Steam? Impossible to tell.

Seriously though, if Valve really cared to have Minecraft, they would have seen the early success and set up some meetings and tried working a deal with Notch. The development of MC has been really open, so it is probably safe to say this never happened. So Notch didn't chase Steam and Valve didn't chase Minecraft. Both are doing really well for themselves so I doubt either care too much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look closely at most games the choices aren't as impactful as you think. For instance if you save Denton's brother in Deus Ex, you get a vid comm message from him but he pretty much disappears for the rest of the game. In Life is Strange your options mean different dialogue in later sequences (same as Telltale) but not much changes. There are characters who die, but the story plays out the same.

If by impactful choices you mean you get more dialogue, then yeah those games have it. If by impactful choices you mean that the story works and moves forward around your decisions, then no. No one is likely ever to make a game where your character says 'Forget about the galaxy, if the world ends, I want to do what I love.' and then the rest of the game is you setting up a boutique fashion store or running your farm. </TEXT>

It's not a big deal. Most games give an illusion of choice. As long as you feel like your choices are making a difference, you shouldn't notice. It is unreasonable for a developer to make 100 different games because you don't like one of the characters they wrote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't played DA but I have played ME, KOTOR and Jade Kingdom. In those games choices are very superficial but give a great illusion of choice. They add a second line of dialogue which will be delivered flirty, angry or whatever emotion the other character is suppose to feel for you. If you do something to piss off someone, you are more likely to get the content cut, rather than have any true impact on the story. Or alternatively you get a very similar story branch with very similar characters. </TEXT>

It might have worked if there wasn't a slew of unfinished housing developments around the country. They also failed by thinking that the only type of housing people would want is in estates with no amenities requiring you to drive everywhere. This would never work because public transport is still shit compared to other cities in Europe, the roads aren't cycle friendly and despite worsening traffic, it is harder than it has ever been to get a license (which is a good thing for different reasons). Our city planning is till based on the needs of the eighties, early nineties. Shure why would anyone want to walk anywhere if they can drive? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Schafer nailed it in his pitch for Double Fine Adventure. The audience for Point and Click games has been very consistent, since his days at LucasArts. The big issue is that the whole audience for games expanded and PnC games became niche. 

When the genre tried to grow with the rest of the market, they kinda set a new baseline for a professional point and click game. Decent voice acting became a must for anything people were going to drop a twenty spot on. The return on these games weren't worth the investment for most studios. Then Telltale came along with shorter games that led into bigger 'seasons'. And they could re-use assets to push quick releases.

This also meant the player only focused on two, maybe three puzzles at a time. Compare that to Monkey Island where you had a whole island to complete three tasks in any order. Each had their own chain of puzzles to solve and had some overlap. Sometimes you would be forced to solve a puzzle to get an item that you didn't even know you needed. By contrast the Broken Sword series (with the exception of the first game) gave you the choice to navigate a room or two with a central puzzle to solve, so you were always working towards one goal.

The games evolved more into the second style of game, where you had a simple goal and a limited space to complete the objective in. </TEXT>

 Now, playing it safe would have had Han and Leia married with Luke mentoring the Jedi Academy. Instead, Han and Leia are separated, Luke failed to bring back the Jedi at the hands of his own newphew, and then they killed off Han Solo - arguably the most beloved SW character. It was hardly playing it safe.

	<TEXT> People need to realize that monopoly is an actual defined term that actually means something, with a very specific definition. Just because you choose to go to Walmart everytime, doesn't make it a monopoly.


Here are the characrttiristics of a monopoly


* Profit Maximizer: Maximizes profits.

Steam doesn't do this. Not in the traditional way a monopoly would. They have sales all the time.

* Price Maker: Decides the price of the good or product to be sold, but does so by determining the quantity in order to demand the price desired by the firm.

For most of its products Steam doesn't decide the number of keys available to them, nor do they set the price.

* High Barriers: Other sellers are unable to enter the market of the monopoly.

Loads of sellers have entered the market. They also compete with console sales and brick and mortar sales.


* Single seller: In a monopoly, there is one seller of the good, who produces all the output.[5] Therefore, the whole market is being served by a single company, and for practical purposes, the company is the same as the industry.

Nope. Aside from a few Valve titles, most games will appear on different stores. Plus a developer can choose not to sell through Steam (Overwatch, Minecraft, Star Craft, etc. do this)

* Price Discrimination: A monopolist can change the price or quantity of the product. He or she sells higher quantities at a lower price in a very elastic market, and sells lower quantities at a higher price in a less elastic market.
 
Nope, not Steam either. 

So Steam doesn't fit a single characteristic of a monopoly. Sure they are big and have a lot of power, but so does Coca Cola and Walmart. When was the last time you heard them described as a monopoly. And as long as Steam distributes their own games like Portal through retailers, they don't even monopolize their own goods. </TEXT>

It was disappointing that they made sub par movies, but it wasn't really unacceptable. It's not like they were insulting your mother, they just failed to reach the bar that was set by their fans. Every person in the creative arts will do that at least once. Even you, when you become a professional animator.

I mean, does that even matter? A movie is either good or it isn't, no matter what it is trying to achieve. Robocop and The Matrix aren't better movies because they are Christ allegories. They are good movies that happens to be allegories too. Signs is a bad movie that happens to be an allegory for returning to ones faith after losing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So you think that the capacity of a laptops hard drive is related to how useful it is. As in when you fill it up you get a new one.. or something? 

I was using it for context. If people make do with using up to 1TB of permanent storage, why would they need more than that in volatile data in a month?

If I want to host a 8k video stream of my back garden and I have a 'unlimited' data plan. That's perfectly okay.

Actually I wouldn't agree with that. If you want an 8k stream, that's your business, but private lines aren't made for that kind of usage. First, you'd probably want a line with more upload bandwidth. Even in plans with 100 down or higher, cap uploads at 25. Second a household line doesn't guarantee you the things to maintain that connection. You don't get a static IP, your service and guarantee of uptime aren't granted either. If you want to hold a 24 hour 8K stream, you really need a business line.

Also an 8K stream on an unlimited home line is the exact sort of idiocy that results in the 'one guy ruined it for everyone' rulings.

Or maybe I want download a stream from a remote location... I have an 'unlimited plan' I can do that. 

You can do this. It would still be an awful lot of streaming to hit a TB. Not sure why the location has to be remote. You are charged by how much data you receive, not how hard or remote that data was / is. Data from Ireland and the US, is the same as data from the Congo or Timbuktu. 
I have an unlimited line. I don't get charged if I go over my 1TB limit (although that has only happened once) but they do throttle my speeds after that. They were upfront about this when I switched plans. It seems fair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's apples to a different sort of apple. 1 TB is an industrial amount of data. [That is over 300 hours of Netflix HD](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/87). 

To put that in context, I used [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com) to track the movies I watched last year. I watched roughly 370 movies in 2016 (which I'm pretty sure is way above average, that's over a movie a day) equating to 604 hours. Assuming everything I watched last year was on Netflix, I would have to watch a whole year of movies in two months to keep up with OPs data usage. And I could get it to fit on a laptop and a single external hard drive.

Another way to look at it is that OP would have to download GTA V (the largest commercial game download I could find, but there could be larger) 15 times to use all his data.

So either OP is hosting a large amount of data, which he shouldn't on a private line, or he is using so much data that he really needs a business line.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Remember it only takes 48 hours of full use to hit the limit.

The only way someone could be using non stop upload and download at max speed in two days is if they are hosting something extremely popular, or they are heavy torrentors. If they are hosting something extremely popular, they should be using an appropriate service, not their household broadband. 

Standard laptops come with a 500GB - 1 TB drive and they are suppose to last 4 or so years. Wording of the account aside, if you are regularly using a laptop full of data a month, you probably need a business level plan.

EDIT: I also did the math. 4 people streaming HD on Netflix continuously would still take 83 hours to hit a TB. That's 3 and a half days of no sleep for 4 people watching non-stop to hit that. </TEXT>

A vegan food line might not want their adverts on Fox. When advertising directly they can control that, and they can control what programmes their ads run on.

Youtube's model originally gave an all or nothing. So your left leaning business might be advertising and providing income to someone or org that you find deplorable. And lets not pretend YouTube news is just news. They are almost always opinion pieces with a bias.

	<TEXT> I think it was a bit silly for 'news channels' or any channel on Youtube relying on their source of income being this experimental payment model where Youtube pays for the content, without approval first. Youtube is a company that has been losing money, year after year and are the only social media site that pays users. That was never going to last forever.

Complaining that YouTube isn't paying you anymore is like complaining that your parents don't give you allowance anymore.

Of course that's not even what happened. Youtube have just stopped paying indiscriminately. The money comes from advertisers and advertisers usually represent corporations. And corporations tend to avoid controversy. Pewdiepew losing his advertisers because he made Nazi jokes that some may find distasteful is no different to Bill O Reilly losing his job because advertisers didn't want to be associated with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The voting system makes it a numbers game too. Even if you forget about the bias that early upvotes have, people will tend only to upvote a topic or comment they can discuss.

So if I open a thread about a movie that was big in the seventies that isn't Star Wars, not many people will have seen it, so they stay out of the discussion. I once saw someone suggest The Sting as an underrated movie. It won Best Picture but because it hasn't been seen by a large group of voters, this might seem like a legitimate opinion to people.

People have seen a bunch of blockbusters, so even though Suicide Squad and BvS were critical flops, we still see them discussed much more than more celebrated movies that came out the same time. It goes the other way sometimes too. Prometheus, which got a decent critical reception (although most critics who did enjoy it, will admit it has flaws) is always decimated as if it was the worse abomination to ever hit screens here. Then there are phases, like when this sub decided that Man of Steel wasn't too bad after all and this caused a bunch of posts defending it.

We see some smaller movies float to the top. This sub is constantly recommending Primer and The Nice Guys. Then there are some topical films, like It Follows, which despite not being seen by many seemed to be discussed a lot before falling off the radar again.

I think you need to look at reddit's top movies to see the inherit flaws, and it doesn't just lie in reddit's major demographic. The movies are all recent, widely seen films. It is like asking a teenager who just got into movies what their favourites are. It's wide, but it isn't deep.
