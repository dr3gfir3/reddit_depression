	<TITLE> The /r/books book club selection for May is The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks by Rebecca Skloot! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-28 20:59:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know many of you are likely familiar with this book and we are very excited to have Rebecca as our book club guest this month.  Feel free to discuss the book in the comments on this post.  

Even if you do not often read non fiction I highly recommend this book.  

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6493208-the-immortal-life-of-henrietta-lacks):

Henrietta Lacks, as HeLa, is known to present-day scientists for her cells from cervical cancer. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells were taken without her knowledge and still live decades after her death. Cells descended from her may weigh more than 50M metric tons. 

HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bombs effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. Yet Henrietta Lacks was buried in an unmarked grave.

The journey starts in the colored ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s, her small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia  wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo. Today are stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells, East Baltimore children and grandchildren live in obscurity, see no profits, and feel violated. The dark history of experimentation on African Americans helped lead to the birth of bioethics, and legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The /r/books bookclub selection for April is Narconomics: How to Run a Drug Cartel by Tom Wainwright! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-31 18:18:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It has been a few months since we read some nonfiction so this will be a nice change of pace. Even if you don't usually read nonfiction this is something you should try out. It's an interesting read and quite entertaining.

From [Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25159062-narconomics):

How does a budding cartel boss succeed (and survive) in the 300 billion illegal drug business? By learning from the best, of course. From creating brand value to fine-tuning customer service, the folks running cartels have been attentive students of the strategy and tactics used by corporations such as Walmart, McDonald's, and Coca-Cola.

And what can government learn to combat this scourge? By analyzing the cartels as companies, law enforcers might better understand how they workand stop throwing away 100 billion a year in a futile effort to win the war against this global, highly organized business.

Your intrepid guide to the most exotic and brutal industry on earth is Tom Wainwright. Picking his way through Andean cocaine fields, Central American prisons, Colorado pot shops, and the online drug dens of the Dark Web, Wainwright provides a fresh, innovative look into the drug trade and its 250 million customers.

The cast of characters includes Bin Laden, the Bolivian coca guide; Old Lin, the Salvadoran gang leader; Starboy, the millionaire New Zealand pill maker; and a cozy Mexican grandmother who cooks blueberry pancakes while plotting murder. Along with presidents, cops, and teenage hitmen, they explain such matters as the business purpose for head-to-toe tattoos, how gangs decide whether to compete or collude, and why cartels care a surprising amount about corporate social responsibility. More than just an investigation of how drug cartels do business, Narconomics is also a blueprint for how to defeat them.

Tom will be doing an AMA here at the end of the month so as you read keep in mind that you will be able to ask him questions later. </TEXT>
