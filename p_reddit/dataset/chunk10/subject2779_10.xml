If 10 - You can go to 10 directly as your key is already converted.

	<TEXT> I remade the thread which means comments was deleted. Here they are, in short.
Also bear in mind with the API changes coming in 7.1, a lot of addon functionality will change, including the "Rangefinders" you get in boss mods. - **Melvyn ~~2016~~**


Yes, this is correct. From deadly boss mods dev crew:
Blizzard just announced a decision to break UnitPosition in dungeons and raids in upcoming patch 7.1. As a result of these changes, the follow DBM features will be removed or limited sometime soon:
DBM Arrow DBM Radar/RangeFrame DBM Hudmap Position based warning filters (are you on mogu side or mantid? Boat or platform?) Nearby Warnings (bad thing on playerName near you)
Arrow and Hudmap will be missed at high end but won't affect most average raiders (Also where I put majority of my effort for mythic raid mods). The radar being broken is going to affect everyone and make simple things like spreading out properly require a lot more geometry and annoyance. It'll be like the days of Gruul in BC where the only range finder DBM could give you was a text based one that was fixed to limited ranges using things like bandages or inspect. Blizzard seems to want that BC raiding style back. It's their game so it's their wishes. I merely need to mention I'm not stripping these features from DBM because I want to.
Just a real shame they knew about this in advance and decided only now to share it after the countless hours put into the above features for Legion. I went above and beyond with arrows and hudmap for Nightmare and Nighthold and even Mythic dungeons.
So much time wasted on features no one will ever get to see/enjoy, put into mods (especially Nighthold). I constantly read boss feedback threads and over and over and over again people said "x mechanic is hard to see please add arrows". Months later fight retested "still hard to see, why not add arrows". This was on multiple fights. Well I say on a good 2/3rd of Nighthold, DBM added arrows or some other kind of helper. Everywhere possible. Now, the only question remains, do I remove them right away from Emerald Nightmare, so people can get "used to it" or leave them in so people can at least use and see these features for Emerald Nightmare (not nearly as fancy as Nighthold but present), only to have them taken away from them mid progression? - **Me ~~2016~~** </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Raiding Addons and requirements to join the raids! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-27 12:37:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Two requirements for joining the raids with Endeavour is the discord desktop app with a push to talk setup aswell as one of the following addons: BigWigs or Deadly Boss Mods. 

Ofcourse the usual rading etiquette is important. (Bring your own flask, food and enchants and such. We have people who can craft different things, just ask.) 
For the first raid 840 is the item level required. 

Below will be a list of addons and a stort explanation as to what it does. 

Discord (REQUIRED)

All-in-one voice and text chat for gamers thats free, secure, and works on both your desktop and phone.
This is mandatory for raiding as callouts for tactics and certain spells will be made over voice communication. 

The client for Windows computers can be downloaded [here!](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=win)

The client for Mac computers can be downloaded [here!](https://discordapp.com/api/download?platform=osx)

Once the client is installed, start it up and look on the left hand side of the client. There should be a plus(+) sign.Click it and choose Join existing server and copy paste the following link: https://discord.gg/XK25sKS



**BigWigs** or **Deadly Boss Mods** (REQUIRED)

BigWigs is a boss encounter add-on. It consists of many individual encounter scripts, or boss modules; mini add-ons that are designed to trigger alert messages, timer bars, sounds, and so forth, for one specific raid encounter. These encounter scripts are activated when you target or mouse over a raid boss, or if any other BigWigs user in your raid does. In most cases only one module will be running at any given time.

If you're looking for boss encounter scripts for 5-man dungeons, these are not in Big Wigs, but live in their own add-on; LittleWigs.

Deadly Boss Mods is mostly the same, except that you don't need a second addon for dungeons.

**Recount** Or **Skada** (They do the same thing, IMO Skada looks more clean and gives more information.)

Knowing your performance (and others!) in terms of damage, healing, damage taken, healing taken etc is nice. Recount helps you with this. Locate the slackers and note the people that bring their A-game. Great for many things.


**OmniCC**

Keeping track of 8 different cooldown timers can get tedious and also distracting. Not to mention certain cooldowns are easy to forget. OmniCC keep track of them all for you and makes it simple. Result is that you can focus on other things while OmniCC does the work for you.

**Omen Threat Meter**

This addon helps you keep track of your threat aswell as everyone elses. Great tool if you're a high burst dps class or your tank is lacking gear. If you see yourself overtaking the tank on the meters, lowering your DPS or stopping all togheter may be a good thing. Instead of having the boss turn around and swipe the raid. Beacuse that fucking sucks. 

**WeakAuras 2**(Highly Recommended) 

This one is not for the faint of heart. WeakAuras is the spiritual successor to PowerAuras, but has since evolved into the single most powerful framework for personalized alerts available today. Even for users who aren't entirely sure how to navigate the complexity of building their own strings, a number of talented theorycrafters have exported strings elsewhere online - on forums, blogs, or otherwise - that you can quickly import for your own use. It is the best addon available today, and players who make effective use of it are setting themselves up for tremendous success.


 
I myself, Restofarean ingame, use **Elvui** and I like it a lot. It's basicly a template of UI's you can use and change everything to the way you want it to be. It's easy to set up on alts as you can just copy the settings from other characters. 

**If there's questions or I missed some addons or anything alike, Let me know in the comments.** </TEXT>
