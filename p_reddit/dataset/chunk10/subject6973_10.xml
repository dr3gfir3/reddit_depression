	<TEXT> Healthy grilled cheese, say what!? Can those three words even go together? This sandwich is amazing! Anyone who is a fan of grilled cheese (or not) I suggest you convert to this method. You wont regret it. In my opinion this tastes even better than the original version thats slathered in butter.  You get more flavor and you feel better about eating it.  This is obviously just a recipe for your basic grilled cheese but there are so many variations you can add to this recipe.  You could add in tomatoes or spinach, or your favorite herbs and seasonings or you can just keep it basic like this. Try this recipe out today and its likely you will become converted to this method, like I have, for life.  Your heart will thank you later =).  Also, keep in mind you can use your favorite cheese but for a lower calorie, less fat cheese Mozzarella may be your better option. </TEXT>
