	<TEXT> I loved Peter dancing by himself in the original because the audience didn't know it was a comedy.  Everyone was so reserved and unsure it was such an interesting theatre experience.  That said still think dancing Groot was better.  It was more technically efficient and Peter never fought an adorable tiny Trex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If Marvel was running the character this would happen.  But Disney / Marvel has this track record that allows them to drop hundreds of millions on films because they know it will work.  FOX doesn't have that luxury.  For every Logan, theres a Fan4Suck. That company looks at money above everything else and right now it doesn't make sense to spend 200 Million on a character when the same money will get them a sequel and second franchise starring Deadpool that should easily hit a Billion each. 
  
Hell, perfect example. Due to the Sony / Marvel deal they each have to pay for their own films.  So Sony had to write a check to film Homecoming.  Because they needed Robert Downy Jr in the film Sony turned down Marvel's pick for Vulture because they didn't want to pay for Michael Keaton as well.  Its rumored that Marvel paid for Keaton out of their own pocket because he was the right person for the part.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heres the problem with this film.  They were preparing to give Gambit 150 - 200 Million dollar budget and groom it too be their next Wolverine type character.  Thats why they got Channing Tatum to play him.  Thats why they allowed Tatum to get more money by playing hardball during negotiations.  Then Deadpool happened.  All of a sudden they have their next Wolverine, and the support of millions of people.  And even more fun, it made Avengers money on the first try with practically no money or management.  Then even better, the star and creative driving force of the film WANTS to do more movies and a new franchise and doesn't want big budgets or management.  FOX doesn't want to pay Tatum his ridiculous fee or spend 200 Million on a character they don't need because Ryan Reynolds is giving them everything they want with literally no effort on their end.  </TEXT>

Two weekends ago he woke me up at 7am on Saturday to play Halo Warzone.  15 seconds into the match he grenaded a group of grunts and hit #1.  Gave me a bunch of shit over the headset.   By the end of the game he was dead last and I was #2.  So he said I was #2 because I used a tank.  So round two I didn't use a vehicle and came in #3 he was still dead last.  He didn't talk to me for the rest of the weekend. </TEXT>

Some of the more ridiculous gear builds are up on YouTube now.  Some effect powers, abilities, character speed... etc.  My view on the game has done a 180.

	<TEXT> Before this film, I was worried.  People said it wasn't as good on twitter.  Professional reviewers said it wasn't as good as the original.  I read someone say it was bottom three of the entire MCU.  Now that I have seen it, I have no idea what those people were talking about.  This was great.  It didn't have a lot of action, but I think that was more so on purpose.  Hell, this film starts with the standard blockbuster opening set piece but James Gunn decided to not focus on the action.  Instead we focused on Baby Groot dancing around to a song while it happens in the background.  I think it was great.  It was like the movie started with a disclaimer "this isn't your typical movie".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is why Cisco was such an important character on The Flash.  It gave them a believable way to funnel all that 60's golden age non-sense into the world.

	<TEXT> It's playable but you need to do a few things.  First you must buy the complete version with all the DLC.  Then when you start the game, only use the batmobile when you have too.  Never just drive it around.  Next you need to avoid the riddler entirely.  You physically have to do one thing but after that, just ignore that dumbass.  And finally, once you feel the Batmobile wearing you down, play one of the added DLC Side Quests.  Save them until that fucking car pisses you off.  If you follow these steps the game will be great. </TEXT>

So we were minding our own business and the teacher decided to draw attention to the fact that I didn't have my book.  He exclaimed like a douchebag that I couldn't follow along reading his book upside down.  I said "I can read upside down, its not hard" and the teacher laughed and forced me to read the next page outloud in front of the class.  I did it upside down and the class sort of exploded in laughter at his red embarrassed face.  At this point he said I was "disrupting class" and made me go to the principal's office.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats why Battlefield is so different than the other shooters.  Sometimes the enemy team will work together and its almost impossible to fight.  Other times your team is together and you plow through the opposition.  Its so uneven.  The only time Battlefield is good is when both sides are actually playing the objective.  I wish there was a way for DiCE to make it clear for the COD fuckheads that keep ruining Battlefield games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem people don't seem to understand here is money.  If you haven't realised this season has been vastly expensive.  Every episode has new locations, actual VFX and an actual team of stunt people for Oliver to thump.  I'm not kidding about the new locations, stop and think about it.  Most episodes have two new locations.  On top of this, the producers hold back money for the final three episodes.  They have done this since the first season.  So we have a show that costs more than normal, and they are holding money back.  Of course the episode before the final three would be made on the cheap.  Think about it.  The entire episode took place in an established location and mostly only featured two characters.  It was made on the cheap specifically because they needed the money.  Doing an Andrian episode would be great BUT it would be ridiculously expensive.  The people in charge had to make a decision, using the money for the finale is just a no brainer.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to paraphrase what happened.  Microsoft paid for the script.  Then they signed with CAA over the film rights.  Every studio said yes, FOX just wrote the word "Yes" on their bid sheet.  It was a huge deal.  After every studio was foaming at the mouth over the property and Microsoft promptly lost its damn mind.  They sent out a list of demands for the rights.  
  
They keep all merchandising.  
They don't pay for any of the film.  
They get paid back in full for the script.  
They get 30% of the profits.  
They get a bonus if it underperforms at the box office.  
They wanted first class airfare for over sixty Microsoft employees for the premiere.  
They want full creative control over the film and required the film to be shipped to Seattle every night.  
They also needed one of their executives to be on set at all times.  
  
The cost of their demands was just too damn high.  At one point Universal and Warner were trying to split the costs to start production but it just never worked.  Microsoft's demands combined with Peter Jackson and the directors costs would literally mean the studio wouldn't make any money off the movie.

	<TEXT> Arrow is great.  Olicity is dead.  There has been one short scene about their relationship and the majority of the time they both act like they never dated. They have money again, every episode has at least one new location.  New trick arrows.  At one point Oliver shot goddamn fire out of his bow. The villain is legitimately great and his "End Game" has literally nothing to do with saving a city or an army of baddies.  The story is literally building to the finale.  It's like they actually thought up the entire arch before they wrote it.  Oliver is killing again.  DOLPH LUNDGREN! Multiple huge returning characters.

	<TEXT> I'm going to be downvoted for saying this, but this show isn't really about telling a story.  It's about reminding people that its in the Breaking Bad universe. Every episode has multiple nods to the show, some are hidden or less obvious and others have huge neon signs over their heads.  Literally nothing happens on this show.  In three years, Jimmy still isn't Saul.  He switched offices and got a fancy desk.  Thats pretty much it.  My sister has more drama in a week than this show has given us in three years.  But we tune in every week because we miss the adventures of Walter White. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The president of CW said ratings don't matter and that 20% of their audience view online.  That was over three years ago.  Could you imagine what it is today? The fact they we are still gauging TV shows off an antiquated system and ignoring hard data is just retarded.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read the book last month for this show.  The show is moving faster than it should and is adding a lot more violence and weirdness than it should at the start.  In the book, Techincal boy just picks him up in a limo.  His children are unrecognizable not thumb faces on bodies.  They don't try to kill Shadow, they just gave him a message for Wednesday.   It was also wierd that they kept the dialog after they changed the scene.   The world of the gods doesn't really become *true* until Shadow goes on the carousel and I kinda liked it that way.  </TEXT>
