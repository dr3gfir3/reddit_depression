	<TEXT> Thank you for writing all that out. I totally feel the same regarding the robot thing and the bit about luxury cars. I could live pretty simply, just working little jobs forever, but I know that's not financially responsible. I'm not "supposed" to be content with a simple life, or living in the woods or something - I'm supposed to always be working toward something better. But I have zero drive to do it. It's weird. 

To be honest, I'm taking a break from college right now - I was very close to attempting suicide again - so I'm living at home now. But I feel embarrassed because a girl I used to be friends with in high school that I follow on instagram just graduated from oxford!! She's a year younger than me too, just 19, and already doing so much more than I ever could, even if I was motivated like her. It's so strange. I wish my brain worked like hers.

Anyway, I'm sorry for rambling. I really appreciate that you replied to my post. It's nice to not be the only one that feels like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some background: I've struggled with depression since I was 10 and suicidal thoughts since I was 13. When I was 17, I think, I tried different meds and finally went on prozac, and that's been working well for me. I'm 20 now and I still very much struggle though.

I feel like my struggles with depression can be split into two halves. The first is the occasional kind, the really bad kind, that develops every few days or so, sometimes at random, where I feel absolutely terrible. I am consumed by self-hatred and my thoughts are at best passively-suicidal and at worst actively fantasizing and seriously considering it.

On other days, the in-between days, I am more "passively-depressed". This is a day like today. I can find enjoyment in things, kinda, but I feel horribly anxious about my future and everything around me. I worry and I feel overwhelmed and paranoid often. I feel like nothing matters. My nihilistic/anti-society thoughts come out stronger - stuff like "I just want to run away and live in a forest." "I hate how much we consume things." "I don't like this lifestyle - nothing is fulfilling. Everything is fleeting". It sounds kinda dumb when I write it out but it worries me because how can I ever be happy in the future if I don't even like society? I visited a factory the other day and it almost made me feel ill - I don't really know why. I recognize that this much sound silly, but I do mean it. I want to live in society. I want to be a part of things. But on my "good days", I worry so much about my future, "Will I ever really be happy?" type of thoughts, that it's depressing.

I dunno what to do. I feel so empty. On my bad days I wanna die, on my good days I feel that less but the result of me being able to think more clearly is that I dread my future.

What can I do? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 20f here, 5'4' 108 lbs. I've noticed that for the past few years, if I get up from laying down and stand up quickly, my vision fades to black and I have trouble feeling "conscious". This develops and fades away all in the span of about 30 seconds. Details I've noticed: 

- doesn't usually happen when I first get up out of bed in the morning


- if I don't eat at all in the day, it becomes much, much more frequent and I feel kind of queasy throughout the day until I eat


- my mom also gets this occasionally when standing up quickly; my dad does not


- when I was younger, up until maybe about four years ago, I had no problems with this


This didn't bother me too much until I recently attempted a tiny fast where I didn't eat anything until dinner. Throughout the day, I felt more and more tired and literally any time I'd get up, even in a reclining or sitting position, the mini black out would happen. Is there any way I can avoid this? And what exactly is causing it? </TEXT>

So a little over a year ago, when I was 18, I posted pics on here and got good feedback. Y'all were super nice (especially considering how bad my makeup was at the time lol) and told me what to improve on and I tried to follow through with most of it. I grew my hair out, dyed it a bit, and watched makeup tutorials. Did I do alright? And what can I improve on?

At this point I'm no longer loyal to her interactive as a company, especially with Penny at the helm, and I'm very willing to play a knock-off game if it means I get something even remotely similar to a nancy drew game. Have any of y'all ever played miss clue? What do you guys think of their games? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have recently gotten closer with a friend that I previously never hanged out with much. I have a class with her and I'm happy to have gotten closer to her, especially since most of my other friends are guys or tomboy girls. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with that, but it's nice to be able to talk about makeup and period cramps and romance movies sometimes. 


There's a small problem, however. I absolutely can't stand her boyfriend. They usually hang out together whenever she has free time, meaning I'd have to see him to see her. He just loves to hear the sound of his own voice. He tries to sound excessively confident in everything he says and it's so obnoxious. He's so smug. He makes little snide comment and remarks and godawful puns. To add to this, he's makes weird sexist jokes sometimes and was apparently a horrible lab partner to a friend of mine last year. Every time I see him, I completely avoid him or just leave because his voice is like nails on a chalkboard to me. I can count five separate people who have complained at one point or another about him, so it's not just me. I have never wanted to fight someone more.

	<TITLE> I have some questions about applying to pharmacy schools in Canada </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-20 18:53:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some background info: I'm a 19 year old girl and I go to the University of North Georgia in the US. I'm currently majoring in biology with a minor in Spanish, and I speak French fluently. I have dual citizenship with Canada and the US. I also have many relatives that live in Canada that I could potentially live with if need be.


So. I have questions about Canadian pharmacy schools vs American. The main reason I'm looking at Canadian schools is due to tuition prices. UGA's tuition is $29,000 in-state, while the University of Waterloo, for example, is only $2,400. That's a crazy difference. Is there a catch? Is there something I'm missing that would rank up the price for me? Even if I were to count as an international student, it says it would still be only $6000 for tuition.


In general, are there any major differences between the application process and the pharmacy schools themselves between the US and Canada? From what I've seen, the required courses and workload and so on seem more or less the same, just much cheaper than in the US. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dealing with intense depression the week before my period </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-05 17:22:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: 19 years old/female/weight: 112 lbs/height: 5'4"


I have clinical depression and I take prozac, 20mg a day for it. For the most part, I'm stable. However, in the week before my period starts I almost always get extremely depressed. Self-hatred, thoughts of suicide, self-harm -everything I mostly don't think about because of my meds comes back in full force. The three times I've tried birth control, I got the same "symptoms" except they lasted for a month, because that's how long I managed to take the birth control. I stopped taking the birth control because at that point, it was interfering with my studies, plus it felt sort of dangerous to be considering suicide on a daily basis.


I would greatly appreciate 1) an explanation as to why my body/mind get like this seemingly due to hormones, and 2) any advice, suggestions, anecdotes about depression getting significantly
 worse when near the period and how to deal with it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [skin concerns] Is my current routine too exfoliating? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-30 15:01:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've never posted here before but I was wondering if you guys could give me some input regarding my daily/nightly routine.
Some background: Ever since I was a tiny child, I've had fairly noticeable sebaceous filaments. My parents thought they were blackheads, or some mysterious "refilling" pores, so from a young age I was squeezing them, using pore strips, and trying products with microbeads - basically everything I know not to do now. Most of them aren't too bad now that I've stopped messing with them directly.


By lurking on this sub and r/asianbeauty, I made some purchases and created a little routine for myself over the past few weeks. However, I've also read some horror stories about the dangers of overexfoliation, so I wanted to know what you guys think.


AM:

* wash with neutrogena pore refining exfoliating cleanser in the shower; leave on for a few minutes while I wash myself and then rinse it off at the end

* apply neutrogena moisturizer/sunscreen with spf 50

PM:

* wash makeup off with ponds cold cream

* wash again with neutrogena cleanser, but I don't leave it on my skin for a few minutes, I rinse it off after massaging it in a bit

* swipe maximum strength stridex over upper cheeks, chin, the part of my forehead near the area between my eyebrows, and especially my nose; let dry and then swipe another pad again and let dry 

* apply neutrogena deep moisture night cream, avoiding my eyes and the skin near them because it irritates them

Does this seem excessive? I've never had smoother, clearer skin prior to starting this routine. But I also don't really hear about people using a chemical exfoliant twice a day. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a lot of work, a lot of tests and homework on my plate. It's only a few weeks into the semester, and the few grades I've gotten - on small papers and quizzes and such - haven't been great, even though I put effort into them. Do you guys have any advice or even personal anecdotes regarding dealing with a challenging courseload?


If it helps any, my classes are Biology 1107, Bio lab, Chemistry 1211, Chem lab, Public Speaking, and Mexican Culture. I know these classes don't seem very hard, and they probably aren't compared to some of the stuff y'all study, but unfortunately literally all of the professors I got are widely known to be hard graders, making situations and questions where I would get partial credit if I mess up be zero credit instead, which makes things a bit tougher.


In order of appearance, I've got an impromptu speech tomorrow, a short answer chemistry test over the first two chapters this Friday, over fifty questions of chemistry practice due Friday morning, a Spanish essay due Monday, a bio lab on Monday, a chemistry lab due next friday, two public speaking chapter summaries due over the next week, and a biology test over the first five chapters the Monday after next week.


Any support, links to helpful websites, personal anecdotes of your studying days, small statements of motivation is great - I'll take anything you guys :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like I'm an outlier here, but I really didn't mind being an only child. I was a pretty quiet kid. I loved reading and video games, and I usually kept to myself. I got both of my parents attention and love. Even though I was under a lot of pressure to do well in school, comparing me to the smart kid in class feels like it was much easier than being compared to a sibling, which my parents certainly would have done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read something by a former child actor - can't remember who - that said that their parents played a really big role in keeping her away from the more dangerous parts of hollywood and on-track with her acting career. Hopefully, the Stranger Things kids have healthy and supportive families that can keep them safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I tend to do both. It depends on the style of class and how it's taught. If it's a slower class where the professor uses powerpoint slides and discusses things, then either paper or typing is fine. When its a faster, more lecture-based class, especially anything with figures, then I opt for writing things down manually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of me wants to stand up to him but part of me doesn't. I do think I look gross and fat like this. It's been wired into me since I was little. Being fat is one of my worst fears.
I know that a lot people would be perfectly fine with being the weight I am right now, but I can't say that I am. I don't mean to defend my dad - I could do without the mean comments about my thighs - but he means well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 19f sophomore who's heading home from college tomorrow for the first time since the semester started. I'm 5"4' and I was 106 pounds when I got here, and now I'm hovering between 112 and 114. This is the highest weight I've ever been in my life. 


I know exactly how it'll go. I'll tell my dad I'm more like 111 or 112 and how ashamed I am that I've gotten to this weight (and I am, but my butt and boobs also grew, soooo :T). At my dad's suggestion, I'll agree to eat as little as possible while I'm home. He'll make a couple jokes about how fat I am and how my thighs have no muscle and jiggle. How I might become "another fat american". Eventually, from drinking coffee and only eating oatmeal and probably browsing myproana, I'll get down to a nice 108 by the end of the week. I'll stop hating my thighs and I'll head back to school to study my ass off for finals and life will go on. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is there a difference between these two versions of this textbook? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-16 17:40:48 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Here's the hardback version of the book: https://www.amazon.com/Chemistry-Central-Theodore-E-Brown/dp/0321910419/ref=mt_hardcover?_encoding=UTF8 me=


But then if you click on paperback, the book cover is completely different and it's much, much cheaper - $245 vs $49. I also definitely need the access code for this class and I'm confused if the paperback version comes with that. By comparison, our university bookstore sells the book for $324, so it would be great if I could get it for less than a fifth of the price. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe it turned out that the guy had stolen some of the lyrics from another dude so the video got taken down, which may make it harder to find. It was this young looking guy in his twenties maybe with very light, whiteish hair with purple dye in it. He was singing while rowing this boat in the center of the video and he had a beautiful, deep voice. At some point he smokes a cigarette (or a joint) and at another he tosses a guitar he was holding into the water. </TEXT>

Not because he's disabled, but because his family seems absolutely crazy. The part that struck out as excessive to me was smashing her phone, which frankly, is kinda scary. Why the hell did you smash her phone? You realize there's apps and shit that you could use to prevent them from texting, right? Now she can't even talk to her friends, ask about assignments - nothing. </TEXT>

Last night I couldn't sleep at all, I felt so so anxious. That's the first time it's every happened to me before. I've been worried about every little thing, how I look, how I act, my grades - when normally, I would lean into my depressed state of mind and just sort of accept it. I feel tense all the time now. 
Is there some way to treat this? This anxiety's popped up really only in the past few weeks. </TEXT>
