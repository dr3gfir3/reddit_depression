	<TEXT> As much as I'd prefer titles like, "The Long Walk Home" to "I Walked Home in the Dark and Something Followed Me" I find myself clicking on the longer titles first.  Yes, I eventually get to the shorter titles that maybe don't grab my attention quickly, but unless it's a favourite author of mine, they are usually the last to come by. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RIGHT?  Why do kids always seem to want to go where they shouldn't be going?  The more dangerous, the better :/

Don't feel guilty about that break.  Nobody thinks you can't handle it - you're doing a great job, even if you don't think you are, lol.  Moving is a huge pain the ass w/o kids!!

Deep breaths, so you *can* handle it when you're back at it again :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BabySpawn is 16 mo and still takes 2 naps.

So, around that age, he, too, was waking up earlier and earlier, but we made a point to keep him up until what his normal naps would be - 10:30/11 and again around 4:30/5 - with bedtime at 8:30.  

I asked the pediatrician about it, too, and she explained that she thought it was just BabySpawn waking up, realizing I wasn't there, missing me, and wanting me to give the cuddles.  The first couple of nights I went in to soothe (and make sure he didn't pee his diaper out) but then I started waiting a few minutes and he would fall back asleep.  Eventually, he stopped waking up and crying.

It took a couple of weeks, but it worked itself out and how it's back to normal.  (Whatever that is, lol.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome back :)

/r/wownoob will probably help you best for things like this!  However, Broken Shore quests are the "newest" dailies to be doing right now.  You can get some nice gear from that, but it is a bit of a grind.  Make sure you're also doing the other WQ, LFR, heroics, M+, etc.  www.icy-veins.com will provide a useful guide.

Good luck. </TEXT>

But, then you'd need more than one, so I guess that's not very practical.  I've had XBoxes, Nintendos, and Segas.  My personal opinion is that Nintendo systems are the most family friendly out there.  All the Mario Parties, Mario Kart, Super Smash, etc...

Heck I could even said go old school and get an SNES!!!  Literally such a thrill to play a lot of games there, even today.  I will occasionally break out the N64, GameCube or Wii, but somehow I feel drawn back to SNES. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ever since BabySpawn arrived on this Earth, we've done "nice, nice" while gently caressing his face, or using his hands to gently touch our faces.  Somehow within the last couple of weeks, BabySpawn has decided to rub the sides of my face saying, "Nieee, nieee" (which is him trying to say "nice") then immediately trying to gouge my eyeballs out _  (Come to think of it, maybe he's trying to say "die"...)

I've tried to pretend cry and say he's hurting mommy, telling him no, distractions, etc but he just LAUGHS at me.  (Tbh I'm lol'ing as I write this, but still.  I don't laugh at him while correcting him.)  So, how can I stop this, b/c my poor eyeballs T_T  Or am I raising SatanSpawn?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the dog exchange, I sent a link to a very expensive dress w/ puppies on it.  I said something along the lines of, "I don't expect you to buy this for me, but this is an example of something I'd wear and what my style is."  I also requested no Pop figures b/c I don't have space for them.  My giftee was able to nail it based on that.

Anyway, I just think it's super rude to assume you're going to get something expensive from a random gift person.  Smh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't want to know the gender of my 1st kiddo - I wanted it to be a surprise.  I said outright that I hoped it was a boy but I didn't care so long as the baby was healthy.  If/when I have #2, I hope it's a girl so that I can have 1 of each, but again, that doesn't matter either.

With my son, he plays with his cousins' princess horses and their pink cooking set.  He plays with trucks and cars.  I brush his hair and take real joy in picking out super adorable outfits.  I want to sign him up for sports.  We dance together to music.  (I'd sign him up for dance class if he wanted; I just really hated it so I guess that's why I hesitate.)

The only real "complaint" I had was that b/c I chose to have his gender be a surprise, I had a hard time finding clothes.  My "theme" was puppies, stars, and moons.  Do you know how hard it was to find not-blue puppy items??  1/2 of the stuff baby had was blue b/c there were no options.  Annoying.  And, if/when I have #2 and it's a girl, she's wearing "boy" clothes as well as "girl" dresses.  B/c why not?  I wear "boy" clothes sometimes.  I'm looking at you, shorts that are always so short they show off my butt cheeks so I have to wear men's shorts.  xD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no.  It's a very big adjustment time.  Once you find your rhythm again, things will smooth out.

You will be sleep deprived, but hopefully you have some kind of support system that will come over and watch the baby while you catch up on some sleep.  Night and day will cease to mean anything to you for a while :P  But, I made it a point to go out with baby as much as possible so he'd get used to being around people, noises, etc.  He'd just fall asleep whenever, whatever.  Now that kiddo can sleep through an explosion, lol.

I never once had to poop or shower while wrangling the kiddo.  I did those things when he was napping, or when my husband was on Baby Duty.

This might be slightly different if you are nursing.  I only nursed for a month.  Not having to stop and nurse or pump made things a lot easier.  I didn't have to plan things around these sessions.

SAFE bed-sharing is also a lifesaver.  Check up on that, if you're into it.   </TEXT>

Side note, my office was perturbed that I took all the time I was allotted.  They honestly felt I should suck it up and come back ASAP - how 'bout no.  I don't understand how we in the US can justify not giving better maternity/paternity leave...it's not a "vacation" as some people seem to think it is e_e </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's actually a philosophical belief from (I think) Nietzsche.

I'm not entirely sure I believe it, but you're not entirely wrong either.  I've given a gift to a stranger expecting nothing else in return b/c I knew it would make him feel great.  Yes, seeing his reaction gave me pleasure, but that was not *why* I gave him the gift.  I didn't want him to feel left out - I wanted him to be included.

Even if you're getting the incidental payoff of the good feeling, my intention is what I think matters more than the result. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Open-minded person here.  I come from a family of Roman Catholics.  Not super-pushy or anything, but let's put it this way - I was the only 1 not to be married in a church.  If I had to "label" myself, I'd say Pagan.  Husband.JPG is agnostic; bordering now toward atheism.

We've decided to raise BabySpawn to live by the mantra "Be excellent to each other."  If he asks questions like, "Who is Jesus?" I will tell him he's a great example of a good person who tried to help people when he was able.  Stuff like this.  If he asks other questions, I want to be honest with him.  If he wants to go to church with my dad, that's fine.  Really I want him to follow what is right in his heart.  Even if he decides he wants to be an atheist.

I guess what I find shocking is that people don't understand that you can be an atheist and *still* be an awesome, great person, just like you can be religious and be a horrible person.

FFS, morals are what's important, not what you call your gods. </TEXT>
