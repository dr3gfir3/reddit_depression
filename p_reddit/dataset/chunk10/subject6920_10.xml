	<TEXT> Is there anyone in this country that thinks Comey has been competent in the last year and a half? Dems hated him when he investigated Clinton, Republicans hated him for not recommending charges, dems hated him again when he re-opened the investigation into the emails, and now they suddenly think he's doing a great job because he's part of a trump investigation. The hypocrisy is hilarious </TEXT>
