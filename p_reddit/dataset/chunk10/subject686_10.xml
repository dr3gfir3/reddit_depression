	<TEXT> When I was a kid (maybe 10 years old), my mom gave me money to pay for some school stuff. I told her I accidentally lost some of it, but what I really did was, that I bought a small LEGO set. She had financial problems at the time, and she was angry that I "lost" it. I've never told her what I did. 

Even though I often payed her bills when I got older, and "lend" her some money, it still haunts me to this day because I consider myself a good guy.

	<TEXT> 1. Imagine getting a period, being punched in the stomach, and getting sick. At the same time. 

That's the reason we can't even move for a while after someone punches us in the balls.

2. I have no problem with sharing. The problem becomes when you don't know how the woman will react. It can make us look soft even if we are not. That is often a turn off for women. 

3. My GF gave birth 4 months ago. I felt even bigger respect for her, she took it like a champ and all the time I was wishing for it to be over asap so she can get some rest. She is awesome 3

EDIT: grammar and additional answers
