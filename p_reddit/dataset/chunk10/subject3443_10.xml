	<TEXT> yes it is just my opinion. In any case we saw in 205 that Conor was very good checking leg kicks. Eddie could only throw like 2 or 3 leg kicks because he said Conor checked one and damaged him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. Eddie implemented the wrong game plan. He tried to box with Conor. I am not saying that with the right game plan Eddie would win, but he knows there's that left for him.

I think Aldo's loss was more embarrassing. He got KO cold in 13s. It was not a fluke when Conor was trying that exact movement in the training room. 

I think Aldo has nothing for Conor. I think in a rematch Eddie is more likely to beat Conor than Aldo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wonder how does the UFC manage to get such SHITTY AUDIO QUALITY. This is like worse than when they were communicating with guys in the moon during the 60s.

Both Conor and Nate have iphones, and iphones sound kind of decent. Probably the journalist too. I wonder where the UFC fucks up everything. Plenty of people do phone interviews (see Ariel for example), and it sounds much better.

Also it seems the UFC have some sort of noise cancelling filter which kills the signal completely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a rule of thumb, people dislikes / hates anyone who tried to peek above the rest. In the guitar world, Chapman and Captain and 2 of the most public personas, and their Youtube channel is probably the best. That's the only reason why they are hated.

I love their channel, I think it is a lot of fun and I think they make a lot of cool videos.

Regarding their guitars, no idea, I never played one, and I don't really like how they look, but hey, each to their own. I am sure that for the price range they are quite good guitars. They are hated for the same thing I said before, the idea of someone even trying to do it. </TEXT>

It is the UK who thinks that the Britain is hundreds of miles away from mainland Europe, and it is the UK who wants to eject from the EU.

If the UK comes tomorrow and says "fuck brexit, we are in again", it'd be received with open arms from the EU.

So don't phrase this like the EU "ejecting out" the UK, when it is the other way around. </TEXT>

Thanks to the UK being out the Turkey question is also done now (the UK were the only ones lobbying for them).

With anti EU movements being shafted in mainland Europe and the UK out, I think it is time for real integration.  </TEXT>

I guess you mean enormously bad, because that would mean plenty of countries would opt for that, and that would mean the death of the EU.

In case you think "but that's great! we all separated with only positive agreements!"

That is impossible, because every EU country wants something different. Most EU countries wouldn't want a free trade agreement with Germany, for example, because it clearly goes in one direction. Spain would prefer an open market with chinese, american and european products instead of buying overpriced german and french products. On the other hand, Spain wants free movement because it is good for tourism, and it wants EU investment for its agriculture that they would sell in EU.

That's why the EU works, one for me, one for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only reason why they don't go down is FPTP. This system makes it almost impossible for parties outside the top2 to win seats, and seats is the only thing that matters. This influences the electorate into voting A or B. It is a cycle that reinforces itself.

By the same reason Labour is one of the strongest "old school social" parties of Europe. See what happened in France, in Greece, Italy, Spain, Austria or recently in the Netherlands. In all these countries the classic "social labour" is kind of smashed, and they were in power not long ago.

This is not because Labour is doing better than them, but just because how the FPTP. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By the way, in this case, Whirlpool is an american company, and the only reason why they manufacture in France is in order to sell products in the EU avoiding tarifs and the like.

	<TEXT> The reason why France exports so much to countries like Spain or Italy is because the borders are open, which means there are no tarifs. Which means you can manufacture something in Lyon, put it in a truck, and sell it 5 hours later in Barcelona.

This gives France a huge advantage when compared to other countries like USA, Canada, Russia, China, India or Japan. They need to go through customs, they need to pay tarifs.

If there were no open borders, then french products would need to compete head to head in Barcelona (as an example) with american or chinese products.  And there's no way France can compete against them (keeping high wages).

As an example, the car market, in Spain 3 of the top5 selling brands are french (the other 2 german). You need to go to the 9th position to see a non european brand (toyota) (ford is 6th, which is american, but they are manufactured in Spain).

If you think that the 8 most selling car brands in Spain are all european just because they are the best, then you are wrong. The EU is a market that protects itselfs. Renault gets all the possible help to sell its cars in Spain, while Toyota gets as many hurdles as possible, to the point that some non eu brands manufacture in EU in order to sell as EU (such as Nissan in the UK, or as said Ford in Spain), which is good for us as europeans because it brings jobs in.

To answer your question, with closed borders France can still export loads, but good luck competing with the chinese products then. </TEXT>

I am from some other city where it is also rare to see the police around, but I remember watching a TV documentary about the police in the centre of my city, and at some point there was a map with moving dots, and there were almost a police person in every corner.

I am sure there are a lot of them in civilian clothes around glasgow. Generally if you can see big guys with sunglasses, caps and a backpack, it can be a policeman. People like this too: https://www.indymedia.org.uk/images/2011/11/488317.jpg

	<TEXT> I disagree when you say that those events were "tame". You need to put things on perspective. Now they are tame because we have some worse stuff in the UFC, but back then, the idea of 2 guys in a cage, no rules, fighting to simulated death, was pretty brutal.

I never watched those events live, and I was a kid back then. I used to love fighting shit like Bruce Lee, JCV, Rocky,... and I remember a friend of mines had a magazine were they talked about the first UFC events, and it looked brutal.

The first time I watched one of those fights was around the start of Youtube, something like 2008, someone put some of the fights there I think (or maybe it was google videos, I don't even remember). I know around 2008 the UFC was well developed and it already had big stars like GSP, but I really had no idea about it. But I remember watching videos about UFC1 and shit like that, and I thought they were brutal. The idea of 2 guys in a cage fighting to death was tense as fuck.

I don't know, everything is relate to its time. Yesterday I was watching a movie from the 30s which is supposed to be a masterpiece. After 20 minutes I stopped it because I was bored, so I checked why people thought the movie was so good, and basically a lot of the stuff that made that movie good are things that nowadays we take for granted. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any mid range budget Hotel recommendation? Or mid range budget area where to stay? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-21 12:44:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have used the search engine, and I also checked the "tips for tourists", but I couldn't really find much about hotels (apart from people asking for the cheapest ones).

I will go to NYC 10 days during October, and we are looking for a mid range hotel where to stay. Our budget is around 250-300 per night (I would say this is high in Europe, not like 5 stars high, but like high range hotel), I hope this would translate into something good and decent in NYC. Obviously if we could get something cheaper, like 200 a night, that would be amazing, but so far everything we can see is around that range.

The only thing I have seen is people recommending to stay as far as possible from Times Square as possible, which we will do.

Because we are going for 10 days, our idea was to stay the first 5 days very near Central Park (because we like that location a lot), and then the last 5 days move to somewhere not as "central" but which gives more bang for the buck.

It would be very useful if you could recommend hotels, or places where to check later on on Trip Advisor or stuff like that.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am 31, and I think that the 3DS is the perfect system for old working people, because we have very limited time, so it is perfect to play in smal bursts, in the train, things like that.

On the other hand it would be impossible for me to play a PS4 or a Xbone, I just don't have the time to sit down and play for 1 hour, and when I have it I do prefer something more relaxing because I am usually tired.

Where I work people is more or less my age, and I don't know a single person with a Ps4 or xbox, most people have a 3DS or play phone games. This is why as an old guy I don't see ps4 or xbox as "adult consoles", but more like consoles for teenagers or guys in their early 20s (more childish, because that's only when you have so much free time). I wish I could have the time to enjoy them though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any recommendation for rodent control? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-14 16:10:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These last 2 nights I think I have heard rats or mice in my flat or very near it. I live in a ground floor, and we have had problems with rats in the backgarden for a few years (since a supermarket opened in our street, before that we were fine). But I never heard anything inside or near my flat, even though a council rat trap is just outside my window.

I haven't seen them, so I might be wrong, but I think I heard them. Today inspecting the area where the noises come from (a tiny room with a washing machine), I saw a pipe that goes to the ground, and a decent opening in my ground and in the walls near it were rats could easily sneak in. This wall is connected to a communal room in the close were the council placed some time ago a rat trap.

I have been checking through amazon to see what I can buy, but I am a bit lost. The acoustic stuff seems nice, but most people say it doesnt work. I don't see myself setting traps or stuff like that. I do prefer some sort of rat killer that the rats can eat or preferably some sort of repeller, but all the views for repellers are sort of bad.

Any recommendation? I really don't know what to do, but the idea of going to sleep and hearing rats around stresses me a lot. I have contacted the council a few times but they don't do anything. Just once like 2 years ago they put some traps, but that is it.

This is in the West End / Byred rd by the way. One of the big problems of living in building with mostly students is that they don't seem to give a fuck about anything, so the backgarden has been a horrible mess for a while with food, pizzas boxes and shit like that. This is probably attracting the rats, and my flat is just the nearer one. </TEXT>

Most people (myself included) have shitty integrated sound cards, and when we try to use it to play the guitar with Amplitube or GuitarRig, the latency makes it impossible and that's why in that situation getting something like a Focusrite is very useful. If you already have a decent sound card, the latency will be probably OK. So basically I suggest you connect your guitar directly to the sound card, and see how it goes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> as someone with a mexican telecaster, and a american stratocaster, the difference in quality between both guitars are huge.

I also used to be in the "mexicans are the same as americans" because for 10 years my main guitar was a mexican telecaster, but the moment I got the american stratocaster (and it was second hand from 99, while my tele was from 05, and dont start with the "uff the good mexicans are from 07 to 12" or whatever mythical stuff people say), the differences were HUGE.

Not really about tone, but about "feeling". the american just feels like a better guitar, the weight is more balanced, the finish is better, the neck feels better, the electronics look better. I don't know, every component piece feels much better. The stratocaster is 6 years older, and I mostly played my telecaster in my bedroom, but it just feels to be in a better state. Like the knobs, the jack connector, everything just seems better.

So I don't think there's a big difference in "tone", but if you get a 10 years old mexican and a 10 years old american, the american will feel much much better.

There is a reason why the guitars are 600 dollars cheaper. </TEXT>

lol you never stop upgrading.

About your question, I think any moment is good to upgrade, but if you have been only playing for 2 months, maybe going with a $600 guitar is too much. You can get cheap decent guitars for like 150-200$, or maybe even a bit less if you go second hand. I would upgrade your guitar into something decent in that range, and then after 1 year or so, decide if upgrading to the $600 guitar. </TEXT>
