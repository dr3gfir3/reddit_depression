	<TEXT> Omg it happened again!

I was at the grand exchange trying to make my money back after being killed by a stupid wizard, and this guy played a prank on me where he disguised himself as gold lol. Then he asked what I was up to and I told him about my situation and he gave me 1000k gp! Thank you kind person!!!! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't played runescape in about 10 years and just recently got back into it. I'm so glad the old version still exists!

Anyway, I barely know what I'm doing now bc I forgot everything and all my skills have been reset for some reason so I didn't have anything. 

Then this one player came up to me and asked to trade, so I told him I didn't have anything to trade but he insists we trade and he gave me 3 rune axes (I think?) and told me to go sell them in GE! I was so surprised because most of the players I've come across are so mean to (kind of) noobs like me. So I just wanted to thank you, kind stranger, for helping me out :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry if the picture is a little dark! I got 3 rollers, up the wooden hill emotibomb, you snap the whip body butter, and after 8:30 massage bar! I love how everything smells, roller especially . I asked for a sample of mermaid fun but I didn't get it, totally fine though. I got samples of outback mate, gorgeous, none of your bees wax, and rainbow fun :) I'm so excited! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, the best you can do for him is be there for him through surgery and treatment (if he needs either/or). Also if you can stay with him at the hospital if he needs to stay overnight it's really helpful to have someone there.  It really all depends on his type of tumour/location/treatment. He might need a lot of help or he might not. Just let him know you are there for him if he needs you and that he can count on you. :) </TEXT>
