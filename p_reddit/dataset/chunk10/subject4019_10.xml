	<TEXT> I'm currently reading David Copperfield and I can't understand what Dickens is saying at all. I mean, I understand some of his contemporaries but I can't for the life of me ever understand Dickens. I'd like to read him because I think his prose is beautiful but the problem is I can't comprehend much of it. Do you guys have any tips on tackling Dickens?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yesterday I went to my a psychiatrist's office and was formally diagnosed as bipolar 1. Though I feel that I should have been diagnosed with cyclothymia but the problem is I haven't had it for 2 years, only about a year, year and a half at most. But I don't fit the criteria for mania or major depression. I've had major depression before this all started and it doesn't feel like anything I'm experiencing now. I call it depression-lite. And I feel like more fall in line with hypomania than mania. What do I do?

	<TITLE> How do you get your reading stamina back after years of mental health problems? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-13 19:47:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since 2014 (the year I graduated high school), I've been having a host of mental health problems, which caused me to not be able to read. The concentration I earned from elementary school through high school had been completely obliterated, I couldn't even finish a book, and when I did, it took me almost a year. Currently I'm trying to read *A Clash of Kings, Pride and Prejudice, As I Lay Dying, and Tess of the D'Urbervilles.* They aren't hard books to read, I'm just concerned with my current reading stamina. I used to be able to read all day, in fact, when I was in classes I didn't care for, I just read the whole time. It seems like a stupid question, I know, but how does one get that kind of stamina back?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>    Jacaerys couldn't sleep. He rolled left, right, and left again but his mind would not give in. Ever since his grandfather had told him that he had found a match for him, he had not slept well. All he could think about is what she'd be like, what she'd look like, if they'd get along well, and more importantly, if he'd make a good husband. 

   He tip toed out of his room and down the spiral staircase, the stone was cold on his bare feet, a relief from the sultry air in his room. 

"Master Jacaerys, what are you doing up?" a lone maid said, dusting the furniture.

"Hmm?" he said, not realizing she was there. "Oh nothing, thinking is all."

"About what my lord?" she asked, tucking a strand of black hair behind her ear.

"Oh, just the future," he said, finally looking at her. 

   She was the most beautiful woman he had ever seen. She had curly black hair that went down to the middle of her back, light green eyes, and tanned olive skin. Jacaerys wondered if it was too late to get out of the engagement, for he knew that no woman was as beautiful as her. 

"Are you new? I don't recall us having a maid as beautiful as you, I would have remembered," he smiled.

She chuckled, "Yes, my lord. I previously worked in Sunspear."

"What did you do there?" he asked, taking a seat on the couch. 

"I worked in a whorehouse," she said, dusting the mantle.

Jacaerys looked down, "Ah. I'm sorry."

"Don't be, I made a lot of money whoring," she chuckled.

"Why did you quit then, surely you made more than you do here?" he asked.

"I got tired of it. So when Lord Aron came to Sunspear looking for maids, I thought it was the perfect time to leave," she said, sitting down beside him.

"Would you like a drink? I know where my grandfather keeps the good wine," he smiled.

"Let's go," she said, getting up off the couch.

   Jacaerys couldn't remember anything after that. To him, it was a blur of laughter, drinking, and passionate love making. He woke up the next morning in a daze, naked, lying in his bed. The maid's side of the bed was still hot. *Where has she gone off to?*  </TEXT>

 I agree wholeheartedly that the two sides of Westeros should strengthen their bonds with each other, however my granddaughter Nymeria is currently a ward of the Hightowers of Oldtown. Your son may be able to visit her there, if Lady Dyanna wills it.

 Ser Aron Santagar

[M] Sounds like a no, it's not, she's just a ward of the Hightowers right now. Also, I'm not sure if you're new or not, but never ask larger houses for a betrothal, most of the time it's a no since we're not very prominent, but occasionally it can be a yes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oldtown was just how her sister Nymella described it, it almost seemed endless. And the people, the amount of people she had seen in Oldtown made Sunspear look like a wasteland; people were packed into every street corner. Whether it be whores flirting, butchers chopping up meat, or drunks fighting in the streets; she loved it. 

"Oldtown is wonderful," she said, looking around.

"Come, we must meet Lady Dyanna," her grandfather said, walking faster. "She'll be expecting us."

"Grandfather, slow down, wouldn't you like to look around?" she asked.

"No, Lady Dyanna is expecting us, now come," he said, looking behind.


When they finally got to the Hightower, Jeyne couldn't believe how huge it was. She tried to look all the way up, but even at 180 degrees she couldn't see all the way up. 

"We're here to see Lady Dyanna," Ser Aron smiled.

"Come," the tall guard said.  </TEXT>

 Princess Arianne, I write to you today in hopes of asking for a betrothal between your granddaughter, Alyse Sand and my grandson, the future Knight of Spottswood. True, we are a small and unimportant house, however we make up for it with our unwavering loyalty to House Martell. I believe this would be a good match for both parties, I pray to the Seven that you think likewise. 

 Sincerely,

 Ser Aron Santagar, Knight of Spottswood  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I mean, I get it, she's tired of raising kids, but it's like she completely forgot about her being their guardian. I do agree that everyone needs to take on more responsibility in the house, but threatening to kick out your children if they don't pay rent is over the line, especially with Carl, since he's the one who bought the house. Technically, Fiona bought it but Carl was the one who provided the money, she wouldn't have a pot to piss in if it wasn't for him. I also think throwing everything on Lip abruptly was a fucked up thing to do, she's telling everyone to take more responsibility, yet she's not taking it when it comes to the kids, does she not know she's legally responsible for them? The judge told her this would be a big burden and she still said yes, she should've listened to the judge if she was going to pull some shit like this. I hope I'm not the only one who thinks she was a total bitch in season 7. 

Don't even get me started with her leaving Harri with Debbie while she was in an interview so she could get a job like Fiona told her to do. Seems like the entirety of season 7 is just her shirking domestic responsibilities.

I'm done with Fiona. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is going to be a stretch but here we go, hopefully someone else will like the idea. I would have the game take place during the age of the Roman Empire, from it's infancy to its death, obviously spanning multiple generations and multiple Assassins/Templars (that way you get both sides of the conflict.) The Templars would be the nobility and other prominent people during that time period while the Assassin's would be just another random guy/gal in the crowd. When you're an Assassin your goal will be to take down the Roman Empire from it's roots by infiltrating the government and assassinating Templars as usual, or you can let them live, that's another thing I'd add: Dialogue choices. That and assassinations would be completely free, no optional objectives or anything, you see a guy, you take  him out your way, no illusion of choice like Syndicate. And you have a town that's your base and you can obviously upgrade it and watch it change throughout time (same goes for Templars.) When you're a Templar though you focus on taking out the Assassin's all threw out the Roman Empire from Bethlehem to Britain and everywhere in between, maybe even other places the Roman Empire tried to conquer. Obviously there would be many weapons, and a myriad of gear/weapon upgrades, collectibles, and base/town upgrades (like in 2 I believe, haven't played it, but I remember someone telling me that was a thing in one of the games. I'd add naval combat and you're on ship, but I wouldn't personally make it upgradeable, just really to get you from place to place, and maybe the occasional naval battle.

I would have it be a completely open world, no locked doors; an open world  like Witcher 3. I would take Syndicates day/night cycle and mash it with Unity's graphics and fine sense of detail, and have it run well. The map would be at least four times bigger than BF. 

Ah, oh well. I'm afraid this game will never get made. Our current consoles/PCs couldn't take it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By Goldilocks I mean most enjoyable missions, side quests, etc. I mean I personally have only played 3, BF, Rogue, and Syndicate, but it seems like it could be the most rounded one. For the most part it had pretty enjoyable missions (same could be said about Rogue though) and a nice amount of side activities (more would always be nice imo, but c'est la vie.) But then again I haven't played 1,2, Revelations, Brotherhood, Liberation, or Unity so I could be dead wrong. If it isn't, which one in your opinion is the Goldilocks of the franchise so far? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are all the characters' names completely different? Where's Altair? Where's Desmond? Why the hell is it in Spain? Why not have it during the Crusades? What was up with the Animus? It seemed like all they did was use a very vague Assassin's Creed template and stuck a bunch of random characthers (that were based off of the ones in the games) in it. I'm not asking this to stir up controversy or anything, I genuinely don't know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been out of high school for about 3 years now (it'll be 3 in June) and haven't done anything with my life so far. No job, can't drive (medical condition), and severely depressed and suicidal. The only thing I've ever wanted to do with my life was write for a living and just to be told that it's a stupid idea by society, it just ripped my fucking heart out. Honestly, if I can't make it as a writer, I'm gonna wind up killing myself, I can't stand the thought of being a wage slave, I'd honestly rather be dead. I don't know how so many people do it. 

Anywho, time for the question. What do I do now? Do I continue trying to write even though I can never completely finish a project, or should I just end it all. It's really one or the other at this point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd have to disagree. Of course it wasn't as flashy as Unity, but at least it wasn't nearly as buggy (not to say Syndicate is flawless in that department, it's not) as Unity was; I mean there's still numerous bugs that the patches failed to fix. It's better than when it first came out, much better, but I'd still reckon it's buggier than Syndicate. I do agree with you though about customization, there wasn't as many options as I would've preferred, compared to what seemed to be endless customization in Unity, I guess that's just the trade off.  I don't know about that last one, the side quests were pretty interesting, and they tied into the story pretty well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sad thing is, there are actually areas on Earth where Christians are persecuted and they're even killed if anyone finds out, but Americaisn't one of them.

America was never a Christian country but the majority was always Christian, and because of that, they got special privileges, and now since there are other people of different religions (and some without) living in America, they don't want their children force fed Christianity at school, and they don't want it involved in the government either, which is understandable, no religion should have an upper hand in the state. But since Christianity has always had an upper hand in America and now it's being brought down to a level playing field, they think they're being persecuted because they're losing their special privileges. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Selwyn was strolling in the garden, thinking about Avia and his future with her when his elderly grandfather came up behind him. He was wearing a blue doublet with a leopard pin on his left breast. His once bald head had begun to grow shaggy white hair. 

"Grandfather, are you all right? You don't look too well," Selwyn said, hoping he didn't just offend his grandfather.

"Except for being old, I'm quite well," the old man smiled, "How are you, Selwyn?"

"I'm fine, grandfather," he lied.

"What's wrong Selwyn?" Ser Aron asked again.

"I've always wanted a boy," he said looking up into the cloudless sky, "but I'm afraid that Avia doesn't wish to have children."

"Nonsense, why wouldn't she, look at you, Selwyn!" he said jokingly. "These things take time, don't worry. In fact, your grandmother and I didn't have your uncle until the third year."

Somehow that made Selwyn feel better, he decided to go up to his room to see his beautiful lady, smiling all the way there. </TEXT>

I mean, we have to forcibly kick natives out of their homes because there's oil? That's absolutely disgusting, this is just one example, there's plenty more. As for what I meant when I said "rebellious," I meant non conformist, anti government, etc. I think I'm going to end this, I fear if I go on too long, I'll start ranting.

Honestly, I still wouldn't do it, but this has got to be the most I've ever thought about doing it. I mean, she was right, don't get me wrong.

	<TEXT> 1. Athenaze says it takes the dative, does it take another case instead? Ah, it hasn't introduced  yet.

2. Ooh, did not know that, thank you. The book glosses the article with the word, I guess I thought they wanted me to use the article, the book emphasizes you which means it wants it there.

3. Yeah that's just wrong, nothing to say to that, should be .

5. I thought it meant so? The book said to flip them, I thought it was odd too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know what you're talking about. Was depressed last year, it eventually turned into Bipolar II. Anywho, I think the root of the problem is, like someone else said, people don't really know what depression is. In my experience, most people think it's just sadness and say "don't be sad, be happy!" or something along those lines and since that works for them when they're sad, they think it'll work for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Selwyn couldn't help but feel sorry for his wife, no lady deserved to see someone die, especially not one so beautiful. He embraced her tightly but said nothing, for nothing could make this better but time. He reached into his pocket and gently wiped her tears with a blue and white handkerchief. 

"Don't worry my love, I'm not very much interested in jousting," he chuckled trying to make her feel better. "I promise I'll die old in our bed."

He knew he couldn't control how he would die, for all he knew, he could die on a hunt, jaguars have killed many men and nothing is stopping them from killing him, but he lied anyway, he didn't wish to see his wife so upset.

"Is there anything I can do for you, my love?" he asked, gently.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It had been a long night, luckily for him, he couldn't remember half of it, the last thing he could remember was taking that brunette girl, what was her name again? Vaelana? It didn't matter, the only thing that mattered right now was this headache. *By gods, next time I've got to go easier on the wine. Oh who am I kidding? Ughhh.*

"Are you all right?" the brunette beside him asked.

He removed the blankets and got up out of bed, groaning, "What happened last night?"

She looked at him and chuckled, "Your guess is as good as mine."

With that, he put clothes back on and headed out of the pillow house.

"Wait, you forgot your chain," she pointed down at the floor, for she couldn't pick it up. "Are you a maester?"

"I was," he said, picking up the chain. "Though I don't very well think they'll want me back."

"Why do you say that?" she asked, intrigued about what had happened to Quentyn.

"It's a long story," he said, looking for the glass candles in his robe. Luckily, he found them.

"Well, Vaelana," he said, still unsure of her name, "It was nice to meet you."

"My name's Jeyne," she said, grabbing the blanket to cover herself up.

"Ah, doesn't matter really. Who is Vaelana then? I suppose that doesn't matter much either. Any who, it was a pleasure to meet you," he lied.

She scoffed and left, the blanket leaving a trail behind her. Quentyn shrugged and left the dusty old pillow house.

When he got out pillow house, the streets of Lannisport were just beginning to wake. The sky was blue with wispy streaks of pink running across of it. The air smelled like fish and fresh bread, and the only sounds that could be heard were the sounds of the dock workers talking, and high above them stood Casterly Rock.
