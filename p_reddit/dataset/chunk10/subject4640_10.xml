	<TEXT> This is obviously an advertising article for EndTest: Look at the medium posting history of the author. He is writing articles about web development, where he is linking and recommending this product in nearly all of them (Most hilarious one: "The 10 Most Common Mistakes Web Developers Make" - mistake 4: you don't use EndTest).



If you read this linked article, it becomes pretty obvious. Also, take a look at the posting history of his reddit user. I recommend to downvote or delete this thread. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I have noticed this too, some of my customers really got upset about this. I think this is where the banks are digging their graves right now: It's ok to follow the law for blocking transactions and be transparent about it, but totally not ok to make up own random rules and refusing to tell me about them. 



I can only recommend to switch the bank as soon as possible, since if they start with this bullshit, they will continue with this in other areas as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a lot of work to do all that social media PR yourself. If you can afford it, I can recommend to 'outsource' this. Especially since there are now quite a lot of social websites existing. There are recently websites popping up trying to help you with this, like thunderclap or headtalker, but I haven't tried these yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, that's pretty bad. Back then, when Flash games were popular, this was a common thing. Flash died, and it looks like with the Greenlight gates open, Steam will replace this now? Uh, I hope not.


When this was a problem for Flash game developers, you just had to live with this. You could try to make it more difficult by using some kind of DRM, but that was it. </TEXT>
