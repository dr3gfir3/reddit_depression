	<TEXT> Cool OK. I don't think Alien is trying to surprise the audience with the death scenes, except perhaps for the airvent 'jump'. Weirdly, despite what may seem cliched, I still think it feels completely fresh and timeless each time I see it. I guess its just one of those things where people see it differently for all sorts of individual reasons.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What do you think of Jonathan Glazer's Birth (2004)? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:38:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> On release, Birth was pretty slammed by critics and audiences, and seems to largely go ignored. Its not even available on bluray. It only has 38% on [RT](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/birth/), 6.1 on [IMDB](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337876/). But in light of Sexy Beast and Under The Skin being so well thought of now, I wonder if people realize how overlooked and misunderstood Birth was?      

Personally, I think a lot of its criticism came from the discomfort of the story, implying reincarnation and Nicole Kidman getting into a bath with a boy thinking he's her late husband. But the story is so much more than that. At the time I think the ambiguities were met with impatience, because people didn't have a reason to trust Glazer's intentions (as with say, Tarkovsky, Lynch or Villeneuve). But if released now, I think it would be appreciated in a completely different way. Not that its even *that* ambiguous, the reveal actually dispenses completely with any supernatural allusions, and makes it far more about the complexities of human belief and how it can form so strongly by a mix of imagination and motive.  

Its also the closest film I know to deserving the circlejerky label of "Kubrickian". The direction is meticulous, the story told so cleanly and robustly with a strong sense of visual aesthetics and plenty of implied depth between the lines. A few really ballsy, jarring moments (Danny Huston spanking the boy, Kidman staring for minutes whilst thinking at the opera). There are also lots of little homages to Kubrick: the jogging tracking shot of the opening is like Bowman running around the ship in 2001, the silhoetted tunnel death is shot like the similar scene in A Clockwork Orange, the kid throwing a ball against the wall like Jack in The Shining, Kidman in the posh apartment feels like Eyes Wide Shut.  

Just wondered what y'all think of it. If you haven't seen, its absolutely worth watching, from a visual direction point of view alone its awesome.

	<TEXT> Can I ask how you watched them? I always feel with detailed and opinionated reviews like this, its important to understand the context of the experience. I've seen Alien three times at the cinema, and every time it was absolutely incredible. Genuinely, with exception to a packed screening of Sicario, I've never known an audience to be part of such a tense, claustrophobic shared experience (and I'm guessing most of the audience, like me, had already seen it more than once). There's so much depth, atmosphere, and well-judged artistic choices, I'd go on all day in explaining it. But if you watch it on a laptop with high expectations, waiting for the "good bits" and not letting yourself sink into it (for example) then the experience will be much worse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope its story holds up better than Prometheus! I could never figure out why Shaw et al assumed the engineers made us, there's no real evidence of it (assuming she didn't watch the prologue). Can I ask another question about Compliance - Did Craig have you watch the Law and Order episode about the same case, with Robin Williams playing the caller?   

Compliance gets such a lot of flack from people saying "morons! they deserve it for being so stupid!" etc, which I always found massively unfair and distracting away from the core aspects of human nature that make people vulnerable to influence, especially when layered like that over time. I thought Craig did a *fantastic* job on researching and writing it so authentically. I really want to see Great World of Sound but can't find it anywhere in UK! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   You made some contradictory observations on the Z4 vs the Homido even before you purchased the Homido

That's simply not true, why are you saying that? I didn't comment on the Hv2 at all before purchase, I [asked questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/68uq8a/homido_v2_vs_bobovr_z4_vs_fiitvr_re_anything/dh1qejz/), stated I would get one, then that I had gotten one.    

You've basically played the standard disinformation cards of: "everything" I've written is wrong (or mind-boggling), its all lies because I haven't proven it, my opinion differs vastly those those with a proven purchase (i.e "everyone else likes it so therefore you're wrong"). If I seem defensive, its obviously because you're trying to disrepute my opinion (although you'll no doubt see it as *evidence of lying*).   

You said "everything" is mind-boggling. Can you disagree with *any* of these factors:  
- The Hv2 weighs 421gms, and if front heavy compared to the Bobo (weighing 430gms)  
- The focus wheel for the lenses takes a lot longer to adjust than the Bobo after changing IPD    
- The front panel clamp requires two hands to clasp and unclasp  
- The FOV isn't greater than the Bobo   
- The Hv2 is more than twice as expensive than the Bobo and doesn't have headphones   

No? Then it seems the only thing that's really mind-boggling, unless you want to stop generalising, is the issue regarding clarity. I have no idea why we disagree on that but we clearly do. My Hv2 lenses have *a lot* of edge distortion and light refraction/flaring which has nothing to do with QR codes.   

Here's your [proof](http://imgur.com/vhhQmTv).

	<TEXT> Mind-boggling? Completely random? There's nothing random about it. What in particularly are you stumped about?     

Bobo more comfortable: Hv2 weighs 421gms, Bobo weighs 430gms *with* the headphones. Its simply far more comfortable, with the balanced weighting of the headphones. Hv2 feels far more front heavy. Not *too* heavy, I'm sure someone buying one as a first headset would be fine with it, but I'm specifically comparing it with the Bobo (which I do find more comfortable).   

Focus wheel: Yes, I prefer having a more immediate focus on the lens when adjusting IPD than having to turn the wheel a bunch of times. Its a minor point, in a comparison review something I thought worth mentioning.    

More detailed image on the Bobo: Yes, as mentioned the Bobo shows slightly more of the screen than the Hv2 (using an LGG4), hence more detail. That kind of thing matters when watching a cinema screen for example.  
Edit - I just tried the cinema app again to test this. The Bobo gives a *tinier* bit more screen, but overall is much clearer. The Hv2 has a definite distortion ring around the edge. I had a scene from Alien where it was dark on the left side and brighter on the right - the left edge of the lens cast a ghostly white flare against the dark, reflecting something from the right side. Its just annoying, and reduces the overall visible area. The Bobo lens doesn't have this issue at all.  </TEXT>

I think it has a really interesting story, in terms of Ripley being the outsider whilst the beast is repressed a little until they realise they need to team up to defeat it. I find it much more interesting in atmosphere, art design and direction than Resurrection. It has subtext and themes, and feels like a real story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the engineer stuff being implied under a veil of mystery, the more its spelled out the more 'human' and within the realms of a writer's imagination the whole thing becomes. When just implied, it feels beyond imagination, like its just something mankind isn't supposed to understand. I feel that a genuine other alien race like that would have communication/politics/beliefs/intelligence levels that are just *so* otherworldly that a coherent story could barely relate to it. For example, the scene with David pressing the blobby buttons and interpreting their starmaps, learning their language - its just way too human. Gone is the complete other-worldly mystery of the original set in Alien, and now we have this clinical set, blobby lighty-up buttons, perfect CGI orrerys - it just kills the imagination a little for me. Prometheus made me realise how much the atmosphere and other-worldly terror of Alien really relied on HR Giger's completely 'out there' designs. Without that, I'm sure it would have much more resembled a standard 70s alien sci-fi. In Covenant, I'd much prefer to see the aftermath of engineer activities and structures, to piece together intentions and agendas. I hate that they're called engineers though, when they're no more engineers than man (making spaceships and whatnot). The whole "they created us" thing just jars with me, when they apparently catalysed our evolution at best. They really don't seem to have much of a clue when it comes to engineering organisms, judging by the fact they more or less wiped themselves out in that pyramid, the last one thinking "fuck this" and putting himself in a cryopod. They could just as easily be called "clumsies" or "mess-abouters". It would be interesting to see different societies of engineers had been at war, so one took off to LV223 to create weapons, used Earth as a kind of easter island experiment zone, then maybe destroyed themselves so the other side won, but then the other side had to deal with the aftermath. Humans then pose a strange part of the equation in being an off-shoot of the weapon and therefore part of the enemy.         

The thing I like most about Prometheus is the psychological aspect of a person's belief system (or what they imagine about things without realising they're imagining it, like unconscious imagination) colliding with harsh reality. I'm really tired of seeing stupid characters in modern films though and hope that the writers realise by now that characters don't have to mimic modern audiences to be engaging and relatable.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My comparison of Homido V2 against BoboVR Z4 (and Fiit) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 17:28:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently bought a Homido V2, already being a BoboVR owner, so thought I'd share my thoughts for anyone weighing all this up. Firstly, I had a **Fiit** before, and didn't like it. I know that Maria (can't find her username) [loves them](http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/2016/03/review-lenest-viewer-is-close-to-perfect/) though. For me, the individually adjustable lenses are way too sensitive, meaning they go out of focus at the slightest touch (and your eyeballs/eyelashes often accidentally hit them if you have the lenses out too far). The asymmetric nature of their focusing means one eye might be better focused that the other, which causes headaches when your brain tries to marry the images. Ugh. Also, they have big ridges around the lenses which dig into your under-eyebrow if you position them so you can see through the center (rather than just under the center). Smaller FOV too, although the image is clear once focused. So I'm just going to exclude them now, as the BoboVR without headphones is better and about the same price (actually I think the BoboVR with headphones is a comparable price depending on where you are).   

I absolutely love the newer edition of the Bobo with the better solid magnet button, cleanable PVC/foam padding (*much* better than the old itchy foam stuff), and longer headphone jack (perfect for my LG G4 with jack on the bottom rather than top of phone, allows for adjustable volume via the Bobo knob rather than messing with the phone). I also like the headphones - I know some people prefer their own, but the convenience of just putting the headset on and having full immersion is perfect for me. All round a very comfortable, light, balanced headset with great optics. 

Also check out [u/i-poker's comparison here](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/68uq8a/homido_v2_vs_bobovr_z4_vs_fiitvr_re_anything/). 

The **Homido V2**:   

*Phone lock mechanism* - I love the soft magnet closure of the Hv2, the clunky spring-clip of the Bobo often messes up your focus when force-closing it shut. But I found the actual phone clasp annoying on the Hv2. The Bobo has a nice soft ledge with adjustable edges, so you always know your phone is snug and centered the moment you place it in. The Hv2 has two claw-grips on the bottom and one on the top, all spring loaded. This means you have to use two hands to force them apart, before wedging the phone in. Two hands again to take the phone out. My LGG4 has a quickcircle soft case that bends around, and the strength of the claw is a bit concerning. I much prefer the gentle placing in on the Bobo. You also have to manually set the horizontal on the Hv2. U/i-poker's review has some extra useful points about screen size on this though.   

*View* - I prefer the Bobo. U/i-poker disagrees with me on this, so don't take my word for it, it might depend how you like your IPD (I like mine closer for a more 3D image at the sacrifice of a wider but more 2D FOV), or face/nose shape(?). Hv2 has a very, very similar size of view - I couldn't spot any significant difference at all. There are two disadvantages though. One is that there is a kind of fuzzy ring all the way around the lenses. Because each eye can see the fuzziness over the clarity of the other eye, it makes the view less comfortable in terms of stereopsis, because the brain has a harder time marrying up the images. (What I mean by this, is that near the clear center for one eye, will be slight fuzziness for the other eye, even with the IPD as close as it will go). I found the edge distortion much better on the Bobo. This was the biggest bugbear. After a while it gave me a headache. The second disadvantage is that the Hv2 magnifies ever-so-slightly more than the Bobo. This might be why there is more edge distortion. You basically don't see quite as much. On a cinema app, where I could just about see the whole screen on the Hv2, on the Bobo I could see more space to the sides of the screen too. Although its only slight, it means the image will be more detailed on the Bobo. Hope all that makes sense.    

*Comfort* - The Hv2 has very comfy padding, which blocks out light a little better than the Bobo. But because its SO padded, and pushed quite hard against the face, I found it misting up slightly more than I ever had on the Bobo. It also feels heavier. After using it a while, when putting on the Bobo, the Bobo feels almost weightless and less intense.     

*Other stuff* - Hv2 has a great focus mechanism for the lenses - its *very* precise and takes forever to turn the wheel to focus. I kind of prefer the faster mechanism on the Bobo though, if you switch your IPD for a different feel depending on the app, its nicer to instantly re-focus rather than spend ages turning the focus wheel. As I love the convenience of the headphones on the Bobo, it felt a distinct disadvantage having to use headphones on the Hv2. Obviously not a problem for anyone used to using their own headphones. I mostly use cinema apps, and like just putting the headset on and off when dealing with real-world stuff. Using separates just feels like more of a fuss. For the price, I massively prefer the BoboVR, which is 19.99 in UK compared to Homido's 49.99. I just can't see how it warrants the extra price *at all*. It feels like it should be about 15.99, like a more robust version of the Fiit. It does come with a lovely hard carry case though. It would be great to see a V3 of the Bobo with headphones that folded in, and a nice carry case. 

TL;DR, I much prefer the BoboVR Z4. u/i-poker has a different perception on this though, so do check out [his comparison](https://www.reddit.com/r/GoogleCardboard/comments/68uq8a/homido_v2_vs_bobovr_z4_vs_fiitvr_re_anything/) too.  

Edit - i-poker [found this](https://www.vr-iphone.com/2017/02/homido-v2-mobile-vr-review/) suggesting some fixes have been made to a variant of the V2. Although a "slight increase in FOV", I doubt it fixes the other problems I have with the headset, or the refracting light on the very edge of the lens. I'm not at all motivated to buy another one to find out.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a neat tip, thanks! I love this headset, especially the newer edition with the PVC/foam padding and longer headphone jack. Am so pleased they did that, it lets me retain the volume control using my LGG4.  

The only remaining niggle I have with the Bobo is the clasp mechanism of the front. I wish they'd made a nice magnetic one like the Homido V2, rather than one you really have to shove to click shut. The pressure of closing it messes up the focusing, as it pushes that whole front bit in. It means you have to refocus it every time you change to a different app. Not so much an issue when you're used to it, but a pain when showing friends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Homido V2 arrived today - just had a quick blast so will share my thoughts. I used the "cinema walk" app (where you can walk around a cinema, I had Aliens playing). It took a while to get it adjusted nicely. I like how massively precise the focusing is - you have to spin the wheel ALOT to really change the focus.  

I really don't notice a lot of difference to the BoboVR though! On my Bobo, I like the IPD set as minimal as possible so the images overlap more (more 3D, less FOV, but more immersive for me). What I notice on the Homido is that when I close each eye, there is more distortion on the inner edges of the eye, as well as less screen showing. Here's what I mean: so I'm standing in the middle of the cinema watching Aliens. On the HV2, If I close my left eye, the left edge of the right eye is a little distorted (brighter, stretched) and is just touching the left side of the cinema screen. Vice versa for left eye. On the Bobo, the edge distortion isn't as bad, and there is more of a gap between the edge of the FOV out of one eye and the cinema screen. So on the H2, each eye is seeing this brighter slightly stretched distortion running down the edges near the screen, but its nowhere near as bad on the Bobo. I can't see any difference with regards to that middle bit you were talking about, I have no idea why, maybe its a specific face shape thing? I also noticed that the Bobo is MUCH nicer balanced on the head, and feels so much lighter, almost weightless (I appreciate the headphones help balance the weight) whilst the H2 is much bulkier and front-loaded. Ehh. Its tough weighing them up. At this point I can't see any noticeable benefit of the H2 at all, but will test it loads more on different apps and see if it grows on me. What QR code did you use for it? I notice one doesn't come with it.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I rewatched The Fugitive recently and *really* enjoyed it. Its one of those rare occasions where an exciting, Saturday Movie style premise actually has good performances, writing and structure. Two things I love about it: how Tommy Lee's team all have their own characters and nuances, without being self-consciously showy like so many of today's films; how great the balance is between Kimble being truly lost in this urban jungle (helped by the interspersed aerial shots) but also constantly under pressure to not be discovered whilst solving the crime. The soundtrack is great too. I agree the ending could have had more 'oomph' in terms of the motives and redemption, but it was more a macguffin by that point to drive forward the cat/mouse relationship between Kimble and Tommy Lee (a bit like the story structure of North by Northwest).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its worth watching in terms of understanding where Ridley's mind is at with regards to events leading up to LV426. You need the back story for sure to appreciate Covenant.   

Cinematically it looks nice, and is very well designed, but never quite has that 'epic' space feel. Story-wise its a trainwreck. Listening to the commentary between the two feuding writers (one was brought in to redraft the other) there are LOTS of decisions made before, during and after shooting (i.e. editing) that change things and explain the incoherence in many areas.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some excellent thoughts there, I agree on all points. Interesting about the Hindu chariot, I didn't realise that at all. It being Christmas is another shoe-horned reference.  

Some other thoughts I had: Was it really logical for Shaw (or Weyland, anyone) to assume that whoever the visitors were in the cave paintings, had created us? I can't figure out this leap. It would surely just imply that creatures had visited, but there's no evidence that they had anything to do with our creation. Even if Shaw was going down that road, it would probably be more logical to think that we *were* the aliens who had visited. So they didn't create us anymore than primitive apes 'created' us.  

Along those lines, I think it would have been far more interesting as a film without the prologue. If it opened at the hole that Shaw makes in the cave (also, how the *hell* did she know about that cave before breaking in, maybe I missed something there) then we could have followed the mystery with all of them, not knowing. The first sight of the engineers would be the ghost recordings and head, which would have been far more exciting than having known about them beforehand. Sharing that surprise with the crew (i.e. not having been primed by the prologue) would have also shown how inappropriate their response was. Really they should be thinking "holy shit, what is this? An alien? Or did the aliens kidnap a human and this is what they evolved into?" There's still absolutely no evidence whatsoever that the engineers 'created' us, so when Holloway has that hissy fit in the deleted scene, it really makes no sense. The film seems to behave as though Shaw/Holloway had watched the prologue. Unless I'm missing something here?   

Also, when Shaw says "oh, stab it behind the ear, that should reactivate its neural centers" (or something to that effect, I have *no clue* how she suddenly become an expert pathologist of engineers.  

Really though, the real film is David's story, and I feel like the film completely belongs to him. His lines are a whole level beyond everyone elses, the balance of sardonic wit and sarcasm hinting at darker agendas is such good fun. I'm still not sure what his agenda was in knowing about the goo, infecting Holloway's drink, enjoying the alien foetus in Shaw and hoping to return it to earth.  

One other thought - how on earth would taking all the goo canisters to earth destroy us? Surely it would just turn us into billions of weird-as-fuck tentacled creatures which wouldn't help anyone.

	<TEXT> I love the soundtrack to Alien. The opening credits are amazing in their set up of what follows. You have this eerie, hollow, lonely and isolated vacuum of space sound, the ominous wind (that you can hear on LV426 and often on the ship). Then this little soft, slow melody starts, like someone thinking, dreaming or hoping. Then it cuts off with the little percussive rattle, like the cruel alien world snuffing it out. The music at the start of Aliens does a similar thing in a different way. Its so atmospheric and awesome, I fuckin' love it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Followed by "hehe, why don't you pay me on the other side?" LOLZ WE'RE ABOUT TO DIE! So terrible. Also, when Vickers says "ok... FATHER!" Or Shaw, having watched her boyfriend burn to death, had an alien foetus cut out of her, been attacked by a super-humanoid, watched it get killed by her now-massive 'baby', somehow crawls her way back to the crashed ship again (having already abseiled out of its vagina-door with a severed abdomen) first thing she asks David - "where's my cross?" "Oh yeah, its in my utility belt. Everything cool? Remember to pick up some milk? Still going to pilates tonight?"   

Also, the whole section left out where Weyland is dreaming whilst in cryo, of being on a weird futuristic boat (which they designed and built). As far as I can see, this was one of the main reasons to have Guy play Weyland, so he could play his younger self in the dreams. Without that, I always find his performance (and casting) as Weyland really distracting, because he really looks like a young guy plastered in makeup the whole time. The dream scenes could have been edited into a really eerie Twilight Zone/Black Mirror vibe if we (and him also) then suddenly realised they were just dreams, and he's actually super old and in the middle of space somewhere.   

The thing with Prometheus that bugs me the most is that it doesn't ever really feel like a real film. Despite the design work, it just lacks something. The acting, characters, dialogue, story and look of the whole thing all reek of TV. Its like HBO made a big-budget Alien spin-off TV season, using some cheap actors and a couple of big names (sorta like Westworld). There were loads of subplots and bits of philosophizing weaving in a few core themes etc (again like Westworld). Then, some fan edits together a 2 hour movie based on the 13 hour season. But it just feels a little choppy, and there clearly can't be a central core story or anything remotely cinematic in terms of atmosphere. All the allusions to creating, paternity, religion etc end up just feel ham-fisted and shoe-horned in out of context, missing the bits where they're fleshed out more across episodes.   

I hope to hell that Ridley returned to his cinematic senses a bit for Covenant.

	<TEXT> I just watched Prometheus 3D again after the docu, and it makes it far more of a frustrating watch. I can now appreciate all the work and design that went into *every single* visual element - building a buggy from scratch, the suits, all the amazing sets. But then the Scottish woman saying "yep shes totally doped up", Fifield getting high in his space suit, the other guy saying "come here little fella!" to a vicious looking alien, Shaw not grieving after Holloways death or twlling anyone about her crazy casarian, the captain immediately agreeing to Shaws flimsy rationale to crashing into the alien ship and his co-pilots immediate support, the terrible acting from that guy going on about his repetitive betting gag, Shaws recording saying "still searching..." before the ship zooms off like an 80s kids film - those moments (and more) are SO jarring! Its the strangest imbalance of thought/attention to detail Ive ever seen in a film.   

A great making-of though, and glad you watched it! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I always imagined a scenario where the spacejockey was somehow a carrier to a chestburster, which burst during flight and led to the crashing of the ship. Then, the chestburster grew into a queen (maybe eating the crew), then made a nest of the ship, laying a whole bunch of eggs. I figured the light-layer barrier thing was some kind of organic node she'd have put there as a way to wake up the eggs only when something intruded (a cool idea which was subsequently dropped, eggs then just somehow 'knew' when someone was near).  

But Prometheus and Ridley's suggestions change all that to suggest that the ship was *carrying* the eggs as a biological weapon. This doesn't make sense to me, because if the ship crashed after a chestburster, the eggs would have flown about all over the place and caused a right mess. They also wouldn't be lying flat in the way that they were. It seemed so much more appropriate and eerie that the chestburster eventually made a nest of the crashed ship, waiting to be discovered.  

Also, I always felt the beauty of Alien's story was that it was *completely alien*, mankind suddenly being framed as this utterly insignificant, helpless and vulnerable thing in the context of nature's cruellest, darkest corner of the galaxy. To suggest that the alien's actually share DNA with humans, might have been intended to destroy us all along, and along with the 'engineers' are actually *ancestors* of mankind just kind of pisses all over the idea of actually being 'alien'.   

What do you think?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. I watch it about once a year *really* wanting to like it, hoping it will just click somehow. But it just can't. Its a horrible mix of gorgeous (but also incredibly 'designed' and clinical looking) visuals, hinting at what could have been, with first-draft level writing and annoyingly self-conscious 2-dimensional characters. But even beyond that is the really annoying story. I appreciate Ridley trying to tackle the spacejockey, but it felt so much better leaving all that to the imagination in Alien. No matter how hard I try to forgive it, the whole "they invited us", "I choose to believe", "oh no, actually they want to destroy us" with all the instant-evolving bullshit along the way is just absolutely *stupid*. I just can't get over the fact that Ridley will have his artists develop, design and produce a perfect looking and perfect working science buggy, with every last detail designed from scratch, yet not give anywhere near the same level of thought to the story.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Damon Lindelof gets brought on-board at a late stage to take all of Jon Spaihts ideas and 'drive them home' as an existing screenwriter (despite being only from TV where stories are necessarily patchy and cross-cutting, rather than developing a singular core idea).   

Lindelof then criticizes Alien as being thematically poor, saying 'it is what it is' as if just some mundane space slasher that happens to have good design. Then it turns out that Ridley had a few random scenes he wanted in the film, that Spaihts had worked to include by zig-zagging all over the place to force them in. Its really no wonder that Prometheus ended up being very pretty (incredible attention to design and visual ideas) but mostly a collection of sporadic story ideas that were strung together based on what Ridley thought looked cool. Its almost satirical that Spaihts designed a kind of board-game to map out the plot points.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah he was a real dick. I specificially remember him bashing Lynch's dialogue style in certain scenes, re-enacting bits like "a tape", "a tape?" "yes, a tape" as though it was terrible. No appreciation for the intent behind decisions like that (like those bits in Blue Velvet where is sort of celebrates the banality and simplicity of peripheral characters, but in a way where it feels unsettling against the weirdness in how it isolates it). Our teacher was a total cunt though, he bashed all our art work, was completely discouraging, after discussing a filmmaker would say something like "none of you will reach that level though". Of course he flirted with the pretty girls and always told them their work was great. He was fat and stunk of cigarettes all the time too. People like that really shouldnt be allowed anywhere near an impressionable, optimistic mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for this. I found the Fiit FOV nowhere near as good as the Z4 - even though the eyes are close to the lens (too close, I'd often have to clean residue off the lens from where my eyeball actually touched it sometimes) on the Fiit, it looked like a toilet roll compared to the Z4 which is wider. Z4 cheats a bit though as the IPD can be set to have a smaller 3D overlap, so it looks more like the shape of binoculars you see in those older movies (like a venn diagram). Is the view through the Homido V2 circular or more Venn-ish? This is where its all at for me - how it would feel to watch a film in a VR cinema. Its hard weighing up whether the 50 would be worth it. Thanks for your info!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After dossing about with the *very few* decent cardboard games (Gravity Pull, Wrong Level/Voyage etc) I mostly like to watch films all tucked into my bobovr/LGG4 (with the perforated non-foam padding, I had the foam version and it felt horrible and I broke out in pimples, ugh. The longer bendier headphone jack is much better than using an extension on the LG as well, because it keeps the volume functionality). I use two apps, but both have pros and cons so thought I'd mention them.   

**Cmoar cinema**: pros - excellent cinema atmosphere, really feels authentic with excellent seat graphics and screen surround. Absolutely feels like a late night at the cinema. Ability to switch off the environment too so its just the screen. Settings allow you to change the FOV which has the equivalent effect of placing you further or closer to the screen which is really useful depending on the film. Yes you can notice some pixelation but generally its fine. Ability to lock the screen to prevent drift. Also can press magnet button to center again if drifting. I like using a big cinema screen though so prefer looking around. Cons - 3D films really don't seem very 3D. Battery intensive, phone gets quite hot. You're looking "up" at the screen slightly, its not tiered seats. Costs $/4.99, but I think its worth it. Also has youtube and lan support but I never bother with that.  

**VU cinema**: pros - has a choice of cinema, home or IMAX. IMAX is really cool - a bigger, curved screen and 3 choices of where you sit, front middle or back (same functionality as the FOV choice on cmoar). Tiered seats so the screen is more level. 3D seems slightly better, but I might be imagining this. Ability to switch off environment also so you can just see the screen. Also has screen lock. Costs $/1.99 which is worth it. Also plays youtube, I think with voice recognition for searching according to blurb. Cons - without switching off environment, seats etc look too bright, so not as cool an atmosphere as cmoar. Doesn't allow for 2.35:1 ratio, fattens it to 1.85:1 which is really annoying.   

Overall I prefer cmoar, but like the IMAX option on VU for films that are in 1.85:1 ratio. If you use something else that you prefer, I'd love to hear about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is what action is going on that corresponds our "wants" to our actual body movements?   

I read a paper on this not so long ago. There is an area of the brain linked to motor coordination that sends a 'copy' of its actions to another area of the brain (I think the executive function) where somehow its translated into a sense of conscious will. Its linked to corollary discharge and efference copy. This is why its hard to tickle yourself, because the sense of conscious will interferes with the 'unfamiliar' feeling. When these pathways get damaged, and the person doesn't experience the accompanying sense of will, they'll experience themselves as moving and behaving automatically like automatons instead. Hypnosis can also drive a wedge between the two, so the person experiences their normal subconsciously fuelled actions as 'happenings' rather than 'doings'. Thanks so much for your post! I think there's going to be a real revolution in self-awareness once neuroscience catches up with the general concepts that people hold about themselves.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If your subconscious did everything, then you wouldn't be aware.   

Why can't awareness just be another emergent property of subconscious functioning? If, for example, the relevant areas of the brain are damaged, the person loses a sense of conscious volition and experiences themselves as an automaton.  

 Also, *you* are the one who programming your subconscious, thus making you the one who has control.   

What makes you so sure? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for giving such a thoughtful reply, you're the only one to spot the inherent implication regarding consciousness itself. Yes, Maeve is a great analogy, as are many moments and implications of that show!  

People do seem *very* attached to their feelings of consciousness, free will and conscious volition, to the extent that questioning them often gets met with anxious confusion and hostility. But what if the attachment causes an unnecessary level of separateness, competition, comparison, judgement, even pride and self-aggrindising? Without it we might all be a lot more patient, understanding, and appreciate the true, wider context of causality more. Also, I think on a big enough scale, time itself starts to lose meaning. Not sure if you've seen Arrival, but at its heart is an exploration of these ideas.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the problem though I guess. Even when waking, I have a feeling (a philosophical one, not phenomenological) that my sense of lucidity is a brain-created sensation. Its not like I can really 'cause' anything other than what my brain (encapsulating my unconscious mind) would have ordinarily and automatically caused. If I choose a number, and choose 8, there's no way I could have chosen 5, because everything in my brain at that point led me to choose 8. So when I have varied feelings of control in a dream, I assume that they are a factor of the dream. If consciousness is aroused to the extent that I assume full control, then it ceases to be a dream, and is more a case of a vivid imagination.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for a reasonable and interesting answer. What you describe in your first paragraph sounds like something in between dreaming and waking life to me - like using the (imagination/dreaming) technology of the brain to conjure representations in real time as you will them to happen. Using similar processes involved in hypnotic hallucinations perhaps. But I think that's different from having a dream where your awareness increases to the extent that you realise you're dreaming, then have a sense of exerting some varied control over that dream? Perhaps its just a question of definitions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, OK. So you say "Why the parts of the brain associated with rational thinking, awareness and decision making we use while awake become active?" I say "Why do you think they do?" then you say "OMG! Its not ME that thinks they become active!" I really don't think you're following logic here, at all. I simply reversed your question to find its implication, and you distort its meaning entirely from when you first asked it. I'm not asking why you have the opinion that they become active, I'm asking for what reason do you think they become active. We just don't seem to be understanding each other at all, which I would think is a requisite for this kind of discussion unfortunately.

Why do *you* think they do? Do you honestly think you "will" them into activation?   

If I told you I dreamed of running through a meadow, you could just ask "why the parts of the brain associated with running, and meadows become active?"  Its just that when the areas associated with rational thinking, awareness and decision making *do* activate, you experience the sense of a lucid dream. 

 Lucid dreaming has been scientifically proven a different state of consciousness.  
 
A different state to what, normal consciousness or dreaming? I've no doubt that there are "scientifically proven" different states whilst dreaming, it would make sense if the activation of your conscious areas are varied. Being a different state doesn't mean that you *aren't* dreaming of being conscious.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not making a distinction between 'awareness' and 'the idea of awareness' - the sensation would be the same. Are you assuming that awareness itself isn't created by a part of the brain? Whatever part of the brain it is, that's what I'm suggesting is active when you feel more aware in a dream.  

I don't see how saying "I have inner dialogues in my regular dreams" is different from saying "I dream of having inner dialogues". Whether you consider the decisions of 'dream you' your calls or not would be dependent on whether those events are accompanied by a dreamed sense of conscious will. One is just experienced as a 'happening' and the other as a 'doing'.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  if there are discreet differences between those and normal sleep patterns   

I'm not sure what this would prove though. There could easily be discrete differences in sleep patterns between other sensations - e.g. a sexual dream, dreaming of sitting in a library, and a nightmare for example. As neither could be lucid, any other discrete differences wouldn't imply consciousness?  

If the areas were active but not sensed, that could just mean that other accompanying areas aren't active to give the full sensation. Which is why sometimes you're slightly conscious and feel aware but can't 'control' anything, other times you feel like you're more in control, and other times you feel fully in control but still within the confines of the rules of the dream. 

In a way brain areas eventually just becomes a circular definition however complex you take it, unless you think that sensation could exist outside of its accompanying brain area.  </TEXT>

But what if you just dreamed about it being way more specific, and had a heightened feeling of being in control? and in the other lucid dreams, you just didn't have as much of a sensation of being in control? Last night, you just dreamed that you wanted to do the things that you were doing. Basically whatever you are capable of sensing in waking reality (consciousness, control, desire) you are just as capable of sensing if those same areas happened to be active in a dream? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The example I gave of reading about lucid dreams obviously wasn't to suggest that you *have to* read about them to trigger them.   

The part of the brain creating the sensation of awareness obviously *would* be active in a dream involving a sensation of awareness. In the same way that the part of the brain creating a sense of fear would be active in a dream involving a sensation of fear. Basically any brain area responsible for any sensation is going to be active to create that sensation in a dream. What does that matter? It doesn't mean that you're *not* dreaming of a sensation of awareness.  

The feeling is different to a normal dream, because the very area that controls your feeling of being aware is active, whilst it isn't in most of your other dreams. It might feel like you're choosing things in your dreams, and controlling it, but your dream is still *completely automatic*, it just has an accompanying sense of "conscious will" attached to it because that part of the brain happens to be active in the dream.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More and more these days I think that a lucid dream is simply a dream where your sense of "self" or "conscious will" is activated as part of the dream, in the same way that any other part of your brain might be activated. So whilst it feels like you're suddenly aware and controlling it, it really is just a feeling, a sensation that is an artifact of the brain's random activation.   

When reading about lucid dreams, its common to then experience one. This isn't because you've somehow become more aware or have trained yourself - its just because you've been thinking about conscious awareness, so that part of the brain is more likely to fire up when processing memories during sleep.

No, you're really not, its been mentioned over and over again. 

 Actually I don't even remember the names of the characters.

Regarding cultural impact, although obviously everyone knows of Avatar and its place in cinematic history, I know what you mean. If you take any other top 10 box office film, you'll be able to come up with character names, ideas, scenes, classic iconography or something. With Avatar, nothing has really become classic. Compare it with say, Aliens, where almost every character, line and set-piece is celebrated. With Avatar, I get the sense that Cameron wanted "I see you" to become a known catchphrase of the film, or the action scenes to become classics, but no one gives a shit. It all just feels oddly flat and unmemorable. I've discussed this before and heard that its part of the strategy to appeal to mass international markets, bland apparently helps rather than having spikier moments or ideas, but I'm not so sure about that.  </TEXT>
