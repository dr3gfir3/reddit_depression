I'm running extremely low on money and wasn't able to order some and now I just ran out.  Any kratom would mean so much to me as I have been rationing it the last couple days and feel suicidal anhedonia creeping back in.  I wish I had the money so I didn't have to post asking strangers for some but here I am and I'm so angry at myself </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm gonna get down voted but I just don't want to see you even more hurt mate. If a girl or anyone takes away your pain this much, when the relationship ends the gaping whole in your chest becomes even bigger. 

I'm not saying don't date her, but recognize that she can't become the source of your happiness, because if she does then when that source is taken away you will be devastated.  It's fine to date her, but realize you can't base your sense of self on having her, because then without her you will feel like no one.

It's painful to understand this, but it's *EXTREMELY* painful when you think that she can fill your emptiness and then after the relationship ends you go right back to where you started.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How much relief did you get? I've already tried so many things and I need real relief too or my life will fall apart to a point that's way beyond the hell I already live in.

I'm almost 24, and over a decade have tried 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, TMS therapy, ketamine infusions, various nootropics, mediation, lifestyle changes such as profound mediation and exercise, new friendships and girlfriends, and nothing ever takes away my anhedonia.

Whenever my outlook is better all that remains is still utter lack of emotions; can't feel pleasure or joy in anything, and this always eventually leads back to dark thoughts.  It's like living in a world of just the color white, and nothing else exists and you're there for years.

I'm currently on TRT which I started two months ago for low testosterone and it helped a lot but then I stopped feeling better a couple weeks ago and don't know why. I suspect it's because I stopped my minor kratom habit of a couple months, but I haven't felt good or been able to function in over a month. Before that I hadn't been able to function ever really. 

I'm about to try this compound BPC-157 and a bunch of other things but I'm losing hope quick </TEXT>

People miss simpler times without the non-stop technology, social media, and news, and want to go back to when things were quieter and simpler, and so will do anything to feel like they did before, and these studios recognize that there's a huge market to cash in on.  

That's why the new Star Wars was such a fucking re-do of the first, because everyone was jerking off with nostalgia and the studio wants more and more $$ </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I find Star Wars boring and the unending circlejerk tiresome and annoying </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-05 03:06:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Other people can like what they like, just as I like what I like, that's completely okay. I'm not a Star Wars fan and find the movies extremely overrated; some really like it, that's fine.  

The thing that annoys me is hearing about it all the time and its fans constantly circlejerking the Star Wars culture.  *"DAE Darth Vader themed ____!?"*

I'm really into music and am a huge Metallica, G'N'R, and 2Pac fan, and am really into things like psychedelics, comedy, fitness, sports, and movies, but I don't dress up my dog like Slash or have bumper stickers on my car about my favorite films like GoodFellas or Shawkshank Redemption.  I don't go to the supermarket and see Game of Thrones themed Macaroni and goddamn cheese.

I know this is likely coming off as someone who's bitter about something, like much of the posts on this sub can sometimes come off as, but its really just that repeatedly hearing *"DERR May the 4th be with you!"* can get irritating, especially as it relates to a series that I find so numbingly over-saturated into the culture already.

It honestly always feels to me as if the culture is pushing that everyone must like Star Wars and hear about all the goddamn time.  Side note, Ricky And Morty is slowly infecting the culture like this too.  The show is alright, but not laugh out loud funny at all, and the "deep" nihilism commentary isn't anything truly revolutionary either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for the answer man.  Did you buy from Peptides Warehouse? I bought from there and they're apparently not responding to anyone's orders or emails right now.

I'm really suffering and need relief desperately and I think I should try Uridine like you're saying.  Did you start off with just that or did you start off with the happy stack? 

Also are there any side effects and could you tell me where you buy your's? Thanks a ton again man this help really could save my life </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like even if they play it live again that it won't even be half as good as in the late 80s.  Its just hard for older musicians to play with the same energy as they did when they were playing for years in their youth.

You're fortunate though that sounds awesome especially in '08 when they had more energy still. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always loved the into riff to AJFA. Maybe I'm blanking on something but it always reminds me of some sort of anthem and it just SOUNDS like it fits in with the word Justice.

Do you mean almost like an anthem or a pledge like a pledge of allegiance? I'm curious what you mean exactly this is an interesting observation as I have no idea what the intro is supposed to be sounding like. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I feel AJFA is Metallica's best song ever, even better than MOP </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-04 02:58:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> IMO it just has everything I'd ever want in a Metallica song, I can't describe it, but aside from a ballad like *One*, just as a purely 100% metal track, it stands out to me as Metallica's best song, and its definitely my favorite Metallica song and the peak of their skills. 

The rhythm is no doubt their best ever, the vocals are James' best (probably equal with *One*), the lyrics are fucking intense and cold as shit, the solo is retardedly good, and the drumming is at Lars' peak, especially with the double bass.

When I hear this song to me it just sounds like Metallica's heaviest fucking song ever.  It's heaviness is on par with *One*, but AJFA is heavier in a much different way.  *One* is more about a hopeless, desperate situation, and the heaviness in that song gives off the feeling of existing in the ultimate hell where there is no escape.  AJFA gives off a heaviness that is more about extreme anger about how fucked up the so called "justice" system is and about how fucked we all are because of it.

Just my two cents, would love to hear your opinions. </TEXT>
