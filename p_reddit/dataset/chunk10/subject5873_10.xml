	<TEXT> **This is a warning! Please read my story and heed my advice! Tell everyone you can not to make the same mistake I made!**

I am a fitness freak, *was* a fitness freak. Marathons, Tae Bo, P90X and Insanity, basketball twice a week, indoor soccer, free weights twice a week, cycling every Sunday morning, and exploring trails and caves in between. That is until I suffered a double hernia. I was in the early prime of my life and just beginning to peak, I mean HUGE gains the month before. My wife wasnt the happiest about how much time I spent working out but she sure appreciated the results. Anyway, back to the hernia. It would have been fine if it had been an umbilical hernia, those arent so bad. Usually back to work the next day with no complications if you are in any semblance of fitness. Of course, I wasnt so lucky. 

Mine were lower, very low  an indirect inguinal hernia and a femoral hernia  both of which I was told were congenital, meaning I was born with them. Apparently the extreme workouts built enough muscle in places I never really had to force my intestines around into wherever they could go and bam, a huge bulge just below my waistline. Insert penis joke here. 

Normally I wouldnt worry about it. I have pushed through injuries all the time and heal quickly. The first time I felt it happen I just pushed it back in and kept going at it, scissor kick after scissor kick. It didnt show up again for another two weeks but it hurt that time and from then on as well. I could always push it back in but it started to pop out more and more frequently. Totally freaked out my wife the first time it happened during sex, Ill tell you what. She dialed my doctor for me, still naked, and pushed the phone into my hand to make an appointment.

Fast forward a few weeks and I am getting wheeled out of the clinic with a small incision and a little bag full of meds. The doctor said I was lucky nothing serious happened like intestine strangulation because it was very bad, so bad that they had to use a new procedure to fill all the gaps. I dont speak doctor but basically, she said it looked like an ant colony down there, lots of little holes and rooms for the intestines to get trapped in and back me up really good. 

I had taken that day, Friday, off of work to get the procedure done and had to be back on Monday bright and early  something I really didnt think would be an issue. That is until I tried to take my first step or sit up in bed or take a leak. Who knew such a tiny cut could cause so much damage and pain? I made it in to work much to the dismay of my wife but I wasnt much use. I couldnt stand up fully straight and I couldnt lift or push anything over five pounds. I basically shuffled around like an old man in a robe and loafers trying to find his glasses. Towards the end of the shift, my boss called me in and asked me how I was doing (not great) and decided to give me the rest of the week off to recover faster. I wasnt happy about it, (pride you know?) but I did go home.

Things didnt improve that week, nor the week after. In fact, things only progressed downward. I regained some strength and mobility but I kept getting shooting pains throughout my body that began at my incision and lanced out in all directions, pulsing once, then twice. The incision was always itchy and tingly and felt like something was moving around, burrowing or pushing my insides around. It reminded me of the ant colony analogy my doctor used  thousands of ants crawling along the underside of my skin laying eggs in all of my organs and muscle tissue. My head throbbed, my eyes were itchy and red constantly, even my brain itched. Have you ever felt like that?

Then, suddenly, it was all gone. The pain, the tightness in my muscles, the tickly tingles under my skin. I went back to work like nothing had ever happened, stronger and spryer than before, like I hadnt missed almost a month of workouts. In fact, my usual weights seemed a bit lighter and I was quicker than I used to be on the basketball court. I hit the gym hard for a month trying to capitalize on this high I was on and turn it into sick gains. As they say, though, all good things must come to an end. 

It started out small  a missed step up the stairs or my hand letting go of a weight mid-curl like a total gym-tool. Each day it seemed to get worse, more missed steps, sometimes even going the wrong direction. Cutting to the left and out of bounds is pretty embarrassing in the middle of a championship basketball game. It was like I had zero control of my body!

I am not sure what prompted me but I began looking into the new procedure they had used on me during my outpatient operation. I couldnt quite remember what the doctor had said so it took a while for me to find it but it is called Nanomesh and it is supposed to fix all the issues they have had in the past with mesh inserts slipping, getting rejected by the surrounding tissues, and causing internal pain and bleeding. Instead, this mesh is flexible and adapts to your body so that it can blend right into any multitude of tissues it is placed by and can stretch and even grow to close off holes that appear near it. In theory, it sounds awesome. In practice, however, all the kinks havent been worked out quite right. 

So here we are in the here and now. Things have become much worse since I have begun to type this up almost two weeks ago. I have had to resort to writing out a section in random emails or on forums and then cutting and pasting them into this document in order to fool myself (hopefully it will all make sense) but I dont know how much longer Ill be able to keep it up. It is learning quickly, taking over more and more each day. The mesh. I think it has spread much further than just a few inches to heal newly formed holes. It is in my brain, controlling everything I do. Sometimes I can force myself but often I fail, unable to break through the hold it has on my body. 

My wife is lying on the floor next to me, dead. I, it, we, killed her after a few questions too many for our liking. She is really decomposed now, and the flies are coating her so thickly I cant even see her once beautiful hair. Fortunately, the mesh has turned off my ability to smell otherwise Id probably vomit from the stench of her rotting flesh. Once I finish this I am going to try and kill myself. I doubt it will work but maybe I can trick it, or force someone to kill me. Whatever. 

Please, if you get a hernia or need anything like a mesh insert **do not** let them use Nanomesh.

	<TEXT> He should have known better. He had worked for us long enough to know no one ever succeeds in exposure or escape, not even the Founder. 

--------------

*Good evening! Today has been mellow so far, thank God, but that wont continue much longer. If you take a look at the monitor with me youll see a massive front coming in. It initially looked like it was coming in this morning, early afternoon at the latest, but a strong current from the southeast has slowed it down and shifted it slightly. Expect four to five inches of snow by ten pee em and over a foot when you wake up tomorrow morning. Bundle up, get home, and stay safe.*

Behind him, the green screen switches from a Doppler map to a comical cartoon scene of Bugs Bunny holding on to a tree by his fingertips. The tree bends and sways enough to touch the ground but never breaks and a large mound of snow drops from the sky to blanket the ground, tree, and bunny instantaneously. 

Cut to commercial and the weatherman steps off of the small stage, pulling earpiece and power-pack off of the rear of his belt. He walks stiffly down the corridor, loosening his tie in stride, to his small dressing room to grab his heavy coat.

Good evening, Phyllis. Get home safe, okay? It is going to be a bad one, promise.

You always say that, Kirk. The smile on her face was unnecessary because it rang true with each word she spoke.

Kirk stopped at her desk and leaned forward, hands on each side of her large computer monitor, and stared down at her. The color turning to white on each of his knuckles and the stern, set jawline clued her in to his seriousness. Phyllis, please. Can you take me seriously one time? Go home early and stay indoors.

She nodded slowly and tried to smile her usual smile. He was scaring her and she didnt know how to respond. He was normally such a silly, laid back guy. (Imminent doom will do that to a guy.)

------------

With that, he turned on his expensive brown leather-soled shoes and stalked out to his car with purpose. The engine roared to life fifteen steps before he passed the rear bumper and the powerful engine had the car warm and ready to go by the time his seatbelt clicked into place. Technology, so beautiful and elegant when applied properly. The comforts we now possess are incredible, no? 

He reversed the car and made his way out of the basement carports, tires screeching on the smooth, polished cement floor. The radio crackled to life once the hood of the car peeked out from the underground bed it was sleeping in  traffic was light, but it wouldnt stay that way. Every weatherman in the five surrounding counties was issuing the same warning. Get home, stay inside, and pray you have enough candles and water to make it. 

The storm hit as soon as his car turned off from the highway and onto his country road  well used and in dire need of attention. Of course, he had memorized all of the pot holes and mud slicks so he didnt mind. He had a large all-wheel drive SUV after all, it wouldnt matter if he knew each low point or not. Winds pushed and pressed against the drivers side of his vehicle with increasing vehemence and power. It was getting hard for him to keep it moving straight, muscles straining against the rebelling steering wheel. Snowflakes were dancing across his windows too fast to need wipers. 

He slowed down to twenty to maintain control  only two more miles to go before he could turn into his driveway. The snow began to stick and accumulate, thicker and thicker flakes created by the cruel heavens above coming faster and faster. With defrost on full blast and wipers swishing madly back and forth on the heated windshield he could forge out just enough visibility to stay on the two-lane road if he stayed in the center. Not the best place to be considering most of the biggest ruts and holes were in the center  but what choice did he have? 

The largest of holes was just in front of him, although he had no idea until his SUV was jarred and began spinning its tires. His head snapped back and to the left, cracking roughly into the freezing cold window. He switched on the all-wheel drive and tow features to try to get himself out but the wet snow and strong rubber made for poor teammates. Instead of moving him forward he only succeeded in making the rut deeper, further tilting the car. Throwing the car into reverse he gently touched his foot to the accelerator pedal, nothing. In fear and frustration, he stomped on it and the car lurched momentarily, then settled back down into its new parking spot. He was stuck. 

His head settled back against the headrest in defeat, the wheels in his head turning furiously. The storm wouldnt be over for half a day. Could he wait it out without freezing to death? His eyes flicked to the gas gauge, half full. Probably not  this beast didnt get the best miles per gallon. How far was he from home? A mile, a little more maybe? He could run a mile in eight minutes, even in business attire, but what about in the storm? He risked it.

Donning his gloves, overcoat, scarf, and wool cap, he took a deep breath and killed the engine and pushed open the door. Or rather, he tried to push open the door. The wind ripped through the tiny crack between the door seal and the frame, instantly freezing him to the core. A snow drift almost to the window had built up in just minutes, impeding his exit on that side. The wind, as far as he could judge, was at least sixty miles per hour. Even in the roomy interior of the SUV his lanky frame had difficulty moving over to the passenger side. Knees and feet and elbows bumped and banged and dug into every console and component on his way, stiff and sore and annoyed before stepping one foot into the storm.

The door opened easily and he lost his balance from the excessive force he applied, tumbling out onto the hard, cold ground. Cursing and reaching for his cap that had fallen off he stands, takes one last look at the warm cabin of the vehicle, then takes off in the direction of his home. 

Step by plodding step he ran. The wind howled in his ears and buffeted him off course each time his foot lifted from the compact dirt. With each five steps, he took one moved him towards his goal and the wind picked up still more. Brittle, delicate, soft  the snowflakes instead cut into his skin like tiny ninja stars dipped in poison. Breathing became increasingly more difficult. The frigid air seared his passageways with each breath and chapped his lips and surrounding skin with each exhale. His eyes wanted to hide behind their lids, afraid of the wicked wind and the endless white they processed. 

---------------

*Tragic news last night, our local weather man was found dead just outside of his car after being caught in a freak storm on the way home. Police were on the scene early this morning when a semi-truck passing on the highway spotted the car askew in the middle of the road and radioed it in. Investigations are ongoing.*

The storm he was predicting ended up centralizing over his road, and only his road. In fact, it was only one-eighth of a mile square. The build-up of snow found around his car indicated the wind speeds reached hurricane force and over four feet of snow accumulated overnight. His body was found nineteen steps from his SUV curled in a ball and frozen solid. His lungs and stomach were full of frozen water on account of his mouth freezing open wide and his eyeballs burst from the extreme cold.

If you want to be a weatherman let this be a warning to you. We are a sacred group, dedicating our lives to accurately portraying the weather. We hold many secrets and we hold them dearly. We take care of our own and we **do not** tolerate oath-breaking.

You always say that, Kirk. The smile on her face was unnecessary because it rang true with each word she spoke.

Kirk stopped at her desk and leaned forward, hands on each side of her large computer monitor, and stared down at her. The color turning to white on each of his knuckles and the stern, set jawline clued her in to his seriousness. Phyllis, please. Can you take me seriously one time? Go home early and stay indoors.

She nodded slowly and tried to smile her usual smile. He was scaring her and she didnt know how to respond. He was normally such a silly, laid back guy. (Imminent doom will do that to a guy.)

------------

With that, he turned on his expensive brown leather-soled shoes and stalked out to his car with purpose. The engine roared to life fifteen steps before he passed the rear bumper and the powerful engine had the car warm and ready to go by the time his seatbelt clicked into place. Technology, so beautiful and elegant when applied properly. The comforts we now possess are incredible, no? 

He reversed the car and made his way out of the basement carports, tires screeching on the smooth, polished cement floor. The radio crackled to life once the hood of the car peeked out from the underground bed it was sleeping in  traffic was light, but it wouldnt stay that way. Every weatherman in the five surrounding counties was issuing the same warning. Get home, stay inside, and pray you have enough candles and water to make it. 

The storm hit as soon as his car turned off from the highway and onto his country road  well used and in dire need of attention. Of course, he had memorized all of the pot holes and mud slicks so he didnt mind. He had a large all-wheel drive SUV after all, it wouldnt matter if he knew each low point or not. Winds pushed and pressed against the drivers side of his vehicle with increasing vehemence and power. It was getting hard for him to keep it moving straight, muscles straining against the rebelling steering wheel. Snowflakes were dancing across his windows too fast to need wipers. 

He slowed down to twenty to maintain control  only two more miles to go before he could turn into his driveway. The snow began to stick and accumulate, thicker and thicker flakes created by the cruel heavens above coming faster and faster. With defrost on full blast and wipers swishing madly back and forth on the heated windshield he could forge out just enough visibility to stay on the two-lane road if he stayed in the center. Not the best place to be considering most of the biggest ruts and holes were in the center  but what choice did he have? 

The largest of holes was just in front of him, although he had no idea until his SUV was jarred and began spinning its tires. His head snapped back and to the left, cracking roughly into the freezing cold window. He switched on the all-wheel drive and tow features to try to get himself out but the wet snow and strong rubber made for poor teammates. Instead of moving him forward he only succeeded in making the rut deeper, further tilting the car. Throwing the car into reverse he gently touched his foot to the accelerator pedal, nothing. In fear and frustration, he stomped on it and the car lurched momentarily, then settled back down into its new parking spot. He was stuck. 

His head settled back against the headrest in defeat, the wheels in his head turning furiously. The storm wouldnt be over for half a day. Could he wait it out without freezing to death? His eyes flicked to the gas gauge, half full. Probably not  this beast didnt get the best miles per gallon. How far was he from home? A mile, a little more maybe? He could run a mile in eight minutes, even in business attire, but what about in the storm? He risked it.

Donning his gloves, overcoat, scarf, and wool cap, he took a deep breath and killed the engine and pushed open the door. Or rather, he tried to push open the door. The wind ripped through the tiny crack between the door seal and the frame, instantly freezing him to the core. A snow drift almost to the window had built up in just minutes, impeding his exit on that side. The wind, as far as he could judge, was at least sixty miles per hour. Even in the roomy interior of the SUV his lanky frame had difficulty moving over to the passenger side. Knees and feet and elbows bumped and banged and dug into every console and component on his way, stiff and sore and annoyed before stepping one foot into the storm.

The door opened easily and he lost his balance from the excessive force he applied, tumbling out onto the hard, cold ground. Cursing and reaching for his cap that had fallen off he stands, takes one last look at the warm cabin of the vehicle, then takes off in the direction of his home. 

Step by plodding step he ran. The wind howled in his ears and buffeted him off course each time his foot lifted from the compact dirt. With each five steps, he took one moved him towards his goal and the wind picked up still more. Brittle, delicate, soft  the snowflakes instead cut into his skin like tiny ninja stars dipped in poison. Breathing became increasingly more difficult. The frigid air seared his passageways with each breath and chapped his lips and surrounding skin with each exhale. His eyes wanted to hide behind their lids, afraid of the wicked wind and the endless white they processed. 

---------------

*Tragic news last night, our local weather man was found dead just outside of his car after being caught in a freak storm on the way home. Police were on the scene early this morning when a semi-truck passing on the highway spotted the car askew in the middle of the road and radioed it in. Investigations are ongoing.*

The storm he was predicting ended up centralizing over his road, and only his road. In fact, it was only one-eighth of a mile square. The build-up of snow found around his car indicated the wind speeds reached hurricane force and over four feet of snow accumulated overnight. His body was found nineteen steps from his SUV curled in a ball and frozen solid. His lungs and stomach were full of frozen water on account of his mouth freezing open wide and his eyeballs burst from the extreme cold.

If you want to be a weatherman let this be a warning to you. We are a sacred group, dedicating our lives to accurately portraying the weather. We hold many secrets and we hold them dearly. We take care of our own and we **do not** tolerate oath-breaking.

*Good evening! Today has been mellow so far, thank God, but that wont continue much longer. If you take a look at the monitor with me youll see a massive front coming in. It initially looked like it was coming in this morning, early afternoon at the latest, but a strong current from the southeast has slowed it down and shifted it slightly. Expect four to five inches of snow by ten pee em and over a foot when you wake up tomorrow morning. Bundle up, get home, and stay safe.*

Behind him, the green screen switches from a Doppler map to a comical cartoon scene of Bugs Bunny holding on to a tree by his fingertips. The tree bends and sways enough to touch the ground but never breaks and a large mound of snow drops from the sky to blanket the ground, tree, and bunny instantaneously. 

Cut to commercial and the weatherman steps off of the small stage, pulling earpiece and power-pack off of the rear of his belt. He walks stiffly down the corridor, loosening his tie in stride, to his small dressing room to grab his heavy coat.

The drill motor slowed and stopped, blood pooling at my feet, bits of flesh tenuously clinging to the six inch bit. I had stopped screaming long ago although my mouth still split wide with each touch of the hot metal  my vocal chords pushed far past their limits. 

He had started on the slowest speed and the biggest muscle claiming the slow speed did more damage. Instead of just drilling through it pulled and tore at the surrounding area, pulling larger pieces of meat with it and wrapping tendons. I cant say it did or didnt because I blacked out after the first few seconds of it entering my thigh. Each time I shut down he would wake me with the high-pitched whine of the drill millimeters from my ear and a hard slap to the face. 

The hands were the worst. Multiple holes now littered them, bones severed by the merciless tool, tendons and muscle shredded and useless. My head hung low, mind foggy from pain and exhaustion and blood loss. The soft crunching of footsteps stirred me slightly and I rolled my head slightly to the left and brought my eyes up to the highest point in their sockets. My grandfather stood directly in front of me, hands clasped behind his back.

Did I not warn you? There was sadness in his voice.

I searched him with my eyes for answers but found none. This is your doing?

I tried to warn you, tried to instill a love of this world, every world. I thought you understood, Aaron. 

Anger swelled within me, giving me a new strength. My head snapped up and my body pushed against its restraints. Pain exploded in one hundred tiny bursts across my body but I didnt care. What is *wrong* with you? You would torture your own grandson over a tree?!

The frown on his face grew deeper, his age showing in a crisscross of wrinkles, and he motioned for the jar. Onion Man handed it over and grandfather lifted it up to eye level, peering inside at the eternal inferno. His eyes took on a crimson hue from the flickering flames. How could this man be my grandfather? The man who spent every moment he could teaching me how to fish, tend to gardens, tie knots, and pop a wheelie. The man who read Shakespeare each night to his sick wife and spun wondrous tales to us tucked warmly in bed. The man who cried at every family wedding and every funeral. No, this was not that man. This was no man at all.

Balance. Every world has one, every world *needs* one to survive. Too much life and there are not enough nutrients to go around, too much death and there is not enough left to keep species going. Chain reactions ripple through the ecosystems and cause dependent species to die, then another, then another. Eventually there is nothing left. When I first came to this Inner World it was by accident. I was tasked to explore a fox hole and collapse it if necessary. After over an hour of crawling I still hadnt found an end, or even a branch to another tunnel but I came across a drop that went straight down. I shined my light down but couldnt see anything. I couldnt get across so I dropped a grenade and hauled back as fast as I could.

He paused there, regret clearly expressed in his eyes. When I made it back out and described it to the Sergeant he wanted the whole area torched and blown to hell. He was a pretty superstitious guy so we did as he said. What we ended up doing was ripping open a portal to this world and then the napalm hit.

He slowly turned the jar in his hands, inspecting each individual tip of flame. Of course I had to pay for my crimes, accidental or not, and that is where the story came from. I found the portal and stopped anymore from entering here. I shared that story with you, hoping my mistakes would not be repeated. Why couldnt you have listened to me?

Nature isnt the only thing that needs balance, Gramps. Your psyche could use a little right now.

With that he stepped forward and began unscrewing the jar. The heat escaped immediately and washed over my cold, weak body. It felt good, if only momentarily, then was so intense I turned as far away as the restraints allowed. Just before he tipped the jar I lashed out with everything I had and caught him off guard. My head knocked the jar from his hands and napalm went flying across the room. 

My momentum tossed me and the chair I was on sideways and I landed with a hard thud. Panic set it instantly, hunger fire devouring whatever it could find. The trees went up quickly and the smell of caramelized onions filled my nostrils. The room was a flurry of movement and a cacophony of screams in octaves Id never heard before, deep like an earthquake. I struggled on the floor to free myself of my bonds but nothing would give.

Fire spread and the screams died down. The only sound in the room was the crackle of the flames and the scrape of my chair on the floor as I inched toward the only exit. I could feel the heat on my hands and neck, closer, closer, closer. A scream ripped from my raw throat when the first of the napalm leapt onto me. Skin charred, peeled, melted, but so did my bonds. I rolled, one to be free and two to put out the fire. My injuries left me feeling weak and crippled but I managed to get to one leg and hop out of the burning room. I looked back once to see where my grandfather was but saw no sign of him. 

Several hours later I found a portal. Which portal it was I didnt know but at least it was a way out. The land around me was beginning to catch fire, much slower than it did the first time I am sure, but spread it would. Hopefully it would finish the job this time. A charred figure made its way through the wall of fire and shouted at me. The wall stuck with it, engulfing it like a suicide bomber. Whatever it said I couldnt hear it and I honestly didnt want to - I stepped through the portal.

Fire spread and the screams died down. The only sound in the room was the crackle of the flames and the scrape of my chair on the floor as I inched toward the only exit. I could feel the heat on my hands and neck, closer, closer, closer. A scream ripped from my raw throat when the first of the napalm leapt onto me. Skin charred, peeled, melted, but so did my bonds. I rolled, one to be free and two to put out the fire. My injuries left me feeling weak and crippled but I managed to get to one leg and hop out of the burning room. I looked back once to see where my grandfather was but saw no sign of him. 

Several hours later I found a portal. Which portal it was I didnt know but at least it was a way out. The land around me was beginning to catch fire, much slower than it did the first time I am sure, but spread it would. Hopefully it would finish the job this time. A charred figure made its way through the wall of fire and shouted at me. The wall stuck with it, engulfing it like a suicide bomber. Whatever it said I couldnt hear it and I honestly didnt want to - I stepped through the portal.

	<TEXT> my father always told me to seek out joy in everything i do so i did.

i tried goin to the park en walkin the trails, playin frisbee, fishin. i joined book clubs en read all of the bestest books even writin my own stories en poems to share. tried yoga, hot yoga, cyclin classes, free weights. nothin worked! 

no matter what i did joy eluded me. no not eluded! joy flat out ran from me

i ran as hard en fast as i could but i could never catch joy. eventually i got depressed en just stayed at home. what was the point of going out en doing things without joy in my life? joy is important, ya know? 

the restrainin order she set against me is what really did it for me. why wouldn she want to live here with me so that i can be joyous? So this is my letter of resignation from life. i'll try'n find joy one more time but if i fail i cant go on any more </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Onion Man - Part 2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-02 21:07:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 

*Hand in hand with my grandfather, we made the leap into the hole together. I felt as if I was turned upside down, stomach clenched tight and churning, when a jolt traveled up my feet and ended somewhere in my back. My knees and back ached from the sudden impact but I didnt let go of his hand. With a sweep of our necks we took in the strange surroundings. Blue trees, soft red sky, sheets of yellow clouds stretching out forever, and a small onion running on thin legs in an unknown direction. What choice did we have now? We followed.*

If my neck wasnt stiff already I would say it was now. I pulled myself to my feet and blinked back the tears forming at the corners of each eye. A searing pain raced up and down my spine and each shoulder throbbed. Barely able to twist my neck, I could see bright red blood dripping down my arms from deep scrapes on each shoulder.  Whatever that thing was, it wasnt the Gentle Giant. 

With closed eyes, mostly because of the pain but also fear, I went through a few stretches from high school cross-country to loosen up my back and neck. It helped somewhat although I would have much preferred a few coated pills and a whiskey. When I felt sufficiently loose and marginally less fearful I opened my eyes to take in the view. 

I stood in a thick copse of trees the color of tropical ocean water, bright blue and radiant. Above me loomed a red sky like a velvet blanket slowly settling down around you. The ground felt different under my feet, softer, less dense, like a freshly tilled patch of dirt that is sitting loosely waiting for seed. The air I breathed was not toxic but it had an abrasive quality to it  burning my eyes and forcing me to blink often. A deep bellow rang out harshly and the ground I stood on rumbled. I ran. 

*Grandfather and I caught up with the Onion Man once he stopped at the top of a low hill, teardrop shaped body quivering with excitement.*

*Look, the fire rages. If it is not stopped our home will be destroyed.*

*From the top of the hill we could see in all directions. A fierce wall of green flames licked at everything in sight, moving quickly with a hunger Id never seen before, as if alive.*

*What caused the fire? Grandfather asked.*

*We know not. A small ember fell through the central portal and grows rapidly. We cannot stop it. That is why I was sent to find you both, Wise One and Courageous One. Please, help us?*

*Can we fix it for them, grandpa?*

*We will do what we can. His face was solemn and gaze fixed on the raging fire in the distance.*

I ran until my lungs burned and my back could tolerate the motion no more. I collapsed to the ground with spasms in my back and my chest heaving up and down. Spittle formed a thick layer on my lips and perspiration dripped down each temple to cheek and chin. The bellow had finally stopped but my ears still rang with it. Raising my head I realized I had broken free of the trees and panted on my hands and knees in the middle of a barren plain. Rolling hills stretched out in all directions, the low valleys between them scorched and picked clean like a carcass in the desert. 

My mind raced, searching my memory, trying to make sense of what was happening. Could his story really be true? It made no sense, it was just a bedtime story. Was I dreaming? Back on my couch tossing and turning and ready to jolt awake at any moment? Another bellow, closer this time, broke me out of my thoughts and I pushed myself to my feet. I couldnt go back the way I came but I knew another way out  that is, if the story is real. 

Why was I brought here? Was I actually here before? What do they want from me? I played through the story in my head as I ran.

*Thousands of vegetable creatures fled the fire  onions, beets, carrots, broccoli, whole shrubs and aloe plants. Massive sequoias plodded slowly, huge root systems for feet tossed dirt clods the size of VW Bugs left and right. Most of the larger trees were too slow, consumed from behind by the unnatural flames that blazed across their land.*

*Grandfather stood and watched for a moment, hand on his chin, other hand holding tightly to mine.*

*Tell all of the creatures to run toward the edges and loop behind it. The fire can only move in one direction and eventually will burn out. Once it dies out you can drop roots once again and rebuild your world. My grandson and I will find the source and ensure no more is coming from our world.*

*The Onion Man looked at us for a second, then bowed toward the ground and scampered off to spread the new orders.*

*Grandpa, will that work? It doesnt look like normal fire.*

*Napalm. A portal must have been opened somewhere in Vietnam during the war and it leaked down into their world. It makes me wonder how time passes here compared to our world.*

*Time can pass differently? How?*

*That is a discussion for later, my boy. Now is a time for action.*

*We approached the oncoming wave of superheated fire and he scooped me up in his arms, leaping higher and farther than I had ever seen him do before. The heat was intense for a moment  I closed my eyes to it and turned my face up instinctively. We landed a few feet behind it but grandfather just ran, not setting me down.*

*I can run, grandpa.*

*In a moment, he huffed. It is very hot here still.*

*Sweat was pouring off of him, both of our shirts drenched and clinging to our bodies, when he finally set me down. Move quickly. Do not let your feet stay still for even a moment. The ground is still very hot and will melt your shoes.*

*I nodded and followed him, jogging lightly toward the hole in the sky that I never noticed before. Fire seemed to drip from it like a slow leaking hose. As we got close enough to really inspect it the ground cooled and we slowed to a walk. Everything in the area had been burned and charred so badly the fire couldnt spread. It just dripped down and burned on a single spot directly below the hole, which looked just like the one we came from, green swirling light tinged with liquid fire.*

*Fire needs fuel, oxygen, and a source. But this is no ordinary fire. Give me your coat and step back.*

*I handed it over to him and watched him work. He stripped off his coat and thick flannel shirt, wearing only an undershirt and pants. He set to work tying them together into a thick rope and then looked at me. Stay here, no matter what. With that he flung one end of the shirt-rope up into the portal and it pulled him up and out of sight.*

*Several seconds later he came crashing down and rolled crazily in the dirt to put out any fire that may have clung to him during the fall. Is it fixed? Are you okay grandpa?!*

*Out of breath but smiling widely, he answered. All is well. I removed all the debris from around the portal and built a mound-moat around it to keep the napalm from spreading. I was right, it was a different time, during the war.*

*I was too confused to ask anything and too thankful that he was able solve the issue. I ran over and hugged him tightly. At some point Onion Man made his way over to us and ended the silence -*

*Is all well, travelers?*

*I believe so, Onion Man. Since I have come through the portal no more fire has followed. Your home should be safe. I beamed at his words. I helped save their world!*

*Oh, thank you, thank you! Please, I have one more request of you before you leave. He paused dramatically before continuing. Be respectful of your world. It is only when you destroy yours that ours seems to suffer.*

*Grandfather looked at me with strong, compassionate eyes. Do you promise to take care of the planet you live on, Aaron? I nodded emphatically and issued my promise. Yes, we promise.*

I stopped dead in my tracks. I cut down the trees  broke the covenant I made as a child. Grandpa. Was he safe? I had to get to him. The ground trembled and I turned in time to see a massive branch cross my vision. 

Rough slaps to both sides of my face brought me back to consciousness. I raised my lolling head to see my assailant standing before me. A massively built and horribly pungent onion loomed within arms reach flanked by a redwood and a squat palm tree. In one hand the Onion Man held a small jar with a familiar fire licking up the sides with a hungry intensity, in the other a wicked looking drill.

Remember me, boy?

	<TEXT> 1992, I approach my grandfather in the backyard and ask him what he is doing. My grandfather is a kind and loving man, always taking the time to explain in as much or little detail as I ask. He sets his shovel aside and begins to teach me about gardening. Together we plant several rows of vegetables; tomatoes, onions, peppers, and cabbage, alongside the back fence which is chain-link. It will help them grow tall and strong, he said to me, like you will be one day.

That night I wiggled deep into the warm sheets in the guest room of their home and eagerly waited for the story to begin. Grandfather was an **incredible** storyteller, so much so that I usually spent the night at their house for the sole fact that Id hear a story at night. Tales of time-travel, massive underground gangs, fantastical creatures helping my sister and I save the world. I clung to those stories for many years after we got too old for bedtime stories and we would discuss them at length over lunch or through e-mail every so often. That night would begin the most epic of his stories  The Onion Man.

*Tap Tap Tap. In the cool and quiet night, the sound could be clearly heard. It was coming from the window. Quickly we gathered together and rushed outside to find the source of the disturbance, grandfather in the lead wielding a strong, wooden bat. After circling the home twice we could find no sign and so filled back to bed. In the morning we rose early to continue our work on the garden but found a large hole in the middle of the row of onions.* 

*One of the strays must have dug up the seeds, I complained.*

*I dont think so, take a closer look.*

*My grandfather always lets me try to figure things out for myself, albeit with a nudge in the right direction from time to time. I set the rake I was holding down and stepped carefully between the rows. He was right, of course. Only one of the mounds that we planted the day before was disturbed but the hole was enormous and deep.*

*What do you think did it, grandpa?*

*He squatted down to inspect the gaping hole closer, powerful mental wheels turning inside of his head. Lets eat breakfast and think on it.*

*And so we did.*

The time came for me to move out on my own and I started to get into science fiction shows and movies I started to see parallels to his stories, sometimes vague and other times incredibly similar in nature, so I asked if some of those shows were his inspiration. He admitted some were but about half of them were completely pulled from his beautifully creative brain. We have bonded tremendously over the years because of those stories. Anytime I see a movie or read a book I think hed like I call him up and tell him all about it, and visa versa. Once we have both seen or read it we talk about it  what we liked, didnt like, how we could have made it better. 

*Just like the night before I was roused from sleep by a soft but clear Tap Tap Tap. My grandfather was already out the door by the time my feet hit the floor and I followed him out, struggling to get my slippers on while pursuing him. He rushed to the left, towards my window, and I saw him dive forward. I approached cautiously, worried that whatever he was wrestling with would get free and attack me. Suddenly, the struggling stopped, and my grandfathers deep laugh filled the night air. In his hands was a squirming, shuddering onion with thin arms and thin legs.* 

*I am sorry to startle you, humans. But I need your help. Our world is under attack!*

Two years ago I purchased my first home. It is a fixer-upper on the edge of town on a fairly large corner lot. The home itself is shaded by half a dozen trees as old and ancient as they are tall. As beautiful and majestic as they all were some were dead or dying and dropping huge limbs all over the yard and roof. Fortunately, no damage had been done but it was only a matter of time before one strong wind knocks enough off to crush the house, maybe with me in it. I called a tree service company out for estimates and information on what each type of tree was and whether or not they were healthy. Much to my surprise they only recommended removing two which happened to be the biggest, tallest, and closest to the house. $2,500 for each tree. $5000! Just to drop two trees. 

My stubborn nature, can-do attitude, and complete lack of common sense told me that I could take care of them myself for far less. After all, I had never worked on a house before buying this one but Id been able to fix a lot of the plumbing and electrical issues in the house and even knocked a few walls down. I started looking up pricing for chain saws, ways to store firewood, and how to make a nice outdoor fire pit. After several hours of YouTube videos, a few trips to Home Depot and half a paycheck later I was ready! 

*I sat back on my heels with eyes wide and bulging. A talking onion?! Grandfather seemed to be unfazed, conversing with the little guy about the ongoing attack and what we could do to help.*

*Follow me, I will show you.*

*And with that, we walked to the backyard and watched the Onion Man drop down into the hole  a dim green light emanating from it. I stood just close enough to peer over the edge but saw nothing  just green swirling light. Grandfather was a practical man and a window cleaner. He grabbed a long, thick rope from his gear and tied it around our waists, then looped it around a large tree.*

*Are you ready for an adventure, my boy?*

I took a week off of work to ensure I had enough time to do things properly and not make stupid mistakes. I was able to drop the first tree just fine. It was a little off-mark from where I wanted it to land but all in all pretty easy. By the end of the second day, I had it chopped and stacked. I also had a major back ache! The second tree was closer to the house and much less room for error which is why I waited, using the first tree as practice and experience. After shooting up a quick prayer I revved the 36-inch chainsaw into action. The tree took a lot more precision cuts compared to the first one but after an hour I got it to the ground with a thunderous boom. My house was still standing and I was victorious! I circled the massive trunk to start making cuts into the stump when I was stopped by what I saw. 

There in the center, where a solid trunk marked by hundreds of rings should be, was a deep hollow emanating a green light. Memories came flooding to the forefront of my mind  hundreds of stories my grandfather told us as we laid in bed. I approached boldly and grasped the massive trunk with both hands to peer down into the gently swirling light. It was hard to focus on any one point, mesmerizing, hypnotizing were the swirls. I squinted and strained to see through the swirls but ended up getting queasy.

Clutching at my stomach I teetered backward and landed hard on my butt in the soft grass. Moaning in pain from two sore spots I turned over to hands and knees and eased my way inside the house. An hour later, with hot tea in hand, I lounged on the couch watching television. My butt was no longer sore however my stomach was still tied up in knots. Just standing fully erect was enough to double me over again and shoot spots across my vision. I dont know how long I struggled with my tea and the remote but eventually, an empty mug dropped from my hand and I dreamed about my childhood. 

Tap Tap Tap. 

My eyes blinked open. Was that a part of my dream? With slow deliberation, I swung my legs down and gingerly rubbed my stiff neck. My phone light up at a touch and revealed the time  10:18 PM. Crap, my sleep schedule was going to be way off. I began making my way to the fridge to grab something to eat when I noticed my stomach had finally settled. Good, I can get back to work tomorrow. The cool air felt amazing on my face, eyes scanning for something quick and easy.

Tap Tap Tap.

I spun toward the sound. Definitely not a dream. I pushed the fridge door closed and stalked to the patio doors and flicked the light switch up. Soft yellow light removed the darkness in a thirty-foot semi-circle, just shy of the stump. I could easily make out the strange green light in the darkness  swirling up and out like a fog machine at a concert. With a twist of my wrist, the door was unlocked and sliding open. I stepped out and made my way towards it but skittering behind me made me pause. Raccoon? Opossum? Something bigger? 

The stiffness in my neck hadnt faded so I pivoted with my hips but saw nothing. Then, out of the corner of my eye, movement at the stump. I turned and moved forward in one fluid motion hoping to close the distance on whatever was out here when two powerful hands latched on to my shoulders and lifted me up and off the ground. 

I tried to break free, to turn and see what held me so tightly, but each movement was met with more resistance. My body was on the verge of breaking  the stump drew closer and the light shone brighter. Without warning, I was flipped 180 degrees with my feet in the air and my head dangerously close to the rough bark. I caught a brief glimpse of powerfully built legs and the overwhelming smell of onions before my head broke the plain of green light and everything went black.

	<TEXT> I always wanted to be a father, as far back as I can remember, probably starting with when my younger sister was born. Being an older brother was a lot of fun and I must have translated that into being a dad will be fun. I probably scared off a lot of girlfriends early on with all my talk of being a dad someday but that is fine, they clearly didnt have what it takes! 

When I met my now-wife, then-girlfriend we clicked immediately and I wasnt even the first one to mention babies which was a first. She was just as excited about being a mother as I was at being a father. Match made in heaven! We didnt date long, just seven weeks, we were so eager to start a family. That was eleven years ago, eleven childless years. It turns out that enthusiasm isnt the only thing you need to have children. High sperm count, active sperm, an inviting cervix, and many other factors are involved, all of which we addressed one by one, even going out on a limb and doing new and provocative methods in other countries that werent legal here in the US. 

After a few years we slowly began to lose hope and in turn the relationship suffered. I dont like thinking back to that time as I am not proud of who I was but we managed to get past it; renewing old bonds, creating new ones, founding a new set of passions and in time came to peace with our childless home. The would-be nursey became a home office, the larger spare bedroom reserved for later years a home gym. We took trips to faraway places, became fitness freaks, tried to learn pottery and painting. And then one day it happened  a beautiful little boy began to take form inside of my wife. We are still not sure why or how but of course we were thrilled! We joke that it was the wine in France. He was our miracle baby. 

The home was a buzz almost immediately. I ordered dozens of books for dads, moms, how to care for the baby in the womb, the fourth trimester, you name it I probably ordered and read it. My basement quickly turned into an office and gym, paint went flying, Buy Buy Baby stock increased 18% in a months time - they knew us by name at the local store. Have you ever been in one of those stores? It is *insane*. They have a product for every single possible scenario you could ever encounter. And none of it is cheap. 

Finally, 276 days later, a curly-haired little prune cried for the first time and a permanent smile was fixed to my face. Isaac was perfect, our family was perfect. The two days in the hospital went pretty quick. There was lots of crying and sleeplessness, although the food was much better than everyone makes it out to be. We made our way home ever so slowly in our new minivan (I traded in my 12 Audi TT) and settled in. A few weeks went by without a hitch, like I said, Isaac was perfect. He rarely cried, feeds regularly, and sleeps half of the night already. 

I was back at work in the middle of a presentation when I received an urgent phone call from my wife. To paraphrase the strange phone call, she was cleaning up the kitchen after lunch and her water broke. You can imagine my surprise at that considering we just had a baby. Looking back on it now I suppose it was odd that over those few weeks her mid-section never lessened in size, but hindsight is 20/20. I rushed home and helped her and Isaac to the hospital to get checked out. Maybe her water never broke during the delivery so it was delayed? Was that a thing? The nurse did a few quick checks and left the room for what seemed like hours. When she came back my wifes OB/GYN was with her. She looked perplexed to say the least and asked my wife to lay back on the table so she could perform an ultrasound. As soon as the transducer hit her belly a strong, quick heart-beat greeted us and everyone in the room gasped. 

Twins? But how could they have missed a second child for so long? And why didnt she just deliver both at the same time? What the hell was it doing hanging out in there for three weeks? Questions were flying around the room but were interrupted with a scream from my wife  contractions. We were transferred up into the Labor and Delivery department and eight hours later we were proud parents of a second child  Isabella.

Unfortunately because of the back-to-back nature of the deliveries my wifes body was wrecked and worn out. She bled a lot during the second because stitches from the first were not fully healed and each one re-opened. We were grateful, of course, to be parents to a boy and now a girl. Our family was complete  the perfect model family. A longer stay was necessary but five days went fast with two newborns on your hands and soon we were back home and I was re-painting half of the nursery a soft coral color. My work granted me three more weeks off given the circumstances and boy was it ever needed. I probably slept a total of 60 hours during that time! The things you do for your family, right? 

A nurse visited our home once a week to check in on her, probably because of the crazy situation. No one had ever heard of that happening before. The day after our last in-home nurse visit her water broke again. This time I was home when it happened and before we could even get to the hospital I had to pull over on the side of the road and rush around to her side to help catch the baby girl that was so eager to come out into the world. An ambulance met us at our car to assist because she was bleeding out and fainted from the pain. One pregnancy is extremely hard on a womans body, let alone three in the course of three months. We just arent made for that! A whole team of doctors and specialists took interest in our case and began to try and solve the mystery behind it. 

That was eight months ago. 

My wife died during the fourth incident, each one exactly three weeks apart, each one a perfectly healthy and strong baby. Each one looks slightly different but clearly our children. I have stopped calling the hospital, what is the point? They never figured out the cause. I set up a special delivery bed in the guest room for her, legs permanently strapped to the raised stirrups. Every three weeks another child emerges. I have no idea how long this will last. I had to pull the last one out because her body has wasted away to such a degree that she has no musculature left. I am afraid if I am not here for the next one it will suffocate and died inside of her. Would that stop things? Maybe. Maybe the next one will just push out the dead one. Or they will get backed up and explode. I dont know, I am going crazy. Trying to take care of eleven babies? Maybe there are more, I cant really think right now. Her milk ran out a long time ago so Ive tried to keep up with formula but it is so expensive! I wonder if I bought a goat and milked it. Who am I kidding, I dont have time to milk a goat. 

Whos crying? Isaac, stop that! I swear, I am going insane.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Imposter. Stranger. Doppelganger. Changeling. Shapeshifter. I have been called many names over the centuries. Who I am is not a valid question because I am many. *What I am* is a much better question and one that I will do my best to describe to you in terms you might understand. 

If memory serves me right, and it almost always does, I was created sometime in the 5th Century. A grieving woman, desperate for her husband to return to her, called upon a power she did not fully understand and could not control. She received her husband back, of course, but he was me. Maybe created is the wrong word because I already existed but I had yet to be given a purpose. I floated along the Breeze of Time until that night when I was Summoned and given a body to inhabit. From that point on I have lived in your realm in various bodies, enjoying life after life. 

When a body loses its ability to live I drift out and once again enter the Breeze of Time until another summons. Naturally, once I had a taste of life as a human I wanted more. I had developed a desire for life and the sweet tastes that come along with it  emotion, desire, needs, even lusts. I grew impatient waiting for the next summoning, something I never dealt with before. Ignorance truly is bliss. Over a century of counting the milliseconds passed before I had another opportunity to indulge in the human realm. 

She was a pretty little thing, the woman I entered, for human standards. Love-sick suicide. Her grief-filled boyfriend unintelligibly offered his life for hers which I was most thankful for. Public service announcement, dont be so brash and careless with your words  someone is *always* listening. Instead of simply enjoying life as I had done previously I spent time learning about your race, absorbing your tendencies and weaknesses and storing away as much information as I could. As my borrowed life came to an end I explored ways in which I could extend it but alas I ran out of time. 

Fortunately for me this was the period you call the Dark Ages and I was not without opportunity. I skipped from body to body and experienced a vast smorgasbord (Oh how I love that word) of people, places, cultures, and witnessed many a secret. Within a few decades I had bounced between a dozen or more individuals thanks to outlandish religious beliefs and short lifespans. I knew it wouldnt last that way forever and therefore I needed to figure out how to stay for good. The Breeze of Time sounds beautiful and all but it is empty, Time itself is nothing except what you make of it, and so I sought out a means to stay.

I am sure that you have heard the expression It is not what you know but who you know and it is spot on. I spent life after life trying to get closer to the great minds of the era and learn from them, or become them if possible. Tesla was crucial for me. The knowledge that man had stored away was incredible! During my short time within him I learned the secret of how to jump from person to person instead of waiting for a Summons. It was at that point I could *choose* my next life and if manipulated properly I could then steer that man or woman into allowing me in. I never had to travel along the Breeze again! 

Something else I should note is that once I am a part of someone I become them and they become me. When they would die and I would return to the Breeze of Time their memories departed with me. After sixteen centuries of focused learning you could say I am the smartest man alive. Or woman, depending on who I choose, I dont discriminate. That brings us to the here and now, the point where my hard work, patience, experience, and knowledge pay dividends  finally freeing myself of these shackles.

Two days ago I found an amateur author, tired and desperate. He was bogged down with life and in his lowest point he uttered the words I so desperately needed to hear  he was mine. I drifted into his body and watched his shadowy essence depart, lost and confused. It swirled and circled for a time before an open window pulled it out. 

Last night as I went about my new daily routine I encountered something new, something disconcerting. The shadow returned, and it watched. What is perhaps even more damaging is that his daughter, my daughter, seems to recognize me for what I am, or what I am not. That is a bridge I will cross when I must but for now I need to be rid of his shadow. For those that do not know a shadow, or shade, or ghost, depending on who you ask, is his corporeal essence. Because he did not actually die the Breeze of Time is not calling to him and because he no longer has his body he is stuck, for lack of a better word. I need to get him unstuck, and fast. If not, and this is only conjecture because it is the first time I have tried this kind of trade, is that he will try to return to his body and his body will be destroyed from being pulled in two directions. Granted, I dont foresee needing his body very long so maybe it wont be an issue after all.

You may be asking yourself a question right now, something along the lines of What the hell does this Imposter need from a crappy author?  It just so happens that this author knows things, as a matter of fact the *only one* to know one particular fact  where is Harrison Matherson hiding? 

When he killed me I was forced out of a body I had been in a long time, one I had planned on staying in forever. And now that has been taken from me! However, I will find Harrison and I will take his body. It is almost as good as the one he stole from me.

My name is Irithmus Thar and I want revenge.

	<TEXT> [Imposter](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/67b19w/the_imposter/). Stranger. Doppelganger. Changeling. Shapeshifter. I have been called many names over the centuries. Who I am is not a valid question because I am many. *What I am* is a much better question and one that I will do my best to describe to you in terms you might understand. 

If memory serves me right, and it almost always does, I was created sometime in the 5th Century. A grieving woman, desperate for her husband to return to her, called upon a power she did not fully understand and could not control. She received her husband back, of course, but he was me. Maybe created is the wrong word because I already existed but I had yet to be given a purpose. I floated along the Breeze of Time until that night when I was Summoned and given a body to inhabit. From that point on I have lived in your realm in various bodies, enjoying life after life. 

When a body loses its ability to live I drift out and once again enter the Breeze of Time until another summons. Naturally, once I had a taste of life as a human I wanted more. I had developed a desire for life and the sweet tastes that come along with it  emotion, desire, needs, even lusts. I grew impatient waiting for the next summoning, something I never dealt with before. Ignorance truly is bliss.
