	<TEXT> I love peaceful sightings like gardens and public parks, I am willing to spend but the less is better! I also love hipster shops and coffee shops, but don't know any specific ones. I just plan to roam around most of the time. I can uber, walk, and take the cabs, but do you guys think that if I rent a bike, I can reach most of the great spots in Portland?

Thank you! I appreciate the help. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I need travel help: PORTLAND to FLORENCE (Heceta Lighthouse) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello, I am traveling to Oregon by myself this June 3rd - June 7th by plane from Alaska. For the first two nights, I am going to stay at a AIRBNB and probably be leaving on the 5th (Monday) to try to explore the coast. I don't want to rent a car, I want a different type of transport. I prefer buses. I was wondering if Greyhound + Taxi is reliable to get to the Heceta lighthouse? What is the timeframe you recommend? I don't need things to do at the lighthouse, I simply want to go there for my photography.

Any advice on how to get back to Portland as well?

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree. I've always seen **Spanish Sahara** as this soft yet hardcore lullaby that represent unsaid words Chloe that didn't get to tell Max up at the lighthouse after the ultimatum.

When I listen to Spanish Sahara, I imagine Chloe's ghost hugging Max when she has difficulties falling asleep at night due to thinking back at the horror that she has went through in the course of that week and saving The Bay. Chloe being there, constantly in the back of her head, existing only as a memory that existed only to Max. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mom told me to snap out of my depression before work and told me that other people have worse things to be sad about. I am at work at the moment and I want to break down. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I am diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression, and I fell back into another phase where I constantly think about death and wanting to die. I've been plotting my death for a few days ago and this brings me comfort. 

I even had a major mental breakdown at work where all my co-workers saw me cry and I was sent home, because I was plotting ways to ask for paper clips to cut myself without anyone knowing. I told my boss about this.

I bring myself to therapy because my parents ignore my depression. They never say anything when I try to talk about it, they turn their nose at me. Then they only say things like, "are we getting charged for those 'therapies you go to?' That seems to be their only concern.

One time my dad even told me, "You don't even have a reason to be depressed."

Few weeks ago I told my mom that I've been cutting my wrist for awhile. She just guilt tripped me and said that I make her feel ill.

Since I work with her, she knew about my breakdown a few days ago. This morning I was telling her that I was feeling low, I've been trying to let her know. She told me to just snap out of it, because it's embarrassing that everyone is talking about us at work now.

I almost broke down and I'm just trying to push through. This job makes me miserable, but I'm trying so hard in life. But it piles up so much and I am so overwhelmed and feel like I am drowning constantly, depression makes me feel like I am suffering. I want to die so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In her interview with the BLACKWELL PODCAST, she said she is and picked Bay, because she believe that we gotta let destiny play itself out and that it teaches us the ultimate lesson to not take anyone (most dear to our hearts) for granted, specially that one, special person :)

	<TEXT> I guess it was more of a turning point and motivator for me :) I am clinically diagnosed with Major Chronic Depression with suicidal tendencies, and instead of actually hurting myself, I decided to put myself through a change to better myself emotionally and physically. 

I didn't lose weight to get back at him, but instead more like revenge because I was with someone who constantly talked down at me and made me feel worse about myself. I wanted revenge to feel better, but in the end I ended up benefiting more than I could ever imagine; health, physique, mindset, etc. 

It all fell into place and for myself only.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> THANK you :) I basically started doing mostly cardio in the start, and reducing my calories but by bit, then whenever I hit a plateau, I always sped up my metabolism by having random cheat days or changing up my workout routine (and eventually incorporating weight training)

The whole process took around 4-6 months. It left a lot of loose skin in the belly, but worth it :) I am still working on it! I have 20 more pounds to go :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, THANK you! Lately, I've been okay :) Sometimes it is inevitable that it just pops up for a few weeks though. I tend to have suicidal tendencies, ever since I was younger, but I think I am slowly trying to use gym time as a coping mechanism :) </TEXT>
