	<TEXT>  For the US, specifically, something like 2% of CO2 comes from cargo ships

Do you have a link for that, and is that US waters only?  Most container and dry and wet freight vessels have two engines, one burns ULSD which they use in territorial waters, one burns bunker fuel which they switch to in international waters.  Bunker fuel is horrendous from a CO2 and other pollutants perspective.  </TEXT>

When I was there we definitely had the lines cleaned every two weeks - they did it during my one opening shift and was a huge pain in the ass, so I remember very well.  

Can't speak to the underwater kegs, but can say overall definitely not the cleanest spot I worked.   </TEXT>

The CSR AF does hit immediately and is hefty if you can't use the $300 travel credit pretty quickly.  They did also take down the bonus from 100k to 50k, so not sure if it's as worth it anymore... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actual -87.  Still very tight y/y.  But with maps as is, H might not see the rally.

Still looking for the J-V flows rally rather than storage.  With this much heat in the Northern hemisphere, the summer could be brutal.  It's looking like none of the M U takeaway projects will be ready before 2018, and most of the plays booming (Permian) aren't very gassy for associated gas production to boost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to update quick with a before and after of the worst part of the walls I plaster repaired, [here](http://imgur.com/a/8Dzvz). This wall does bulge a little and isn't perfect because I put a few pieces of sheetrock where that big open lathe was, but one of the other walls was in better condition, and came out really well, I would be happy with the quality in a new house.

I do have to say, the plaster probably took 5 times as long as hanging, taping, and mudding drywall, *but* ripping down plaster and lathe is a massive PITA (and dusty - never good in old houses) and that alone would have taken even longer than plastering.

Happy to answer any questions (although I'm no expert).  This was one of the favorite projects I've done in my house.  The walls were lathe and plaster probably 80 years old, which were later covered with wall paper, then covered with fake wood paneling, then that was painted when fake wood paneling went out of style. It was really interesting peeling back all that history, then fixing the original walls which could likely stand for another 50 years because of the quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would suggest learning skip trowel style texturing.  I just finished plaster repairing a few rooms in my 1905 house, and the walls are incredibly solid and professional looking, and I like them better than the sheetrock and hand texture we paid a professional for on another part of the house we tore to the studs.  

I started from basic drywall finishing experience, and plaster repair came quickly and seemed a bit easier, but the plaster was sometimes trickier to work with than sheetrock mud. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actual -209.  Relatively flat to pre-report.  Looks like eyes or on the ridge building over AK.

From CWG:

Downturn or Downfall? Over the past 24 hours, we have seen a remarkable nosedive in the Eastern Pacific Oscillation readings. Normally, such changes may show up toward the end of the 11-15 day to suggest uncertainty in the normally lower-skilled period, but these changes started happening around today's Day 10 (now 12/30, next Friday) and then persist through the balance of the period. The European ensemble is leading these changes similar to how they led to the colder pattern shift in late November (big Bering Sea high pressure spike that time). This makes me more interested in this situation and it increases the odds of a colder January outcome overall; however, the one big problem was last weekend's debacle. The European ensemble was strangely much colder than other models in the 6-10 day dealing with the storm system early next week as we reported on Sunday morning. It held that view for about 1 to 1.5 days over the weekend before it completely flipped Sunday afternoon. That 6-10 day flip suggests that even the mighty European is struggling with this pattern evolution and that we need to stay on the cautious side initially here.  </TEXT>
