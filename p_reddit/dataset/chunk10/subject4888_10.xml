	<TEXT> There has also been a lot more weird shit that has been happening. There is a club across the street that is abandoned called club cognac, that was shut down because the security guard shot and murdered a lady. There is also this weird attic inside of the kitchen closet. There is no other door to get up there. Me and my boyfriend hear footsteps and knocks above us, usually every single night.   </TEXT>
