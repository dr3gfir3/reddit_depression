	<TEXT> Thanks for the info.  This info is great!  I also watched a Joe Rogan clip online.  One guy said if you're not too serious about being vegan, you should eat oysters or clams because per calorie, they are the most nutrient dense.  I should look it up. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Vegan/Vegetarian Diet and Boxing </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Personally, I have nothing against eating meat, but most of it doesn't taste good and it makes me feel sluggish.  I started skipping breakfast, and becoming much more mindful of my food.  I notice that  I feel much better when I force myself to eat majority fruits, vegetables, and high fiber grains.

Is it possible to maintain a fitness for boxing and eat a vegan/vegetarian diet?  What should a meal look like?  And what nutrients should I focus on looking for? </TEXT>
