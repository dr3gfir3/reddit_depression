	<TEXT>  Insurers still cannot deny people coverage outright, as was a common practice before the ACA's passage, but they can hike up premiums to an unaffordable amount, effectively pricing people out of the market.

 In fact, premiums could reach as high as $25,700 per year for people in high-risk pools, according to a report from AARP. 

And therein lies one of the problems with pre-existing conditions - at the whims of the insurers </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  With the repeal of the ACA many families will lose their only chance at accessing life changing therapy for their autistic children.

 ...the House passed the AHCA, a bill that would allow states to opt out of any mandated coverage for those with pre-existing conditions (pre-existing conditions that include everything from autism to pregnancy).  The bill also would greatly impact Medicaid funding for disabled individuals.  Every medical, disability and autism organization has expressed opposition to the AHCA and what it would mean for our most vulnerable populations.  And yet enough Republicans are okay with that that it passed the House and in doing so they made it perfectly clear to me that I can no longer vote Red in good conscience.  

Pre-existing conditions - the bane of many people's lives. Do we even have a comprehensive list?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Tennessee state Sen. Mark Green (R), President Donald Trumps nominee for Army secretary, strongly believes that citizens should be armed  and not just with any ol guns. They should be able to possess whatever weapons the military has, because an armed citizenry is the ultimate checks and balances against the federal government

 Tennessee state senator also said that the citizenry should be allowed to maintain whatever weapon the federal government has. If they can have an aircraft carrier, I ought to be able to have an aircraft carrier.

 EPA may assess civil administrative penalties of up to $37,500 per day, per violation against federal agencies for noncompliance. The total penalty cannot exceed $295,000 unless EPA and the Department of Justice determine a greater penalty is appropriate. EPA may also issue field citations against federal facilities. A field citation up to $7,500 per day per violation may be assessed in these cases, and are generally issued for minor infractions. (Read more: CAA Stationary Source Civil Penalty Policy, 1991.)

	<TEXT>  Last week a Filipino lawyer filed a complaint at the international criminal court (ICC) accusing Duterte and 11 other Philippine officials of mass murder and crimes against humanity.

 In the 77-page complaint Jude Sabio says the president has repeatedly, unchangingly and continuously committed extra-judicial executions or mass murders over three decades, amounting to crimes against humanity.

Wonder how long before this lawyer is suspected of being a drug addict/pusher and is "disappeared" by the vigilante cops. </TEXT>
