	<TEXT> Thanks for posting to /r/DIY!

Your post has been removed because it links to an unapproved domain. While links to other domains are permitted here, they do require moderator review.

**Please read this entire message before you reply, and before you contact the Moderators about your post.**

You have a couple of options:

1. If you are submitting a completed project that meets the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines), and you made the project yourself, you may message the moderators to request that your post be manually reviewed.

2. If you are asking for help with a specific aspect of a DIY project, and are linking to a website to explain your problem, please use the [Submit a Help Request](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/submit?selftext=true) link instead. Include the link to the website in the text of the post, and also include additional context and details so that others may help you more easily.

3. If you're asking a question that doesn't meet the "specific question about an *aspect* of a DIY project" requirement, such as "how can I fix the problem shown in this website" or "how can I make the project shown in this website", such posts generally do not meet the help request requirements in our [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines). Consider asking your question in the [Simple Questions](/r/DIY/about/sticky) thread at the top of /r/DIY, rather than creating a new post.

Remember that all posts are required to meet the posting guidelines. We encourage you to read the [posting guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/wiki/guidelines) for more information.

If you believe your link meets the posting requirements, please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FDIY message=Please%20review%20my%20non-Imgur%20submission%20at%20https://www.reddit.com/r/DIY/comments/6ac3pj/homemade_greeting_card_and_crafts_tutorial/).

If you're trying to post a product/promotion, or trying to drive traffic to your website, please see [reddit's spam rules here](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq#wiki_what_constitutes_spam.3F), and if you fall into that category, please go somewhere else.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac3m2/men_of_reddit_do_you_really_think_money_is_a_big/).

## Purchase Guides

# Visit [/r/headphones' Purchase Assistants](https://sites.google.com/view/quipa/assistants). 

The tools include more than 150 In-Ear, Full-size and On-Ear headphone recommendations, as well as DACs and Amps for desktop and portable use.

**Gaming Headphones**: Read [this](http://www.head-fi.org/t/534479/mad-lust-envys-headphone-gaming-guide-updated-9-2-2013-sony-ma900-added) head-fi post.

**Budget Headphones**: Take a look at these guides; [$30](/r/headphones/comments/uywzz/guide_what_should_i_buy_if_i_have_30/) and [$50](/r/headphones/comments/v0xbu/guide_what_should_i_buy_if_i_have_50/)

[This spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/lv?key=0AvER-WhtgCFjdEpldTBWSVFLeG5pX3ZOcnFDVXdOdVE rm=full#gid=0) summarizes data from the headphone guide in a sortable/searchable format.

## Before Requesting Purchase Advice

Using [this template](/r/headphones/wiki/purchaseadvice) helps others answer your question.  Often questions without enough detail will go unanswered.

Remember that the more specific you are, the better quality the responses you are likely to receive.

After asking a question, please have some patience as responders may not always be immediately available.

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

 **No posts or comments relating to buying, selling, trading, giveaways or asking for advice about any of those topics.**
 
 What should I buy threads should be posted in /r/AppleWhatShouldIBuy to consolidate buyers advice and to stop WSIB requests flooding /r/Apple. We also recommend checking out the [What Should I Buy Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/wiki/whatshouldibuy) for more information.

	<TITLE> Day 1? Starting your weight loss journey on Wednesday, 10 May 2017? Start here! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 13:07:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Today is your Day 1?**

**Welcome to r/Loseit!**

So you arent sure of how to start?  Dont worry!  How do I get started? is our most asked question.  r/Loseit has helped our users lose over 1,000,000 recorded pounds and these are the steps that weve found most useful for getting started.

#Why youre overweight

Our bodies are amazing (yes, yours too!).  In order to survive before supermarkets, we had to be able to store energy to get us through lean times, we store this energy as adipose fat tissue.  If you put more energy into your body than it needs, it stores it, for (potential) later use.  When you put in less than it needs, it uses the stored energy.  The more energy you have stored, the more overweight you are.  The trick is to get your body to use the stored energy, which can only be done if you give it less energy than it needs, consistently.

#Before You Start

The very first step is calculating your calorie needs.  You can do that [HERE](https://tdeecalculator.net).  This will give you an  approximation of your calorie needs for the day.  The next step is to figure how quickly you want to lose the fat.  One pound of fat is equal to 3500 calories.  So to lose 1 pound of fat per week you will need to consume 500 calories less than your TDEE (daily calorie needs from the link above).  750 calories less will result in 1.5 pounds and 1000 calories is an aggressive 2 pounds per week.

#Tracking

Here is where it begins to resemble work.  The most efficient way to lose the weight you desire is to track your calorie intake.  This has gotten much simpler over the years and today it can be done right from your smartphone or computer.  r/loseit recommends an app like [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/), [Loseit!](http://loseit.com/) (unaffiliated), or [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/).  Create an account and be honest with it about your current stats, activities, and goals.  This is your tracker and no one else needs to see it so dont cheat the numbers.  Youll find large user created databases that make logging and tracking your food and drinks easy with just the tap of the screen or the push of a button. We also highly recommend the use of a digital kitchen scale for accuracy.  Knowing how much of what you're eating is more important than what you're eating.  Why?  [This may explain it.](https://youtu.be/vjKPIcI51lU)

#Creating Your Deficit

How do you create a deficit?  This is up to you.  r/loseit has a few recommendations but ultimately that decision is yours.  There is no perfect diet for everyone.  There is a perfect diet for you and you can create it. You can eat less of exactly what you eat now.  If you like pizza you can have pizza.  Have 2 slices instead of 4.  You can try lower calorie replacements for calorie dense foods.  Some of the communities favorites are cauliflower rice, zucchini noodles, spaghetti squash in place of their more calorie rich cousins.  If it appeals to you an entire dietary change like Keto, Paleo, Vegetarian.

The most important thing to remember is that this selection of foods works for you.  Sustainability is the key to long term weight management success.  If you hate what youre eating you wont stick to it.

#Exercise

Is **NOT** mandatory.  You can lose fat and create a deficit through diet alone.  There is no requirement of exercise to lose weight.

It has its own benefits though.  You will burn extra calories.  Exercise is shown to be beneficial to mental health and creates an endorphin rush as well.  It makes people feel *awesome* and has been linked to higher rates of long term success when physical activity is included in lifestyle changes.

#Crawl, Walk, Run

It can seem like one needs to make a 180 degree course correction to find success.  That isnt necessarily true.  Many of our users find that creating small initial changes that build a foundation allows them to progress forward in even, sustained, increments.

#Acceptance

You will *struggle*.  We have all struggled.  This is natural.  There is no tip or trick to get through this though.  We encourage you to recognize why you are struggling and forgive yourself for whatever reason that may be.  If you overindulged at your last meal that is ok.  You can resolve to make the next meal better.

Do not let the pursuit of perfect get in the way of progress.  We dont need perfect.  We just want better.

Now youre ready to do this.  Here are more details, that may help you refine your plan.

	<TEXT> In accordance with Rule 8, this is another reminder to ESSers to remain civil to your fellow ESSers, even if there's a difference of opinion. Don't escalate debates into abusive arguments. E.g. "Well you're fucking wrong and stupid" and "So you believe that? You must be a insert disgusting word."

Violations of this rule will be met with a warning, a temporary ban or a permanent ban, depending on the circumstances.

If any abuse is directed to you by a fellow ESSer, report it to the mods and we will investigate.

Thank you for your cooperation and fuck Bernie Sanders.

If you have questions or want to debate, please consider the subs created specifically for this (/r/Socialism_101, /r/SocialismVCapitalism, /r/CapitalismVSocialism, or /r/DebateCommunism/).  You are also encouraged to use the search function to search for topics you may not be well versed in, as they may have been covered extensively before.  Acquaint yourself with the rules on the sidebar before commenting or posting. Rules are strictly enforced for non subscribers.


- Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. 


- **Bigotry, ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans;** socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society. 

- This subreddit is not for questioning the basics of socialism.  There are numerous subreddits available for those who wish to debate or learn more about socialism


- Users are expected to at least read the discussion in a given thread before replying to it.  Obviously obtuse or asinine questions will be assumed to be trolling and will be removed and can result in a ban.

	<TEXT> Hello /u/janKhut! It looks like you're trying to post a direct image, or something that might not be the original source, to /r/dataisbeautiful. **I've removed the current thread,** since you're probably trying to do one of three things. Let me help you with posting...

---

##If you found the image somewhere:

Please note that we require you to post the [complete original source article](https://redd.it/2lokun), so that the readers can get context, the author can get credit, and third parties don't get hits from stealing another person's work. Posts must directly link to the visualization *where it was originally introduced* by the author (not an image on the site, but **the actual full web page article**). [More information here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_original_sources).

The source is rarely Gawker, Tumblr, Imgur, etc. Figure out where *they* got it. Usually a link to the original source is in the first couple paragraphs of where you found it. You may wish to try [TinEye](https://www.tineye.com/) or [Reverse Google Images](https://images.google.com/). If you need assistance, [click here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fdataisbeautiful subject=Need+help+finding+the+original+source message=I+need+help+finding+the+original+source+of+this+image:).
        
---

##If you made the image yourself:

...then you probably just forgot to add `[OC]` to the title. Simply follow the steps below:

1. Delete this current thread.
2. Resubmit your thread with the phrase `[OC]` somewhere in the title.
3. subject1093 will send you a private message instructing you how to cite your post. **Follow instructions carefully.**
4. If you have done everything correctly, /u/OC-Bot will be along shortly to reward you with [flair](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/flair#wiki_oc_flair), and sticky your citations.

Please note that you may **only tag a post as OC if and only if you made it yourself.** We are very strict about [plagiarism](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/wiki/index#wiki_what_is_plagiarism.3F) in this subreddit. No, screenshots of someone else's apps do not count.

	<TEXT> It's not that we don't care that you got something good in your pack. It's just that we don't care enough to scroll all day to find out. 

If you got something good, brag it up in here. 

If you want to know what to do with it, ask away. 

If you're about to commit pack suicides, write your goodbye letter here.

If you literally burned through all your coins and ended up with nothing... welcome to the club.

**Let us live vicariously through your mistakes or your insane good luck... IMAGES are highly encouraged!**

	<TITLE> Weekly Self-Promotion Thread - May 10, 2017 </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Self-promotion (ie posting about projects/businesses that you operate and can profit from) is typically a practice that is discouraged in /r/financialindependence, and these posts are removed through moderation.  This is a thread where those rules *do not* apply. **However**, please do not post referral links in this thread. 

Use this thread to talk about your blog, talk about your business, ask for feedback, etc. If the self-promotion starts to leak outside of this thread, we will once again return to a time where 100% of self-promotion posts are banned. Please use this space wisely. 

**Link-only posts will be removed. Put some effort into it.**     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed because it looks like you're posting music without a correct title. 

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

	<TEXT> [](/user/Maninahouse)Your submission has been automatically removed.

This seems to have occurred because it is not a direct link to a single image, or it is not hosted on an image hosting site. 

**READ BELOW BEFORE MESSAGING THE MODS ABOUT THIS REMOVAL.  THIS IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE REASON.**

**If you did submit to imgur and this was removed, you most likely linked to an imgur page and not to the .jpg of the image itself.  Please double check this, 99% of the time this is the issue.  If you are using RES, it automatically fills in .jpg when you look at the link, but most of the time it actually isn't there.**

The URL of your submission needs to end with .jpg, .jpeg or .png, and it should be hosted on an image hosting site, such as [imgur](http://imgur.com) or [minus](http://minus.com). If you are submitting an image, then please be considerate of mobile and RES users, and resubmit your post as a direct link.

For your convenience, here is your submitted link with a .jpg file extension appended to the end. Please check that it works. If it does, retry your submission with this link:

http://picsagain.com/charlie-chaplin-1918/.jpg

If the above link does not work, right-click on your image, select *Copy Image URL*, and paste that into the reddit submission page.

	<TEXT> Hello, trader! Your post is up and running. We just want to remind you of some important rules:

1. No trading of hacked, cloned, or illegal Pokmon. Definitions of these terms can be found in the [legitimacy policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/policy).
2. Do not trade valuable Pokmon of uncertain legitimacy. That includes Pokmon obtained from Wonder Trade, the GTS, and passerby trades, and may also include trades on other websites or with friends.
3. [Full details](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) must be posted when offering any shiny, event, or competitive legendary Pokmon.

If your post violates any of these rules, please edit it as appropriate, and [read the rules **in full**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemontrades/wiki/rules) before posting again. Otherwise, your post will be removed by a moderator.

* The loser has a max of 3 days to pay up, though payment should be as immediate as possible.
* Don't bet if you don't have the coins.
* State your console in your comment.
* You might want to take screenshots of your bet to limit the risk of being scammed.

What Card Should I Get Weekly Thread, where we try to figure out what card you should get or  critique your current plans or AOR if you're doing it that way). Everything is YMMV and these are all opinions. Agree or disagree with your votes. As always ***read the wiki, do your research***, and happy churning.

Also, check out the [Credit Card Recommendation Flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/5wsvzr/faq_credit_card_recommendation_flowchart/) before posting in this thread.  

[Current crowd source best offers. Please be mindful to double check if it is indeed the current best offer.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-O7cxABDN1EGwBn8KXIm4ZZVXA88SVfmv2w4NIIyYvg/edit?pli=1)

1. What is your credit score?

1. What cards do you currently have? For better results also add the date you were approved for the cards.

1. Are you targeting points, Companion Passes, hotel or airline statuses, First Class, Biz, Economy seating(s) or cash back?

1. What point/miles do you currently have?

1. What is the airport you're flying out of?

1. Where would you like to go?  (The More specific you are, the better someone can recommend the right card.  Tokyo is great, "International travel" is way too vague)

Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac2nu/is_the_isle_of_man_a_country/).

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

Is there a close relative you discovered via genetic genealogy who refuses to respond to your contact requests?

	<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

For more information, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/38uktc/meta_link_flair_system/)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

Hey /u/SletHunt42, thank you for your submission in /r/Rainbow6!

Unfortunately, because your account is new (under 2 hours old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.

Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have negative comment karma, it is easy to raise it  simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
