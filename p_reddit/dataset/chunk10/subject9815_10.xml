	<TEXT> While I though the actual writing was fairly mediocre and repetitive, I liked the story and loved the characters. I don't need to hear that Madeleine is insecure about Abigail loving the young and effervescent Bonnie over her as often as Moriarty share; I don't need Jane's pained ruminations on Ziggy being genetically evil, which by the end is he or isn't he predisposed to evil based off his father?, but I can see how the constant and repetitive inner monologue and torture helped accurately portray a Survivor of Intimate Partner Violence like Celeste and her decision to stay with Perry. 

At the end of the book I couldn't decide if it was about the survival and resilience of women despite the disruptive and violent behavior of men, or just a conclusion that men suck? 

What did others think?

	<TEXT> That's what I was thinking you were saying. I just wasn't sure because at least his outcomes have been almost across the board above career numbers. 

I actually found CRPerry13's most compelling argument not in the article but in the comments 

This season his FB/LD average exit velocity is 96.8 mph, which is right between Freddie Freeman and Bryce Harper, somewhere around 30th in MLB. In 2015 his same exit velocity was 93.0 mph, right betrween Jon Singleton and Wellington Castillo. His barrels per batted ball event was 3.6% in 2015. Now it is 12.2%.

	<TEXT> Perusing Fangraphs this morning. Marwin is now tied with Altuve for the team lead in fWar (.8). More surprisingly because most of his offense has been via HR, his BABIP is still insanely low at .179. In his last three years his lowest has been .311. 

Hopefully Marwin a) just keeps hitting dingers or b) becomes a contact hitter when we need him in that role.  </TEXT>
