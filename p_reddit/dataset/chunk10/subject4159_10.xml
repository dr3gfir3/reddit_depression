	<TEXT> Friday evening, I was off work this day and without anything to do in this boring town i'm acclaimed in my sanctuary. Confided with my computer, focused on the monitor as i'm consumed by the game in front of me. Everything else was white noise, although everything around the house is usually white noise.


"Alright that's enough Bob!"


The shriek of my mom came from across the house. Her voice gave me an instinctive feeling that made me want my ears to curl inside themselves and squeeze the pressure out of my head. The game was perforated as a second party to my old found focus. My mom is my everything.


I heard the door headed to the garage slam. She was walking out from the bedroom bathroom when I met her at the opening of her door. 

"Hi pumpkin!" as if the shrilling hadn't occurred.

"Hey mom, what was that all about?"

"Oh dad being dad."
They've been together for 35 years, and I guess she's gotten used to all of the arguing. It's always Dad is right, and Mom is wrong. But right isn't always the end all be all.

"He's got to go out of town for the week so it's just me and you. Do you want McDonalds?"
Dad usually cooks, so when he's out of town, it means my Mom doesn't have to cook, because she doesn't like to.

"Sure." I remarked, I've never really had a preference to food. If it tastes good i'll eat it.
"Alright you go get it." She said smiling biting her tongue.


As I was walking to my car I got a phone call.

"Hey buddy how's it going?"

"Hey Dad. What's up?"

"Hey, so I want you to know that i'll be gone for a week and I can trust you to take care of Mom right?"

"Yeah of course."

"Thanks buddy, I always feel a lot better when I know you're going to be there to take care of her." (Although she takes care of me)

"Yup no problem."

"So what are you doing?"

"Oh i'm going to go pick up some burgers at McDonalds for me and Mom."
I could hear him hiss at my response.

"Alright, well I got to go i'm about to get on my flight. Bye buddy."

"See ya Dad."

I backed out my car and the pigeons that like to hang out on the power line took off as if they left with me.


My mom usually goes to bed around 8:00 when my Dad is home but stays up later watching T.V when he's gone, so the night is shorter and I had some games to play. I lost my first game, it took 30 minutes to play. I was seething, mad at my teammates for costing me the game. *HOOOOF*


I started to get a headache, so I opened my window to get some fresh air. *HOOOOOOOOF*
*What?*, this sound was not coming from outside. It felt as if a Pigeon was behind me. It was dark, only the computer monitor to illuminate the room. I turned around immediately. Eyes need time to adjust in the dark, so there was nothing to see. Peering at the spot of origin I walked closer. The light from the computer monitor started to narrow, fading as if being sucked into the corner of my eye where I can notice my iris, a webbing of black. Nothing. There was nothing in my closet. 

*HOOOOOOOF!*

My heart nearly jumped out of my chest. I could hear footsteps coming from across the house. They came closer and closer to my room.

"Jared?"

"Mom?"

She opened my door and walked in.

"Did you hear that mom?"

She was baffled. The expression I could make out on her face changed to scared to manic. She began to cry.

"Mom?"

"You heard that too?"

"Yeah, there's a pigeon in the house."

"No son."

She got down on her knees in her night gown and wept more.
The room became deafening. I tried to ignore the ringing in my ears. So much noise, but through it, I could hear the pigeon. It became more frantic now. Howling consecutively, my ears could bleed. I looked to my mom. She lay down on the floor, blood pouring from the gun shot. *How could she do thi...* 
*HOOOOOOOOOOF!*


I screamed. The pigeon was too loud to ignore, it took me to my knees. My stomach was churning while i felt like my Adams Apple was going to explode. And just like that, it was all gone. I wiped the green shit from my nose and gazed at what was once my mom. *It was so sudden, what could I have done?*


The sight of my mom's head rocking back and forth interrupted my grieving. I could hear a rustling noise like a bird waking from it's nest. An object peeked out of the gunshot hole from the top of her head. *HOOOOOOOOF*


"Impossible..." I muttered.
A grown pigeon slid out and gained it's footing. It rustled it's feathers shaking the brain matter from it's breast. It took a few steps and shook. Did it ever shake. It shook, and shook. Violently it shook. 
*HOOOOOOFFFFFFF.... HOOAAAWWWWWWWFFFFFF.... AGGGHHH!!!!*

It's sounds became more human with every bellow. Shaking so hard my mothers blood splat across my face. I closed my eyes and put my hands on my ears trying to snuff out the noise and wish it away. Silence. I hadn't heard silence for hours. I opened my eyes checking to see if my wish had been granted and it had, perhaps I should have wished for my mother to be alive. *hooooof*

*I'm selfish. Maybe if I wished her alive she would be alive.* *Hooof*
*I'm useless. I should have seen the signs sooner.* *HOOOOOOOOOOF* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I got D5 for the first time which should have been a great thing. Come to find out everyone in D5 trolls and drops your MMR. Then i'm playing vs p3-p2 players and they expect me to 1v5 carry. I don't even flaunt my rank at anyone they just berate me just cause i'm D5. I once had a guy tell me he wasn't going to listen to something I said because he thought I wasn't diamond so anything I said had no merit.


Quit shaming D5 players, we're people just like you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LoL is a game of action and reaction. Recognizing the actions and making the appropriate decision along with good mechanics is what it's about. Like when you're laning and enemy adc goes for last hit on cs, he is in animation while you can auto him. The price to cs is taking damage, but not always. Sometimes you need to stay back so that you don't get cc chained by the support and ignited and die. Work on dodging skill shots and dealing harass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So say you're doing well in your lane, autoing then off creeps to where they are chunked or simply you just push faster so they are always at turret, this is called "lane pressure." If the enemy laner is forced to make a decision between taking creeps, or losing them and helping out his teammate which is a win win for you unless he gets the kills. That's why it's important to ward your bush next to the river and tri brush or further down in the river in the spot where the land goes down, it's a pin point of vision to spot enemy jungler or mid lane roam/gank. Anyways back to the question: If your jungler or mid laner is caught in river doing dragon or trying to invade help him if they are pushed to their turret. Another way is if the lane is even in the middle and the enemy adc and support go to help crossing into river bush. The advantages of having a cs lead will come into play as  you will spike earlier then them having an advantage. Now they made a mistake that ALOT of players make even in plat trying to help their jungler when they are pinched between the wall and you. This is an opportunity to force a 2v2, force summoner spells or push them out of lane. It is important when you back that you push your lane to the tower so that they have to take the cs stay and be in danger of being jumped or lose a wave of cs when you get back as you should be pushing the wave. Also if you are say 6/1 and enemy bot lane is 0/3 0/3 and you've taken first blood tower don't go mid. Tell your support to stay with you bot lane and keep pressure. Feel confident in your ability to 2v5 and smash them Bot style. Back when you need to but keep the pressure because going mid will just stall the game, get you killed and them fed unless you know you can take the tower. It's better to have level advantage, and you can acquire that by constantly pushing and pressuring. You'll get the most experience by yourself but pay attention to the map when you're solo and see if enemy is missing or if the jungler isn't on the map. You know you can take tower worry free if you kill bot lane and see the other 3 on your minimap.

Anything else? :D
Also i'm at work so thats why it took me so long to respond :3. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Plat 2 and here's my advice :D
First and foremost you have to know what every champion does. That'll help you realize if you're in a good position to do damage. Kiting is a big factor that translates to all elos but is very effective in lower elo because they will just chase you down and die so i recommend you pick up cait. To apply this use the key A and left click near the ground that'll attack the closest target to you so use it when being chased or a mix to get someone that is low that's backing off. Third, don't fight in a big minion wave, learn to dps poke without taking aggro from minions to the point where you lose a trade. (People that say trading i feel are snobby but it's actually a quite true use of the word.)

If you feel like you can win a fight roam to wherever it is if it's close to you. If you pick up kills it'll help you snowball. Bronze players make a lot of mistakes with mispositioning so there will be a lot of opportunities to take advantage of.

When you know the limits of your abilities make sure to enable quick cast so that you can animation cancel, which seems to be a large part of success. Example cait's e+q+auto.

Well I hope you got something from that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, i'm new to this subreddit, i came here specifically to see if I can get a diagnosis or if its just normal behavior.

I'm 24 years old and have been in a slump since I was 17 years old. I'm tired all of the time even when I get 8 hours of sleep. I'm afraid of consequences to the smallest degree as well as being antisocial and trying to avoid confrontation. My safety is my home and all I do is play video games while i'm there. When asked a question I don't really think about the answer it just kind of comes to me. I can think critically like solving math equations or figuring out whats wrong with computer code or recognizing a theme of a movie and I found out recently I can act under pressure when my dog was bleeding all over the floor from an animal attack I didn't waist time to tie a knot around his leg to stop the bleeding and take him to the vet. I have a voice in my head telling me over and over "I just want to go home, i'm tired." 

Anyways I guess that about covers it. Thoughts? Am I just normal but a loser, or do I have a condition that's holding me back from pursuing happiness? </TEXT>
