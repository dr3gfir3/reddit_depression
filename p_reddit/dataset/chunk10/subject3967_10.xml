	<TEXT> Considering how Rattlesnake Ledge is known as the "basic bitch of hiking trails" in Seattle, I think it's rated just about right in my book.

I still like recommending it to folks who want to do relatively little work for an absolutely stunning view. It's also ~~close downtown~~ easy to access from downtown and has a huge parking lot.

edit: Better words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also got a house in the area for below asking earlier this year. While it's an up-and-coming neighborhood, it isn't as "hot" as other places.

 I take the light rail to work.

This changed my life. I used to bus from Capitol Hill to Pioneer Square... My commute is almost exactly the same, time-wise, from Columbia City to Pioneer Square.

 The Columbia City strip is awesome too, great restaurants.

What restaurants would you recommend on the strip? I always tell myself I'm going to try something new, then end up grabbing a slice at Pagliacci...

Is there a pricing strategy that's given you more success? Am I eBay'ing wrong? </TEXT>

These are relative terms... but I'll give my suggestions anyway:

* Bill's Off Broadway is pretty chill. Get their pizza or wings.
* Stout has wide open space, lots of TVs, good selection of drinks.
* Six Arms can be a tight squeeze, but they have amazing tater tots.
* Captain Blacks has a cool rooftop deck, but it can get crowded on a nice evening.

I don't think any of these places have dance floors or live music often, it's pretty easy to hold a conversation and have drinks at all of them.

Good luck! </TEXT>

Is that money at risk of suddenly disappearing? Is that money coming from over-levered buyers (like 2006)? Are "them foreigners" propping up home prices?

If the money flooding the market is as fragile as the subprime loans in 2006, then I'd scream "bubble". However, your comment just about sums up my thoughts on things. Seems like the real-estate in Seattle has strong legs. But hey, I'm just guessing here... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite the downvotes, I guess I'll help.

 Or have you been screwed with your degree and are currently unemployed, unable to pay back student loans?

I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer science in 2009 and currently work as a software engineer, paid back all my student loans in 7 years. A degree related to technology generally pays off well.

 Do I even need a bachelors or could I do away with less?

One thing to consider: a software engineer isn't necessarily a computer scientist and vice versa. So, no, you don't need a computer science degree to work in software. In fact, some of the smaller colleges in the area offer degrees specifically geared towards software engineering.

That said, if you are interested in using computational theory to do some cool shit as a software engineer, I'd highly recommend getting a degree in computer science. You'll learn most of what you need to work in the industry (or at least learn how to learn it) and you'll dive into some really interesting theoretical topics as well.

 Hell, after you got your degree, do you feel a coding boot-camp would have been just as lucrative for you?

Maybe? I've interviewed candidates from bootcamps and find that they lack a deeper understanding of the type of code the write. Like, they know what MVC is, but lack the understanding of why MVC exists, where it came from, or what problem it solved.

 Lastly, do you feel confined to Seattle/west coast or do you feel you can go anywhere?

Kind of, but that could be because I love the west coast. However, I've interviewed with companies in New York and Las Vegas (is Vegas west coast?).

 Big loans scare the shit out of me.

As they should, good on you for being responsible about it. Like I said before, money spent on education related to technology/science generally pays off well in the long run. </TEXT>

The area around Mt. Baker station *looks* shady, but it has definitely changed. It feels safer than it has in the past. That said, I'd recommend the Columbia City station. It's surrounded by a relatively quiet, residential neighborhood. The Mt. Baker station is elevated above a busy intersection and commercial buildings.

As always... use common sense, keep your head on a swivel, and stay in the lighted areas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hotel 1000 has a nice view (if you get a room high enough). Very close to Pioneer Square and all the fun bars/tours down there. Also, a really nice (but small) spa to get a massage in.

The Westin is further north, but closer to all the fun stuff in Belltown and Seattle Center. Some of my favorite Tom Douglas spots are nearby: Palace Kitchen, Lola, and Dahlia Bakery.

Edgewater has an excellent view in nearly all the rooms (it's on the freakin' water). It's very close to all the fun stuff on the waterfront, including the Great Wheel. Still lots of construction down there though, I think. One fun talking point about it is the Beatles once stayed there.

	<TEXT>  Why does your light rail not run all the way downtown at night?

~~It does... until 1 o'clock in the morning.~~ I assume it stops running because ridership is low at that time, just my guess though.

edit: Going into downtown stops at 12.30a (http://www.soundtransit.org/Schedules/Link-light-rail). I'm still guessing service stops going into downtown because ridership is low, but someone with more knowledge might be able to give a definitive answer.

 Second, why do your vending machines not accept Amexes.

Probably the same reason lots of places don't accept Amex: higher swipe fees.

 Why does it feel like the light rail is so far from the airport?

You mean the station? If you took the right path, it's literally walking distance from the main gates of the airport.

Have fun during your stay! </TEXT>

I did a roadtrip in my XJ from Seattle, WA to Crater Lake, OR and back up along the 101. Slept in the back, got high, and saw some amazing sites along the coast. Snapped [this little gem](http://i.imgur.com/Mcn7CNI.jpg?1) while taking a pitstop. Highly recommend making the trip! </TEXT>

 We'll be in the area on 4/20 so any recommendations regarding related events or just general "check out this place" would be awesome as well.

Buy some weed, smoke it.

 we have a few stereotypical tourist stops as well but any local recommendations would be awesome too

	<TEXT> I have the 1st-gen Thinkpad 13 (roughly 4 months now) and I'll soon be looking to replace it with just about any newer T-series laptop. I upgraded from an X220, which had very decent build-quality over the years I've owned it. The Thinkpad 13, while great compared to most laptops, is not even close to the build quality of my X220. It flexes, bends, and creaks in ways the older chassis doesn't. Hopefully, the newer T-series Thinkpads don't have the same issue.

If I were you, I'd get the T470 based on the chassis material alone. If budget is a huge issue, the Thinkpad 13 will be just fine. </TEXT>

Coming from an X220, the TP13 was a huge disappointment in terms of build-quality. Hopefully the newer X and T series laptops are better... I suppose I'll find out soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently celebrated my birthday and my wife bought me a new watch! It's a Timex Expedition Scout Chronograph. One of the main reasons I chose it was because I wanted to reuse all of my NATO/leather straps that I used on my Weekender. The chronograph and date window are great bonuses and I think it looks great on my wrist! It's a bit bulkier than my Weekender, but I think it might be a bit lighter (weird). Either way, I think it's a suitable replacement.

I did a quick write-up with more photos comparing the two, let me know if you're interested and I'll share it. </TEXT>

OP, take the advice of /u/addtokart. Look along the lightrail.

While you might be fine with the "Dallas-esque" commute to and from Capitol Hill in a car, you have to worry about parking, traffic, etc. That commute will be more than brutal, it would be fucking soul-sucking.

The lightrail will extend as far up as Lynnwood and currently goes as far down as Angle Lake. If I were you, I'd look for a house as far down south as Des Moines. With your price range, you might be able to find a decent home that fits your needs. You'd also have the option to rail into work rather than drive.

It would really help existing Seattle-ites if you did your best NOT to drive into work every day.

Good luck! </TEXT>
