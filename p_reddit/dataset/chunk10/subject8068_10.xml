	<TEXT> Thanks breh. Unless I misread your Ice and Fire lore, George has created a land, Valyria, in which the inheritors of the old 'tech' actually bring about further deterioration of their society rather than advance society? FWIW, your own lore sounds like a good way to explain societies that are seemingly in a time-period stasis (as the world of Ice and Fire seems to be).

In my OP I'm looking at a scenario in which the elder races are instrumental in the setting being able to reach a technological level akin to our own in the face of younger race(s) that would undo all of that progress. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Shower Question - the Old vs the New </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is pretty much a staple of fantasy to some extent. You can substitute Old and New for Nature vs Technology if you're of the Tolkienian school. I was showering, thinking about finding a theme with which to knit my setting together - and I came up with a set-up where elder forces (Dragons, demons, angels, all that good stuff) are necessary for mankind's advancement in the face of some New Bizarre Race* that works to bring industrialization to a halt.

Have you see it done in fantasy lit, in particular, are there any big settings here in r/worldbuilding that play with this concept? I'd be interested in further research on this spin on the concept of "Old vs New."

*New Bizarre Race meaning something alien, recently emerged; not necessarily something you've never seen in the fantasy or SF genre.

	<TEXT> For film purposes? I'd have a weakened King Piccolo appeal to the Red Ribbon Army leader's sense of ambition and use their resources to located the dragon balls. Then once he regains his youth, he creates a few of his signature spawn from the anime, leaving Goku and co to deal with RR and the spawn before they get to Piccolo himself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, with Malaz I didn't have any moments where I had to stop and ask myself why I was reading it.

Have you read Richard Morgan's A Land Fit For Heroes? That trilogy has a big war between humans and dragons/dragonfolk as the backdrop. There's even a repressive theocratic regime that took power in the aftermath by lending soldiers and funds to the kingdoms involved in the war.

That's Dragonlance, done right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they were high priority targets, you'd have a good point. The idea is that the pueblo PC and castle PC are at about the same educational level as the other villagers. As for the idea of a commando-type PC, they could go for ambiguity ie other soldiers intercept the PC at the end of the game and take 'em away.

Are they undercover US agents? Are they Saddler's goons? I'd leave it vague.  </TEXT>

I know Moorcock skews left on the political spectrum, a bit of an anarchist I think (or he was back in his early days). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little while ago I was talking with a couple of acquaintances. While I'm in the middle of a hunting story, one of them asks out of the blue, "are you seeing anyone?" I say that I'm not and keep going with my story.

Some weeks later the same girl comes up to me and asks how I'm doing, academically. I'm like, "yeah, I'm doing fine." She tells me where she and her friend like to go study. I reply with "yeah, I could use a white board at my place for studying." She breaks it off and walks off, I go back to studying.

Some weeks later, she stops by to tell me when she and her friend will be studying. Its brief, but she's kinda smiley through the whole exchange here about lab technique.

Now she's back to giving me funny, kinda perturbed looks. Did I accidentally come off as a jerkwad at some point here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Malazan fandom. I'm a Malazan fan and those clowns act like Deadhouse Gates is the best book in the series when its really Toll the Hounds. The whole "stick with it until the second book" thing rubs me the wrong way. If you didn't like the first, I don't see why I should expect you to push yourself through 600 pages to a volume that you may or may not enjoy. </TEXT>
