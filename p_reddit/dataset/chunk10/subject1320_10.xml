	<TEXT> I did not know the candles being thrown was going to happen.  Cameras were setup in the past.  A majority of them went missing, got thrown themselves. Some are still missing. Others outright broken.  I pulled out my cell phone because a few minutes prior the lights in the hallway and bedroom were going off and on.  I got this footage by accident. I was trying to record the inexplicable light phenomena when all of a sudden the candles got thrown. Watch part II, III and part IV and you'll see me journey into the hallway and masterbedroom.  Thats where the EVP voices begin. A light goes off to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well "I'm a Mirror" can be heard.  The EVP was found upon review and based on my knowledge some weeks/months after the fact I can't remember if I heard anything. My reaction suggests I did, by my turning in the direction of the camera.  It does seem odd my turning towards the camera coincides with the "Im a Mirror" caught on video tape.    Not to mention the voice recorders in the kitchen.


My gut instincts tell me I heard something. But unfortunately we'll never know, this video was viewed weeks later upon which I can't remember what I was thinking at the time that caused me to turn towards the camera.  Its weird though and no my health is just fine.  If you didn't hear what I think, then what did u hear? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Normally I would agree. But those perimeters you mentioned were already taken into consideration. You assume I'm holding the voice recorder in my hand. I'm not. I rarely hold a device in my hand for that very reason. I'm used 4 voice recorders, 3 sitting side by side. The 4th sat in the hallway.  The tascam and the Zoom H2 do a superb job with filtering out air and background noise, hence their studio quality.  You get what you pay for and I only buy the good stuff.  Quality of equipment helps with debunking what we got.

You hear me talking, no exhaling is taking place. I'm alone in the room and the question being asked only requires that the answer be yes or no, hence the "No" being heard.  I've done countless of these and the words "YES" or "No" is ever captured during moments where nothing is asked.  Seems too convenient that both a "YES" or "NO" would only appear during direct yes or no questions.  

The "no" is then compared to the countless other "no" compiled over a period of time by other teams and other individuals.  "We analyze the "No" and it registers the same on the decibel reader.  same pattern, same and different environments. The only common denominater is "me."


IMO, low quality EVPs should not be ignored or not shared just because there low quality.  We've been able to determine these spirits voices are  lower, decibel wise when less people are in the room.   

There seems to be a correlation between the quality of EVP and the quantity of individuals present.  Thats the analysis here.

It seems plausible that both people (and their equipment) play a role in the quality of the EVP. Might be the entity's are drawing energy from everyone's who's present.    Granted this is a low level EVP. But it low level because I'm the only home.

	<TEXT> Correct. The local Priests gave up. Local paranormal teams gave up, the evidence gathered and end revelation being this phenomena is associated with both the land area, and possible previous tenants.  We had exorcisms done on the house and myself.  I moved out May of this year.   https://youtu.be/sB_fnZ7pu1M  Still dealing with a few attachments at my new place but nothing equal to this. Thank God.  </TEXT>
