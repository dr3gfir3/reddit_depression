	<TEXT> Because the prices of everything are going to increase. Trump just increased a new home price by $3,000. Education costs will rise under Trump. Milk prices just increased. It's the big picture, not the price of strawberries.

Businesses need to compete price-wise, which is why Trump uses foreign workers and imported steel.

Bush and the republicans pushed us very near a second depression

Trump set some stiff GDP goals for himself. He plans to achieve them through inflation.

BTW, I am a republican. </TEXT>
