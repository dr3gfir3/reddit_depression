	<TEXT> You are confusing two different post-Conquest myths on the Conquest of Mexico. 

[Hernan Cortes](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/df/Hernan_Fernando_Cortes.jpg/800px-Hernan_Fernando_Cortes.jpg)' hair was brown/black, not red. One post-Conquest myth said Cortes was the return of Quetzalcoatl based on an unsubstantiated myth that somehow turned a semi-mythical Toltec king of the same name into a white man.

[Pedro de Alvarado](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a6/Alvarado.jpeg) had red hair and had the nickname Tonatiuh, the name of Aztec sun deity. It is disputed whether his nickname came from his red hair or some other esoteric quality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anthropologists in the 19th century used to believe that man originated in Europe based on skeletal remains from Neanderthals. It was only with the discovery of older hominin remains in Africa that they stop to reassess their model. Anthropologists changed their model as more and more earlier hominin remains were recovered in Africa and not in Europe.

Thus if the oldest homo sapien remains were recovered in China and their context and age are secure, we would have to stop and reassess our model on human origin and evolution. Either humans originated in China or we have yet to find even older remains in Africa. If more old remains continue to be found in China and not in Africa, the model would have to change. If we find older remains in Africa than the ones found in China, the model would simply need to adjust for the earlier migration date from Africa to China.

These models rely on data. As new data is presented models have to change to accommodate the data. It's basic science.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Incans had the Llama and Alpacas which were both able to be used to pull wagons once carts were introduced by the Europeans yet never encouraged the Incans to pursue wheel tech . 

Have you been to the Andes? Do you know how mountainous it can be? Carts are only so effective in that region even with Inca roads (which were not broad flat roads like today).

 or anything iron for that matter

Several Native groups made things out of meteoritic iron.

 a lot of the soil in the Americas really needs to have an iron plow to really be able to effectively cultivate the ground

What are you basing that off of? Because the Americas were able to support tens of millions of people just fine without the plow.

 ith a vigorous trade network, ideas and concepts might have been able to spread more easily and thus the Native Americans might have develop the social and cultural conditions that helped the Eurasians become more technologically advanced in contrast to the Americas.

That's kind of a huge assumption to make. You make it sounds like history is a game of Civilization where everyone starts out at the base of a predefined tech tree working towards a common end. History isn't like that, at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A team led by Timothy McCoy from the National Museum of Natural History recently conducted tests on several beads made from meteoritic iron recovered from a Hopewell site near Havana, Illinois. These tests concluded that the meteoritic iron used to make the beads matched samples of meteoritic iron excavated at Anoka, Minnesota. This suggests that some sort of trade was occurring between the two sites. There are two competing models of trade for the Hopewell. One system relies on goods and ideas being traded with neighboring communities and the other is based on individuals or groups physically going to and returning from more distant locations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been reading *Correspondence Analysis and West Mexico Archaeology: Ceramics from the Long-Glassow Collection* by Roger Nance et al. on the side. In the background chapter by Phil Weigand, Phil describes the Palacio de Ocomo. It is the only publication I've come across that provides details of the *tecpan* despite excavations going back to before 2013. The excavators just have not published anything, though I think they submitted reports to the government which are hard to find. It's just nice to finally read some details.

Just for some measurements, the final construction of the *tecpan* measures roughly 125 meters a side. It encloses a space that is 60 meters by 70 meters. The highest preserved point of the *tecpan* measures 6 meters. Unfortunately due to its close proximity to the town of Oconahua, many of its finely shaped stone slabs that once covered the structure were mined for other uses like house foundations and a bridge. Phil said these slabs measure  40-50 centimeters a side and some of them were even carved with symbols and possibly glyph (he doesn't include pictures/drawings, though). There's not very many pictures of the structure floating around on the internet yet despite the site being registered with INAH. Oconahua is kind of out of the way to visit. You can see some shots of the *tecpan* in this [interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJwu1j3_Wx4) with Monty, the lead archaeologist of the project. He's a cool dude and he used to work at Los Guachimontones.

I hope Monty publishes more on this structure. It's an important and large building for West Mexico dating from the Epiclassic to Early Postclassic. This was a time of great change in the region when people were no longer burying their dead in shaft and chamber tombs, constructing *guachimontones*, and creating the elaborate and lively hollow ceramic figures that grace many museums across the world.

/u/400-rabbits, I think I recall you asking me for information on the Palacio. If you would like, I can scan the pages and send it to you to read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of that is a result of sample bias based on the testing of mostly non-African populations and the other part is the result of reduced genetic diversity due to a founder effect as people migrated out of Africa. A small population left Africa as early as 100,000 years ago. That small population held just a fraction of the diversity from the entire continent. So as the population settled other areas with smaller populations splitting off to travel further, the amount of genetic diversity is further reduced. According to the founder effect model, the last places settled by humans tens of thousands of years ago should have the least genetic diversity. As it stands, Native Americans have some of the least genetic diversity on the planet since the Americas were the last continent to be settled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do not confuse scrutinizing with discrediting. Archaeologists are simply doing their duty and peer reviewing the findings to assess whether they hold up. It is not an attack, it is an evaluation. And for these kinds of claims, they rightly deserve heavy scrutiny. We cannot just accept everything at face value. Archaeology is a science, after all. Claims require testing and scrutinizing.

	<TEXT> Yes, agriculture was independently invented in the Americas. 

To copy/paste an answer I gave [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/1uji41/why_was_there_gap_of_over_100000_years_between/ceipxd9/)

 There's a number of factors that can contribute to this answer and the debate has raged on for 100 years. Factors such as population density and a dwindling food supply are often mentioned, but I am of the mind that it was the weather. Up until 12,000 years ago the climate around the world fluctuated from hot to cold and back again in intervals as small as a decade in some cases. This makes it extremely difficult to cultivate plants to grow in a certain climate if the climate is never stable. 12,000 years ago marks the Holocene and we have had a relatively stable climate that allowed people to settle down and begin farming. Whether that is, in fact, the case or not is still up for debate but the fact remains that people just were not able to farm before the Holocene.

 [Richerson, Peter J., Robert Boyd, and Robert L. Bettinger
2001, Was Agriculture Impossible During the Pleistocene But Mandatory During the Holocene? A Climate Change Hypothesis. American Antiquity 66(3):387-411.](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/AgOrigins_2_12_01.pdf)

To quote the source cited 

 "Might we not expect agriculture to have emerged in the last interglacial 130,000 years ago or even during one of the older interglacials? No archaeological evidence has come to light suggesting the presence of technologies that might be expected to accompany forays into intensive plant collecting or agriculture at this time. Anatomically modern humans may have appeared in Africa as early as 130,000 years ago, but they were not behaviorally modern. Humans of the last interglacial were uniformly archaic in behavior. Very likely, then, the humans of the last interglacial were neither cognitively nor culturally capable of evolving agricultural subsistence. However, climate might also explain the lack of marked subsistence intensification during previous interglacials. Ice cores from the thick Antarctic ice cap at Vostok show that each of the last four interglacials over the last 420,000 years were characteristic by a short, sharp peak of warmth rather than the 11,600 year long stable plateau of the Holocene. Further, the GRIP ice core suggests the last interglacial (130,000-80,000 BP) was more variable than the Holocene, although its lack of agreement with a nearby replicate for for this time period makes this interpretation tenuous. On the other than, the atmospheric concentration of C02 was higher in the three previous interglacials than during the Holocene, and was stable at high levels for about 20,000 years following the warm peak during the last interglacial. The highly continental Vostok site unfortunately does not record the same high-frequency variation in the climate as most other proxy climate records, even those in the southern hemisphere. Some northern hemisphere marine and terrestrial records suggest that the last interglacial was highly variable while other data suggest a Holocene-length period of stable climates ca. 127,000-117,000 BP. Better data on the high frequency part of the Pleistocene beyond the reach of the Greenland ice cores is needed to test hypotheses about events antedating the latest Pleistocene. Long marine cores from areas of rapid sediment accumulation are beginning to reveal the millennial scale record from previous glacial-interglacial cycles. At least the last five glacials have millennial-scale variations like the last glacial. The degree of fluctuations during previous interglacials is still not clear, but at least some proxy data suggest that the Holocene has been less variable than earlier interglacials." </TEXT>

Take Cyprus for example. It's only ~80 kilometers from Turkey and ~100 kilometers from Syria. And yet the island remained free of human activity until some hunter-gatherers created a kill site around 10,000 BC. People did not settle the island until 8200 BC. 

So you want to tell me that people were somehow able to cross the Pacific ocean by boat to settle two entire continents, but they couldn't sail to an island in the eastern Mediterranean that was only 80 kilometers away? I just don't buy it. </TEXT>

I would be doubtful of that. People did not begin settling Polynesia until 3000 BC. They did not reach Hawaii and Easter Island until after 1000 AD.

You and several hundred Venetians in an aging medieval coastal island fort defend against tens of thousands of Ottoman Turks in September, 1570. Your only hope is holding out and getting relief from Venice, the Papal States, and Spain if they can move fast enough. You have to deal with Ottoman cavalry charges, sappers, marksmen, and artillery. Your commander, Marco Antonio Bragadin, orders you and a small contingent of soldiers to sneak out of Famagusta and wage a guerrilla war against the Ottomans. You roam across the fields and mountains of Cyprus as you disrupt Ottoman camps, supply lines, harbors, and fortifications. Friendly Cypriots who do not want to fall under Ottoman rule can aid you and your men. Unfriendly Cypriot will rat you out to their new masters. You are the only thing stopping the Ottomans from completely controlling Cyprus, the eastern Mediterranean, and maybe even all of Europe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those of you that cannot read the article, the authors determined that the cave paintings at Guerrero were painted over a period of time. The famous enthroned figure and the jaguar and man pair have been dated to 2200-1980 BC and 1520-1410 BC, respectively. These dates come from calcium oxalate that forms on the surface of rocks. These early dates put the art style at Oxtotitlan to before the rise of the Olmec culture. It throws into question what constitutes "Olmec-style" artwork if this art style predates the very people it is named after. Much like the Mixteca-Puebla style being found in Nayarit centuries before its presence in Oaxaca and Puebla. </TEXT>

The excavators noted that some of the higher status houses were bare of artifacts which may indicate that they knew of the impeding invasion soon enough to pack up valuables. Lower status houses were not so fortunate. I'm really amazing at the ring and chisel that were found. If either object were to break they would have been melted down and remade into something new. The fact that they were left behind speaks volumes about the impeding Inca attack. </TEXT>

This is based on the style of artifacts (bells, tweezers) and the methods of making items (using sheets (Panama) and casting (Ecuador)). So you would have to ask why coastal Ecuadorians and Panamanians did not get llamas from the mountains before you ask why Mesoamericans did not get llamas from South America. </TEXT>

You want to say that one region's art is similar to another, you need to do that comparison. And one of the key elements of codex style art is not present in Mississippian art. You may think they look similar, but as you have demonstrated repeatedly, you have a surface and amateur knowledge of pre-Columbian studies that is based entirely on a lecture series since you have failed to provide any sources to back your argument.

	<TEXT>  The lecture references thousands of sources. Maybe millions.

I asked if you had sources that was not the lecture. Not whether the lecture had sources. We've already established that you refuse to relay any of the lecture's sources to us.

 You called them landlocked.

They are landlocked. The Triple Alliance is made up of Tenochtitlan, Texcoco, and Tlacopan. None of these city-states are on the ocean. Tributary provinces were largely autonomous and were only required to provide tribute. If they failed to provide tribute, they were punished. Hence the term indirect control. That means the Aztecs were landlocked since their own territory that they physically and directly controlled was not on the ocean. Comprendes? 

 My point is not arguing against genetic similarities. My point is that they don't TEST them. Meaning that's not the standard they use in determining if this or that is Maya. Just if they speak Maya.

Are we talking about modern or post peoples? Because you can't directly test language for past peoples. You can indirectly test it through writing. And when we identify Maya peoples in the archaeological record, we look at multiple sources of evidence such as their art, architecture, burial styles, tool types, ceramic types, etc. It is more than just language. When you make the same sort of comparison between the Aztecs and Hopi you find they share very little.

 So you don't think two Native American groups who both speak Uto-Aztecan languages and come from the same places of caves have ANY similarities?

Do you know what a language family is? It is a very broad category in which multiple languages are grouped together based on linguistic characteristics. While Hopi and Nahuatl are under the same broad category, they are not similar enough to be mutually intelligible. Their common language was thousands of years in the past. Thousands of years which allowed languages to change over time. In that period of thousands of years, so too did their respective ancestral cultures. They changed so much that the Hopi do not have feature caves in their origin mythology

http://www.sacred-texts.com/nam/hopi/toth/toth002.htm

So no, they are not similar.

 It's the same as a French man and a Chinese man?

No, I used Poland the Mughal Empire. Both speak an Indo-European language (!!!! a broad category !!!!!), but neither group could understand one another. And neither group shared very similar histories or cultures as you are suggesting with the Aztecs and Hopi. </TEXT>

 Yes

Do you have any sources that are not the lecture?

 So now you admit they DID control it. So you were wrong.

I said indirect control from the start, you failed to read.

 It was not weak when dealing with a technologically equivalent civilization.

It was weak since they were continually putting down rebellions from people who did not wish to pay tribute.

 Copout. Their shared history becomes whatever one of them is, as the defining factor is those who speak Maya. 

Just because one group may experience something does not mean all groups did. This is as true now as it was in the past. Events in Belize, for example, do not necessarily affect those in Yucatan or Guatemala. Likewise, events at Chichen Itza would not necessarily have affected those at Kaminaljuyu.

 There is no Maya blood test.

There most definitely are genetic similarities between Maya peoples. Why would you even try to make such a claim?

 All Uto-Aztecan peoples have a shared cultural history.

Maybe thousands of years ago long before the Aztecs or Hopi were a culturally identifiable group. But that does not mean that the Aztecs and Hopi were in any way similar in the early 16th century. Since you say they are, what are their defining historical and cultural similarities? </TEXT>

Kinda, except that the mounds were covered in thin layers of colored clay. They would have had stripes of red, yellow, white, etc. But then all squared, flat topped mounds technically look alike.

 They controlled from coast to coast. https://i.redd.it/j9s79gucemny.png

As I said, indirect control. How many of those territories retained their rulers and merely offered tribute to the Triple Alliance? The answer is, most of them. The Aztecs were toppled by the Spanish and Tlaxcallans because their control over their empire was indirect and weak. If they wanted to go out and conquer someone, they first raised troops from their three member cities before relying on any of their tributary provinces. Ross Hassig explains troop recruitment in his book *Aztec Warfare* (1988).

 There is huge overlap. Maya are defined as people who speak Maya languages. That's literally it, for example.

No, the Maya are defined by their shared culture, history, and language family. The Aztecs do not share the same culture or recent  history with people in the Southwest. As I said, it is like the Polish compared to the Mughals in the 16th century. </TEXT>

Indirect control over other territories does not mean the Aztecs had access to the ocean. The Aztecs, after all, inhabited just three cities in the Basin of Mexico. So yes, they were landlocked. 

 Also all UtoAztecan peoples are their cousin cultures from the place of 7 caves. Including people like the Hopi

You are confusing a language family with cultures and peoples. People can and do freely adopt languages and cultures that were not initially their own. Uto-Aztecan is also divided into northern and southern branches of which Hopi is part of the northern branch and Nahuatl part of the southern. While both branches had a common point of origin, that origin was many thousands of years ago long before the Hopi and Aztecs cultures developed. These two cultures are as similar as the Polish were to the Mughals in the 16th century despite both groups speaking an Indo-European language at the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And you overestimate how far people physically traveled. Goods may travel long distances along a trade network, but people most likely did not. As I said in my post above, intermediaries were most likely used between the Southwest and Central Mexico. The pochteca would not have physically traveled to the Southwest. This is supported in part by Book 10 of the Florentine Codex. The Aztecs only described a handful of different cultural groups, all of them in close proximity to Central Mexico. If they had traveled as far as the Southwest, would descriptions of the people and places not be recorded? </TEXT>

If they are correct, the Bajio is still very far south of the American Southwest. It would make sense that Nahuatl speakers would not have a word for buffalo.

As for the Pochteca actually reaching the US Southwest, "pots are not people" as the saying goes. Goods may have reached the Southwest from Central Mexico just as goods reached Central Mexico from the Southwest. That does not mean that people in both locations physically traveled from one point to the other. Instead, intermediaries were most likely used that helped move goods along. The same can be said of goods like jadeite from the mountains of Guatemala being found in Central Mexico. Trade goods are traded through many hands before they reach their final destination. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Has anyone heard of the Maguey Plan before? Adela Breton made copies of it which are now in the Bristol Museum. Apparently it records households in Tenochtitlan? I'm not entirely sure,

http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=230507

Also, I was taking another look at the site map sketches of Los Guachimontones that Adela Breton created. I finally realized why the two maps look so different. They do not depict the same site! [This map](http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229150) depicts the ceremonial core of [Los Guachimontones](http://i.imgur.com/S1Pfu3g.png). But [this map](http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229149) is actually a map of [Loma Alta](http://i.imgur.com/bMRAwNQ.png) located further up the hill from Los Guachis. Breton failed to draw the ballcourt correctly for Loma Alta leading me to think that she drew a weird version of Los Guachis. So that's cool. I also took a look at the scrap book of photos and confirmed that two of the photos were of Circle 1 and one photo was of Circle 2.

I am curious about another sketch that Adela Breton produced. This sketch was of a stone relief at [Cerro Guzman](http://museums.bristol.gov.uk/details.php?irn=229147), Jalisco, Mexico. I have very rarely seen stone reliefs from Jalisco. My guess is that this is from a Postclassic relief. I just wish I knew where Cerro Guzman was located. My Google searching has not quite found a place where this could be unless it is suppose to be near Ciudad Guzman just south of Sayula. </TEXT>

 Why do you think Malinche the random Maya slave was fluent.

Malinche wasn't Maya

 And I said there is NEW evidence.

 https://audible.com/pd/History/Maya-to-Aztec-Ancient-Mesoamerica-Revealed-Audiobook/B00TKIYO46

Can I get something that not an audio book?

 Your argument is broke as Nahuatl speaking Mexican army traveled where they'd be alerted to buffalo

 Wherever they have been or traveled, Pochteca traveled a thousand miles more

A thousand miles or more? So you're saying since Nahuatl speaking troops accompanied the Spanish to the US SW, the Pochteca thus reached Canada? They reached Kentucky? Because both of those places are a thousand miles from the US Southwest.

	<TEXT>  They've found Maya evidence such as tropical birds goods since then from the Maya up north. New discoveries.

Yeah? Mind providing a source? Or are you confusing the presence of the scarlet macaw found in San Luis Potosi to the macaw remains found at Casas Grandes? If so, the exchange required no Maya people.

 There is no evidence to the buffalo numbers that you claim. The natives did not kill them in such numbers to decrease them in population as you claim.

I said that Natives managed the buffalo numbers before Europeans arrived. After the arrival of Europeans, disease and colonialism took their toll on Native populations and Native populations declined. With less Natives hunting buffalo, buffalo numbers were able to grow in number. Savvy?

 There was no push for nationwide Spanish during the New Spain era. They kept them speaking whatever. Marching their newly conquered armies of hundreds of thousands of Mexicas north and South

But there were other people besides the Aztecs and they spoke other languages that were not Nahuatl. To say that everyone in Mesoamerica spoke Nahuatl is false.

 Place of Seven Caves is in the American Southwest somewhere

lol no. The Aztecs themselves said they only traveled a hundred leagues or so before reaching the Basin of Mexico. That would place Aztlan and the Seven Caves somewhere in Guanajuato. And based on early Postclassic evidence in areas like Jalisco and Hidalgo, it would seem that Guanajuato is the place of origin for these Nahuatl speakers that intruded in the region.

 They saw buffalo and recorded it in their libraries

 It's just burned and lost to time

Sound like a convenient excuse, but one that does not answer why a word for buffalo or bison does not exist in Nahuatl. You would think the term would be recorded in Molina's dictionary or even Remi Simeon's dictionary compiled a couple of hundred years later. Yet both dictionaries lack any words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Umm the settlers killed the passenger pigeon and the buffalo

 Meaning the buffalo extended even further before

No. As I said, with a reduced Native population the numbers of these animals grew. Then Europeans came in and began hunting them to or towards extinction.

 The long arm of the Pochteca was reduculous...both south and north

The Pochteca traveled far, yes, but not that far. You honestly think an Aztec trader traveled all the way to New Mexico for turquoise?

 and if they've found evidence of Maya in the US

They did not. You are referring to Richard Thornton's work? It is pseudo-archaeology

 Also Spaniards took the Nahuatl speaking Mexican army when they did the California missions and tried to conquer random parts in the south west

So? Your map doesn't show buffalo in California or Arizona. And by the time they appear in New Mexico it is the 1800s, long after Spain's early colonial expeditions with Aztec troops.

 Mexico was mostly Nahuatl speaking until the Mexican revolution

That is completely false and ignorant of Mexico's heritage and its people. It completely ignores the multi-ethnic nature of both pre-Columbian and colonial society in Mexico.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, that map does not show their extent in pre-Columbian times. It shows the extent of the buffalo since the 1800s. Between 1492 and 1800 disease and colonialism took its toll on Native peoples. Without Native peoples in sufficient numbers to help manage the buffalo population, their numbers grew. Just like the passenger pigeon. 

And even if they were in northern Mexico, that does not mean Nahuatl speakers would have a word for them. Nahuatl does not extend as far north as northern Mexico. </TEXT>
