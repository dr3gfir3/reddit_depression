	<TEXT> About two years ago it took me a little over a year to track down every issue including The Morning Star option which was a limited series before the real comic began. Now there's 3 large paperback collections of all issues but I can't bring my self to buy it because I love my individual issues. I had no faith when Fox picked it up but god damn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, please. I absolutely love the comic Lucifer and read that as well as Sandman once a year. You want to talk about an adaptation that's gone off the rails? Fox's version of Lucifer spits in the face of anyone who read the comic. American Gods(although not exactly what you want) ain't that fucking bad.  

As far as your concerns over buckets of blood and raging cocks, maybe you're just too sensitive for the material? Everything I've seen so far in both episodes has been necessary and quite stylish.  

Pretend the book was just a synopsis for this series and let it rest deep down in the back of your mind. You'll enjoy the show a little more. It's the only one you're getting. </TEXT>

If she's dead there's no reason to return. I guess I'm just so used to movies explaining themselves that I expected more explanation than he had already given. I actually appreciate this exchange even more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone please show me the scripture that says anything about Satan being an angel. There isn't any. Satan or Shaitan was just a creature that lived on the Earth. Nowhere does it say anything about him being a fallen angel. If you want to get into Sammael an actual angel but no connection, or Lucifer(never said to be an angel) then I'd be interested.   

The Antichrist was never said to be angel, that's all Renaissance poetry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The robber(played by Tim Trella) is a professional stuntman. His build is nothing like Hader or Rogen. It's kind of interesting you thought of this but like other people said, the cops were more wacky than violent. The only argument would be that Hader does totally smash that kid in the face at the party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The show was about a pissing and moaning rich guy who couldn't use his powers. The entire season should have been the first 3 episodes with growth from there. The story is about a guy who becomes a monk and trains for 15 years but he can barely fight. Most of the characters motivations don't make any sense. Danny was completely irresponsible and let people with little to no experience tag along on his missions. In the old comics Luke Cage and Iron Fist are great friends, I have no idea how they will ever convince me that Danny Rand isn't anything but a bleached(seriously who was dying his hair?) blond, self-centered twat.   
That being said I'm glad you enjoyed the show but as far as your 'untrained' eyes go, I come to these shows for some action. The choreography is terrible.   
Let me ask you this, did you enjoy Jessica Jones? </TEXT>
