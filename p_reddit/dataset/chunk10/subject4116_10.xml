	<TEXT>  You posted a photo of a hobby you do in a context of how you'd use it. By my standards you'd be completely fine.

When you said "posting a weapon with no context" I had assumed you meant that we lacked the knowledge of the context. Obviously there is a reasoning behind the post, a context. But the same as someone happening upon my post, the context is not obvious to an ignorant observer.

This conversation is pointless because we don't know the circumstances of the child who originally got suspended.

The child who originally got suspended? As far as I'm aware there is a single child who got suspended, so the distinction here confuses me. 

But if the child never showed an interest in airsoft, never talked about wanting to play on the weekends. And then randomly posts a photo of a gun that says "ready," I would take notice.

Sure, take notice. Now are you saying that is what happened, and you have evidence to show? Because otherwise that's just baseless speculation.

In an age where school killings exist, you cannot idly stand behind vague statements of guns. The reality is an airsoft gun resembles a real gun, and that concidencde is not lost on children.

I'm 24, when I was 17 the climate was no different than it is now. In fact I have a fairly distinct memory of being sent home for a day because my Halloween costume included a trench coat that year.


The physiological evaluation begins at a conversation. If you know these kids and they're completely harmless, then you tell them to not associate their image with vague displays of weapons. And you don't support it.

Why? Because you don't like it? Because you associate guns with fear, and intimidation, and attention seeking behavior? I've been using guns since I was 10 years old. I received my hunting license at 13 after taking a safety course. I've posted a fair few pictures of guns on social media, for a while my profile picture on MySpace was the rifle I enjoyed using the most. I had several pictures of myself holding weapons, showing them off. There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of that, and I'm disgusted at you trying to twist it around so that there is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 17 I played airsoft. I posted a picture on facebook of myself in full tactical gear holding an airsoft rifle. By your standard my school should have pulled me aside and had me evaluated because I had a hobby that I enjoyed and wanted to show off.

Your assessment is absurd. An airsoft gun is not necessarily a weapon, in the same way that a hockey stick and a baseball bat are not necessarily weapons. Even if it were, liking someones post of an airsoft gun does not mean you are seeking to draw attention and cause fear, you have drawn no connection there. All you've done is make baseless assertions about the implications. </TEXT>

Also, you're making a non-sequitur. Yes it's a bad thing to have blasphemy laws, but that fact doesn't have the implication you're claiming it does. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  strategic timing

Supposing it was a Russian state actor the timing damn near couldn't have been worse. There is a political media blackout in France.

previous hacking attempts on Macron by Russia

Failed attempts are not proof of success.

document metadata leading to a Russian security contractor

I've given several explanations for that, all of which you have no disagreed with so I'm inclined to believe you're either being intellectually dishonest or you're just not reading the things I say to you.

fabricated documents

That is a fact that, in of itself, in no way points to Russian state actors. 

pattern of previous Russian interference with democracies

Russia is hardly alone on this front. You'd be hard pressed to find a single major nation who you could not accurately make that statement about.

coziness with the Le Pen campaign 

That is in no way evidence of the assertion you are making.


You can try to construct an alternative explanation, but it'll need to be pretty convincing.

No, it wont. All it needs to be is plausible. And you're just being ridiculous at this point, because I already listed 4 such alternatives. Again I have to wonder, do you just not really read the things I'm saying, or are you being intellectually dishonest? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in no way asserting that any of the documents are verified. I didn't know if they were. But that doesn't make them fake. The dichotomy you're presenting is false. It's not "either you prove they're real, or they're fake". The reality of the situation is that there is a middleground, that being the one I was taking. The position of "I don't know".

	<TEXT> Do you have any information I don't about how the hack was done? I can't seem to find any specifics about how the emails were attained. 

To answer the question of why, I would suggest that there are many reasons. 

To name just a few, if there is an easy way to distinguish between fake a real emails and the real ones contain nothing incriminating then it's perfectly plausible that the campaign, or an allied group/individual with similar goals, leaked it themselves in order to rally voters in their favor. A false flag attack, if you will.

If there is not, then it could just be the act of someone(s), unrelated to the security firm in question, who is hoping to damage the campaign while also creating a patsy so that their involvement is less likely to be discovered.

It could also be an actual attempt releasing the emails to the public with good intentions, that was corrupted by someone(s) somewhere along the process. It's even possible that the campaign themselves planted red herrings so that in the event of a leak they could point to them and say "yes we were hacked, but look clearly you can't trust these documents". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why could this not be the work of just a single individual who is fairly competent?

Why does creating a patsy mean that this isn't some random security firm with only a bit above average level of competence?

I don't know a ton about IT security, but I know enough that I'm reasonably certain that it's not beyond the capability of a single competent actor, or group of actors, to find the name of an employee who works for a Russian security contractor and then spoof his signature while editing the files or something along those lines.

And I disagree that this is a small mistake. This is a huge mistake. This is a mistake that, should it actually be a mistake and not a red herring, pretty much ruins any value they could have been seeking from leaking these documents.

The headlines turn from "Macron implicated in scandal through leaked emails" to "Russian security firm with governmental ties attempts to smear Macron through false email leak"


Also one has to wonder about the timing. It's a well known fact that the French impose a media blackout in regards to politics in the 2 days prior to an election. This is pretty much the worst time they could have leaked the documents. </TEXT>
