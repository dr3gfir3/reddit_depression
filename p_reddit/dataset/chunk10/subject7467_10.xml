	<TEXT> The Dutch speak English fluently because their TV and cinemas  isn't always synchronized so they watch a lot of American shows. Nothing to do with education.

In France they teach us English very early and throughout the whole educational process. But our TV and cinemas are all fully translated to French, therefore we don't use English on a daily base.  

Same goes for Spain, Germany and Italia by the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I'm from Europe I just moved in a house in Adelaide (Unley) and I'm trying to find out which kind of internet should I get?

I  looked up many websites and ISP providers but jeeez its such a mess,  ADSL, ADSL +2, FTTN , HFC, NBN..  it was much more simple in EU so I'm lost.

I was planning on getting NBN HFC 100/40 from internode but its pretty expensive ($99 monthly) and I 've read that its kind of like gambling, some have a good speed, others dont.


I'm a gamer and I play mostly online games so I d like something kinda reliable without having to sell a kidney.

What would you recommend ? 
Also, I'm in a house that has TV/phone cables ( they look the same in France so I assume it is that), if I would apply for NBN HFC, will they need to make nees holes in the house or it would just go through existing cables ?

Thanks! ( beside that mess, i love your country I hope  to become a true Aussie citizen one day) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes good one, I had trouble with it before and I was ashamed sometimes when having sex. Its just better  to be honest and when my girlfriend is about to go down I usually just tell her to wait a minute and go wash it quickly, its just better for everyone.
