	<TEXT> I'm only saying Cersei and Dany go mad. Like you say, people seem to assume that Dany will rule the kingdom with Jon. Everything points towards that happening, but that's too happy of an ending for Game of Thrones. George R R Martin himself has said that the ending will be bittersweet. I think someone big will die and I think it's Dany. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the show has shown her slowly losing herself in her desire to take the thrown. She's slowly gotten more violent, especially if you remember how she was when we first saw her.

George R R Martin has described his story and characters as "the human heart in conflict with itself". I think Dany becoming a villain would complete that arc for her. Atleast one of many possibilities for her story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> George R R Martin himself has said that his prophecies aren't necessarily true or set in stone, they're open for interpretation. I still think Jaime will kill her somehow. You have some good points though, how do you think the Hound will kill her?

I haven't put much thought into which dragon it could be, Viserion does seem to make most sense. My guess would be that warging is limited to living creatures - however that doesn't rule out White Walkers in my mind. They're still alive... in a way.

Tyrion might be able to calm her but in the chaos of war, I can still see Dany losing control of herself. It feels like anything can happen now that she's in Westeros. And Tyrion might not always be at her side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Warging into a resurrected zombie Ice dragon is just about the most metal thing ever. I doubt we'll see that, but who knows.

That's an interesting way to go even further with Jorah and a smart way to incorporate the salt and smoke from the prophecy. But Jon being Azor Ahai seems to make more sense, it's a fun idea though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [EVERYTHING] Some theories about the future of Game of Thrones </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 18:46:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a couple of theories about the show and I just want to throw them out there. I follow this subreddit but I haven't personally seen anything about these particular theories. They might be popular and widely accepted already, I don't know. But I'd like to hear about what you think and if anyone is more knowledgeable than me about the show and has read the books (I haven't), then feel free to share how likely these are to happen, or *not* to happen.

1 - I think Jaime will kill Cersei the same way he killed the Mad King and for the same reason - she will go mad and want to burn the city to the ground (she already said she would do that if anyone harmed her children. Now they're *all* dead). Cersei already has already burned people alive - in fact destroying a small part of the city in the process.

2 - I think Bran Stark will warg into one of Daenerys' dragons - the only living dragons we know of are on their way to Westeros, remember. The Three-Eyed Raven has told Bran "You will never walk again but you will fly" and that might mean warging into birds at first, but eventually he will warg into a dragon. And while I'm on Bran, (this isn't my theory) but I love the theory that [Bran is Brandon Stark](http://wikiofthrones.com/1763/heres-proof-bran-stark-bran-builder-person/) "the builder" who built the Wall.

3 - Speaking of Daenerys - I think she will become more of a villain towards the end. She's already done some pretty extreme things like crucifying slave owners and burning her enemies alive. She seems hellbent on taking the throne which she considers her birthright, no matter the cost. The whole series seems to lead towards a big battle in Westeros, she's on her way there at the end of the last season. The whole series "A Song of Ice and Fire" has strongly hinted towards Jon being Ice, and Daenerys fire (either that or White Walkers and Dragons but it's perhaps not as clear cut as that). It seems like Jon and Daenerys perhaps might become king and queen over Westeros but that's too fairy-tale-like for Game of Thrones. I think in the end she will go mad like her father (not *as* mad but definitely going too far) and Jon Snow will be forced to kill her. Jon Snow is one of the only characters who has consistently acted like a true hero and always tried to do good even if it's not the easiest choice. He seems like the real hero of the show, overall. Either that or I think Jorah Mormont (who I think will suddenly appear in Westeros, cured) will be forced to kill her. Which is super tragic of course because he's spent so many years protecting her, but that's GoT in a nutshell. Wouldn't that be a great dramatic scene?

Anyways, that was a bit rambley but I just want to see what the community thinks because I've thought about these ever since the last season ended. I mean, what else is a GoT fan to do while waiting for the next season? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I once knew a guy in school who was deaf. He had an assistant who could speak for him via sign language. This was back when people used MSN, and talking to him there felt like talking to a completely different person. We could have a normal conversation.

Do you feel like a different person online? It must be very freeing for you, I imagine?

Also, I don't mean to get too personal but I read another post you made somewhere about a very dark past you've experienced. Do you think that experience has anything to do with becoming mute? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To keep it short, I've been getting a double "child benefit" payment every month since I was 6 years old. My parents used that money until I was 18 and it stopped when I was 24 (2 years ago). Taking money that doesn't belong to you is illegal in Sweden and I can potentially be sued for recieving and using that money for those last 2 years. Turns out, I've been getting anothers kids money.

Tax agency fucked up and my parents should've stopped it immedietly, but *I'm* the one being investigated now. </TEXT>
