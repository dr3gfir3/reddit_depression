	<TEXT> I'm confused as to why you reviewed the sound design of Cave Story+ instead of looking at the original Cave Story?

Also at the end you mention that Cave Story came out in 2004 but the game you reviewed, Cave Story+, came out in 2011. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a process involved. The judge blocked the order but the DOJ appealed. There will be a hearing on May 15 to see if the block should be upheld. The DOJ (or the other party) can keep appealing up until the case reaches the Supreme Court. The court can then decide if they want to take the case or they can let a lower decision stand.

Does that process seem fine to you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want to romanticize illegals but you do have to admit they are human. Immigrants come to the US for a better life. They want to provide for their families, they want better opportunities. What other reasons would they risk coming here for? That, however, doesn't mean I don't also want sensible immigration laws. It took my parents over 10 years to get a green card. They became citizens less than 5 years after they got their cards though. I think it should be easier to immigrate to the US. I think waiting many many years is ridiculous.

As for illegal immigrants that are already here I do think it's fair to punish them but I don't think the solution is deportation then reapplying. I think a fine would suffice, fine them and get them into the system. Stop worrying about them and then focus on making immigration easier.

I think that is where we will disagree. I want easier immigration. You probably want less immigration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They all mean different things. The post has a very good explanation on what they mean. Personally I think we all should just use the base 2 version (mebibyte, gibibyte, etc.) because computers are binary. Underneath all the marketing bullshit they still work using base 2 (or base 8 or base 16) but not base 10. Note that when you buy RAM they list things in gigabytes not gibibytes. Try going into dxdiag and looking at how much memory is reported. 8 GiB of RAM is reported as 8,192 MiB. If you got 8 GB of RAM then Windows would report it as ~7,629 MiB of RAM.

I think this is confusing because marketing people wanted to make it confusing to the average consumer. Computers will always work in base 2. I think it's easier to explain that 8 GB is actually 8,192 MB instead of explaining mega vs mebi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lisa was at the supermarket in the pets aisle looking for a new toy for Lisa. She decided on a new toy when she saw Norman looking at cat food. Lisa put the toy in her basket and turned towards Norman.

Hi Norman she said. Norman turned around. Hi Lisa, how are you doing? he asked.

I am doing well. I was just picking out a new toy for Lisa, she replied. Well I am sure Lisa will like it, said Norman. Lisa then remembered CSI would be on soon. Yes, actually I have to get going, she said. OK, see you at work tomorrow, said Norman. Norman walked further into the aisle.

Lisa wanted to get a small carton of eggs but she would have to walk past Norman again to get to them in the back of the store. She did not know if she should say hi to Norman again so she decided to head to the register. She could have cereal tomorrow morning instead. She liked cereal.

As the cashier scanned the bone she thought to herself, *Maybe tomorrow I can tell Norman how much Lisa liked the bone.*

	<TEXT> Norman turned the corner to the pets aisle at the supermarket. Norman needed more cat food. As he entered the aisle he saw Lisa comparing items. Norman thought Lisa looked busy so he didnt say hi and looked at the shelf to find the cat food brand Norman liked.

Just as he found the bag he heard Hi Norman from behind him. He put the bag into his basket as he turned. It was Lisa. Hi Lisa, how are you doing? he asked her.

I am doing well. I was just picking out a new toy for Lisa, she replied. Norman looked at Lisas basket, there was a plastic dog bone sitting at the top. Well I am sure Lisa will like it, he said. Yes, actually I have to get going, said Lisa. OK, see you at work tomorrow, he said. Norman turned and walked further into the aisle. Norman thought about getting Norman a new toy but then he remembered CSI would be on soon.

*Maybe next time Norman* he thought to himself.

That is...incredibly wrong. See here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_Service_System#Failure_to_register

 As an alternative method of encouraging or coercing registration, federal legislators passed laws requiring that to receive financial aid, federal grants and loans, certain government benefits, eligibility for most federal employment, and (if the person is an immigrant) eligibility for citizenship.

It then goes on to state that some states mandate you register to get some state benefits (like a driver's license) but nowhere does it say you don't get the right to vote until you register. Nowhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CS student here. Had a Surface Pro 1 since it launched (so almost 3 years at this point) and I bought a Surface Book with no dGPU at launch (128 GB 8 GB RAM). I'm happy I went with the Surface Book. I thought it would be a really hard decision to choose between a SP4 and the SB but the SB won out. One thing I don't miss from the SP1 is that with the SB I have the ability to use my laptop at weird angles, sitting in weird positions, or be able to type with the keyboard while sideways in bed (not practical at all but I still do it sometimes). My SP1 could do it but the keyboard would have to be at the right angle and I would have to provide way more support.

What I'm basically saying is that you will probably like either no matter what you do. What I think it really comes down to is if you really value having an actual laptop with a hinge vs having a detachable screen.

...I do miss the kickstand though, kind of wish the SB screen had a kickstand... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes? It's hard to compare the two since they exist in very different environments. Most would say Powershell isn't as good as bash. I also don't need to use Powershell on a day to day basis. When I use a Linux based operating system (usually doesn't happen too often) the things I use in bash the most are things like vim and debuggers. Windows is a GUI based system so there are GUI based solutions for things. Linux has more command line solutions for things. They both work well when they need to. But yes it would be great if Powershell had native SSH (and yes I know this is now SoonTM). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had ups and downs. The insider previews have certainly gotten better over the last couple of months. I rarely get bugs (maybe one app crash every couple days). Glance however doesn't work for me. It did work 2 builds ago but not it won't install for me. If you don't factory reset after upgrading to 10 you'll be fine because Glance will stay installed but it was always recommended to factory reset after an upgrade. Hopefully that won't be the case for the RTM build.

It's been at least 3 weeks since the last build came out so the RTM build should be very solid. I would say once 10586 comes out (RTM) try it out (since you probably won't have to wait that long for the build anyway). </TEXT>

I was upgrading from a HTC Surround (WP7) and was super excited for this phone. My one regret was not waiting a week or so to pick up the cyan version (I have a black 920). The Microsoft store didn't have any in stock when I went to pick one up.

Still using the same 920 as my daily phone. It runs pretty well on Win10 but I'm really looking forward to the 950. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've owned a Surface Pro 1 since it launched (so almost 3 years). I really really love the device, I use it every single day. I'm currently a junior CS student in college. I haven't had to use a paper notebook since I bought the Surface, all of my notes have been hand written in OneNote. The pen is great for just jotting things down randomly or sketching out ideas. I can run Visual Studio on it, Linux (I had a Arch Linux USB boot for one of my classes), I bring it to hackathons and code on it (Python Flask apps?, front end web development?, Android app?, Surface can handle it all).

Went to the store today and preordered the Surface Book. I really couldn't decide between the Pro 4 and the Book because I've gotten so use to the tablet and kickstand that I thought I wouldn't really like the Book any more than the Pro 4 but the Book has a bigger trackpad and the screen really isn't that much bigger than the Pro 4 screen so I preordered a base model Book. Pretty excited to get my hands on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe stories expire after 24 hours (not too sure, never used Snapchat since I've only owned Windows Phones). Regular snaps expire after a set period of time. I think that's why some people like it. Send a silly maybe slightly embarrassing photo, it gets "deleted" (since you can save snaps this is kind of pointless) after a couple seconds.

With the MMS thing nobody wants to spend time trying to fix it. If they need to talk to their carrier then that's at least 15 minutes trying to connect to the right person. Why fix something when you can just use something else that works? (In this case, Snapchat). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My T experience actually started Sunday night right after the Patriots game. Got into South Station and needed to take the last Fairmount train. Train was due to leave at 11:50. They announced the train was boarding on track 5 at 11:40. Walk onto the platform. Train is empty, no MBTA workers anywhere to be seen. There are 3 people (me and 2 others) waiting to get onto the train. We find that one of the doors is unlocked so we go into the train (this was at about 11:50). We wait on the train for 5 minutes when a conductor gets onto the train and says that the train we were on is actually a Worcester train and that the Fairmount train had been canceled for some reason. So we get off the train and walk to the information booth. Nobody working in the booth but there are two MBTA employees standing right next to it. We tell them what happened and they don't know why the train was canceled. She tells us to check the commuter rail ticket booth to see if anybody there has any information. It's midnight now so the booths are closed. We walk back and she makes a call and tells us that the train was canceled because nobody was going to take the train apparently. She then tells us to go up to the signal booth and talk to the guy there so that they can order us a taxi so we can get home. It took a while for the taxi to get there (we ended up going up to the booth a second time so that I could give them my number so the taxi driver could call me when they arrived). I got back home around 12:30.

Getting into work on Monday wasn't that bad. It was leaving work that was the problem. At around 4 PM I get a TAlert stating that the red line was experiencing severe delays due to a disabled train. Coupled with the fact that Fairmount trains were being delayed and canceled I decided to leave work immediately before I got stuck somewhere. I believe I got onto the last red line train that left Kendall/MIT towards South Station before the red line basically shutdown. Got onto the 4:25 Fairmount train at South Station that was delayed by 20-30 minutes. About a minute after we leave South Station the train stops apparently due to a signal issue. It took them about 20 minutes to fix the signal issue. My commute back home took about 90 minutes when it usually takes 30. I count myself lucky because I probably could have gotten stuck at Kendall/MIT for a while or would have to wait for a super delayed Fairmount train.

This morning at 7 AM I got a TAlert stating that the red line was experiencing severe delays again. I said fuck it and went back to bed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just maybe. They do have something planned. The reason people are upset is because network quality has gone down over the last couple of patches. It may be due to more people playing League at this time of year but Riot hasn't said anything regarding the degradation in service. It may not even be Riot's fault (damn ISP's) but their silence about this is why people are upset. </TEXT>
