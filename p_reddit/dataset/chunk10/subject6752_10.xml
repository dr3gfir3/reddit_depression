	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just received my S8 and I'm trying to transfer my files, however, Smart Switch sees my iPhone and attempts to look for the data. When it finally reaches 99%, the app says it lost connection to the phone. I have tried this like 3 times.

Using wireless doesn't help as the S8 doesn't see my iCloud backups. 

Any help? I'm not looking forward to transferring things manually but if it comes to that, then I will do it.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Greetings! 

Couple of questions about the change:

1-) Does Samsung Smart Switch support Whatsapp? If not, what's the best way to transfer Whatsapp messages between the two OS?

2-) Can I change the round icons in the phone and keep the same launcher (I preferably want to keep Bixby on the left)? I don't like the way the icon looks assuming this is stock: http://imgur.com/a/feXGl

3-) How long does Samsung take to ship promotions? I am interested in the free Gear VR. If they also launch another promotion, are current owners eligible or is only for new customers?

4-) How do you deal with apps that don't take full advantage of the display (displaying black bars to fill in)? Most apps have this or just ones that have not been updated in a long time?

Anything else I should know?

Thanks in advance!

Not really. Just set up avoiding adding fingerprint, passwords, and/or Apple ID, then install the Pangu app. Once that is installed, Jailbreak and delete the app. Afterwards, go into safari and go to jbme.qwertyoruiop.com and create a Home Screen shortcut to it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been using this IDE for quite sometime now and personally, is the best IDE for Python.

Just a couple of quick feedbacks, is it possible to run our Python code on MacOS' Terminal as opposed to the IDE's terminal? Can you guys implement [Touch Bar actions on the Mac?](https://developer.apple.com/macos/touch-bar/). Lastly, is it possible to implement a function to remap the key shortcuts?  </TEXT>

You can use a website to re-jailbreak if you decide to stay in iOS 9. See this: https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/67z8k4/discussion_to_those_who_suddenly_lost_their_pangu/

  So I can plug it to iTunes and update?

I would recommend doing a backup (iTunes and iCloud) and restoring the phone. Then restoring the backup.

Do you even use BT? Explain to me how Android (or literally any other device) devices know when you want to connect a BT mouse as opposed to a Speaker? 

 Connect known device, drive, disconnect device, the phone marks itself as parked.

Wrong. Since you are telling me that my phone can't differentiate between what I connect to it, I took a trip to a random location in my area and back to walk with my Bluetooth headphones (used in one way only) that are known to the phone. I used Maps' Navigation and all Siri can do is tell me this after I finish the route: http://i.imgur.com/eUcwBLm.png .

	<TEXT> I never said that BT devices tell others where they are. It does matter what OP's car is telling devices what they are. Does the phone knows when to record where I park the car if I use my Beats headphones or a Bose Speaker? No, because it shouldn't. It should record when a car says via Bluetooth that they are a car </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It shows up as that, but BT actually tells devices what they are.

Your iPhone outputs a signal saying, "hey, I am a phone."

You car, however, could be outputting its signal as a BT speaker, which will tell the phone to not record where you park the car as you know, the car isn't telling the phone it is a car. 

I tested this when my family rented a '17 Explorer. The car told my phone that it is a car and I was able to see where it is parked, but my stepdad's car didn't.  </TEXT>

Isn't this what you are talking [about?](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK122LL/A/power-adapter-extension-cable?fnode=8b)

The thing is $20, not $100 </TEXT>
