	<TEXT> I have noticed many people use two different mics, the camera mic while recording themselves and another better quality mic when showing things that dont require them on the camera (animations, timelapses etc). 

So my question is, how do you feel about it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I wouldnt have it based off the movies. 
Neither would I want him to look like Hugh Jackman. 

I was thinkin more comics based, with the classic villains. And definitely a younger Logan so the claws and healing factor would still be intact. 

As for the rights, if Arkham games could get rights to so many characters, why won't this game be able to pull that off?

	<TEXT> If any studio works on a game based on Logan, and develop it upto the caliber of Batman's Arkham games, then it would be huge. 

Plus, like how in most games the characters heal after some time (eg. Uncharted), that same logic can be applied in the Logan game and fans will happily digest that because Wolvo heals. 

A studio should definitely work on this. Can someone from Rocksteady pick this up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been out of the gaming business for a long time, just recently put my foot into it. My last three games that I have completed and really enjoyed playing are The Last of Us, Uncharted 4 and GTA V. 

Currently playing Arkham Knight but it's not giving the feels of the above mentioned games. 

I was thinking of looking forward to either Watchdogs 2(didnt play Watchdogs) or The Division. But the reviews arent like what TLOU received.

Which game would be better in your opinion? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remember Messis iconic celebration after the PSG game? (6-1)

Remember Iniestas celebration against Chelsea in 2009? 

See now you wouldn't want us to call you cunts for celebrating a victory when the opponents were clearly robbed right?

And I am done telling it to the people who rely on media but I'll tell it once again. That Bayern game was disastrous refereeing. In the first leg they received a penalty for chesting a ball. In the second leg, multiple times it was supposed to be a corner kick (something RM is real good at) but was given a goal kick. That own goal by Ramos was also supposed to be caught offside. 

I would mention the faults the ref made to favor RM but seems like you know that already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although this data is beautiful, Alexa has become a lot less reliable. They collect information by two methods. 

1. I as a website owner have to buy their subscription and they provide me with a tracking code so the visitors and page views on my site get counted. 

2. I as a user can install their plugin that would automatically send them data about what sites I visit. 

The miscalculations arise when I don't have a plugin installed and I am visiting a site that did not subscribe to them. These visits will not get counted at all. I am pretty sure all the top 100, even top 1000 sites, all of them have subscribed to Alexa. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMHO, I think iSCO is much better coming in the match as a substitute. In high intensity games, Isco will just be a regular footballer. But if he comes on after the players are tired, around the one hour mark, then he can dance his way to glory. </TEXT>

That was a really scary experience. When asked in-game to look behind, I could barely move my neck. But I did look behind in game and was in for a scream.
