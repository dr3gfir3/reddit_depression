	<TEXT> Sure, the pork belly went into the ziploc bag with:

1/4 cup each of soy   mirin;
2 tbsp each fish sauce   sugar;
1 tbsp of ketjap manis;
chopped ginger and scallions.

Cook for 24 hours at 68 degrees C in the water bath.

Let bag cool, then pop it in the fridge to solidify fat. After cooling, remove belly from bag, chop into 1 inch wide slabs and sear them over high heat. Strain sauce from bag into saucepan, leaving the hardened fat behind, and add 1/4 cup broth, minced garlic and scallions, and healthy big spoonfuls of white miso and gochujang paste. Reduce, then pour over the belly. Really, really, good.

	<TEXT> Unlike most macarons, I would serve these the same day I make them. The cheese has a lot of moisture that will make the shells soft.

This recipe is based on the recipe for cocoa macarons in Les Petits Macarons. (This is an excellent book, and their website also has a good video tutorial. Macarons are hard to get right and there are lots of details missing here. This is only a skeleton recipe!!) The almond meal and powdered sugar quantities are reduced because freeze-dried fruit powders tend to absorb a lot of water and make the batter too dry. The sugar is also reduced in the egg white mix because these are "savory," although if you go too far in reducing the sugar they won't work out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the basic recipe; divide proportionally based on the actual weight of the egg whites:

Preheat oven to 200 degrees.

140 g almond meal
140 g powdered sugar
25 g tomato powder (used Denver Spice brand from Amazon)
Blend these together in food processor and sift into a bowl.

5 g powdered egg white
3 g cream of tartar
130 g granulated sugar (used caster sugar because most mac recipes call for it)
115 g aged room temp egg whites
Combine these four ingredients, and whip the mixture until stiff peaks form.

"Macaronage": combine the two mixtures, folding them together, until the result resembles lava. (This is what recipes always say.) Pipe the resulting lava-like mixture into circles on a silpat, and bang the tray on the counter to release air bubbles. It is helpful to watch videos if this is new to you.

200 degrees for 15 minutes, then 350 for 11 minutes.

For the filling: fresh goat cheese, with rosemary leaves chopped very fine, and mixed in some salt and pepper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The cookie part isn't completely free of sugar, because the sugar helps to hold the almond flour together. But they don't taste sweet, and the filling is simply flavored goat cheese! </TEXT>
