	<TEXT> Has there ever been a time where you were the only one in a theater, and it made the movie creepier to watch? Like if it was a horror movie, or something like that. When I went to see Coraline on a weekday evening after school, the only people in the theater were a mom and her daughter sitting near the front. It really creeped me out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering how all of season 3 aired last in year in a giant steven bomb, do you think we'll get another Summer of Steven this year? I wonder how much of season 5 will air this summer. I imagine they have quite a few episodes already completed.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In Unbreakable, what if the son had shot Bruce Willis? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I watched Unbreakable for the first time a few nights ago. During that intense scene where the son (Joseph) finds the gun and almost shoots his father in order to prove he's unbreakable, what if the kid had actually pulled the trigger? Do you think Bruce Willis/David Dunn would have been killed or at least severely hurt? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Most effective jump scares in non-horror films? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Jump scares in horror movies are very common, and it's something we've all come to expect. However, what do you think are some effective jump scares in non-horror movies? The Lord of the Rings scene with Bilbo (you know the one) is usually the first one that comes to mind for me, but I recently watched Unbreakable for the first time and it had some effective jump scares towards the end. That scene where Bruce Willis opens the door and sees the homeowner dead and bloody on the floor was pretty disturbing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even for a grown man, Dennis seemed almost freakishly strong. The movie implied he would have tossed the girls around like fluffy pillows if they ganged up on him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to Papa Bear Restaurant, and because the waitress' shift was ending in 20-30 minutes, she was trying to rush my friend and I out the door and get us to leave quickly. For example, asking us if we were ready to order literally 15 seconds after we sat down, giving us the bill *while we were trying to enjoy our fucking meal*, etc... </TEXT>
