Good that people are fighting for legalisation but sometimes you have to act in professional manner. Childish behaviour keeps the movement back. Media has very bad attitude towards cannabis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah just pure terpenes. A lot of times weed just lacks taste but still gets you high. So buying normal quality or even below par taste weed, you could add this and make the weed taste good.

	<TEXT> I completely agree with both your statements. I don't believe in 50 1g. It's just what is happening right now. I've probably smoked chinky bud but I'd never buy it again once I have. Some of the weed that comes out of them weed houses is crap. The thing is it still gets sold. Whether it gets mixed in with good bud or sold as fat bags. Your just wasting rizla rolling it. It's never cured right. When it's being cured. That's when they most vulnerable to robbers so want it sold asap. They want to chop and cash in as quick as possible. If they were growing same quality as Cali weed. We all be happy lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have said that for a long time. I seen weed grow in Denver. They are a business 1st. They care more about quantity than quality. Anything grown over there should be grown over here. 
It just isn't. Cheese/lemon. That's all I come across and honestly them strains just don't stand up to some of the strains coming over from USA.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You basically doing the same thing to me mate. I really am surprised at this much shock for Cali weed. It's been around for some time now   people are smoking it. Plus paying the top prices. I totally agree it's fucked up. But normal for me to see people smoking that Cali weed   paying that !  I wouldn't personally pay that.  </TEXT>

That's your prices from your dealer.

I've had og kush grown here that smelled like cabbage. I had some blue kush that was grown here. That was lovely. People just ain't growing Cali quality weed in the uk. Or if they are it's not on a large enough scale to actually effect the market.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm guessing we must just have very different mindset when it comes to weed. 
I'm not justifying anything. I posted just so people could see. Dam weed  amp; Cali weed are very different to normal weed(lemon/cheese). Strains vary and what you can  amp; cant get depends on location and mainly dealers. 
I can tell there's a big difference in all weed. I'm not gonna smoke some cheap shit chinaman grown weed just because I can get Q for 50. If it tastes like crap and don't get me high what's the point. 50 1g of imported Cali is worth it in that situation. You can't just say all weed is the same. It's not or you wouldn't have everyone with new strain every week. If you can't taste the difference in different strains then clearly you won't be interested in import weed. 
I never bought 50 1g. The worlds a big place. People smoke differently. Look at USA. Legalisation has created this high end weed market. It's made its way over here. If you can't see the difference in quality of the weed. Then you won't appreciate that the costs involved differ too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you smoked Cali before? Or is what your saying  right just because you think it is?

I get you feel like it's not worth it. I agree that weed grown in warehouse in Cali, can   should be grown here the same. That is not the case. Prices reflect that. I've smoked Cali weed in Cali. Also been Denver, seen and smoked out there too. Nothing that's grown here is as good as that. I love you to prove me wrong. Like to see this weed your getting that's better for cheaper. Please post some pictures. Enlighten me to your vast knowledge of weed. 
If you picking up 2g of standard lemon/cheese and are trying to compare that to Cali. Then don't bother  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1.4 scores are normal. In east London. Ammi bags are never more. Get some good dealers with lemon bags 1.8. Like I said. 50 1g of Cali. Is very common. People go mad at the prices. No one telling you to buy it. If you want to smoke Cali. That's what it costs. Unless you can get to DNM. 50 is a lot. Totally agree. Depending on quality of weed. Prices vary. It's not like old school. 20 8ths. You won't pay more 10 1g but your not smoking the same quality weed either. 
I'm not saying expensive is better. Cali bud costs that much. You didn't smoke it. I can't tell you this was a lot better than anything you might have in your allotment  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mate 800-1000 oz for Cali import. I'm being very serious. People are buying it. It's become very common now. I'm guessing people who know how to use DNM are making a killing. But idiots out there a buying it. Although more people selling now. So prices have dropped to 40 1g. 
I honestly believed I was getting a good deal paying 30 1g for Cali. I pay 220 for my amnesia haze oz. I know that's expensive too but you have to pay or I don't get anything. Just need better dealers.  </TEXT>
