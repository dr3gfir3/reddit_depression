	<TEXT> The blog post mentions the following:

 In addition, many industry partners will be debuting their Street View ready hardware and desktop applications this week at our Street View Summit in Tokyo, Japan.

Seems like this was just posted to let people know about the new street view opportunity and upcoming hardware releases.

	<TEXT> It won't be available immediately. Newegg is the only one mentioning that. B H, Best Buy, and even the Asus website just mention marshmallow.

[9to5Google](https://9to5google.com/2017/05/09/asus-zenfone-3-zoom-now-available/) mentions the following:

 Out of the box, the ZenFone 3 Zoom offers Android Marshmallow, which is disappointing, but ASUS has promised an update down the road to Android Nougat.

That is likely what Newegg is referring to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Snapdragon variant should be alright for that. At the moment, it's really tough to say how Samsung will be treating the unlocked S8 when it comes to updates. They could reverse course and keep it on the same update schedule as the carrier variants or it could be the same situation as before with them lagging behind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on what you're looking for. Some opt for the international models to get the Exynos processor and because it's better for custom software development. With the U.S. unlocked models, you're guaranteed to have all the necessary network bands to work on GSM and CDMA carriers. The international one will only work on GSM and I haven't checked to see if it has all the necessary LTE bands for ATT or T-Mo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  An exclusive source has shared with us a render of the T-Mobile REVVL T1, which is expected to be the first of at least three devices launched by T-Mobile. The others are the REVVL T2 and REVVL T3 PRO and while we dont have specs for the T2 or T3 Pro, were guessing the T1 will be the most affordable of the three devices

* T-Mobile REVVL T1: midrange device, 5.5-inch 1080p IPS display, a 3,000mAh battery and a fingerprint sensor. 13MP rear camera w/ a front-facing 5MP selfie camera that also has a flash and captures wide-angle images. T-Mobile REVVL series runs Android Nougat out of the box, but expected bloatware aside, its unknown if itll be a heavily skinned interface.

* The T-Mobile REVVL T1 is set to be an ODM device thats manufactured by Alcatels parent company TCL,  </TEXT>

However, after experiencing last year how Samsung treats the unlocked U.S. models when it comes to updates, I won't be going that route again.

Down side is that it doesn't include many icons at the moment. I posted it here since submissions for apps below 1,000 downloads are no longer allowed.

Also, the dev has other LG V20 themes available (paid) that have positive reviews. Keep in mind that something like this wouldn't have many installs to begin with since the V20 isn't as popular as more mainstream phones and even fewer people with the device are looking to buy a theme for it. </TEXT>

Edit: AP mentions [here](http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/05/03/nvidia-launches-shield-preview-program-let-test-new-software-released/) that there was such a program last year, but it was closed down. The author does mention that "this one seems to be more publicized and tailored for regular users who'd like to participate in beta tests and give their feedback regarding new features." That "more publicized" part is likely why I never came across it before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Larger displays sell better 

According to [IDC](http://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS42334717)

 "Despite the moderate 2.5% growth in 2016, phablets displayed 49% year-over-year growth as consumers continue to flock to big-screened devices in both emerging and developed markets," said Anthony Scarsella, research manager with IDC's Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker. "Phablets will undoubtedly be the main force driving the market forward thanks to an abundance of feature-rich devices in both the premium and entry-level segments. Total phablet shipments worldwide are expected to reach just under 680 million units by 2021, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 9.2% for 20162021. In comparison, regular smartphones will grow at a rate of just 1.1% during the same period, proving perhaps that bigger may be better, or at least more popular when it comes to smartphones."

	<TEXT>  However from a practical perspective, the composition unit is likely where most users will see or feel the real differences. Responsible for compositing and scaling the different layers within a UI, ARM has consistently been buffing up their composition capabilities over the years to handle Androids increasingly complex UI and features. The Cetus display processor can now composite 8 layers  up from 7 on the previous-generation processors  and with 4 scaling engines, can scale up to 4 of those layers.

 This is especially significant for Android 7, which introduced multiple/side-by-side window modes, and each of which requires its own layer. Combined with any special layering effects on a given window (e.g. window animations), and a multi-window setup can easily eat up layers, not to mention pixels as well in the case of a high resolution tablet.

	<TEXT> From the [press release](http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170427007040/en/Nintendo-Launch-Nintendo-2DS-XL-Portable-System) 

 The new system will be available in a stylish black/turquoise color, and will use the same size large screen found on New Nintendo 3DS XL systems. As the name of the new system implies, visuals will be displayed in 2D only. The system is lighter but still packs the same power as New Nintendo 3DS XL, and has built-in NFC support for amiibo cards and figures. It can play the massive library of quality Nintendo 3DS, New Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo DS games in 2D. Nintendo systems are also the only dedicated video game systems where people can find their favorite characters and game franchises, such as Mario, Peach, Yoshi, Kirby, Pokmon, Fire Emblem, Mario Kart, Super Smash Bros., Animal Crossing and The Legend of Zelda. </TEXT>
