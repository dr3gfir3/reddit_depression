	<TEXT> You see, capitalism is built off of choice. You always have a choice to either labour for someone else's gain at low wages, or go die on the street or something. Nothing exploitative at all because no one is really forced to do anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few individuals owning property is incompatible with socialism. It literally means the social ownership of the means of production by society as a whole. Any state or society that fails to meet this criteria is not socialist. That's always been the defining characteristic.

And that whole keeping what you earn thing is bs. How many wealthy people merely got their wealth from their parents? And besides, they all "earn" everything they have by profiting off the labour of others. If a worker produces X amount worth of product, why should the factory owner "earn" that product and not the worker? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it won him two terms, but the party shifted right. As a result, the new "centre" shifted right. Now the country is more right wing overall than it was. If we try to meet in the middle again, the centre will move even further right. It wins elections, but eventually defeats the point of being a left wing party. Hopefully the disaster that is Trump will enable the Democrats to make a strong leftwards swing and still crush the GOP in 2020. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The wave of automation should be embraced. Having a job isn't, and never should be the meaning of life. Once one is not required to take part in menial activities taken over by machines, they may utilise their newly found free time however they please, perhaps explore and develop their creativity or discovered talents. Once labour is no longer necessary, it is only logical that all wealth produced by machines be collectivised, since no one really has more of a right to capitalise off of automated labour than anyone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, no major branch of the US Government can be called democratic. I don't think anyone needs convincing that the EC is shit, but it's also the House, which is gerrymandered to the point of no return, and the Senate, which is about as representative of the people as the estates general. Seriously, your senate vote can vary in value by dozens of times depending on where you live. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd have to disagree. I know a lot of people, even family members, who were totally unable to afford health insurance at all before the ACA, so they couldn't receive necessary treatments for pre-existing conditions, and now we might go back to that.

Regardless, all of the largest taxes created under Obamacare are placed on the wealthiest Americans, people who don't have to struggle to put food on their table. The people it helps most are those who have the hardest struggle- the poor and lower class. </TEXT>
