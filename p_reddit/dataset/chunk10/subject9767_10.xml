	<TEXT> Unfortunately console at the moment until I get a better PC. My current one I'm surprised is still chugging along. I'm very glad that you're doing better. It's amazing what games can do for people. Really. It's just something about this game that really drives me. It makes me want to accomplish so many things in life, as corny as it sounds. I've come to realize that the world isn't such a bad place after all. Thanks for your words.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That proves nothing. If people use a XIM on console that's their choice. I don't agree with it but I aim just fine with a controller. Take the YouTuber stanky for example. People said he wouldn't be as good with a controller on PC and guess what? He's reached top 500 and GM with a controller. Try again.  </TEXT>
