	<TEXT> I've suffered from OCD for almost two decades. How has it affected my life? It's a bit like being mentally crippled, nobody can see it but you're struggling all the time just to make it through the day.  The most beneficial healing method for me has been meditation, I been to three weekend retreats and they've each given great healing. I've always depended on a strong faith in God and clung to the hope it will get better (it has!). A few years ago I started keeping a journal which allows me to express my anxieties and separate myself from them a little and also pray for healing. Obviously, I've been on meds for years, but they just keep the lid on the pot tightly clamped, they do nothing to reduce the heat or release any steam. It's frustrating how the psychiatric profession has bought into the idea drugs are the answer to everything, they're not by a long shot. I've started teaching meditation to kids now, so I hope the next generation will be given better coping tools than we were. I feel like all the different media they are exposed to is creating a battleground in their minds where they are never good enough, which is the basis of all advertising. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the assassin girl, thought she was great. The one I have a problem with is guy playing Dirk Gently who portrays him as a total fuckwit. I read the books years ago and that isn't the sense I got of the character, he was more of a chancer/fraud who had accidently stumbled on a secret of the universe he didn't understand himself but played it for all it was worth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article, from the socialist magazine Jacobin, tells how Victorian values, far from been cast off or transcended, have merely mutated into new manifestations designed to bolster class superiority with feelings of moral superiority. Fitness, organic food, child rearing have all become area in which the middle classes can demonstrate their moral superiority to both the decadent one per cent and the feckless poor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on reddit a long time and it's only in the last two years I've notice a very right wing sentiment on reddit Ireland. Any post about refugees or travellers and the comment section is just filled with hatred. It's fucking disturbing. It's picking on the weakest in society, the powerless. Posts about the powerful who are ripping off regular people (Nama, Bankers etc) don't get near as much vitriol. I hope it's such a small minority (like they say about football hooligans) but I'm afraid if this the direction the Irish people's mentality is going in general.  I hope not, I don't know, this sub isn't the way I remember it as a fairly liberal, easy going place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't really an indepth article, but I think it covered a very interesting subject - education. We've all been through different school systems and many of us, at least I did, had an unhappy time. I think a rethink of education, it's methods and it's goal, is badly needed to nurture well balanced, psychologically health and well balanced people. Finland are the one country with the courage to try a totally different approach and they consistently top the ratings of best education leagues. I would like to hear what Trueredditors think about how education could be improved to benefit children and society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, yeah. I don't normally insult people but I was a bit drunk and it's been a tough week. But why is it the liberals are always the ones who have to be nice and the right have a license to be mean and nasty?  It seems like a double standard to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's an interesting idea, possibly more appealing to unionists than a united Ireland run from Dublin. Would give each region more powers so would appeal to Southerners as well possibly. But do we have regional governments plus a national government. The division of powers would be the biggest issue I think, what is regional and what is national policy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend got a motor bike when I was young and at first I was terrified riding on the back of it. I was too proud to admit it though and kept getting on. One time I got on and mentally shrugged my shoulders and thought 'if I die, I die'. I lost my fear and enjoyed the ride. I guess it was accepting it wasn't in my hands and surrendering control of my fate gave me peace and allowed me to live in the moment.  </TEXT>
