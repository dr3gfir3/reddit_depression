	<TEXT> Hey so I'll be using colorful sharpies to start out with and then  yes, using awesome filters when I book/cover reveal. Might experiment around with putting the quotes in different places, ie, on grass, on flower beds, on an antique chair, etc. (I just  put up the first quote) - If you wanna take a look and tell me if it looks terrible, I'd love your genuine opinion. I'm terrible at Insta so feedback is great! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Feedback: Would you find an instagram account that just features quotes from books with a book reveal at the end of the week interesting?? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey Guys!! 
Asking for your actual opinions. I love reading and blogging. If you're like me and a total snob who judges books by the cover--I have an idea.  I started an instagram account where I'll be posting quotes through out the week from one book and then do a book reveal on Fridays. The idea is the cover may be ugly, but the writing may be good. 
 
As really big book fans here, I want to know your opinion. Would this actually be interesting or is this just really stupid? Don't be shy, tell me how you really feel!  If you're confused the Instagram account I'm experimentally trying this out with is @firesidecoffeebooks. This is NOT a promotion. Please do not follow if you don't want to. Genuinely just looking for feedback.

Thanks! </TEXT>

BU Masters student here. The cap and gown at BU for masters is pretty expensive ($103-$113). Does anyone who has graduated recommend another option of how to get a cap and gown that isn't as expensive? Suggestions appreciated. Thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a 25 female minority in the United States, yes I cried when the election results came out. A man who is constantly threatening people like my Muslim roommate who is the sweetest person I have ever know is now president-elect.

I moped, I cried. I felt anger and fear for my future when I woke up this morning realizing my political nightmare was reality.

No more. I'm done moping. I'm going to fight. I'm going to fight as a highly educated woman finishing her Masters' degree at a top school. I'm going to put aside my anger at uneducated America. I'm going to put aside my apathy towards studying hard that has been slowly growing this past year. I'm going to study damn hard because I need to be there for my fellow americans. Because knowledge is power and that is what I can contribute to the fight.

	<TEXT> When I was small I had a baby blanket. Now, my mother was a smart woman and prepared for rips and bought two extra blankets of the exact same kind. Eventually when the second one really broke down at 16, my mom thought I'd finally move on to real comforter sets...well yes I did but I sure as hell made her give me that third baby blankie. At 25 years old, I still sleep with it every night and have no regrets  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Starting my first big girl job and the anxiety is overwhelming </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-02 07:08:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me back up a little. A couple months back I got hired at fast paced start up. I'm a grad student, but for some reason they still hired me when everyone else on  the team had been graduated at a PhD level for quite some time. I was fired on the third day as I wasn't meeting training expectations on my first try. Okay, fluke. Everyone tells me it's a fluke and no normal jobs expects you to know the ins and outs of a job before training. 

I've now been hired by the company of my dreams and I am SOSO anxious I'm going to be fired at the drop of a hat for any small mistake I make during training. My last experience makes me feel like I have to be 110% perfection or I will get fired. I can't stand the fact that I have to go through the learning process and that they could find me not "up to expectations. I'm so scared. I can't sleep. I can't eat...

To make matters worse, I'm just getting over an asthma episode from last week and my new co workers and boss saw how much of a toll work was taking on me my first day. They sent me home eith instructions to rest and come back in two days when I feel better so I don't relapse. I'M SO MORTIFIED. I can't believe I was sent home on my first day. The anxiety of not performing up to perfect expectations is eating me up!! AHH </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Finally, something I can respond to! 4 years ago I believed there was a ghost in the corner of my room. My lights would flicker...But my parents said it was a loose wire. Ok, I can get behind that. Then one day I'm specially nervous and this corner is just giving me the heebie jeebies. I go in to tell my mom exactly what's up and in the middle of me talking about it, every picture of me hung up in the house came crashing down...at the same time. We went downstairs to broken glass everywhere. 

My mom chalked it up to chance on the first one falling that caused vibrations and made the rest fall. Though if that was the case why didn't the rest of the family pictures fall? Needless to say, we never decided to talk about said creepy corner and entity again. No problems since but said corner still creeps the living shit out of me (probably more so now.)  </TEXT>

People who live in poverty but became  cocaine transporters to earn a decent living. some of these people got 25 years in prison. This pedophile guy wanted by interpol...got 6ish years? Did I get that right? An international child abuser got almost 3x less  jail-time??

It just hurts so much to know that Op breaking her 7 year relationship off with the man she loves is EXACTLY what Sara wants so OP can suffer along side her. 

I feel the need to say this because even if it doesn't work out, it might give you some closure and understand what was happening: couples therapy.

  You guys should  go. Breaking off a 7 year relationship isn't something you can just do cold turkey. Sincerely wishing the best for you OP </TEXT>
