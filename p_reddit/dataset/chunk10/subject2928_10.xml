	<TEXT> daily caller is twisting this, but that's not surprising as this story originated from some unreliable far right bloggers not based in London. This has already been disproven as what the ban was about.

Daily caller and others didn't tell you this bit of the TFL announcement. It doesn't include all pictures of women in swimwear or lingerie. 

TfLs new advertising policy, which does not include all images of people in their underwear or swimming gear, is only expected to affect a handful of the 12,000 adverts a year which run across the network, including at bus shelters and on-street sites. [link](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/sadiq-khan-there-will-be-no-more-body-shaming-adverts-on-the-tube-a3269951.html)

So he didn't ban 'sexy pictures' and as someone living in London I can confirm you can still see posters with good looking women and men not wearing much. If you read up on what was banned you'd find out it was a ban on ads which focus on weight loss products which use shaming language to promote their product or use images (like the one with the skinny bikini model) which might make young people feel ashamed at their body shape. This can still be hotly debated but the claim this was ridding London of pictures of women in swimwear etc is untrue.

	<TEXT> From people I know (I'm usually a labour voter), what I mostly hear is 'I don't agree with the Tories all the time but so and so conservative MP is good for my local area'. For others they just say all the anti-labour stuff from the press like 'he's loopy and friends with the IRA' etc. A few might mention issues with immigration like 'I heard this immigrant did x bad thing it's gotten out of hand'. 

From what I can see they are just living that daily mail image of a middle-class family and conservative 'strong and stable/hard working families' brand matches what they aspire to be. We might mock that slogan but it's working. I try to point out how cuts to schools and hospitals etc will make their working family life harder, but it gets ignored or they have a pang of guilt but I know they'll still vote tory anyway. One tried to argue private health system like the US is what we need (and then moaned about how much they pay for pet insurance with no irony). It feels like brexit all over again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to a show once for a hen-do where the group was x amount of dancers who don't fully strip and guys who cannot dance but have other big talents. In this show one dancer twists his ankle and is sent to hospital. I think he must have been the big finale since the rest of the show was dancing/teasing and no full frontal nudity. When the show ended the crowd was angry. Lots of women screaming about wanting to see cock (they paid I think 30 to do so). Never seen crowd turn so angry so quickly. They club also had bouncers on the mens doors to stop women sneaking back there too.  

I think when some of us women enter a space where slut shaming won't be an issue and there's a ton of cheap drinks, it all comes out into crazy (though wouldn't be surprised female strippers have similar issues with stag dos). It's pretty awful behavior but I think its what male and female strippers deal with a lot. </TEXT>

You're more likely in the US for one of the main parties to shift from centre to far side than people to vote for a different party. Even in the UK the conservatives don't have much competition on the right.

For many Marcon is little too much like centre right than anything left (which is why the fake email saying he works for anti-fa is hilarious because they hate him). So didn't want to choose.

	<TEXT> When I first dated my boyfriend we would often walk home late at night. Late one night/morning it was absolutely freezing and there was already frost everywhere. Then coming up behind us there's this guy in a grey suit sprinting in a mad panic. After he ran past us I looked round to see if anyone was chasing him since it was like he was running for his life. Yet there was no one else. It looked odd and creepy, but we didn't think much of it afterwards, maybe there was a family emergency when he was out clubbing etc. Few years later find out some guy in that area had raped and murdered a girl in the house he was staying in after coming home from a night out. He got caught the next day by police when trying to lie about coming home later to find the body. DNA evidence and him being covered in scratches gave him away. The date this happened was also in winter when I started to date my partner and it happened when I lived near that street. I wonder if he was the running man panicking after the murder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If she says I want the baby but he does not. You'd have to set up a system which might force women to go through a forced abortion. Forcing medical treatment like this against someone's will is difficult and would be horribly unethical. Odds are women knowing this will happen would go on the run or barricade themselves into their homes. 

If women want to end a pregnancy but he does not how would you stop them for sure? Lock them up or follow them around 24/7. If she ends up having a miscarriage would this mean a lengthy investigation to see if she caused it another way. Would people have to go through such psychical and emotional trauma.  

Child support argument is difficult. Would anyone prefer it if the state covered the full childcare costs? As this would be an possible alternative than leaving a child with the risk of poverty. Would this count for someone walking out during early pregnancy or years after raising the child and changing their mind on parenting? What's the risk of someone lying to get out of paying child support (when they were a supporting father for many years) if there's a messy divorce.  </TEXT>

In another post, said to be in response to a newspaper story about an immigrant called Arnold Sube, he allegedly wrote: "Please will someone smoke this ghastly insult to this country, why should I pay tax to feed these monkeys?"

	<TEXT> Government is focusing more on providing money towards building more private rentals which will benefit investors. So good luck looking to buy these new homes for yourself. 

The government first stated its intention to back the private rental sector in its housing white paper. The growth of managed rental housing provides an alternative to part-time landlords, an industry that has faced considerable regulation due to the problems landlords have been creating for renters and the property market more widely.

In addition, the government has pledged to diversify the tenures available on the UK housing market, arguing there are not enough housing options for those who do not want, or cannot afford, to buy a house outright.

For institutional investors, the private rental sector provides dependable returns over a long period.

Kylo Ren was trained to fight by a hologram but never had a jedi sparring partner. He has techniques but no one who really challenged him when it comes to a 1-1 fight. He mostly just used his powers to kill unarmed civilians or obedient guards. 

Finn is a solider trained to kill. He has more odds of being in real combat and can hold up a little bit against someone with training but no real combat experience.  </TEXT>
