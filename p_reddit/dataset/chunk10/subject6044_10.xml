	<TEXT> I've ducked out of this and no longer really debate these things but I should owe you a courtesy of a response as you weren't involved in my reasons for backing off and have taken time to articulate clearly and reasonably.

I agree with you IF you care about evidence and proof. In that case you are 100% correct.

But religion and faith don't actually work like that. It's not what it's about. If, say, you have a car in your back yard for sale say, then if I want to buy it I want to see it. Not for 'proof' - I don't care about that - I just want to see:

a) it exists and you're not trying to rip me off
b) that it's something I want to buy.

Other than that I don't care. Claim what you like. 

Extending this to unicorns (as atheists seem to like them a lot and I do too) I'd say this - if you tell me you have a unicorn in the back yard then I am interested in several things:

a) are you a raving lunatic? I don't think the claim that you have a unicorn in the back yard *equates* to insanity (though most atheists seem to think this) so I rule that out first

b) if you're not crazy then I know something else: that unicorns don't exist as a physical creature - again, atheists seem to think that a belief in unicorns actually means a belief in a flesh and blood creature. They may think that (irrationally) but I don't.

Therefore I know, if we rule out insanity, that we are dealing with some sort of waking dream or hallucination. I find that interesting and find unicorns interesting in that context.

I find it quite incredible that most atheists (not you necessarily) seem to be so uninterested in the mythic, the dream world, visions etc, that they deny them to the point of believing that if someone claims to see a flying horse (say) then it means that the person MUST be claiming that flying horses exist as a living creature. 

It would be a failure of imagination, a lack of familiarity with psychological literature and a signifier of a highly irrational mind if atheists really were this literal. Unfortunately I think it's worse than that... I think they know all about dream states and hallucinations but are merely trying to score cheap points by suggesting percipients are stupid.

	<TEXT> Just because someone gets pissed off means nothing. It's not the benchmark.

I get pissed off every single day with some shitbird here in BCN but it doesn't mean anything in terms of any sort of benchmark.

And another thing, probably the torches and pitchforks will come out of the shed for this one but someone has to say it: time we gave up this 'you need to integrate' BS. Wtf?

I am me and I will be me wherever I go. And I can go where I want and where is possible. If I get there and some dick is telling me to bend to his idea of how things should be or how he's set them up when it's not my way - well, that'll be one of the shitbirds I mentioned above.

We're all humans. We express ourselves how we want. 'You must integrate' really translates as 'I don't like your culture (or you) so change and do things our way'.

Bollocks to that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some questions in a purely rhetorical sense. Downvote at will.

1) Can one lampoon ISIS/DAESH? Is it allowed?

2) If not why? If so then does it matter who does the lampooning? Are only certain people allowed to do it?

3) If the lampooning IS permitted (who has this power of veto btw - bonus question) then how can one signify a member of DAESH if not by the clothes they wear?

4) If DAESH wear what the OP calls "Islamic Wear" then does this excuse them from being criticized?

5) If so then if I wear - say - trousers, then does it mean I automatically am linked to all other people who wear trousers? If someone were to lampoon someone (not me) who wore trousers would I have a legal case for a suit? Pun intended.

6) "It also pairs our beautiful religion with bombs and guns." In this case would it not be better to start a campaign to deny that DAESH use bombs and guns? That could work too.

7) "This is an act of terrorism against Muslim women" 

8) LESS THAN 4,000 SIGNATURES SO FAR - will I exceed this in downvotes?

	<TEXT> Not entirely sure what the OP is about or trying to say but fwiw:

"Doors of Perception" is a quote from William Blake and an obvious reference to that. Presumably Huxley wanted to build around Blake's original idea. 

"God is not Great" is a similar case in reverse where Hitchens is trying to be amusing/clever as well as signal to his demographic in a reference to the Islamic statement of belief "God is great".

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Time has come to buy a new laptop. I will be mobile a lot next year and have been on an iMac for last 5 years so out of the loop re Apple's laptops. 

Been looking at new MBPs obviously but heard some worrying things and then there's the price. What I need/want is this:

1) Primarily will be used for web dev and coding - BBedit/Transmit basically and running Apache on localhost.

2) A lot of writing - Scrivener and other low-intensity programs

3) needs to be 12/13"

4) ideally the screen should be far less glossy than MBPs were 5 years back as that was a real deal breaker and would always have gone for matte back then. 

5) interested in future-proofing as I'd like not to buy again for 3-4 years if poss. 

So - is it overkill? Could I get away with the latest Airs or 12" MBs?

	<TEXT> Was kind of cool for the first chapters the voice of the unreliable narrator was a tad unbelievable. Spoiler alert: massive plot-hole where the 'God' character disappears in a huff in the first half, comes back all chilled (with no explanation) in the second and then at the end is back in kick-ass mode. Not very well thought out and the characterisation is very one dimensional. 

Definitely went over the top in the last chapter. Every Hollywood action-film cliche thrown in and I just didn't care about the characters. 

Overall it's not bad for a first draft but it unfortunately needs a better editor. 2 Stars.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I saw that. It's still a conundrum though because although for sure King did not sign those ones, the ones I've been offered are from the publisher and are a Limited Edition of 150 copies - kind of deluxe version.

It's vaguely possible these are SK signed I suppose, I'm trying to get more info. One thing's for sure - they are not the same copies as these at the event as they are direct from the publisher in a special version. 

In some way, in this case, it makes me think it COULD be King? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't talk to me like I'm some tool of Western propaganda when if you read my comment history you'd see how wrong you positively are.

I am talking to you on the basis of what I read here. It's enough.

Meanwhile you're a complete tool of Russian and Assadist propaganda. 

Nope. If anything I am a complete tool of the facts. All I am saying is that the rebels are as bad as Asad and in many worse. You think that's disgusting but that says a lot more about you than it does about me. 

ISIS has absolutely nothing on the violence Assad has committed...

And there we have it....

Asad will be long dead and gone and Iran a smoking heap of rubble for years while you're still justifying Daesh. You'll just move on to "ISIS has absolutely nothing on the violence Iranian dictators meet out to their own people".

	<TEXT> How you can give the rebels a free pass because of your hatred of Asad - itself based largely on a natural reaction to what the media tells you but unfortunately *only* what the media tells you - is, well.... I won't say disgusting. 

Disgusting is a loaded and emotional word. Facts are something else.

Several buses en route to evacuate ill and injured people from the besieged Syrian villages of al-Foua and Kefraya have been attacked and burned, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and Syrian state media say.

Some buses, as well as Red Crescent vehicles, reached the entrance to the villages in Idlib province, which are besieged by insurgents.

The coalition of forces fighting for the Government of President Bashar al-Assad are demanding people to be allowed to leave the two villages in exchange for allowing evacuations of rebels and civilians from eastern Aleppo.

http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-18/aleppo-evacuation-resumes-buses-burned-pro-regime-villages/8130818

A report by the leading human rights organization details how extremist rebel groups have taken over large parts of major Syrian cities, in which they have created repressive theocratic regimes where critics are violently silenced and where religious and ethnic minority groups fear for their lives.....Amnesty documented abuses committed by five armed groups that have controlled parts of Aleppo and Idlib since 2012. These rebels have been supported by Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Qatar and the U.S.

Rebel groups have established courts (the report uses the term in scare quotes) in Aleppo and Idlib based on strict interpretations of Sharia (Islamic law).

Extremist Islamist groups such as Jabhat al-Nusra and Ahrar al-Sham have harshly punished Syrians who disobey their theocratic laws, the report notes.

I heard and read about the government security forces torture techniques. I thought I would be safe from that now that I am living in an opposition-held area. I was wrong. I was subjected to the same torture techniques but at the hands of Jabhat al-Nusra, explained a Syrian man who was abducted by the extremist rebel group.

http://www.salon.com/2016/07/11/u_s_backed_syrian_rebels_committing_war_crimes_torture_abductions_imposing_harsh_sharia_law_report/

ABDUCTIONS, TORTURE AND SUMMARY KILLINGS UNDER ARMED GROUP RULE IN ALEPPO AND IDLEB, SYRIA

https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde24/4227/2016/en/

Maybe you think - on what basis? - that "equate Bashar Al Assad to anyone else in Syria is absolutely disgusting" and therefore don't hold these reports above to be of any worth but the people are still people being tortured and killed. 

Maybe the fact Western Governments are lying about it, covering it up and pushing the line that only Asad is 'evil' but there are people who find that even more disgusting. 

I'm one of them. To me a killer is a killer. But someone enabling and protecting one killer while pointing to another killer as the only source of evil is far, far worse. And far more dangerous. 

Who would do that? What sort of sick person?

Answer: your media and government.

	<TEXT> I suppose it could be something to do with an uncritical acceptance of Western Media memes without any analytical reflection. 

Or it could be the uninformed black/white reductionist thinking that dictates that if Asad is an 'evildoer' then not only must be be the WORST baddie but those opposing him can't possibly be as bad or worse but since they are we just need to sweep that under the rug and not look at it.

Or it could even be that this card has been played so many times - Saddam in Iraq being the template - that any rational objective person must really see it is a card being played. In fact Syria is in the chaos it is *just because* that card was played. 

But for me, it is all of these and more... I'd add some hadith too in the mix if you're pinning labels on Asad. I've got some doozies too:

There will come a time for my people when there will remain nothing of the Qur'an except its outward form and nothing of Islam except its name and they will call themselves by this name even though they are the people furthest from it.

There will come a time upon the Ummat when people will recite the Qur'an, but it will not go further than their throats, (into their hearts).

In my defence all I can say is that posting about these misguided individuals who insist on giving free stuff to the homeless and elderly (!!!!! Wtf eh?) does **NOT** necessarily mean I condone this psychopathic disgrace which is clearly a brawling obscenity and should be condemned by all right-thinking people. 

I hope I can be forgiven in the fullness of time - I only wish I could be downvoted more. I have no idea whatever can have possessed me. I am thinking perhaps Djinn.

She's right about no journos on the ground.

She's right about the sources for the media info. And this is provable btw. If you see an incident happen then you can Google it and pretty much every source will use the same words. I did this the other day with the massacre of 82 people reported. 

Every result - ie all UK papers, most US - used the same words "Shot where they stood". That's not coincidence and it's not independent. 

The Asad election thing is a stretch I grant you but if you think this is not a prelude to regime change and that the West (and Israel and Saudi) is not pushing for that with this then I don't know what to say.  </TEXT>

I think (know) there are quite a few people who harbour doubts of this nature but would never voice them as the Guilter camp is possibly the most inanely moronic and toxic demographic out there and no sane rational person would ever ally themselves with it regardless of their beliefs. 

It's kind of like you might agree the trains don't run on time but you're never going to join with Mussolini in calling for a fix for it.

	<TEXT> True, it could also be indicative of other things. Vote fraud for example.

	<TEXT> So the main question Im trying to ask is how is Religion and science to seperate things that cannot mix. It's just a sincere question. Am I misunderstanding you?

I don't know if you are. 

Can you prove God exists? No. Why? Because He does not want that... you can prove many other things but humans will never be able to *prove* this. 

Do you not think that if He wanted God could not have made proof possible in creation? 

He didn't. Atheists are right when they say that this can't be proved. They are wrong when they say that *everything* must be able to be proved... that's the point really. 

Belief or acceptance of God is not built on a world-view based on proof. Science has to be. You can be a scientist and a believer but you need to know where one stops and the other starts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's real science it's not scary but there's a lot of Scientism these days. I avoid it like the plague. 

Religion and Science are two separate things that don't mix imo - and don't need to. If one side (religion or science) tries to co-opt the other there's a problem. 

Religion used to try to co-opt science and subsume it under one overarching umbrella. We fixed that. Now science is trying to do the same with religion.... we need to fix that too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True... it's a mystery. I think someone should do a study of the more anomalous hadith actually - there are some real classics esoterically speaking but they get swept under the rug and downplayed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a difficult one. I guess you know the hadith I mean right? I can't find it to quote it. Be tempted to say something Sufic/Mystical but I don't think there was such an animus against that at that early stage. 

Perhaps it is related to of the end-time prophecies which show the Umma in a very degraded state at that point?
