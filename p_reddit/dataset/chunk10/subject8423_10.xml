	<TEXT> If it's a serious relationship, and since this is your first Mother's Day together, you need to get her something very nice and thoughtful.  Probably something nicer than what you got for your mother.  Hopefully you have an idea of what she wants/needs.  For instance, my wife loves the movies and has been complaining all her shoes are old.  I got her a couple new pairs of sandals and flats and a gift card for the movie theater.

You should also plan to spend the day with your SO (provided it's a serious relationship) and maybe have dinner/lunch with your mother with your SO and her children.  You might feel like your in the matrix dodging bullets on this one, good luck buddy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The civil war.  While slavery was definitely a huge part of the civil war, tariffs, trade policies, and a slew of domestic policies were enacted that hurt the south.  When Lincoln, a very pro-northern politician, won the presidency in a split that looked an awful like the Mason-Dixon Line, and then proceeded to trick the south into giving up a lot of states rights to keep Slavery legal and then abolish slavery, you understand that the North and South had been at odds for a while and the North won.  Even as far back as the founding of this country, Virginia, Georgia, and the Carolinas were always more at odds with the other colonies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the most part, the social construct of gender is mainly decided by biological sex.  Other behaviors asp contribute to our gendered social norms.  Sometimes people can enjoy or feel more comfortable in a gender role that is opposite of their biological sex, which isn't too odd.  However, when someone feels they have the wrong biological sex is when you COULD call it body dysmorphia. 

Problems arise because psychology is a soft science, meaning empirical data is hard or impossible to come by.  For instance, I remember a study done of two twins, separated at birth, who both developed OCD that centered around cleaning their houses.  They developed this independently without ever meeting but it gets interesting when one claimed they developed it from growing up in a hoarder house and the other said their adoptive parents passed on their strict cleanliness to him.  This situation is like a psychologists wet dream, but even this example is not empirically sound as there are still variables that you can't control.

So how do we decide when someone identifies with a gender that is opposite from their expected sex or when someone mentally feels they are the wrong sex?  We have no idea what to look for physically and we can't rely on people to self-diagnose.  There answer is who the fuck knows.  If you come up with one you could make a lot of money. </TEXT>

For instance, a fight between Dr. Doom and Strange would likely end in a stale-mate but Strange has a much altruistic and stable mind than Doom.  

Of course we all know DOOM simply lost the fight as part of his intricate mechanizations because DOOM would never lose to Strange if being sorcerer supreme were the goal of DOOM. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Childbirth and childcare.  Italy, as an EU country, doesn't have to factor in childcare, birth, etc for women alone as healthcare, parenting styles, and other progressive social and economical factors take gender out of the equation for the most part.  The US and Korea plug their ears when they hear paternity leave and the US starts screaming "LA LA LA" when you bring up universal healthcare.  From a business standpoint, you want someone who will not take time off to be pregnant and give birth, which you have to, by law, provide maternity leave.  And then there's the very real statistic of women not rejoining the workforce after having children so now all the training you gave that person is gone too.  

Want to get the wage gap down to EU levels?  Give men more paternal rights and cultural freedom.  Simple as that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree being sweaty, hairy, and stinky is not quite as bad as hemorrhage Week, you're missing the best parts.  It's not that we are hairy, or that we are sweat, or that we are stinky.  The trifecta of being hairy, sweaty, AND stinky is the perfect mix for the perfect sauce.  First the hair gets growing, insulating our most moist areas for some godawful reason.  This same hair will grow in thick and course enough to cause rashes between the leg and sack and underarms unless groomed.  But then the sweat starts coming in.  Know the feeling of pulling your bra off at the end of the day?  The feeling of cool air against bare skin that has been insulated and contained all day?  We don't get that, our pits, balls, and ass (hairy man ass is a male secret, keep it on the DL) stay stuffed into our course, home-made sweaters no matter where or when.  Once that sweat sits in that hair all day, really rubbing the skin raw, the smell sets end.  There's nothing like the smell of swamp ass and sweaty balls pooling in the taint hair and basting for several hours to get the strew brewing.  Gonna hike a leg up, crane an arm over and adjust yourself?  The smell coming from your armpit is enough to make YOURSELF gag. 

So now your hobbling around, insides of your groin chaffed pink making it hurt to walk, and arms moving like a T-Rex so no one drone strikes you for suspected chemical attacks.  Even when you cool off, the smell doesn't go awake, only gets worse.  What smells worse than fresh taint juice?  Stale taint juice.

Emotionally, it was something beautiful, physically it was disgusting and no one should think different.  The advice I gave to my friend who was nervous about his wife having their first child was, "if you've field dressed a deer it's less gross than that so don't worry about feinting.  Your wife will likely poop herself too but don't tell her if she does." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has gone back and forth but most agree it's a tie between getting hit in the nuts and giving birth for many reasons explained in the link below.  Not surprising when you consider its the same parts of the body hurting.  The key difference is one lasts for 8ish hours, barring complications, and the other can happen my surprise and repeatedly.  Personally, I wouldn't want to get kicked in the nuts every few minutes for 8 hours and I imagine most women wouldn't want to suddenly and unexpectedly give birth several times throughout the week.

	<TEXT> The Star Wars Universe has something ours doesn't: the force.  We, in our galaxy, lose our balance or stumble for many reasons.  For Star Wars, everyone, everything, and every action flows through and is influenced by the force (and the force influenced by it.). It has been this way since the dawn of time, primitive Thok is an asshole, steals food, hurts people, and is generally a dick.  Thok gets into an accident be he was unbalancing the force and the force rebounded strong enough to cause our poor primitive's death.  This has been the rule of the galaxy since before wheels were invented.  It's not a stretch to assume that this universal karma is noticed and influences society.  If you stand behind railings, put shielding over exposed power sources, or grate exhaust vents then it looks like you're preparing for the universe(the force) to rebound at you.  You're saying you do bad things.  And that assumption wouldn't be wrong in the Star Wars universe because the force does seek balance.  Do you think it was a coincidence that the Death Star was blown up shortly after destroying a planet?  Maybe if it were destroyed once, but it was destroyed twice, by powerful force users both times, no less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, I do have a job and children.  It's easy to go on Reddit and up vote a few posts I agree with while taking a twosie but it's another thing entirely to devote a good portion of my attention to /r/place since just hopping on and placing one pixel is pointless and the only way to make anything meaningful is to watch the timer all day.  I don't frequent /r/t_d at all, just upvote or comment whenever it's relevant to me, but I'll probably get downvoted because no one will read this far; which is the point, because /r/t_d has made enemies of everyone so everyone will be against them in /r/place.  They're finally the Nazis they always wanted to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Allegedly they only do that to up and comers, people rising in the ranks.  Say someone did a good job on Trumps campaign trail, does a lot of speaking and fundraising, then wins a state senate seat in 2018.  They go out with their fellow GOP members to celebrate, celebrate too hard, then one of their "friends" has the sit down chat the next morning with the pictures because he was tapped years ago.  Then you do business as usual but then you take $1,000 to vote for something a certain way.  If you don't, you get exposed.  Now you filibuster this or speak out against this person.  Maybe in a year you help another rising star celebrate and take pictures.

You toe the line between too afraid to speak out and benefitting too much from the arrangement.  As you do more fucked up stuff, your threshold for being too afraid and the amount you benefit go up.  Then you're secretary of interior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The eye of Sauron is able to look over vast differences and the rings of power the 9 ringwraiths wear connect them with Sauron spiritually and mentally.  So Frodo puts on the ring and Sauron tells the wraiths "he's on your 7," and it goes from there.

As for how them knowing where to look, you can chalk that up to good old detective work.  Sauron had more than the ringwraiths in and around the shire looking for the ring.  It wouldn't take long to get pointed toward Bilbo who is famous for being rich and going on magical adventures.  Crows would spot them walking through the fields and report back to dark men who report back to the ringwraiths.  The whole of the shire turned into a noose that Sauron was slowly tightening for Frodo, not even Aragorn would take the roads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright there's a lot of questions here.  As far as hard numbers go, we only know the speed of sound and the speed of light.  As far as physics are concerned in the DCverse, there is also a speed you can go to break the time barrier and the dimension barrier, which we do not have numbers for as we humans are unable to conceptualize outside of our 3 dimensional existence. (Brief note, dimensions as planes of reality and dimensions as alternate realities are two distinct things with the same name.). As far as who can go what speed, we also don't have hard numbers for this either.  The best we can do for speed is to make tiers.    Wonder Woman is fast, she is blessed by the messenger God, but she is not as fast as superman.  Superman is fast, he can go fast enough to move through time.  Superman is not as fast as the flash.  The flash is where the buck stops.  The flash is the avatar of the Speed Force which is a parallel dimension full of nothing but momentum.  Flash is able to splice himself into our dimension and this parallel dimension and exist in both at the same time to give himself his unmatched speed.  This is a balancing act and a damn good way to explain his inconsistent speed.  The more Flash goes into the speed force and the less in our dimension, the faster he is able to go.  If Flash goes too far into the speed force, he can't leave.  So Flash can push himself to outrun death one month, when his mind his clear and his body healthy, and then barely match Supes after finding his wife in bed with Reverse Flash and coming off of a bout of food poisoning.  Flash's greatest fear is losing himself in the speed force. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Arthur Dent just can't catch a break.

Round 1: Arthur stumbles and mumbles protests but the children are left at his door.  Arthur, for all intents and purposes, is a perfectly normal man, if a bit dull and boring.  

Round 2: Getting the orphans from Dent is like taking candy from a baby.  The only wrench I can see for Olaf is if Arthur calls in his best friend Ford Prefect to help which is, admittedly, fairly likely.  Dent would take a background role to Ford and Olaf antics.  If it comes down to it, Ford is a space hobo with absurd technology and the twins are his ticket to having enough money to get off earth, I just don't see Olaf outsmarting the clever Ford Prefect and would eventually get turned into a toaster or something.

Round 3: as the events of The Guide play out, the children would escape the fate of earth and end up on the Vogon ship.  Provided they survive to make it on the Heart Of Gold, Trillion would adopt the orphans (since Ford and Arthur really have no interest in raising children) thus negating the last two books of the series.  The children, as clever as they are, fair well in the Hitchiker's Guide world with Trillian as their mother. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maiar don't die in the sense that you're thinking of.  They can have their physical bodies destroyed in a myriad of ways but, for a Maiar and Ainur, the physical body is something they make to interact with physically-based life.  Maiar are not physical being.  As far as "respawning" after dying, most Maiar are able to make their own bodies but can be given bodies by their patron Ainur, as was the case for the Istari, the five wizards.  But for making their own body, or making anything of significance, this permanently drains a Maiar and Ainur from a sort of spiritual well.  Once the well runs dry the Maiar because wholly incorporeal, as was the case for Sauron after the war of the ring.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Diet and exercise for me?  No.  I've always been able to balance my diet and count my calories in my head.  I'm solidly in the "overweight" category but several years of children will do that.  My wife doesn't.  And she started off very heavy and has gained weight and breast size from the pregnancies, which is totally understandable but it tipped her over the 300 mark and I just don't know what to do.  No conversations about seeing our grandkids graduate or wanting to take back up hiking when the children are older have worked (I hiked, she did not.). She's bought elliptical bikes and treadmills which we really couldn't afford for them to sit and collect dust.  The weight issue is tables until our children are older as any sort of serious life changes like that are nearly impossible with a 1 and 3 year old.  I hope she will agree to change something before a heart attack or a stroke happens.

And I admit I make excuses for her and myself.  It looks like I pig out because she'll see me eat a lot for dinner but I know I've had less than 1000 calories that day.  I'm not setting a good example.  And I assert myself as much as I should.  She's insisting on doing the shopping when I know she will buy sweets and frozen foods.  Convenience food.  During Christmas time she came home with three whole cakes because they were for sale.  I made her give one away as a gift but she wouldn't budge with the others.  She got them because I bought one before and she really likes it.  

Sorry for unloading on you like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's two sides for all stories.  For instance, my wife is a G cup and wants reduction and I out my foot down on us not spending the money for it because insurance won't cover it.  Insurance won't cover it because she is very obese and, just like the insurance company, I think getting breast reduction is both dangerous and unnecessary when she could instead choose to lose weight with diet an light exercising.  I've even told her we will pay for the reduction if they're still uncomfortably large when she's down to a healthy weight (though insurance would probably pay for it at that point).  It's been a sore point for two years and no diets have changed.  

I wouldn't get a divorce of she went ahead and did it.  Probably.  We're married and have children.  But if she were just a long-term girlfriend and she went ahead with it (and we shared expenses or something) then I could see that ending the relationship fast.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh hi OP, was just talking about you.  From what I've gathered from the, admiringly very limited, slice of your life, you seem to either:

A, lack confidence to assert yourself in your relationship until very recently.  This deviation from the norm and sudden shift after YEARS of letting your GF act like one of those NEET neckbeards (legbeards?) from 4chan, she feels attacked and abused.

B, have let yourself be manipulated and abused by a narcissist until you've let her coast through life on your dollar.  You're stopping her gravy train and she slashing out as a result.  She could seriously have convinced herself that you're abusing her or she's finding out the signs so she can lie about them. 

C, just like A but in this your an absolute dick, make her feel self conscious about working, and belittle her for not having a job or cleaning often.  This one is not likely.

In the first two scenarios you lack confidence to assert yourself (your goals, your wants, your needs, your expectations from your partner[you can have those], your ideal home environment, etc) but you seem to be doing better!  Unfortunately either you or your SO are not handling your sudden change in the relationship but I'd guess your SO is just floundering because her free ride is over. 


Or you're just a dick, who knows, we only have your side of the story and no one is the villain of their own story.  The facts you've presented don't make you a Disney villain unless you lock her in a tower or something, but we still only know half of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is my take: he's a tall guy, usually the tallest guy in the room and probably has been most of his life.  His family is likely tall, his friends know him as the tall friend, you get the picture.  I'm guessing being tall is one of the things he uses to define himself.  Being tall is, of course, a masculine trait which is also why he chooses to identify himself.  So when you make yourself taller, almost as tall as him, you are, in his mind, making yourself for masculine and therefore emasculating him. 

To draw a comparison, imagine your boyfriend had a beautiful flowing beard, his whole family has beautiful flowing beards, and people comment and compliment his beard all the time.  And then you grow a neat, trim beard every now and then.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well fuck.  My great grandparents on my father's side were part of an old rich German family.  They were not just Nazis but SS Nazis so my karma is screwed.  On the flip side, I could see my grandfather, who was exiled for marrying a gypsy woman, and my grandma, said gypsy woman, being able to teach me a lot of magic from their respective backgrounds.  I could see my grandma knowing divination and maybe some minor luck magic, she taught me how to read tarot cards in real life anyway.  My grandfather would be a bit of a wildcard, as old families tend to have specialization.  For fun, let's say he specialized in elemental magic to make them battle-magic themed.  Having bad karma would suck though.

My familiar, I would choose something logical and grounded.  I connect a lot with my German ancestry as I have it on both sides of my family, so I would look for something from Germanic religions though that might require a trip to a potentially hostile area of my Nazi family is still around, which they probably would be.  They probably wouldn't kill me on sight as I have my grandfather's blond hair and blue eyes but my goal would be to usurp those Nazi pieces of shit and use their knowledge and power for good.  I think it was Assault who said "who doesn't like fighting Nazis?"  My implement would be an eye carved from a holly tree that I carved myself, I'm good enough at wood working to make it.  The eye to pay homage to Woten and his own sacrifice for knowledge, a holly bush to draw parallels between myself and Baldr who's foolhardiness got him killed by a arrow made of holly, and the wood is natural and would help me get in the good graces of Frigg, who rules over nature.  I want to win the Germanic gods back over after my family perverted them.  

Edit: upon looking into it, I would summon forth and partner with my family's Fulgja/Dis, a Germanic Shapshifting/Valkyrie type creature that attaches to one family's fate. </TEXT>

The symbol of sexy SS Elsa stays in your head and the symbols around her, the swastika, SS logo, etc, become normalized in the mind.  Once the symbols become normalized to someone but other people still treat them like they represent the deaths of millions of people or something, it creates a disconnect from the reality of the symbols.  This is when radicalization can take root.

The Nazi's swastika is distinct enough, or as distinct as a simple symbol like the swastika can be, to differ from its use in Hindu culture and religion.

If the Alt-right turned Pepe orange for all its memes or white supremacist universally portrayed Elsa with a  buzz cut and bright red make up, I'd say those were hate symbols as well.  All three symbols require significant perversion before they can be classified separately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll agree that Pepe is used more on Pol than Elsa on Stormfront, but Pepe used on Pol specifically for white supremacy is on par with Elsa on places like Stormfront.  Not all instances of Pepe used on Pol are for white supremacy, Pol is a diverse international board despite its alt-right majority, but all instances of Elsa used by Stormfront and KKK groups are for white supremacy.  What's more, I've seen images of Elsa in Nazi/white supremacy attire in real life(family is fun /s)as opposed to Pepe being limited to the Internet.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really.  White supremacists use it, yes, but they also dress Elsa from Frozen up in SS uniforms a fuck ton, with her blonde hair and pale skin.  Pepe the frog is as much a hate symbol has Elsa.  The difference is Pepe doesn't have the world's scariest lawyers willing to challenge that ruling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Less of a bad aftertaste, less hit burn and more cool burn.  If you've ever used shitty toothpaste for kids, imagine the shot toothpaste is Smirnoff, the fancy Colgate is Absolute.  No weird residue in the mouth, no weird flavors, etc.  take all the bad stuff about vodka and make it less pronounced.   </TEXT>
