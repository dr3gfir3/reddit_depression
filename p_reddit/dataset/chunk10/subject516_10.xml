	<TEXT> As a developer, I know these types of comments. They're snide remarks about how a developer "probably doesn't understand [a difficult subject]" and that they only really know "trivial stuff." There's no way around it; that's an insult. These insults have been seen throughout the years: C++ devs looking down on web developers, full stack engineers dismissing app devs, systems engineers scoffing at the "simplicity" of consumer-level applications, etc. It's unnecessary, negative, and diminishes the work that a developer is actively working on.

Further, insults are more than crude death threats or things that a 16 year old says on XBL. I would *love* to believe the /r/emulation community recognizes that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ....it's obvious if you understood how insurance works. Those who take on unnecessary risks (tanning beds) end up paying more for insurance. That's because they're most likely to need it. Similarly, people with more money pay into the system to help those with no money. That way, poor people can have a better shot at life while riskier people and those more well off help cover the costs. Welcome to the real world. </TEXT>

Realistically speaking, people here are venting more than anything. I can guarantee none of the people saying that *truly want people to die*. It's cathartic to say "you guys got us in this mess and it's just deserts that you're going to be affected most by it."

 I just don't want to die, but people in here want me to.

	<TEXT>  He was talking openly about meeting me in the Reswitched group, because he genuinely thought that it was absolutely fine.

No offense, but if it was implied that you would be hooking up when he sees you than that means he would be breaking the law. Not only that, but I personally have a hard time believing someone who's 22 doesn't know their age of consent. As someone in their 20's, I would feel very strange about flying to another country and meeting someone who is under the age of consent that has been drilled into my head since I was a child. It just sounds strange to hear that someone casually didn't know they'd be breaking the age of consent laws.

 So, please, tell me what is unhealthy in our relationship, since I lack one year for it to be legal in the UK ?

That, that right there. You might not like the law but that doesn't mean you should be able to break it because you are different. Extending your logic a bit, would you be fine with a 40 year old meeting a 14 year old in France? 

I'm not trying to tell you that you're wrong or that Dazzozo is some crazy pedophile, only that laws should be followed. Especially laws concerning older people having sex with minors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  if the choice is between making more NES Classic or Switch, they are going to go with the Switch

What world are you living in where there's only one assembly line? Nintendo mass produces many things such as cartridges, disks, switch, joycons, 2ds, 3ds, 3dsxl, the New versions, amiibos, 3ds face plates, pokemon merchandise, etc. Saying that them halting production on one low yield product to bolster Switch manufacturing doesnt make sense. It would be like saying they're not gonna make 8bit Mario Amiibos anymore to boost the amount of joycons being created. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  side effects of making your own build may include learning something new, getting more educated about things you are posting about on reddit, and potentially understanding that adding bad code harms the emulator in the long run

	<TEXT> You're asking a very general question so I'll try to give a concise answer. The answer is yes and no. Vulnerabilities are found in many parts of consoles (or computer systems in general) so it matters how well each of those parts are emulated. For example, theoretically, the Switch's Webkit exploit should work in a Switch emulator because the browser itself had the bug and the emulator should be able to emulate userland execution. On the other hand, there are other exploits such as the recent Broadcom exploit that can hack devices by hacking into the processor/OS *inside* the WiFi chip. This exploit most definitely wouldn't work in an Android emulator (like BlueStacks) because they don't fully emulate the Broadcom WiFi SoC hardware.

With all of that being said, look no further than the Wii U's vWii for proof that you can fully hack an emulated system. I believe you can even use Smash Stack on it to get HBL running :) </TEXT>
