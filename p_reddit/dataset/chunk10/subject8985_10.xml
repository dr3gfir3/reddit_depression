	<TEXT>  Who says that it doesn't bother many people?
 As for democracy, there hasn't been democracy in this system to begin with; the US is about the illusion of democracy only. Do you think a real democracy spies on its own citizens, lies to them about it, is caught, is ordered to stop, and then... doesn't?

Technically the answer to this is yes if that is what the people of the democracy voted for, well except for the lying.

So... while he later "clarified" that he was only cherrypicking a sentence, he did in fact originally make a different claim. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think invading Afghanistan was a mistake, but lets not pretend that the Taliban didn't do more than *that*! They harbored the prick, and refused to hand him over when pressed (frankly at gunpoint)... it was a mistake. The result has been terrible for everyone involved, and ironically it is precisely what people like bin Laden wanted and groups like Daesh want today.

They want a worldwide religious war, and they can't have that if we're all struggling to get along, only if we're at each other's throats.

Still... that hardly excuses the Taliban! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And if tens of thousands of other people are giving me an equal amount of cash, is the understanding that I owe something significant to tens of thousands of people who might want completely opposite things? 

That's generally the reasoning behind campaign contribution limits prior to Citizens United. Now of course, thousands of people can all contribute and be massively outspent by just... one guy. The Koch Bros. or Soros or just a large company/lobbying group is going to be able to offer a far more *memorable* deal than you or me. 

In the end, CU undermined precisely the natural controls you're pretending are still in place. The best thing you're ignoring by the way, is that *I don't need to bribe you in the first place*.

Because they want more money in the future, and because they're human, and when I give you a stinking amount of cash, you know that you owe me.

There is an industry that won't want their products associated with "you can't drive on them" status. This is going to be a fight. 

Meanwhile driving while drunk has been understood to be a downright evil act for decades.  </TEXT>
