	<TEXT> This is the type of innovative, natural problem solver we need to call in time of a global crisis. Using garlic, actual round garlic bread? Maybe I haven't been around this sub enough but I'm speechless.

p.s. hope you feel better  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What this guy says, I would recommend going to the uni library or even a public one in your area to do whatever work you need to do if you can't get rid of all the distractions at home. 

In terms of getting yourself organised, I can send you a weekly planner I used to map out how much free time throughout the week I had which helps put things into perspective how much time in a day you actually have (I was pretty shit at time management but still managed above avg grades working 25hrs a week with a full-time study load). 

Just start getting organised - use a calendar to map out all your exams, assignments etc. Once you have it all broken down and know what you need to do to make it through it makes it so much easier. Goodluck man you can do this. PM me if you ever need anything </TEXT>
