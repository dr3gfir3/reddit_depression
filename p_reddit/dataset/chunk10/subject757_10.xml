 Really? what does this even mean?

Shhh, it's "technical". The strategy is just to mumble hackers and say "you know, hacking", over and over.

	<TEXT>  Yes, all biased towards stopping protests/taking away peoples rights.

These things are already crimes.

 What is to stop people from running over protesters? No consequences will spark some asshole with anger issues and he will just start mowing people down.

The bill states "exercising due care". It also adds: "A person shall not be immune from civil liability if the actions leading to the 
injury were willful or wanton."

Based on those two qualifiers I wouldn't be so quick to roll the dice with a new hood ornament as tempting as it might seem.

 You seem like the type who isn't going to change your pro establishment opinions, and i'm not changing my anti-establishment opinion, so im going to agree to disagree

Ad hominem is how it ends when you're out of things to say. It's silly to say I'm "pro-establishment", but as a normal guy that pays his taxes and wants to keep his family safe, I would prefer it that people don't create dangerous and illegal situations. 

I'm in the DC area and I'm no stranger to the protests that come through every weekend. If your top concern is being prosecuted because you wanted to be violent or destroy property then you should stay home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "criticial infrastructure" could be anything so no protest allowd anywere the government wants

Sure, creative classification of space is an old game that's going to get played in a variety of legal circumstances. Do you think there should be any restrictions to where protests can occur? What if it endangers the protester's life or others?

 government paid protest breakers hit people with their car and get away with it

If you're protesting by blocking a public roadway, especially a highway or interstate then you're creating a danger for yourself and other people and should be promptly removed. People that hit a protestor in a roadway can't be held liable any more than they would for someone attempting suicide the same way.

 no more anonymity for protesters to make it easy to prosecute any participant

There shouldn't be any problem with prosecution when you're not breaking the law, just like when you're not protesting. 


 paid people make a peaceful protest to a riot and everybody goes to jail

I've been involved in a peaceful protest that has turned violent. I left. At some point you decide you're not going to be involved in a riot and stop rioting.

- Increase penalties for trespassing on criticial infrastructure including oil refineries and chemical manufacturing plants. 

- Civil immunity for the driver of an automobile who injures a protester who is blocking traffic in a public right-of-way if the driver was exercising due care. 

- Cracks down on people wearing masks or covering their faces at demonstrations.

- Increased protest penalties from class C felony to a class B felony if a riot involves 100 or more persons, doubling the maximum prison sentence to 10 years. 

Could someone point out the parts that restrict protesting please? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When we talk about global warming, or global cooling, or global climate change broadly, were not talking about science so much as political science,' wrote CFIF in a blog post. Science so far hasnt been able to say with certainty why the earths climate may be warming. Many of the computer models predicting, for example, a precipitous decline in Antarctic sea ice have been wrong.

I'm missing the part where they are "climate-denying". 

You don't have to deny climate change to not want to transfer the bulk of your wealth to a bunch of liberal retards that will blow it on [stupid scams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solyndra). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it possible that it's not related to pedophilia?

And for what it's worth (here come the downvotes since this pisses off both sides):

First some background: I was doing front-line investigating on the Podesta emails. I was writing scripts that did natural language processing and looking for patterns. I discovered references first hand and came to my own conclusions consistent with many other folks and they included a pedophilia angle. 

That being said, the weakest part of the entire case for me is that the "FBI" doc referenced was sourced by WL and I've not been able to corroborate it with a single source that doesn't reference that same document.

If I just had a "PSA" pamphlet from the FBI, or a case file where the symbol was mentioned then I would feel 100% more confident about everything. I've invested some time in looking but I've been unsuccessful thus far. 

Again, I'm a believer; nothing excuses the instagram, videos and art, but I would love to put this detail to rest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> | I would love to live in a Libertarian Utopia

I'm talking about fixing one profoundly broken industry, that's all. It's certainly possible and would be incredibly exciting if it happens.

 what protective measures will there be in the long run? 

Can you articulate some of the threats your concerned about? It's a bit easier to address with specifics, but I suspect the FTC will be part of the response since they manage consumer protection for all the companies that aren't telcos.

How do you quantify not trusting the Government with your data with wanting the Government to "protect" consumers? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Sounds like something out of the Galt Gulch Chile Handbook.

You're in luck! Unlike most people that talk out of their ass about topics they don't know about, this is one where I have decades of professional experience. I've worked for an ILEC, been involved in the creation and build out of two CLECs and am intimately familiar with the regulatory challenges in getting a wire to someone's house. 

Think about any of the possible services that could be provided if your company had the ability to easily pipe data to each house. If someone did want to come to your town and offer gig ethernet for $10 a month but your data would be sold in aggregate to offset the cost, would you be interested? Regardless of your response, it would not have been possible with the regulations in place.

We are in this mess because the Government got involved and created a monopoly in the first place. They have been fucking it up more ever since trying to fix it. They just need to get out of the way. Blowing fiber to someone's house really is an inexpensive and easy thing to do, but that's not the hard part.

| That's not what the government is looking for in your computer.

Lol, the Government has always had your data.

	<TEXT> Since you asked, I grew up in the midwest with the idea that "gee, I hope I get my driver's license before the world ends". My grandparents walked the walk, fed me full of red meat and salt, spent an hour every morning reading the Bible to each other and praying. 

Meanwhile, to hear my single mom, accomplished musician on the 6 and 12-string guitar, flute, harp, percussion (and I wish I had any sense of rhythm) talking about burning her Moody Blue and Stones albums in the 1980s sounds like any poster to this sub today. There was nothing more evil to her than the Clintons and she would never hesitate to redpill you on the evil that we all live among.

Sadly, my beautiful blonde momma died at the age of 54. She was at the peak of her life until she faced an extended losing battle with brain cancer. I spread her ashes in the ocean. 

Meanwhile, though all this, I must always be the "smartest person in the room", continuously attempt to blue-pill my "ignorant" family for decades. Me, as the educated, self-made success story, clearly had all the answers...until you "grow-up" and realize you don't. 

The first drinks of science of taste like atheism but as you get towards the bottom of the glass you might become aware of some other forces. 

The further I go in my journey the amount of knowledge I think I have decreases. I'm now somewhere between wondering how I dress myself in the morning and protecting certain things from certain threats with expert accuracy. Life is an odd place to live.  </TEXT>
