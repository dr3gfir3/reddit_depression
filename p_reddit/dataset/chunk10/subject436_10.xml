DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD+. Thus, NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.

Our findings from a large, well-characterized prospective cohort provide compelling observational evidence on associations of vitamin D with lower risk of breast cancer morbidity and mortality.

Our replacement plan, Trump told a crowd in Roanoke, Va., in September, includes expanded access to Healthcare Savings Accounts, with support for those who need it. HSAs, which combine tax-free savings with a high-deductible insurance policy  a deductible of $2,500 or more  have long been a conservative favorite. In fact, legislation enabling HSAs was passed as part of the Medicare prescription drug benefit in 2003. There has been a very rapid increase in the use of HSAs in the interim, as employers offering health plans turned to them to offset rising health costs.

These are, in my humble opinion, the best articles I could find lately explaining why and how SO MANY political experts, media people and other brilliant minds, as well as millions of 'regular folks' - lik me, for example - completely misread these elections and wrongly dismissed Trump's potential to become president-elect.
Note that the Mike Moore's article was written well BEFORE the election's night.

Also, I think this moment will remain in my memory forever: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-2uSG1xUEg

"I would absolutely consider" suggesting a patient switch to taking medications at night, said Dr. Freeby, an assistant professor of endocrinology, diabetes and hypertension at the David Geffen School of Medicine.

"I would absolutely consider" suggesting a patient switch to taking medications at night, said Dr. Freeby, an assistant professor of endocrinology, diabetes and hypertension at the David Geffen School of Medicine.

	<TEXT>  ISIS ability to strike at will would mark a new threat for the country to contend with as U.S. and NATO forces ended their combat mission at the start of the year. It also further stretches the Islamic State groups influence far beyond its self-declared caliphate stretching through a third of Iraq and Syria. </TEXT>
