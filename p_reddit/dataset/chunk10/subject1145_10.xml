	<TEXT> They tried. For years people tried. They taunted Undertaker in hotels, bars, restaurants, on tours over seas. The plane ride from Hell always leaves out the fact that the Undertaker was in the corner being screamed at by Booker T (who lost his voice); Kane would call the Undertaker up and try to get him to come to televisions tapings and do it; Vince would visit the Undertaker in his time off and they'd watch MTV, Bring It On, You Got Served and at a low point they even marathoned Julia Stiles movies; Triple H even threatened to take away Taker's Wrestlemania match, but that didn't go through. Over all this fighting, The Undertaker never gave in. The Undertaker never did the spinaroonie. And the world is a sadder place. </TEXT>

Another way to find out how to get a permit is to just start playing then wait for the cops to show up (be compliant if they ask you to move) then ask them how to get a permit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two months ago I was waiting for the trolley. This gal with a swaztika came up and tried to guilt me in to giving her a cigarette. She was saying how the AB wasn't treating her right. How she was dying because she couldn't keep anything down except for chicken broth. While I had sympathy for another human being in pain; I had none for the decisions she made to bring her there. She was very distraught because she gave one of them a blowjob and he didn't give her a place to stay. Just sharing an anecdote as to how neo-nazis treat their own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just going to scroll past this; but upon further contemplation I must pontificate about the mental state of Disney characters. When is a Disney character not a lunatic?  

Cinderella thought she could talk to mice. The prince was so in love with a woman he danced with once; he used a shoe to find her and called it a slipper.  

Ariel is not satisfied with being the princess of 70% of the Earth. She deals with sea witches when she could have easily told Eric, "Hey I'm a mermaid, let's fuck and marry." Or something of the sort.  

Belle is into Beast-iality, gas lighting and Stockholm stuff.  

None of the lions at Pride Rock are impressed that Scar made a damn army of hyenas to do his bidding.

	<TEXT> A couple of notes. I'd save the gorilla position until the end (the gorilla position to entrance cut is always a nice touch, cliche'd but almost expected). I'd shorten the intro to no longer than two minutes. I'd put a bit more stories in the intro, example: some heartbreak, injury, mega wins. I'd put some of the fans waiting outside in the rain, if there's footage (fans are the most important part of indies). Also, I'd get rid of the guy reading, I don't care what he's reading, I don't care if its his gimmick, I don't care if he's just really happy about pages, people reading on film (especially a documentary) is absolutely boring. Hope to see the doc soon and remember to save money for marketing and festival entries! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Three words,  
Though thought dark and meek,  
M'lady Thee my soul will keep,  
Three words,  
To lay upon Thine feet,  
And lick them off (if that interests Thee),  
Three words,  
To show I be not freak,  
Three words:  
I'm not creep.

	<TEXT> I have an IG whre I post a lot of vegetarian friendly dishes.  

One of my favorites is Vegetarian Enchiladas (easily veagan). You just blend up butternut squash and use that for the filling instead of meat!  

Pan fried brussel sprout (coated in olive oil, salt and pepper) tacos is pretty good too! Add some black beans and salsa!  

End of the Week Scramble is my favorite! You take all the greens and veggies that are about to go bad and make them into a scramble (I use eggs but replacements are easy). This can even be used to make breakfast burritos for the week! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He knows it's not going to win him the match; but it's definitely putting a hurt on the back and the back of the head. Holding the opponent down for more than a second is enough to break even the greatest man's psyche. Zayn gets under his opponent's skin with the move. If he can get a 2 count, then he's only moments away from getting a three count, Zayn knows it and his opponent now knows it. The fist pumping is from the surge of adrenaline Zayn gets from knowin the end is near. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the biggest problems in WWE today. The moves are predictable. There was a surreal amount of surprise in Bret Hart's matches. You never knew when the finish would come. When ECW was a thing (not THAT thing the thing before it), you never knew what crazy shit they were going to do next.  

Now a finisher is really just a normal move. The winner of the match has to do his comeback, three finisher reversals, his signature, another three reversals then the finisher; repeat this sequence twice, then end the match.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a big guy with a lot of smells (ie, my big balls tend to ripen after a full day of sweating into them). The gym is a a public place where people like to be able to workout without too much nose interference. It also invigorates me to workout harder instead of not wanting to lift my arms due to an "unsure" moment. I believe it's equivalent to why professional wrestlers are always dripping wet when they come to the ring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found one of the best ways is to use Youtube as a source for HIIT cardio. There's a ton of videos.  

Fitness Blender has what you're looking for.  

Other Channels that I've used include: Six Pack Short Cuts; Mike Vazquez (when you want to add a challenging modification to an exercise you've mastered); Jordan Yeoh Fitness (this is the one I use the most, there are some great full body workouts there); Athlean-X (to get some great information about working out). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What r/squaredcircle has to remember is to not work themselves into a shoot! There's tons of wrestlers out there and there's going to be so many that are good heels! Stop circle jerking and getting your panties in a bunch and love to hate the guys instead of hating on them and casting out what they did as untalented! These guys are the most talented heels of all time if they can get r/squaredcircle to get their hands off each other's dicks and finally learn to be wrestling fans again. For reals! What's the fucking point of even watching professional wrestling if you're going to shit all over it? You want to watch a couple a wrestlers swimming around in your shit? Is that it? Is that what you want r/sc? Why not just watch the fucking product, buy some fucking t-shirts and be happy that you can take your children to a fucking show and make some fucking memories for them. If r/sc was my kid I'd leave them at the arena and book it to my car; let John Cena take care of it. There's nothing better than sharing good memories for your kid. Nothing! And here are these grown ass people never getting enough of a product they hate. I don't go to the ice cream store and get bubblegum ice cream because I don't like it; I get a flavor I like! I don't go to the beach because I hate being in the water! Why the fuck do you watch wrestling if you hate it so much??? WHY!? I'm going to go watch Anastasia. </TEXT>
