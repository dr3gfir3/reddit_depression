	<TEXT> Nah man I'm totally with you here. It felt like there were too many 'AS IFFFFFF' moments. 

One that sticks out is them telling Cooper about the mission, all end-of-the-world-and-you-are-the-only-one-who-can-save-us usual fairly unrealistic movie trope...but the instead of simply cutting to the reveal of the spaceship..the entire boardroom wall slides away to reveal the entire fucking spaceship room. Who would design something like that? Why? What boardroom really needs a "dramatic effect" wall?

Also the bit where there's no science, simply a fucking whiteboard that cooper scribbles on to plan an entire landing mission on a planet. It's just too dumb. How hard would it have been to include some semi serious plans/orbits/trajectories or something. I only gave a kerbal space program level of space travel knowledge..but even jeb doesn't use whiteboards to plan missions!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the exact feeling you are having. I found, like Elaol has said, that if you try to accept the anxiety and accept what might happen, you can feel a little bit more in control of the situation and it helps me to settle the nervousness a bit.

You are probably overthinking the whole thing though... I know I do. </TEXT>
