	<TEXT> Deuteronomy 23:13-15 gives a command that, for Israel's soldiers, latrines should always be outside the camp, because the Lord dwells in the camp.

Just before this passage, in verses 11-12, it says "If anyone among you has been rendered unclean by a nocturnal emission, he must leave the camp, and he must not reenter the camp. Toward evening he shall bathe in water, and at sundown he may reenter the camp." But, as I understand it, "nocturnal emission" is referring to a wet dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh except for the fact Aquinas actually was a proponent of the cosmological argument and has four or five reasons for it which TheCosmicSkeptic goes into detail about in his video.

Right, he was a proponent of the cosmological argument, but he **never** said "Everything has a cause, the universe is a thing, and therefore the universe should have a cause" as TheCosmicSkeptic quoted him.

I also dont see how this is supposed to convince me of the cosmological argument? Just because some author claims that no one else used it because its stupid?

No, the author isn't claiming that nobody used the cosmological argument because it was stupid: he is saying that there are gross misrepresentations of the cosmological argument which are put forward as straw men, and then knocked down, and that it's disingenuous to treat this as the "real" version, and then say that arguments as they were actually presented by major proponents as an attempt to patch the original up.

 Thomas Aquinas for one even though the author you quote claims he wasn't a proponent despite the fact he has five reasons, as presented in TheCosmicSkeptic's video as to why the prime mover of the universe was in his mind God.

Feser notes that the cosmological argument isn't intended to establish truths of revealed religion (that's point 5. in his blog post) nowhere does he say that Aquinas didn't argue for the attributes of God as part of his natural theology. Indeed, he says the exact opposite in point 4. of the blog post.

but to be atheist or theist then you have to have the ability to make observations that shape what you think about the world or universe.

Not if atheism is defined as "lacking a belief in theism".

I should note that TheCosmicSkeptic is only attacking the argument which many theists do actually use as a reason for their own Gods existence.

If he's just attacking "many theists", then why does he mention Aquinas and Craig? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> . I highly recommend watching TheCosmicSkeptics videos on YouTube. He responds to a lot of said arguments.

Ok, I just watched his video on the Kalam cosmological argument:

He says at :33 "Everything has a cause, noted Aquinas. The universe is a thing, and therefore the universe should have a cause."

As Ed Feser writes in an excellent blog post called "So you think you understand the cosmological argument?", which I thoroughly recommend you read:

*"Lots of people  probably most people who have an opinion on the matter  think that the cosmological argument goes like this: Everything has a cause; so the universe has a cause; so God exists.  They then have no trouble at all poking holes in it.  If everything has a cause, then what caused God?  Why assume in the first place that everything has to have a cause?  Why assume the cause is God?  Etc.*

*Heres the funny thing, though.  People who attack this argument never tell you where they got it from.  They never quote anyone defending it.  Theres a reason for that.  The reason is that none of the best-known proponents of the cosmological argument in the history of philosophy and theology ever gave this stupid argument.  Not Plato, not Aristotle, not al-Ghazali, not Maimonides, not Aquinas, not Duns Scotus, not Leibniz, not Samuel Clarke, not Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, not Mortimer Adler, not William Lane Craig, not Richard Swinburne.  And not anyone else either, as far as I know.  (Your Pastor Bob doesnt count.  I mean no one among prominent philosophers.)  And yet it is constantly presented, not only by popular writers but even by some professional philosophers, as if it were the basic version of the cosmological argument, and as if every other version were essentially just a variation on it."*

He goes on to say at 2:36 "Even if the Kalam cosmological argument was sound, and I hope to prove that it's not, it still wouldn't prove any particular God".

If his argument here is "The Kalam cosmological argument doesn't establish the truths of any particular revealed religion (e.g. Jesus was God incarnate, Mohammed is the last seal of the prophets)", then that's not really a strike against it. Which major proponent of the argument ever claimed that it *did* establish such a thing? As for his question "why not multiple Gods?" and that the argument commits the fallacy of composition, you'll find that Craig has addressed these questions in his published work.

There are serious criticisms of natural theology, but teenage YouTube atheists are *not* the place to go to find them. J Howard Sobel and Graham Oppy are two qualified authors who are prominent in this area.

calling atheists shoes (an ad hominem to this day I still dont know why theists constantly use)

There's a history behind this one: https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/2za4ez/vacuous_truths_and_shoe_atheism/cph4498/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is absolutely no way whatsoever that you can go from saying a God might exist using cosmological or teleological arguments, to then infer that if there is a God that God is a personal one

Well, Craig gives an arguments in his presentations of the Kalam and teleological arguments for certain properties of the designer. As far as I can see, all you've done is say the words "no proof!" rather than actually addressing them.

So, you are saying the ultimate being in all of existence, one in which they are saying has no beginning, will always exist, has all knowledge, and is all powerful is somehow a 'simple being'?

I certainly don't see why it's true "by definition" that God must be complex.

 The Cosmological Argument or First Cause Argument is a philosophical argument for the existence of God which explains that everything has a cause. That is the definition of the Kalam Cosmological argument, just so we are both on the same page.

No, we aren't "on the same page". As Ed Feser writes in that post I linked to earlier:

*Lots of people  probably most people who have an opinion on the matter  think that the cosmological argument goes like this: Everything has a cause; so the universe has a cause; so God exists.  They then have no trouble at all poking holes in it.  If everything has a cause, then what caused God?  Why assume in the first place that everything has to have a cause?  Why assume the cause is God?  Etc.*

*Heres the funny thing, though.  People who attack this argument never tell you where they got it from.  They never quote anyone defending it.  Theres a reason for that.  The reason is that none of the best-known proponents of the cosmological argument in the history of philosophy and theology ever gave this stupid argument.  Not Plato, not Aristotle, not al-Ghazali, not Maimonides, not Aquinas, not Duns Scotus, not Leibniz, not Samuel Clarke, not Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange, not Mortimer Adler, not William Lane Craig, not Richard Swinburne.  And not anyone else either, as far as I know.  (Your Pastor Bob doesnt count.  I mean no one among prominent philosophers.)  And yet it is constantly presented, not only by popular writers but even by some professional philosophers, as if it were the basic version of the cosmological argument, and as if every other version were essentially just a variation on it.*

*Dont take my word for it.  The atheist Robin Le Poidevin, in his book Arguing for Atheism (which my critic Jason Rosenhouse thinks is pretty hot stuff) begins his critique of the cosmological argument by attacking a variation of the silly argument given above  though he admits that no-one has defended a cosmological argument of precisely this form!  So whats the point of attacking it?  Why not start instead with what some prominent defender of the cosmological argument has actually said?*

*Suppose some creationist began his attack on Darwinism by assuring his readers that the basic claim of the Darwinian account of human origins is that at some point in the distant past a monkey gave birth to a human baby.  Suppose he provided no source for this claim  which, of course, he couldnt have, because no Darwinian has ever said such a thing  and suppose also that he admitted that no one has ever said it.  But suppose further that he claimed that more sophisticated versions of Darwinism were really just modifications of this claim.  Intellectually speaking, this would be utterly contemptible and sleazy.  It would give readers the false impression that anything Darwinians have to say about human origins, however superficially sophisticated, is really just a desperate exercise in patching up a manifestly absurd position.  Precisely for that reason, though, such a procedure would, rhetorically speaking, be very effective indeed.*

If you want to believe with faith, do so. Don't pretend to have reason for it. Be proud of having faith despite there being no rational base for it; many believers seem to hold faith in higher regard the fewer reasons there are for having it. 

Given that you think the Kalam cosmological argument begins with the proposition "everything has a cause", you have a lot to learn and should drop this kind of rhetoric. For example, you can find the answer to your question "Noone has ever seen an actor cause something to come into existence from nothing. Ever." in Craig's lecture "Objections So Bad I Couldn't Have Made Them Up. The World's Ten Worst Objections To The Kalam Cosmological Argument". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To run with the example from forensic science, if somebody said "Yes, I recognise that the samples from the crime scene match my blood type and microsatellite markers, but how can you say that those samples deriving from me is the only plausible hypothesis? Isn't it possible that there was a thermodynamic fluctuation which assembled them from the sources of carbon, nitrogen etc. already at the crime scene?"

But this prompts the reply "Yes, that is a *possible* hypothesis, but not a plausible one".

Surely because eliminating hypotheses as implausible is part of the process of science, evidence against some hypothesis "a" will be support for another hypothesis "b" only in the case that a and b are known to be the only plausible hypotheses.

I'm a creationist, but I think I would disagree with the statement that "evidence against evolution is evidence for creation"? simply because both of those words have multiple senses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You would be left with the same probability that a giant pink unicorn is our God as the Christian God. 

Well, neither Craig, nor any other major defender of the teleological argument, claims that it is intended to establish the truth of doctrines peculiar to some particular revealed religion e.g. that Jesus is God incarnate, or Mohammed is the seal of all the prophets, etc.

So this really isn't a flaw in the argument, because that's not what it's intended to do! 

Craig writes elsewhere concerning the Flying Spaghetti Monster, which is often brought up in a similar manner to the way you used the giant pink unicorn:

*what is the point of the parody? What does it show? Its striking that Hendersons parody does nothing to call into question either the legitimacy or necessity of the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe. Rather the point of the parody seems to be that we cannot know much, if anything, about the nature of the Designer. Therefore, its arbitrary to characterize the Designer of the universe as God, especially the God of some specific religion.*

*Whats curious about this parody is that ID theorists like William Dembski have been insisting on this same point for years, but everyone seems to think them disingenuous. Dembski makes it abundantly clear that on the basis of the specified complexity in the universe one cannot infer that the Designer is infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and so forth. It is precisely for that reason that ID theorists deny that ID is disguised religion. The identification of the Designer with God is a theological conclusion that cannot itself be warranted on the basis of the design argument alone.*

*Dembski writes,*

*Insofar as design theorists do not bring up God, it is because design-theoretic reasoning does not warrant bringing up God. Design-theoretic reasoning tells us that certain patterns exhibited in nature reliably point to a designing intelligence. But theres no inferential chain that leads from such finite design-conducing patterns in nature to the infinite personal transcendent creator God of the worlds major theistic faiths. . . . As a Christian I hold that the Christian God is the ultimate source of design behind the universe. . . . But theres no way for design inferences from physics or biology to reach that conclusion. . . . Far from being coy or deceitful, when design theorists do not bring up God, it is because they are staying within the proper scope of their theory (The Design Revolution, p. 26).*

*Therefore, Dembski is adamant that religious interpretations of Intelligent Design should not be taught in public classrooms. Dembski himself, had he thought of it, might have appealed to the Flying Spaghetti Monster to illustrate his point! Ironically, then, Hendersons parody actually reinforces one of the central contentions of the ID movement, that it is not religious teaching. The inference to a Designer is not an inference to any particular deity.*

*This is not to say that we can infer nothing about the Designer of the universe on the basis of the specified complexity of the cosmos. Principally, what we can infer is that there exists a personal, and, hence, self-conscious, volitional being of inconceivably great intelligence who designed the universe. If people really believed that to be true, they would be wide-eyed and open-mouthed with astonishment, rather than mocking and derisive.*

*Moreover, its plausible that any ultimate explanation must involve a personal being which is incorporeal. For any being composed of material stuff will exhibit precisely that specified complexity that we are trying to explain. The old Who designed the Designer? objection thus presses hard against any construal of the Designer as a physical object (see my Richard Dawkins Argument for Atheism in The God Delusion in the Question of the Week Archive). That immediately rules out the Flying Spaghetti Monster as a final explanation.*


--------

Being we are talking about a being that is infinitely powerful, all-knowing, and some Christians claim, omnipresent, then it is by definition the most complex being possible to exist.

Why is that true "by definition"?

If that cause has no cause, then once again not everything has a cause.

Once again: "everything has a cause" is **not** a premise of the Kalam cosmological argument, so that's irrelevant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Just because something is vestigial doesn't mean it has no function

Plenty of people *do* formulate these kinds of arguments in terms of the lack of function, though. E.g. Jerry Coyne in his book "Why Evolution Is True":

"One of my favorite cases of embryological evidence for evolution is the furry human fetus. We are famously known as naked apes because, unlike other primates, we dont have a thick coat of hair. But in fact for one brief period we do  as embryos. Around sixth months after conception, we become completely covered with a fine, downy coat of hair called lanugo. Lanugo is usually shed about a month before birth, when its replaced by the more sparsely distributed hair with which were born. (Premature infants, however, are sometimes born with lanugo, which soon falls off.) Now, theres **no need** for a human embryo to have a transitory coat of hair. After all, its a cozy 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit in the womb. Lanugo **can be explained only** as a remnant of our primate ancestry: fetal monkeys also develop a coat of hair at about the same stage of development." See [here](http://blog.drwile.com/?p=1309) for a debunking of this particular example, incidentally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you are doing is presenting a critique of the Kalam cosmological argument, in saying that Craig acknowledges "that at least some things can exist without a beginning."

Where did he ever deny this though? The first premise of the argument, as Craig formulates it, is "everything that begins to exist has a cause" **not** "everything that exists has a beginning". This idea that Craig is simply arbitrarily exempting God from some principle misunderstands the argument. I thoroughly recommend the following blog post: http://edwardfeser.blogspot.com/2011/07/so-you-think-you-understand.html

I don't want to sound rude, but this objection is irrelevant and you've displayed no evidence of having actually read his critique of Dawkins's argument, which may be found [here](http://www.reasonablefaith.org/dawkins-delusion).

I'm doing an 11.7 km race in a little under a month, and I have trained to the point where I can run for that whole distance.

Should I just work on bringing my time down for that distance, or is there any point in training with longer distances as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the effort you put in to your post.

My question is: by what principle do we infer this conclusion from this observation?

Well, that's sort of my question as well: I'm struggling to understand final causes within the Aristotelian framework, and how one is supposed to determine what the final cause of a particular entity is.

 if we could get clear about what this reason is, then we'd be in a position to assess whether this is an adequate account of Aristotle's position, and try to clarify the relevant issues if it is not. But I'm hesitant to try to guess at what this reason is, so I was hoping you could clarify the point.

Sorry if seems I'm trying to surreptitiously "gotcha" here: I'm genuinely interested in this topic, and this is not my intent. </TEXT>

Um, I'm not well-read enough on this topic, so I don't see what you're getting at with these questions. Why *wouldn't* the Aristotelian conclude that this cyclic oscillation was the final cause?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sci fi author, retired engineer, and lay Catholic Michael Flynn writes [as follows](http://tofspot.blogspot.com/2011/12/oh-happiness-our-beings-end-and-aim.html):

*William Wallace distinguishes three kinds of end:*

*1. Terminus. In traveling from "here" to "there," the "there" is the end of the trip, where the traveler comes to rest.  When such stability terminates a natural process, whether inorganic or organic, it is the end of the process and as such its final cause.*

*Falling motion terminates when the heavy object arrives at a center of gravity.*

*Fleas grow, but not to the point where they reach the size of elephants.*

*Chemical reactions "go," but they also "stop," for example, when hydrogen and oxygen combine to form a stable molecule in water.*

*The breakdown of uranium terminates at lead.*

*[TOF: Regular cyclic behavior counts as "at rest".  We would say "equilibrium state" in modern lingo.]*

My question concerns cyclic behaviour. Consider the example of the snowshoe hare population. Records of the number of pelts traded from the Hudson Bay Trading Company have revealed that snowshoe hare populations oscillate over a ~10 year cycle. 

See: https://www.math.duke.edu//education/ccp/materials/diffeq/predprey/pred1.html


Now, if you saw the data in the link above might you not conclude "the terminus of snowshoe hares is this cyclic oscillation of population"?

But say you visited Canada in 1880 without knowing of this wider phenomenon, and left after 5 years, concluding that snowshoe hare populations had suffered from some abnormal disaster, are steadily rising and will one day reach a plateau. I.e. the terminus of snowhoe hares is to maintain a steady population.

Couldn't a nominalist say: well, the fact that the latter person made an incorrect conclusion shows that all that's going on is fallible inductions about the combinations of matter that they come across in their daily lives, rather than any kind of genuine insight into a "nature" which these beings possess? </TEXT>
