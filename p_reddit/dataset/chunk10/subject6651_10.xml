	<TEXT> Never posted here before, and I have no film background. I came up with this question while watching Drive with Gosling:

Is there a certain significance to scenes when you can see all characters (at least 3 or more) in the same perspective/picture? </TEXT>

<WRITING>
	<TITLE> NBA Radio game in Drive </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-06 06:31:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the beginning scene you see on the TV and later confirm on the radio that Gosling's character is listening to the Toronto Raptors play the LA Clippers at Staples Center.

If you pay attention to the radio, you notice that the announcer mentions the names Brand, Griffin, and Kaman. Regardless of what year this movie is supposed to occur, the names Kaman and Brand can only refer to Chris Kaman and Elton Brand.

The mistake here is that those two players never played in the same game as a Griffin (who played for the Raptors). The likely Griffin that is being referenced is Blake Griffin, but in his only year playing with Kaman (2011), Brand was with the Philadelphia 76ers, not the Raptors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was watching a movie and had an interesting idea:

What if, before the game, you could designate a specific piece to move like a queen, and in making this designation change your queen to move like a king? I feel like this could create some new avenues for strategy, especially considering that discovering who your opponent is using as their "hidden" queen would become part of the equation.

I don't know if this has ever been proposed before. Just a thought, what do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like I said in my first sentence (my pseudo nut graf, if you will) I gave up on journalism to pursue teaching, so forgive me if my formatting isn't quite up to par you pedantic POS. I digress.

"It is not essential."

You know what else isn't essential? For you to be living on this earth and breathing, but I'm not over here marginalizing your life and dismissing it as something we can do without.

This isn't just a handful of TV anchors from an overzealous corporation being cast off. This is **dozens** of hardworking people who have a right to make a living for themselves. Not all of them are high-level senior editors either. In fact, most of them are reporters and former interns, some of whom probably called their parents to brag about finding a full-time job in a dying industry, only to be let go at a moment's notice because of said dying industry.

I haven't been a fan of ESPN for a long time, but I'm not over here celebrating their demise. And no, the fact that Bleacher Report and Fox and other competing sports sites exist doesn't necessarily mean all these now-unemployed-former-ESPNers are going to find a job easily. ESPN has been dominating its market for a reason, and those competitors (with seriously smaller budgets) are going to struggle to scoop up one to two former ESPNers, much less their entire former NHL department.

What's more, you are seriously overestimating the general population's ability to interpret a box score. I don't follow hockey, so I sure as hell can't explain to someone else how "points" are calculated. And if you think the entire value of a basketball game can be summed up in a box score then please tell me how [this](http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199806140UTA.html) at all signifies the importance and magnitude of the game in question.

My last point is in regards to your second to last sentence. If you were actually spending time researching the demise of ESPN, you would know that their objective, according to [Andy Katz](https://twitter.com/TheAndyKatz/status/857628431567212548), was "being right, not just first." And considering his experience in his industry, I'm a hell of a lot more inclined to believe his assertion in lieu of yours.

You sound like a truly toxic person, and I sympathize with anyone that has to interact with your dismissive arrogance on a daily basis. Just a tip: life is a lot more enjoyable when you choose to celebrate and embrace other people instead of looking down on them and sneering.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who actually gave up on journalism to go into teaching because it's a more stable career, go fuck yourself. My "sports" writing was no different than my "entertainment" writing or my "news" writing. It's a dying industry because of failing standards and information availability. In terms of the consumability of a specific beat, "food" writing is no more effective then Yelp, and concert reviews are about as effective as Yahoo Music. Sports journalism is valuable in the sense that we have former players to interview and reference, but the accessibility of the sports make it easier to dismiss the importance of relevant articles and columns after the fact. Journalism, in and of itself, is pointless without an audience, so as long as there is a market for it, there is a place for writers to work. Also gtfo for insinuating that anyone losing their job and source of income is in any way justified or inconsequential. Have some fucking humanity and get off your high horse for assuming that any form of "writing" is better than any other. I'm actually going to have a beer because reading and considering your point makes me feel hollow and sick. Fuck you. </TEXT>

That doesn't make you a loser, that makes you a fan of the sport. And for what it's worth, I don't think 2001 G2 is lost to history, it's just drastically overshadowed by G1 because of AI's narrative. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about how a website can still identify me with outdated information? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-27 17:47:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Context: Last night I was searching around for a stream to watch the new episode of Better Call Saul. One of the search results sent me to, I think, Project Watch Series. The stream didn't work, but I noticed that towards the bottom you could see that I was "logged in" with Facebook. 

I can't recall if I ever used this site before, maybe back in college, but the thumbnail was a previous profile pic I haven't had in over  3-4 years, and the email listed was one that I deleted a long time ago. I deactivated FB over a month ago, too, but the most bewildering part is the fact that I am using a work laptop that has never accessed/been associated with that old, no-longer-existent email.

I'm not entirely concerned about the security of this -- I promptly logged out and exited the site. My question is how a site like this can retain information over such a long period of time and still identify me when I visit with a completely different laptop? </TEXT>
