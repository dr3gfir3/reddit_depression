	<TEXT> [**War and Turpentine by Stefan Hertmans**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833668-war-and-turpentine), book. Goddamn fine book. A bit meta--author writing about his grandfather and the process of writing about his grandfather, plus he includes portions of his grandfather's journals. It's about war, it's about art and painting. It's great.  
  
[**Anything is Possible by Elizabeth Strout**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32080126-anything-is-possible), audiobook. She's quickly becoming a favorite author; subtle, humane, really relatable and believable characters and natural dialogue. Great collection interconnected stories and brings back Lucy Barton from her previous book. Love it. </TEXT>

He didn't say that. He said Modern which might mean something different. I just want to know what he meant.

	<TEXT> Yeah. You shouldn't bother. It's a fruitless exercise. Why are you so judgmental about other people's reading habits?
  
  Voltaire, Camus, Rousseau, Sartre etc.  
  
You know, I've read those, and probably some of what you'd include in the "etc.," but I honestly didn't consider myself well read because when I read them I wasn't in a place to *read them* read them--it was coursework, my understanding of it was guided, and honestly it wasn't enjoyable for me.  
  
If there was ever a a time when I were to consider myself "well read", it would be now. I read more, I read broadly, and I enjoy a lot of it. What I don't do, however, is rub people's noses in it, or act smug about what I read (well...maybe a little!), or judge people for what they read (maybe if they don't read I'll judge them a bit...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should try [To The Bright Edge of the World by Eowyn Ivey](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27917957-to-the-bright-edge-of-the-world). Ostensibly it's about a man leaving his new wife to explore the interior wilds of Alaska on behalf of the US government not long after it had been purchased from the Russians, but really it's about much much more. It felt like 3 novels in one. There is the adventure narrative of our explorer hero told in diary entries and letters to his bride; there is the novel about his wife--and really her novel is about the birth of an artist, also told in diary entries and letters; then there is the book about a descendant of these two characters and the relationship between he, an aging man, and a 30-something museum curator in Alaska--and their epistolary novel is about the creation of a true friendship. The book is really quite beautiful, and Eowyn Ivey is a pretty startling writer. Highly recommend.  </TEXT>

What's modern? After WWII? 21st C.? Do you mean strictly in English? Or do you mean contemporary World Lit?

	<TEXT> Their study was interesting but a little...myopic? I wonder if they did an additional map layer that included reading habits. However, I'll grant, the reasons I haven't put one up: 1) I live in an apartment building and they won't go for it; 2) at the moment, it's cost prohibitive. For the most part, these are books people have purchased and are getting rid of (for me, I'll drive around looking for LFL after HPB doesn't buy some of my books). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, man. I totally loved this book. I found it distressing and heartbreaking. Stories of every day life have a harrowing dimension because they're set in North Korea. I thought it effectively juxtaposed how the things we do everyday without a second thought or take for granted (visiting our mothers, spending a weekend with our grandchildren, raising a 2 year old, planting a tree in your backyard), all take on a new, malevolent patina. These stories felt significant even though they have the minutest plots. I think Pandemonium and Red Mushroom were the best stories, but I was engaged and invested in all of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  social justice articles that try to use African culture as a standard of cultural perfection 

Wow. I don't think I've ever seen that. OK. Also, there's nothing wrong w/ social justice--although the warriors can be a little...over-the-top, but like you said that's a discussion for another day. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of that may be due to idea that the counter-culture has been commodified and become the dominant culture. Or, it could be that the culture is so diverse now it's stratified so that no one culture dominates...back in the 1950s, culture was a lot more stagnant, and homogeneous. Every ad, every marketing campaign nowadays look like those Benetton ads from the 90s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read it as a freshman Lit major. I loved it. Really identified with his angst, with his anger, with his loneliness. After, I tore through all his books. Then, a buddy--who was similarly infatuated--and I started going through micro-fiche on campus looking for old, uncollected stories and printing those out.  
I want to reread it but I don't know when I will. I remember loving Franny and Zooey the most.

Young Adult I think is geared towards high school kids. Get a lot of romantic tragedies (Fault in Our Stars), or romantic fantasy (Twilight).  
Contemporary is I think of the current era. For people that read a lot, that could be the last five years. For English majors, anything since the 90s? After whatever they define post-modern as... </TEXT>
