	<TITLE> Anybody know where to find vintage "Frodo Lives" buttons? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all - sorry if this is the wrong subreddit for this inquiry, if that's the case please point me in the right direction!

Long story short, my father is both a hippie and a Tolkien fan. As I'm sure many of you know, the hippie movement in the 60's and 70's used the phrase "Frodo Lives!" a lot, whether is was on shirts on buttons or even graffiti. When I asked my father what he wants for the holidays, he told me all he wants is a pin with that phrase from that time period. I have been able to find recreations on ebay and etsy, but I am having a hard time finding one specifically from the 60's and 70's. Would anybody be able to point me in the right direction? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got a preowned copy of Alpha Sapphire today and I was trying to get on GTS. It told me I needed an update, so I clicked the link and went to the eshop. I downloaded the update and went back to the game, it told me "data necessary for the internet connection has not been obtained." Ok, so I deleted the download and redownloaded. Checked again, but still "data necessary for the internet connection has not been obtained." I thought maybe I had to restart the system in order for the update to work, but the error message happened again. I even tried it on my old 3ds, still says "data necessary for the internet connection has not been obtained." I have no idea what is wrong, I can connect just fine to the internet on other games, I even managed to get a mystery gift from AS but I just can't get to anything else. Help please?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, be warned that there will be a wall of text. 

Background: I am the 21 year old middle child of my parents, I have an older sister who is 23 and a younger brother who is 18. In 2012, I came downstairs and saw my mother on her laptop - I could see the picture she was looking at, it was a picture of her lying in bed with some guy. I asked who he was, and without any hesitation, she turned to me and said, "Your father and I are getting a divorce." Immediately I started screaming and crying, I thought everything had been going so well. My older sister just came home from study abroad 2 days before, I thought we were all going to be a family again. I fell to the flood and backed myself into a corner, my sister heard me and ran to me. I managed to get out that they were getting a divorce, and she began to cry, too. My brother was the last to come into the room, he's on the autism spectrum and is very bad at showing his emotions. He asked what was going on, so my mother turned and told him, "Mommy and Daddy are getting a divorce. Daddy is going to move in with his parents." Somehow, the situation settled enough for everybody to speak in a (somewhat) calm manner. I asked why, she said it was because my dad "couldn't satisfy her" in bed, and she had been seeing another man for the part 4 years. My sister and I had known she had cheated on our father before for the same reasons, and she told us that it was the same man almost 10 years later. Of course I didn't want to hear anything about their bedroom lives, I began to ask why she got to stay and dad had to leave. She said her plan was to keep us all here until my brother (then 16) graduated high school, then she was going to sell the house. She said that was enough time for my sister and I to get off the ground and out of the house, and my brother could live in the dorms when he goes to college. I had no idea how my father was okay with this, all he would say is that he loved my mother and just wanted to be happy. Over the next few days, I learned many things about my parents that I wish I hadn't. Every child has that realization that their parents aren't the people they thought they were, but this was shoved down our throats. In the next few weeks my parents did everything wrong. They came home drunk and while my father was trying to go to sleep my mother professed her love to the man she was seeing and told my brother and I who her favorites were. My brother got it all on video. A couple days later my mom and that man broke up because my dad went to his house and yelled at him. To cut this background short, I'll just skip to the end. My siblings and I told my mother that we didn't want to live with her, and she should leave. We convinced our father that it was not entirely his fault, and we have been living happily with him for the past 2 years. He doesn't talk to or about her. The only way he'll acknowledge her existence is when we call her "ED." (That means Egg Donor.) We tried to maintain a relationship with her, but she slowly left our lives and that brings us to where we are now.

Last week, my sister and I were talking about how our mother had blocked us and all our friends on facebook. We found that a little suspect, so we looked at her twitter. On there we found out why she wasn't speaking to us or visiting. She is seeing somebody. My sister and I confronted her about it via text, and she told us that she hid it because she knew we would react this way. I wouldn't have had a problem with her seeing somebody new, it's been 2 years. I had a problem with her hiding everything. Today, I found out that who she was seeing was the same guy. The guy she slept with when I was a child, the guy she was seeing while my sister was starving herself, the guy she was kissing when I was hospitalized for multiple suicide attempts, the guy she left my father for. Now, I've tried to be civil with her. Before she left home she would come into my room and cry to me for hours. I didn't want to hear it because I was in a lot of pain as well, but she was my mommy and I didn't want to see her hurting. That's my downfall, I can't separate the person I thought she was with the person she actually is. I have put myself in situations I know I shouldn't have been in because of this flaw. During tax season I was the go between for them, it was terrible. I got yelled at by both sides. I stood up to them and told them I wasn't a walkie talkie, but they still use me as such. After finding out the news today, it finally broke the illusion that I was unable to see through. I can now identify how terrible she was in the past, how she used my sisters anorexia and my BPD to get in with the people at her work (she works in health care.) I could see how she would take everything my siblings or I had and brag about it on facebook for people to 'like' and praise her on. I could see how, in March at my childhood friend's funeral, she cried more than I did because she wanted the attention. I know now, I do not want her in my life. One of the main reasons I was communicating with her still was because she pays for my therapy, but at this point I don't care if I lose my car or my therapist or anything else - I need her gone. I feel extremely sad, I feel like I lost somebody but it's surreal because the person I'm losing never existed. I don't know what I'm expecting from this, I guess I would like to hear from you all as well as get it all off my chest. Thanks you, guys.

(sorry, no tl;dr because I honestly cannot shorten it.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mouthguard causing sensitivity? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-03 14:54:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a 21 year old female and I've been grinding my teeth for a while. After having some bits chip off through the night, I decided to invest in a mouthguard. They took a cast of my teeth and made it out of a resin-like material. (I don't know/remember the exact material.) For the first few nights it worked really well, I woke up feeling a lot less strained. However, I can't use it anymore. 

About a week after using it nightly, I began to notice some sensitivity. At first I was worried that it was a cavity, but based on the placement and timing I found that to be odd. The only sensitivity I am having is on the outer side of the back upper molar on each side of my mouth, right in the area where the mouthguard would sit. I've never had tooth sensitivity before, so I figured I could invest in some Sensodyne and that would allow me to continue to use the mouthguard. Win-win, right?

Wrong. Not only did the Sensodyne taste awful, but it barely worked. I had to stop wearing the mouthguard in order to alleviate some of the sensitivity. I wasn't able to eat/drink anything cold, hot, or sweet. I am now going to bed without the mouthguard and continuing to use the Sensodyne, but there is still some sensitivity on the outer side of those molars. As of right now, I do not have dental insurance so the mouthguard was pretty costly, and I'm not even able to get any use out of it. 

Is this a common problem? When they were casting my teeth they did have some trouble, they couldn't find the right size to cast it with so they had to fill my mouth with that foam 5 or 6 times, so I'm wondering if that messed up the sizing? Is there any way to fix the mouthguard so it would work without causing me pain? Also, is there a way to get rid of that sensitivity? 

TL;DR: mouthguard made molars sensitive, have to choose between sensitivity or grinding. 

Sorry if this was a long read, thank you in advance if you have any info/advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am looking for cemeteries where the owners/caretakers/families have left and the area has been taken back by nature. I read in an article that in our state was have an estimated 400+ of these sites, so I'm hoping that somebody here can point me in the right direction. I am starting a new photo manipulation/surrealist photography project and I would love to set some photos in these areas.

I live in central CT, so I can basically travel just about anywhere in the state and I'm willing to do so. If anybody knows about some lost grave sites, please let me know! Thanks :D

	<TEXT> First of all, that's way too much of a deficit for her. Unless she's looking to lose muscle mass rather than fat. Assuming the height and weight you gave us are accurate, she should be eating around 1600 calories and working out in order to lose weight at a healthy rate.

If she is eating 1600 calories rather than the claimed 800, 10lbs in 2 months sounds about right. Her TDEE is 2200 and her BRM is 1600. At a deficit of 600, it would take her 6(ish) days to lose a pound. If both months were 31 day months that would be 62 days. Divide 62 days by 6 and you get a little bit over 10.

So, it seems she was either lying about how many calories she was actually eating or she was eating her exact BMR for two months. </TEXT>
