	<TEXT> A new European concept called the Small Mars System (SMS), described in a paper in the journal Ars Astronautica, would use a helicopter drone, among other items, to explore the surface. The European Space Agency funded a feasibility study of the project that concluded in May 2016. The team  led by the Aerospace Laboratory for Innovative Components is hoping to move into Phase A work soon, but that will require more grants to fund specific parts of the system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Samsung has opened preorders for the unlocked variety of its new Galaxy S8 and S8 Plus smartphones. The company originally confirmed to The Verge back in March that unlocked versions would be arriving in May, and now Samsung will let you put money down with an availability date of May 31st. As we noted when the Best Buy listings first went live earlier this year, this timeframe is about one month earlier than past unlocked Galaxy devices have been made available in the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The real cost of the bailouts is that they demonstrated the willingness of the government to save large financial institutions that get themselves in trouble. In doing so, they give banks an incentive to be even more reckless in the future.

Both JP Morgan Chase and Goldman Sachs worked with hedge funds to bet against the toxic mortgages after the crash had started. They made money by selling short on the financial catastrophe they had created. We should have let them crash and hope the new ones learn from their mistakes.

Using props like a mini-solar system, a model skyline, and flowers adds to the surreal and hypnotic quality of the video. Just sit back and take it in--this is pure entertainment." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the game, the player's character joins one of three world-controlling secret societies attempting to repel, mitigate or exploit the attack of Lovecraftian entities and other immortal beings in coastal Maine, rural Egypt, Transylvania and a quarantined section of Tokyo, and advance their society's agenda over that of the others.

The game uses a contemporary setting, borrowing heavily from the horror fiction genre and folklore, with a fog-ringed, zombie-infested New England fishing village for the novice player, mummies and cultists in Egypt for the mid-level player, followed by vampires and werewolves in Transylvania and ghosts, robots, Oni demons and an interdimensional occult cancer in Tokyo. Mission content bleeds into player faction headquarters in London, Seoul and the DUMBO neighborhood in Brooklyn, and into the game's transport network, along the subterranean branches of Yggdrasil in Agartha.

Unlike many other MMORPGs, there is no need to stop to use most of a character's attacks and abilities; as a result, combat is faster and movement-based. The character is free (and at higher levels, occasionally obliged) to redevelop their abilities on the go, to better prepare themselves for specific threats or better integrate into a group. Unlike traditional MMORPGs, advancement is primarily through equipment, using experience points to buy additional abilities and more powerful weapons. </TEXT>

"The K5 has a maximum speed of 18 miles per hour (29 kph), but usually it moves at 1 to 3 miles per hour. It is designed to use mapping software to create a geo-fenced perimeter that makes it stay within one area. The K5 creates a point cloud to show a 3-D image of the surroundings in the geo-fenced area. The K5 also uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect objects in surroundings and movements of its wheels. The K5 detects criminal records through facial recognition. It scans up to 1,500 license plates per minute. When the K5 detects a license for a known criminal on "hot list", it will alert the law enforcement force. It can also check its database to confirm the match. It has "360-degree high definition video capture" The K5 uses the infrared light to collect about 90TB of data every day, and the infrared light can function at night. The thermal imaging sensor detects and measures minute temperature differences. Also, it can cooperate with the microphone to check whether there is a bright glare after a loud sound possibly from an explosion or gunshot. It can detect objects 24 hours a day. " </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The authors's conclusion is stark: "Artificially sweetened soft drink consumption was associated with a higher risk of stroke and dementia." But that seems to be overselling the results for dementia. For stroke, there do seem to be more consistent associations that are worth following up on.

But, as the authors spend extensive time in the paper discussing, there's no way of telling why this association exists at this point. "Sicker individuals [may] consume diet beverages as a means of negating a further deterioration in health," they posit. "Indeed, in our study, diabetes mellitusa known risk factor for dementiawas more prevalent in those who regularly consumed artificially sweetened soft drinks."

In other words, don't clear out your fridge just yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the summer of 2014, Craig Diangelo thought he was on the path to an easy retirement. A veteran of the tech industry, Diangelo got his start as a COBOL programmer in the 1970s. Over the next four decades he learned dozens of new programming languages and kept up with the evolution of the sector from mainframe computers to PCs, from the early days of the web to the advent of cloud computing. He held a position as a senior advisor to the CTO at a major health insurance provider, then took a job as data storage specialist at regional utility Eversource Energy. He lived near his office in Berlin, Connecticut, made a six-figure salary, and was working toward a comfortable pension. And then, in October, he and his fellow staffers were called into an all-hands meeting with the companys chief information officer. </TEXT>
