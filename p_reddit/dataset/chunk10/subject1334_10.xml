	<TEXT> Not at all. It shouldn't effect you either way. As long as all pre-requisites are met, it shouldn't look bad, or matter at all, how long it took to accomplish them or if you took extra classes that weren't required. It won't look bad at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't finished Pre-Pharmacy yet, and I'm only doing two years, but for example I took college algebra in high school and thought it was a waste because Calculus 1 is the only required math. But then I noticed there is a good chunk of algebra questions on the PCAT, so in reality it probably wasn't a waste. Now odds are, we're in different states and plan on going to different pharmacy schools, but my advice would be to look at the breakdown of the PCAT and take any courses that are on the PCAT that aren't necessarily required that you don't know a lot about or need to brush up on. That's what I would do if I was in your situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my patriarchal blessing, it says that I would need to know a second language for my mission. Considering I was out before I ever went on a mission, I can safely say that prophecy isn't coming true. It also says that one day I would "be in a position of great leadership within the church" And that it would be important for me to "remain humble during this time." The greatest leadership position I ever had was teachers quorum 2nd counseler.  And that was before my blessing. Poor guy must've accidently tuned into the wrong frequency.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, I absolutely love pharmacy. It is 100% my passion. Medicine is fascinating to me. I think it's the coolest thing and most of the time people give me weird looks for being so obsessed with medicine. I just find it so incredible. I love knowing how every medicine works, what they do and how they interact/work together. And I love explaining these things to people and advising them on different medication. So, I know some people that aren't as passionate about pharmacy and medicine, but for me personally, I do love pharmacy and it is no doubt my passion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came to this thread just to comment about your kids. There's still a chance they won't get ADHD, especially if only one parent has it. If only one parent has it, there's still a greater chance that your kids won't get it than that they will, but when both parents have it, there's a greater chance that they will too. IIRC, with one parent, the odds are somewhere from 20-30% that the kids will get, but when both have it, it jumps up to somewhere from 55-60%. But like was said before they will be better off than other ADHD kids. Because you're aware that they very well could get it, and are watching and paying attention and will get them treated as soon as possible if they do end up with it. I wasn't taken to a psychiatrist until my senior year of high school. And I didn't have my medicine under control as far as a good dosage and having my medicine prescribed all the time (do to doctors leaving the clinic I was going to etc) until well after I was out of high school. And it sucked. So I always tell my SO that we need to watch our kids very closely and take them in for treatment as soon as they start showing signs that they could have it, because I don't want them to have to go as long as I did having to deal with ADHD untreated, because it sucks big time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my experience, it seems like the reason a lot of people don't think ADHD is a big deal is because the symptoms of ADHD are things everybody struggles with sometimes. Everybody has trouble focusing from time to time, etc. And it's just so hard for others to grasp what it actually feels like to have ADHD without actually having it. They don't understand the magnitude, that these issues are way worse, to the point where we can't function sufficiently, and isn't just from time to time, but is literally constantly, all the time. Just for whatever reason, people without the disorder just don't seem to be able to grasp how incredibly terrible and debilitating it is to suffer from the disorder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you mean to ask if you should be taking ANTIDEPRESSANTS. From me personally, it sounds like an antidepressant might help you out a lot. But what I would defintely recommend is talking to your doctor. Your doctor is going to be a lot more help than any of us here. Talking to your doctor doesn't automatically mean that your depressed and need more medication. Talk to your doctor, tell him what you just told us, and he will work with you, help you figure out what's going on, and then decide the best course of action. That's what the doctor is there for, to help figure out what the best course of action is to help you with the things you're struggling with. Hope you get it all figured out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take 20mg of Celexa along with my adderall. And I don't take days off either. I take my Celexa at night and it does make me drowsy. I take it right before I go to bed. For me, the drowsiness never extends into the next day. They don't effect each other at all. It's been a great combination for me and I like it a lot. I've had no issues with taking Celexa at night and adderall the next morning. I would test it out, and if you have any issues, talk to your doctor immediately to get on something else. Hope it works out for you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Kershaw was also selected as an all star even though they knew before hand that he won't play. So yes, he's still considered an all star. If memory serves me correctly, last year (? Some year) Yadi was voted as the all star starter but couldn't play. But his streak of 7 straight all star games continued. Side note: I think it's cool that Diaz was the one selected considering Terry Collins wasn't required to replace him with a Cardinals player. He could've picked anybody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just make sure to take mine early enough in the day that it's gone even before I try to go to sleep. That way, I never have any sleep problems. You might just be taking your medicine too late in the day. If not, talk to your doctor and they can help you with your sleep, whether it be switching you to something else or recommended something else to take, like melatonin or diphenhydramine. But first I would try taking it earlier in the day, and if you still can't sleep, talk to your doctor about what you can do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe this is correct, based on my understanding. Outer Darkness is for those who have seen God or an Angel or something like that, basically have been a witness to his exist, and still choose to deny the holy ghost. And I believe, if I remember correctly, that at one point, a prophet Said that the amount of knowledge it would take to to be sent to outer darkness when you deny the holy ghost is so much and so large that it's impossible for anyone to ever commit the sin of denying the holy ghost that gets you sent to outer darkness. So for is apostates, we get the lowest level of glory. Which I hear isn't that bad. I mean it's still glory. ;) So it's a win-win for us! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of these things are based on something that actually exists. Like I said, you cannot imagine something brand new, and completely foreign. Your brain can not do that. It draws from it's own real life experiences. No matter what example you suggest, the base of where the idea comes from, the root of it, is always rooted in something that actually exists and is real. Picasso never saw a cartoony eye, you're right, but Picasso had seen an eye before. His cartoony eye is a real eye with slightly altered characteristics. It's not some brand new, non existent, from outer space thing he drew up. It's rooted in a real, actual thing that exists, an eye. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can change certain characteristics, like eye color and so on, or even mix together 2 faces, etc, but you cannot create a new face out of nowhere, dreaming or not. You don't realize it, because you don't remember the face, but dreams and even imagination when not dreaming, are constrained by our own individual experiences. You feel like you're coming up with something completely new, because you don't consciously remember the specific face, or whatever it may be, but the face is always based on and rooted in one you have seen before. James Cameron's creatures were based on humans with altered characteristics. He didn't create some brand new, completely foreign idea. His imagination changed characteristics, like skin tone, of humans. He drew from his personal experiences. Same with Picasso. His imagination changed the position of an eye on the face. But it was not a brand new, never before seen, non existent face. It was based in reality from his own experiences. He just changed characteristics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, absolutely. I felt the same way. ADHD has taken a serious toll on me. I absolutely hated myself and felt like I had to constantly alter myself because of my ADHD, which led to a lot of self medicating with various things before I got my ADHD consistently under solid control. But still at the time, if you would have asked if I was depressed, I would have said no, that I wasn't. But at the same time I got my ADHD consistently under solid control, I was diagnosed with depression along with ADHD and put on Celexa as well as my ADHD medicine, and it completely saved my life. It totally turned me around and noticeably changed my life immensely. It's like I'm a whole new person. Partly because my ADHD is under control, but also because the difference the Celexa alone made is absolutely incredible. You may have depression as well. It's not uncommon. Talk to your doctor. Tell him how you feel, what you just told us. Your doctor can help fix this for you, whether it be depression or not, talk to your doctor. He will help you. </TEXT>
