	<TEXT> Zelda is my favorite game series of all time.  I had divorced parents when I was a kid and mostly ended up at my grandmother's house which was in a nasty neighborhood.  Because of this I stayed inside and played Ocarina of Time quite a bit.  It was a wonderful adventure that didnt hold my hand, and I didn't have the internet to assist me.  

Fast forward to now.  Im 25 and I just got out of the army a year ago and bought my first house for my wife and kids with the money I saved up while I was enlisted.  I try my hardest to get my hands on zelda stuff, because its a bedtime story I tell my daughter, and will eventually tell my son.  I show the stuff I have to my daughter and thr games too and ive even kinda admittedly lied and told her link can be a girl if you want him to be (she wants to be link) I have the botw zelda and bow link amiibos and she loves to just look at them and play gently with them. (shes not gentle with any other toys.) 

Tomorrow im getting a tattoo of the sheikah symbol on my arm because she loves the idea that the princess is the sacred ninja thats supposed to be her own protector.  I think it far surpasses all of Disney's traditional ideas of what a princess is, and I've added a sort of nerd shrine in my home where I keep everything I collect to give my kids later when they're grown so they can have the same existence with their children.  

I hope I win! she loves these little things and they're impossible to get now! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> THIS.  Dude all I wanted was what all the other zelda games had, where you get to a new area and that area's rave has a serious problem with the local dungeon/colossal monster terrorizing everything.  Or even just character development ya know?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you, they placed emphasis on these characters, only for them to be one offs/throw aways.  I would've really liked to have seen more story in each area surrounding these characters </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like I said, my idea was just a loose vague idea and nothing wouldn't be subject to change.  Honestly my idea was just that Ganondorf would be tricking them by kidnapping royalty secretly and trapping them in opposing side's dungeons behind boss monsters and making it look like there's a reason to fight.  Also Nintendo could write it however they wanted to make it work ya know im just saying I think a war where the hero has to play both sides to ultimately unite them against their true enemy is an excellent story that could be told in the Zelda Multiverse </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, I think telling Ganondorfs story would make for a great addition to some juicy plot  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Botw in particular I agree, but I also see the challenge of how to explain, blood moon, guardians, all the monsters, etc. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Botw] How can the Zelda Team improve story in the future? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> One of the chief complaints about BotW is that some find it to fall a little flat in the story department.  Delivery was unique and plot was pretty light, but overall most of what I've seen is that now that Nintendo has the mechanics to a pretty ironclad point, the next game really needs to improve upon story telling. 

I personally think that voice acting needs to be continued and advanced to the degree that bethesda delivers, but I think Nintendo could probably do even better.  

Story wise, my own personal idea is that of a civil war.  I think it'd be really cool to enter hyrule in the middle of a civil war where Ganondorf is playing both sides against each other.  Maybe Zora and Rito could be warring against Gerudo and Goron, with Hylians caught in the middle or split between both sides.  Either way I feel like the dungeons could all revolve around stolen goods, angry monsters, and mossing/kidnapped royalty that ganondorf (fully voiced) has convinced the given faction to be the fault of the opposing side.  Link could complete the dungeons and get to the bottom of things and throughout the story bring Hyrule back together to form a unified force against Ganondorf and his legion of loyal followers.  

I think it'd be nice for Zelda to be a prominent figure or for Nintendo to wow everyone with an Ocarina of time style twist by letting the player choose their gender or possibly even flip the formula on its head and allow the player to BE a more active princess zelda.  

Id also like to see the modern Nintendo take on alternate endings. 

What are your ideas for future stories/improvements to story? </TEXT>
