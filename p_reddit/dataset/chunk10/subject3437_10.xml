	<TEXT> So far, I feel that playing a geokineticist is my biggest offense to date.

"What do you mean you have DR 7/Adamantine?"

"What do you mean you have a climb speed on stone?"

"What do you mean you have about 50% more hp than the party?"

"What do you mean you do 1.5 * 4d6+15 damage?" 

"What do you mean you do that from 120' away as long as you don't move?"

"What do you mean you have 25% resistance to critical hits and sneak attacks?"

"How many dice are you rolling for that crit??"

I wish the crit range wasn't so awful, but it makes it all the sweeter when a 20 comes up, and with a +14 to hit I can confirm pretty easily unless it was nearly impossible already.

I already have a ring of sustenance, and I'm planning to grab a iridescent spindle ioun stone and a wayfinder to remove the need to breathe, meaning that with 1 round of notice I can live the rest of my life as a potato once I grab Earth Glide at L10 and Tremor Sense at L12. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd have to be careful with that if you're dumping Wisdom. If it hits 0, you're unconscious, and that's a whopping -8 to Wisdom right there between all four limbs, -10 if you boost your Dexterity with the mutagen. </TEXT>
