I may only be ten, but Im old enough to know when something isnt right.

And things arent right.

I thought about the eyes all night last night, which was a long night. I hardly slept at all, because I kept hearing someone walking around in the woods outside my house. 

I snuck out early this morning just after sunrise. I hoped that I would look and be unable to find any footprints, which would mean I was just imagining things. 

There were a lot of footprints.

They came from out of the woods. I could follow them all around the house. They stopped at every window, including my parents, like whoever it was was looking into each one.  Then they led back into the woods. 

I decided to see where they went, so I followed them. 

Pepperoni came with me, since he pretty much follows me everywhere now. I was glad to have him there, but you could tell that he wasnt coming to play around. He was very serious. 

The footprints went back to where we had found the eye box yesterday. I could tell that the person was looking for them, because there were a bunch of prints all around it, like they just kept walking around looking for something.

The tracks eventually went farther into the trees, but I couldnt follow them anymore, because I had to come back and get ready for school.

Boy, was Pepperoni unhappy to see me go. He just kept whining and tugging so much that Mom had to put a leash on him so that I could get out the door. 

I got a ride to school with Aiden and his dad, but I told them that I didnt need a ride home that day, because I needed to do something after school. His dad thought that was a little strange, because he always takes us home, but I convinced him that my parents said it was okay.

That was a lie, and I know Im not supposed to lie, but I havent told my parents at all. I want to keep them safe.

So after school I went to the police station and asked to talk to Captain Grinnick. Our city is pretty small, and only a few cops work there, so I was able to go into his office and speak with him. 

He smiled in that way adults smile when theyre trying to relate to kids, but arent really good at it because they dont take us seriously.

Hi Derek, he said, and dropped his fake smile. I always want to make sure you kids are as safe as can be. He turned around and started looking through his paperwork. But Im afraid were going to have to be quick about this, Im very busy. A man named Gordon disappeared yesterday, and its the first missing persons case this town has had in twenty years. Theres a lot to do here! He threw on his fake smile again and stared right through me. 

I realized that whoever dug the hole must have brought the eyes in from far away. Because there were so, so many eyes. We would probably notice that many blind or dead people in our small town.

Captain Grinnick, I was playing in the woods behind my house, with my friend Aiden, and Pepperoni, hes my dog, and, well, we found some eyes. Like a whole box of them. Buried in the ground. I havent told anyone, because I though the person who got those eyes probably hurt the people they came from, and if they knew I had them, they might come looking for me or my family to hurt us, too.

His expression got real dark, and he got up to close the door to his office. When he sat back down, he was done pretending to smile.

I see, Derek. So you havent told anybody?

No, I said, just me and Derek and Pepperoni know. I know that it was kind of a lie, because I posted it here online, but I didnt really actually TELL any of you, like with my mouth, did I?

I see, he said again, now youre a smart boy, Derek. To want to keep your family safe like that. Do you want them to stay safe? he asked, and waited for an answer.

Of course, Captain Grinnick, more than anything, I said.

Well then. Youd be wise NOT to tell anyone. This is police business. Lets keep this between JUST you and me. Do you understand?

Yes, I said, even though I didnt, because Im old enough to know that you sometimes tell grownups that you agree with them, even if you dont.

Good, Devin, good, he said, and I knew not to tell him that he got my name wrong. Now. The box of do you have the hmmmm?

I pulled the box of eyes out of my backpack and put it on his desk. He suddenly looked like he was going to puke right then and there.

Good! Good. Now run along, Devin, and remember! here he looked straight at me, and I remember thinking that he was staring so hard that his eyes seemed unnaturally blue, dont tell anyone!

So I walked home after that, and didnt tell anyone.

But after I went to bed, I heard things outside again. 

This time I decided to be brave, because I knew that something was wrong, and was going to get worse. So I grabbed a flashlight and Pepperonis leash, and we went outside. 

Whoever had been making noise was quiet by the time we made it out there. Its scary out there at night. It was super quiet, and I couldnt figure out why there werent more animals making more noise. At first I had been worried that Pepperoni would make a racket, but he didnt bark at all. He did pull, though.

Right to the eye-hole. 

I could tell right away that something was there, something that shouldnt be. But it was hard to tell what it was until we were right next to it.

When I was standing over the thing, I shined my flashlight right down. I was so scared of what I saw that I couldnt move, and I had to keep looking down at it. Im still shaking.

It was Captain Grinnick, and he was dead. I didnt recognize him at first, because it turns out that people look very different when theyre dead. The thing that was most different about Captain Grinnick is that his eyes were gone. There was so much blood streaking down his face, it looked like he had been crying blood. His mouth was open like he was screaming, so it looked like he was in the middle of a temper tantrum. But I could tell he was dead without touching him.

I felt dizzy, and then my feet slipped. I realized later that I had been standing in a lot of blood, and it was very slick. When I landed, my cheek rested again the Captains face. It made me feel sick, because his skin was so cold, like metal.

I got up again quickly, but made sure not to scream, because I knew that there might be someone out there looking to get me.

I noticed that a piece of paper was stuck to my hand by a few drops of blood. I also noticed that it would be a good idea to run home as fast as I could.

Pepperoni wanted to run faster, but every time he got a little bit ahead of me, he would stop and whimper at me to catch up. Which is good, because if he got lost in the forest, I would be stuck trying to find him, but it would be super scary because theres dead bodies with no eyes out there. And boxes of eyes with no bodies. 

So I got home and showered. When I got dressed again, I noticed the piece of paper had fallen by my clothes. So I picked it up and read it.

The note said His eyeballs arent the only balls he lost tonight. Thats it.

Im pretty sure I know what that means, because I think it means the same thing to adults that it does to kids.

Now I dont know what to do.

	<TEXT> Hi! My name is Derek. Im ten years old, and I wanted to write about something that happened to me. Because I dont know where else to go.

My friend Aiden and I like to go hiking in the woods behind my house. Theyre really great! A lot of kids talk about pretend forts and stuff that they have, but we have a real one. Its a house that my dad and I built out of plywood, not too far from my back porch. So Aiden and I can actually play in a real fort or clubhouse, or whatever game were playing that day. 

But this isnt about the clubhouse. Its about what happened earlier today. 

Aiden and I like to go exploring in the woods. Its real far away from stuff, so we never see anyone else there. We usually take my dog, Pepperoni, who is pretty much the best dog ever. Hes a golden retriever, and hes three, and hes tons of fun.

Anyways, the woods are big enough so that we can always go exploring some place new, and Pepperoni is always excited to check things out. 

We had just gotten back from a long walk earlier today, and were nearly back to the fort. But we were still in a place that was completely covered by trees. Thats when Pepperoni suddenly got really excited and ran to a spot on the ground. Now this isnt unusual, because hes a pretty energetic dog, but I mean he was like REALLY excited. Like way more than usual. 

He started digging really excitedly, and had gotten a pretty decent-sized hole going by the time that Aiden and I had caught up to him. 

It wasnt long before he found the box. It was about ten inches across, and eight inches long, and six inches deep (were learning about volume in Mrs. Huntingtons class). 

I reached into the dirt and pulled it out. I walked into a gap in the trees so I could see it better in the sun. Aiden walked next to me, but Pepperoni nearly knocked me over, he was getting so excited.

It had a pretty simple latch, so I opened it as soon as we were in the light. I looked inside.

There were eyes. I dont mean fake ones, I mean real human eyeballs, about twenty of them. I could tell that they were real. They had blood. I saw something in the back of each them, and I Googled it, and its called the optic nerve. Some still have eyelids attached. Most do not. 

Its kind of hard to explain, but we can tell theyre fresh. Like, youd be able to tell if they were old. They were not rotten at all.

You can tell that the optic nerves were cut with scissors.

I had to yell a Pepperoni to stop jumping up and down, because I was afraid that he was going to knock them all over the place. I dont usually yell at him, but I think he could tell that I was serious, because he stopped jumping.

What do we do? I asked Aiden. He looked afraid.

I dont know, he said real quiet. Which is a big deal, because Aidens usually not quiet. But somebody did not want these to be found, Im pretty sure. This is bad, Derek. Pretty fricking bad.

Usually were not supposed to swear, but this was an unusual circumstance. 

Im afraid to tell my mom and dad, because if someone is going to hurt the person who has these, then I want to keep my parents safe. I told this to Aiden, and he said it was probably a good idea to keep it safe. Which is strange because Aiden usually doesnt keep any secrets, because he cant keep his mouth shut. 

I think Pepperoni knows somethings up too, because now he wont leave my side. Like hes protecting me.

I told my parents that I was going to bed a little while ago, so Im writing this in secret with the lights off in my room. Im ten years old, Im hiding a box of eyes, and I dont know what to do. 

And I think things are about to get worse, because Im pretty sure Ive been hearing someone walking around the woods outside my house for the past twenty minutes.

We all have moments in our lives when passion gives way to practicality. 

Remember that next time youre wondering why the history books are littered with such monsters.

I found and lost my cousin in a matter of minutes, and had inadvertently caused her untimely death.

Her last moments on this earth were not pleasant. 

Ill have the rest of my life to reflect on the implications of this reality. Though that may very well be a short sentence.

For the moment, I need to focus on the practical.

My tears were real, and the blood was as well. But I felt something bigger take over in the moment, so I went with it.

I crawled to Gordon, who was at this point getting pretty ripe. Ignoring the smell, I reached deep in to his gaping abdominal cavity and squeezed.

I then crawled over to where Lucys still-warm body lay prone. I stared into her half-opened eyes and started to gasp and sob. 

Three quick thrusts to the chest represented passionate attempts at suicide.

Or so it would seem from a grainy VHS camera.

I screamed, rolled, and convulsed. The entrails that I had taken from Gordon now lay on top of my torso.

I gurgled, moaned, and then was still.

I had a very long time to think.

Fighting against my mother was out of the question. Even if I could escape the cage, she would have planned five steps ahead. The camera was outside the chain-link barrier, far beyond my grasp. If damaging it were possible, that would do nothing more than put the viewer on high alert that something was wrong.

This cage was designed to display the scene of my horrible demise. So thats exactly what I engineered. The only way that the game would end is if the viewer (viewers?) saw exactly what they expected to see. There was no other outcome. 

Lying there, I knew that my actions would be questioned. So I steeled myself for the long haul.

I shouldnt have fallen so close to Gordon. It wasnt just the smell, either. The flies were getting pretty active, too. Its amazing what you miss when youre in high-intensity mode; the exact opposite is true as the hours pass and youre not able to move at all.

The flies checked me out, of course. It was just annoying at first. Then they decided to explore my ears. One made it pretty far up my nose. And I should have anticipated that a certain lack of access to hygiene products would make them go crazy for my bare ass. 

Seriously, I could feel every single leg of every single fly back there. I really, really, really wanted to move.

But I did not. It had to have been at least twelve hours, because I pissed myself (subtly) three times, and was very dehydrated by the end.

Though I did not move. Not one goddamn inch. 

Finally (finally, finally) the door to the cage creaked open.

A figure stalked toward me. I deduced that they would check my pulse first, to see if I was playing possum. I was right.

A hand turned me over and reached for my neck. I moved quickly enough to make little Lucy proud. I thrust the butt of the knife into the face of my attacker and heard the crack of a broken nose, followed by the clatter of a weapon to the ground.  

I turned, sprinted, and slipped in Gordons guts.

I still had the wherewithal to keep the knife pointed away from my face when I landed. It hurt like hell, though, and I could felt my chin split. 

A hand wrapped around my ankle.

But I didnt come this far to let it all slip away.

I kicked  hard  and the scream I heard sounded like the pain that would come from someone re-breaking their nose.

This time I made it out of the cage, wheeled around, and closed the door. 

My heart sank as I looked down at my Aunt Myra, sobbing and bleeding. She looked so helpless in the cage, and my softer instincts told me to rush to my family and help her.

I locked the door and turned away. 

There was only one door in the room, and I walked through it now. 

Mom was there, of course. You can always count on mom. 

There are things you dont understand, she said with an odd mixture of detachment and pity. I loved Myra, but I managed to make her go into the cave first. Theres always a way, Phil. Dont fight it. Just accept whats going to happen now.

I looked directly at her as I spoke. Youre right, there are things you dont understand. But I hope you try.

I tossed the knife gently down in front of her. It landed at her feet. I started to cry.

You will always  *always* be my mom, and nothing can ever change that. I walked slowly towards her, with tenderness and care. Im hurt. Im broken. I need my mom now more than ever. I was openly sobbing. I need you to get me through this.

Her hard outer shell now began to give way to clear shock. I knew then, beyond any doubt, that she had intended to kill me then and there.

I wrapped her in a bear hug, and she froze, unsure of what to do. She had truly believed that there was no hope for good, and all that was left would be the end of what we had. She had no idea how to deal with the concept of hope and forgiveness, and it paralyzed her.

Her hesitation was all I needed to stab her hand with the shattered rib I had pulled from Gordons chest and hidden in my palm. I couldnt see it, but I heard the pistol I knew she had been hiding fall to the grown with a metallic thud. She was quick, but I was quicker, and I got the gun. 

I knew that she would never go into the cage alive, but with the gun out of her possession, it was down to brute strength. Even in my emaciated state, I had enough rage to overcompensate.

She went into the cage with Myra.

Myra has the knife but is injured badly. She cant get close enough to my mom to use it without a risk of having it taken. 

My moms trying to hide her injured hand. She knows that it will be revealed if she makes the first move. 

Both of them know the stakes. The game is afoot. And with the camera rolling, I have a front-row seat.

I am my mothers son.
