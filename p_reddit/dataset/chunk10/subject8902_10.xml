The Trump team requested:

"Can you send us some pictures of the military vehicles we could add to the parade?" 

They were definitely asking about it. And if you read full context of the email, the author says

...before we provide pictures which might be considered binding."

Had they responded by providing the photos they would have found themselves "bound" by them. That's a denied request.
