[*Fumbling is heard. A male voice speaks. Research has identified the speaker as MARTIN HENDERS. Caucasian male. Date of Birth: 09/29/1968. Date of Death: 02/17/2011*]

**MARTIN:** All right, this is... February 17th, 2011. Daily report: people coming and going. The usual. I could hear the couple in 31 yelling again. And then, of course, the make-up period comes around, when the yelling becomes a whole different sound, if you know what I mean.

[*Shuffling of papers is heard.*]

**MARTIN**: Mail came. More credit offers for that pile... two more magazines for that pile, which is getting big... and the newspaper, which Ill file away as soon as Im done reading it. Im probably going to move the newspapers into the kitchen. The stacks are too big. Groceries came late, again, which Im fine with-- Actually, there was something, this morning. There was an ambulance outside, at like five in the morning, and they bought someone down from the fourth floor. And he was yelling. Like, *really* yelling. So... maybe just a lunatic. No shortage of those. But thats it.

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins.*]

**MARTIN:** This is... February 17th, again. This is the first time Ive done two reports the same day in a long time, but Ive got a good reason. That lunatic from this morning? Looks like he wasnt the only one. I can hear people walking around upstairs. You can hear that, right?

[*Footsteps and creaking floorboards can be heard. Multiple sources. Muffled voices are heard, unintelligible.*]

**MARTIN:** The police are up there, because the guy in 57, apparently... *attacked*? One of his neighbors. And theyre trying to get him out of his apartment right now, but he just keeps... *yelling* at em. But not like hes arguing with them. He keeps yelling the *same thing*, over, and over, and over. The same words. Like its the only thing he can think of, you know?

[*The footsteps grow louder.*]

**MARTIN:** There we go, theyre bringing him down. You can hear them on the stairs. They got him quiet.

[*The sound of rain against glass can be heard. Researcher believes Martin has moved to the window.*]

**MARTIN:** Theyre bringing him out; I can see them. The guy looks like a mess. He looks... he almost looks sad. Except hes yelling again. Hes trying to get the cops to understand him, and... its not working, it looks like. They dont really know what to make of him. And hes getting angry. Theyre-- Holy... Theyre drawing their g--

[*Four gunshots. Martin is silent. Only the rain can be heard.*]

**MARTIN:** Jesus They-- They shot him. He... He grabbed one of the cops guns, and he tried to use it on them, and they... shot him down. Jesus. What the hell was wrong with him?

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins again. Shuffling.*]

**MARTIN:** This is still February 17th, and this is where it gets interesting. The police are going around to every apartment, and theyre putting a notice on every single door. And on the walls. And probably in the elevator and the lobby, too. But whats strange to me, is that they didnt knock on the door to deliver it in person. Youd think if it was an important issue, if it was a safety issue or something, theyd go door-to-door and tell everyone, right? Theyd explain it. But theyre not saying a word. Theyre just posting this on all the doors. *Silently*. And I asked them. When they came to mine, I opened it, and I asked them whats going on. They didnt say anything. They didnt even want to look at me. They were *scared*.

[*Rustling paper.*]

**MARTIN:** And now Im not sure what to think, because listen to this. This is the notice theyre putting up. This building is now under quarantine. Two cases have been reported, but more are likely to follow. In each case, the progression is the same. First, the subject will become confused and disoriented. Next, the subject will attempt to communicate with others. Finally, when the subject is unable to communicate, he/she will become angry and often violent. The subject must be silenced before he/she can...

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** ...before he/she can *successfully communicate* with others. Avoid all interaction and communication. No talking. No speech. No gestures. No written communication. No sign language. Any communication of any kind in any amount is dangerous. The building will be sealed until the virus is contained. What virus? What does a virus have to do with... talking?

[*Uneven footsteps are heard, as if one foot is dragging behind. The footsteps grow louder.*]

**MARTIN:** Hello?

[*The footsteps stop.*]

[*The footsteps continue, growing quieter, before fading away.*]

**MARTIN:** What the hell is going on? How is this a virus? This is... Ive gotta have something about this. Im... Im checking the stacks. Theres got to be some reference to this, and if there is, then, you know, Ive got it. Thats, uh... Thats what I do. I collect. So Im gonna research. Anything I find, Ill report back. 

[*Shuffling. The recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins. Martin returns, with energy in his voice.*]

**MARTIN:** This is *not* the first time this has happened. Im telling you, I am the best hoarder in the world. Ive got all the newspapers, all categorized and sorted out, and I can go back year by year, and search by topic. And I did. I looked for quarantines. And outbreaks. And a lot of it is, you know, bird flu, or whatever the health scare of the week is. But, every now and then, theres a quarantine like this one, *where they dont say what the cause is*. But there are some details that keep showing up, in every case. It always starts with a domestic dispute, or an argument, or a fight between neighbors or family members. One person turns violent... and then more people turn violent. Its always someone trying to communicate, and they *cant*. And they *snap*. And wherever they are, if theyre in an apartment building, or an office building, or anything -- the whole place goes to hell. So you know what? Maybe I had the right idea, staying inside here. Your, your lovable recluse is sitting in the right spot, you know?

[*Rustling of papers.*]

**MARTIN:** But then look at the dates for these stories. These quarantines. One in 1971, another in 1979, 1989, 1995, 1997, 1998. *And then they stop*. And thats the weirdest thing about it. Just as they were starting to get more common, the whole pattern just stops. So... I gotta go further. I gotta look online for this one, cause... this is nothing Ive seen. And Ive seen a lot. So, Im gonna keep looking; Ill be back. 

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins.*]

**MARTIN:** All right, this took some digging. The first thing I looked for was talking virus. And what I found was that these things didnt end in the 90s. Two incidents like this in 2004, three in 2006, three in 2007... these things are getting more common. These incidents. And youd think that would mean more people talking about it online, right? But **nobodys** talking about it. Anywhere. Anytime they do talk about it, the posts are deleted, or the whole websites gone; every other page is a 404. Which means: *someone doesnt want people talking about this*. They dont want anyone talking about it, because talking about it is dangerous. Like it said on the note. Avoid communication. You cant even talk about it, or youre in danger. The *talking* virus.

[*Fumbling of the recorder. Martin speaks clearly and directly.*]

**MARTIN:** Its a *linguistic virus*. A virus that spreads through language. Its attached to a word, and once you say the word, or you hear it, or you even think it -- the virus gets ahold of you. It scrambles your brain, and your mind tries to get help, it tries to communicate the problem to other people, to help you - but you cant communicate anymore. Its-- I know this, Ive seen this before...

[*Rustling of papers. Researcher believes Martin is searching through personal materials, likely notes and medical journals.*]

**MARTIN:** Ive seen it, but not like this... There. This is it. Listen. Its called expressive aphasia: you cant produce language anymore, you cant form a sentence. I saw aphasia cases during my residency; its caused by a stroke, or by brain trauma -- not a virus. This is expressive aphasia in virus form, infecting the host through language, attached to a single word. And that kind of thing **doesnt exist**. Or it *shouldnt* exist.

[*Rustling of papers.]

**MARTIN:** It infects, it kills your brain, it means you cant communicate anymore, but your body is trying so hard to. And everything just boils over. You lash out. You attack other people for not understanding you. You get frustrated, you get violent. Its a virus that turns you against everyone else, and all it takes is one magic word. Its the same thing as... you, you do that thing where say a word too many times, and it starts to sound weird. Right? It sounds wrong, somehow. There it is. Semantic satiation: A psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener. Thats what this is. This virus thing. Its semantic satiation, *weaponized*. Times ten. And all it takes is the right word; a word that you just heard too many times, and it hits that limit. It takes on a new meaning, and the physiological effect is psychotic expressive aphasia. And all it needs is the right word. The magic word I

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** Ive probably got... every word ever written in this place... That means Ive got the magic word here somewhere, right? I mean, I have to, right? In a newspaper, or in a magazine, or one of the stacks. I dont think Im gonna... do any reading tonight. Or I guess I dont even have to. I dont even have to read it, I just have to hear it. I just have to think it. So then what's the magic word? You can't even figure it out; you can't warn people what not to say. You can't tell someone not to think of something. Like, Dont think about ice cream. Whats the first thing you think of? Ice cream. How do to stop yourself from *thinking*?

[*A loud noise is heard; violent knocking and kicking at Martins door.*]

**MARTIN:** Go away! Im not talking to you!

[*Muffled, garbled yelling can be heard, unintelligible. Researcher describes the sound as throaty and visceral, implying speaker has suffered massive facial injury. Speaker will be designated as INTRUDER.*]

**MARTIN:** Hold on, Im checking this out. The doors staying closed, thats for sure, but I gotta get a peek at this.

[*Footsteps, as Martin approaches the door. The Intruders knocking grows louder.*]

**MARTIN:** Jesus Christ... His... jaw is just... *hanging there*.

[*The Intruder yells. The Intruders perceived injury renders his speech indecipherable, but Researcher does note that the Intruder appears to be yelling the same phrase in repetition. *]

[*The Intruder rattles the door.*]

**MARTIN:** Im not talking to you! I dont care what you want. 

[*The Intruder rattles the door harder.*]

[*Martins footsteps are heard, followed by the sound of a drawer opening.*]

**MARTIN:** I said Im not talking to you. You dont step away from my door, Im gonna shoot you right through it.

[*A click is heard. Researcher identifies the sound as the hammer of a small revolver.*]

[*The Intruder delivers one final kick, before leaving Martins door. The same uneasy footsteps are heard  one foot dragging.*]

**MARTIN:** Im staying inside. If they want me to avoid talking with people, they found the right guy. Whatever this is, Im sitting it out. Until... I dont know. Until something. Ill be here.

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins.*]

**MARTIN:** You can hear that, right? 

[*Muffled thumps and rumbles can be heard.*]

**MARTIN:** Its people fighting. And its hard to make out, because its coming from upstairs... *and* its coming from downstairs. People are tearing each other apart. 

[*Rain against glass is again heard, as Martin approaches the window.*]

**MARTIN:** There are a lot more people outside. A lot of them have guns, in case anyone comes out. Theyre not gonna give anyone a chance: if anyone goes out and just yells one word... its all over.

[*Loud thumps in the background.*]

**MARTIN:** The people running it-- Its not the police anymore. Its not even the FBI, or the CDC. Its something Ive never heard of; its these people called the Daumont Group. They just swept in and took control. They keep looking at the building. They keep pointing to the corners of the building. Trying to figure out a plan, I guess. So thats, um... Thats it for today. Nothings gonna change here. 

[*Recording ends.*]

***

[*Recording begins. Martins voice is noticeably solemn.*]

**MARTIN:** I know... I know I said that was the last one for the day, but... Im pretty sure thisll be the last one. Ever.

[*Martin sighs.*]

**MARTIN:** The Daumont Group, the people in charge, in all their wisdom: they got on the megaphone, and they tried to address the whole building. And they explained it. How they regretted that it came to this, how they wish that there was another option... but that the decision had been made, and the only way to keep everyone else safe, is to take the building down. With everyone inside it. 

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** And they said this, they said it loud enough for the whole building to hear it... and no one cried. No one reacted to it, inside the building. Nobody leaned their head out the window, and asked them for help, or asked them to find a different option. No one... No one did anything. They just kept killing each other. 

[*Muffled thuds are heard in the background*]

**MARTIN:** So thats it. They went around, they planted charges on the ground floor. And now, I can see out the window, everyones moving back, down the street. The rains finally stopping... Its a nice night.

[*Martin pauses.*]

**MARTIN:** And thisll be my last recording. And I guess my hope is that they find my tapes, and listen to them, and maybe itll help them figure out what happened here. Maybe theyll find that magic word. I hope they do. Were all in this together. 

[*Pause.*]

**MARTIN:** Together. 

[*Pause. Martins voice grows emotional.*]

**MARTIN:** *Together*. 

[*Pause. Martins voice grows forceful.*]

**MARTIN:** **Together**. Together. Together.

[*In the background, a male voice is heard; amplified, as if speaking through a megaphone. The voice is counting backwards from ten.*]

[*Martin speaks faster, straining.*]

**MARTIN:** Together. *Together*. Together. Togeth

[*An explosion is heard, followed by the roar of a structural collapse.*]

[*The recording ends.*]

**SUMMARY:**

Transcription of MA audio file KM-94. Date of transcription 07/13/2010. Researcher is [NAME WITHHELD].

-------------------------------------

**BEGIN TRANSCRIPTION**

[*The fumbling of a recorder is heard. The sound is muffled and choppy. The quality of the recording suggests an analog tape recorder.*]

[*The sound clears and a male voice is heard. Between 30-50 years old. American. Likely Caucasian. Amplified, as if speaking into a microphone. The male voice will be referred to in this transcription as SPEAKER.*]

**SPEAKER**: ...but few progressed as far, or caused as much damage, as this particular case. By March 21st, 1991, Robert Halpern, an electronics engineer from Richmond, Virginia, was fully convinced that his wife  was *not* his wife. Robert believed his wife Catherine was an impostor, identical in every way, but not the woman he married. He believed this Catherine had been sent to spy on him, gain his trust, and destroy him. And he could not be convinced otherwise. Next slide, please.

[*The CLICK of a carousel slide projector advancing.*]

[*A crowd of unknown size can be heard; an uneasy murmur.*]

**SPEAKER**: As you can see, the Halpern incident eventually reached a violent end. And, to fully understand what went wrong, it's necessary we start at the beginning. Next slide, please, let's get that off the screen.

[*The CLICK of a slide projector.*]

**SPEAKER**: Robert Halpern. Forty-three years old; electronics engineer within Bellmore Electronics; born and raised in Richmond, Virginia. No history of mental illness, none in his family [unintelligible]. Paid his taxes on time, enjoyed bowling on the weekends, and put ten percent of every paycheck in a savings account, to finance a vacation to Paris with his wife. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Roberts wife, Catherine Halpern, worked as a paralegal at Hendricks-McKinley in downtown Richmond. Robert and Catherine were married nineteen years, very happily -- *until* Monday, March 11th, 1991 ... when Catherine laughed, while watching television. Robert had heard his wife laugh many times before, and he knew the sound very well; he had even mentioned it in his wedding vows. But to Robert, this particular laugh sounded *different*. And he could not explain why. 

[*The tape recorder fumbles, scrapes against fabric. Researcher believes the recorder is hidden on an individual.*]

**SPEAKER**: [unintelligible] only description that Robert could offer about this strange laugh was that it sounded like ... quote ... "a reproduction". Like someone trying to mimic his wife's laugh, and *almost* succeeding. Catherine noticed her husband staring at her. He smiled and looked away. But his thoughts persisted. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: No matter what, Robert could not move on from that one strange occurrence. The laugh that wasn't *her* laugh. Robert watched Catherine over the next few days, studying her behavior. He paid close attention to how she spoke. The words she used, the gestures she used. How she stood. How she walked. How she held a glass of water. And one by one, to Robert, the cracks began to show. Robert saw what he claimed were tiny changes in Catherine's behavior. Idiosyncrasies he had come to know very well, that were just *slightly* off. Invisible to anyone else, but her loving husband. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: But Robert kept his suspicions to himself until the following week, when Robert joined Catherine for a dinner out with her parents and siblings. A warm, enjoyable family reunion for everyone except Robert, who heard his wife laugh again, and again, over the course of the dinner. The wrong laugh, every time. Until finally, Robert couldn't take it anymore, and asked Catherine a question loud enough for the entire restaurant to hear: *Who are you?*

Catherine, and her family, asked Robert what he meant, and Robert continued: *She's not the Catherine I married. I don't know who she is but she's not my Catherine.* The restaurant went silent, and Robert stormed out. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: The next few days were as uneasy as one would expect. Robert and Catherine fought constantly, with Robert adamant that Catherine was *not* his wife. Finally, on Catherine's pleading, Robert agreed to see a therapist. In that session, Robert described his suspicions, and what he considered his evidence that Catherine had been replaced. The therapist had no success dissuading Robert, but his condition was identified. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Robert was diagnosed with the Capgras delusion, a rare misidentification syndrome in which the subject believes their friends and/or family members have been removed and replaced with identical-looking impostors, or doubles. The Capgras delusion is most often a symptom of paranoid schizophrenia, though in this case it was not. The delusion is also commonly referred to as "Body Snatchers syndrome", after the 1956 movie that popularized it. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: The Capgras delusion was first diagnosed in 1923 by French psychiatrist Joseph Capgras, its namesake, whose patient, an unnamed woman, believed a *double* had taken the place of her husband. And thus the Capgras delusion was born. In the early 1950s, the delusion experienced a resurgence, which I'll return to later, but for now, back to Mr. Halpern. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Even after the therapist's diagnosis, Robert's fears lingered. Robert was convinced he knew better, and ignored the therapist's advice, but Robert was smart enough to act natural, and avoid further unwelcome attention from who he perceived to be the *enemy* he shared a bed with. While pretending his suspicions had been allayed, Robert subtly "tested" his wife  asking questions about their past, their shared knowledge. Looking for inconsistencies. And Catherine, of course, answered every question correctly, but Robert was not satisfied. He grew distant from Catherine. He ate his meals quickly, making little eye contact. He smiled too much, to disguise his growing concerns. And he spent as much time as possible at work  but soon, Robert's suspicions followed him there. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: At Bellmore Electronics, his company for the last seven years, Robert began seeing the same inconsistencies in his coworkers' behavior. As if they, too, were pretending to be someone they weren't. Robert's secretary was not his secretary. His colleagues were not his colleagues. His engineers were not his engineers. Robert's suspicions  his delusion, as his therapist would say  had spread. And it was at that point, that Robert recognized an important question: Why him? Why replace *his* wife, and *his* friends, and *his* coworkers with impostors? Why was he, Robert Halpern, *special*? Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Be it as a means to voice his concerns, address his condition, or simply to find a friend amongst a sea of enemies, Robert again visited the same therapist, who, luckily for us, recorded the conversation. This was the last time Robert would ever agree to visit a therapist, or a medical professional of any kind. It was the last time he trusted them. Roll tape, please. 

[*The Speaker pauses. An audio recording is heard, likely played over the rooms sound system. The tape recorder is unable to pick up any useable audio. Researcher does note that a second male voice can be heard. The voice is unintelligible, but is clearly speaking very fast, and with rising emotional intensity. The audio recording ends and the Speaker returns.*]

**SPEAKER**: Throughout his ordeal, Robert's refuge was his own journals, because while appearances, actions, and voices were untrustworthy, his own handwriting was a reliable constant. Robert knew his handwriting; he could recognize his handwriting, and he could recognize a forgery. Robert's detailed journal entries provide a better view of his mental state than anything else we've collected thus far.

[*The shuffling of papers can be heard.*]

**SPEAKER**: In an entry dated March 18th, 1991, Robert writes this: *Catherine is first replaced. Did she recruit coworkers? Hannah*-- meaning Hannah Gray, his secretary at Bellmore --*Hannah and Catherine are friends. Are they working together? Catherines family was surprised. Made a scene in the restaurant. Safety in numbers. If we hadnt been in public*-- and this part is underlined --*they would have taken me by now*.

Robert then lists a few of his coworkers at Bellmore Electronics: *Thompson, Cushing, Nakamoto, Ramirez, Grechi  replaced. Harrell, Fike, Detmer, DiSalvo  possible. Dineen, Shaw, Hopkins, Starkey  innocent.* 

Now compare that journal entry to one a week later, from March 26th, where Roberts handwriting is noticeably crooked, and he simply writes: *Everyone gone ... Cant trust work ... Cant trust home ... No one left.* Robert Halpern, despite being surrounded by familiar faces, was alone. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: But again, why him? Why was Robert Halpern special? The deeper he looked, the further he went, searching for a reason, the closer he came to a terrifying realization: that he *wasnt* special. That there was no reason why the impostors had chosen him -- they simply had. And, it may have been this revelation that finally pushed Robert over the edge. Because, as Robert realized, being targeted for a *specific* reason  was not as frightening as being targeted for *no* reason. There was no logic to dispute. No way to reason with an attacker, who had no reason for attacking. 

And, faced with an enemy he could not escape, Robert made the ultimate decision. On March 29th, 1991, Robert returned to Bellmore Electronics, took the elevator to the top floor and continued onto the roof, before stepping to the ledge, and addressing the people below. With what was described by witnesses as a calm voice, Robert said only seven words: *You win. Whoever you are, you win.* And with that, Robert stepped off the ledge, and fell seven stories to his death.

[*The Speaker pauses again. Researcher notes that the audience has become very quiet.*]

**SPEAKER**: Robert Halpern died believing his life had been infiltrated by impostors, by enemies, by conspirators. And he was absolutely right. Next slide, please.

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: Earlier, I mentioned that the Capgras delusion experienced a resurgence in the 1950s, but this isn't completely accurate. Because it was in the 1950s that -- for lack of a better description -- *the impostors arrived*. 

The first case appeared in upstate New York in August of 1951: Mary Cathcart, a retired schoolteacher, called the police, claiming her son was no longer her son. Mrs. Cathcarts worries were quickly dismissed - until more calls came in. An appliance salesman in Manhattan claimed his brother had been replaced. A construction worker in Jersey City believed his father was someone else. A postman in Philadelphia delivered mail to a family hed known for twenty years ... but was convinced that they were different people.

The Capgras delusion had ceased being a delusion, and had become the reality. This was not an isolated psychological disorder. Because five cases became ten. Ten became twenty. Twenty became a hundred. A hundred became five hundred. All across the country, unbound by demographic, geography, class, race. 

The impostors were spreading. And with them, rumors regarding their methods, their origins, their objective. What were they here for? What were they planning? Who was in charge? Who were they? *What* were they? Government spies? Guardian angels? Aliens? The public could only speculate. Lock their doors, hug their family, and hope that the person they were hugging wasn't one of them. 

In an effort to contain the panic, the U.S. government produced a series of films titled, The Enemy Next Door, to help its citizens identify and avoid these impostors, which were then affectionately termed, "the Strange Ones". Roll film, please.

[*The Speaker pauses. The rattle of a film projector is heard, followed by music and dialogue, but the audio is, again, unintelligible. Further study has found references to a 1951 Coronet instructional film titled The Enemy Next Door, but no copies of the film survive. Coronets own records were found to be heavily edited by an outside party.*]

**SPEAKER**: The message of this film is clear: suspect everyone, trust no one. 

But then, in early 1953, the panic disappeared overnight. The outbreak of impostors faded away just as quickly as it arrived, and within just a few months, the widespread phenomenon of the impostors was dismissed as Cold War paranoia, the fear of communism, mass hysteria, confirmation bias, etc. 

The incident was forgotten. And any further incidents in which an individual suspected their friends or family members, such as with Robert Halpern, were again diagnosed as a simple case of the Capgras delusion. Even if it **wasn't** a delusion. Next slide, please. 

[*CLICK*]

**SPEAKER**: But despite the sudden disappearance, the impostors never truly went away. They just got better at their jobs. And it was only with the Robert Halpern incident that the curtain was pulled back once again, for just a glimpse  but a glimpse that we cannot **ever** allow again. 

We cannot be so *sloppy*, we cannot be so *reckless* ever again. The Halpern incident was contained by the end, but the next may not be, and we cannot take that chance. Our operations depend on *absolute secrecy*. The Halpern operation fell apart due to something as simple as a *laugh*. We need to cover every detail, no matter how small, and in the future, if a target ever displays similar awareness of the operation, we will eliminate them immediately. Before they start yelling in the streets. Before it's the 1950s all over again. We are not beginners anymore, we are not amateurs. We are **better** than this. 

The Halpern incident is our worst-case scenario. And every one of you is here to ensure it doesn't happen again. You will be trained to infiltrate, to mimic, to perfectly assume a persona. To be *undetectable*. Because we have work to do. So, without further ado: welcome to the show.

[*Applause is heard. No cheers or yells; only what the Researcher would describe as disciplined agreement.*]

[*The size of the applause implies the room is very, very large.*]

[*The fumbling of a tape recorder is heard. The recording ends.*]

Have a question for both you guys; it applies to both writers and directors.

In each of your processes, is there a balance to be struck between authenticity (i.e. honoring your own personal vision) and commerciality (i.e. appealing to the highest number of people)? Can the two overlap, or are they miles apart? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion:

**1) The mix of conversational/colloquial phrasing and antiquated/articulate phrasing. A $10 word inside a $5 line.**

- *"I'm the Dude. So that's what you call me. You know, that or, uh, His Dudeness, or uh, Duder, or El Duderino if you're not into the whole brevity thing."*

- *"Also, Dude, chinaman is not the preferred nomenclature. Asian-American, please."*

- *"He's a peculiar man. You could even say that he has principles. Principles that transcend money or drugs or anything like that."*

- *"Well, ain't this place a geographical oddity. Two weeks from everywhere!"*

**2) Unusual structure. They break up their dialogue with repetition, emphasis, pauses, and topic changes.**

- *"Also, let's not forget -- let's NOT forget, Dude -- that keeping wildlife, an amphibious rodent, for uh, domestic, you know, within the city... that aint legal either."*

- *"Yes, you did. You've been putting it up your whole life, you just didn't know it. You know what date is on this coin? 1958. It's been traveling twenty-two years to get here. And now it's here. And it's either heads or tails. And you have to say. Call it."*

**3) Fatalism and hopelessness. This is more thematic than stylistic, but Coen dialogue likes to make mention of larger things at play -- bigger schemes, cosmic plans, inescapable consequences. This is how the world is, and you can't fight it. The thrashing before futility.**

- *"You know how this is going to turn out, don't you? I think you do. So this is what I'll offer - you bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable, same as you. That's the best deal you're gonna get. I won't tell you you can save yourself, because you can't."*

- *"I gotta tell you, the life of the mind... There's no roadmap for that territory... And exploring it can be painful."*

- *"The Uncertainty Principle. It proves we can't ever really know... what's going on. So it shouldn't bother you. Not being able to figure anything out. Although you will be responsible for this on the mid-term."*

- *"Whatcha got ain't nothin new. This country's hard on people, you can't stop what's coming, it ain't all waiting on you. That's vanity."* </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Somewhere in the middle of a peaceful listless field

Should probably lead with that, rather than the snowflakes. Are the snowflakes important? Or, are they more important than the setting being a peaceful field?

 on top of a snow covered hill

Are we in a field, or on a hill?

 lies down a MAN with a piece of paper in his hand.

Omit the "down"; just "lies a MAN".

Also, what kind of piece of paper? A loose leaf sheet pulled from a notebook? A torn scrap? A pristine white 8x11? 

 Fascinated by the vivid snowflakes ascending, he stretches his arm to grab one. 

I'd reverse the order here and reword it: "He reaches up to grab one of the delicate snowflakes twirling through the air."

 The man is late-twenties, strong and blithe...

This should be right after the first mention of the MAN, a few lines earlier. Introductions/descriptions should follow the character's first appearance.

 It's made of glass and there's nothing on it. 

"There's nothing on it" seems a little awkward. So it's perfectly clear, unblemished glass? You could probably just say that: "...a perfect SPHERE the size of a fist, made of pure, clear glass."

 The sphere stands above his face.

Well... spheres don't stand. And the man is laying down, on his back. So is the sphere hovering right above him? Did it just come into existence above his face, or did it approach him?

 (A quarter beat)

Either it's beat or no beat; no need to bring fractions into this.

 INTO THE DARKNESS

That's a transition, but I'm not sure what's transitioning. Who's going into the darkness?

 The man finds his way to top [sic] of a hill

Wasn't he already at the top of a hill?

 The man finds his way to top of a hill radiating white bright light.

Weren't we going into the darkness? </TEXT>
