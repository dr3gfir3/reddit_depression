	<TEXT> I'm not a massive fan of fps' or rts', gears of war or car games. Sunset Overdrive is pretty good and I didn't really care for Quantum Break. Rare Replay is my jam though.

With PS4 having bloodbourne, infamous, Spider-Man , ratchet and clank and Crash amongst others the variety is there which Microsoft just don't have... yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a PS3 but only played a few games. I did enjoy uncharted but wasn't a big fan of the last of us.

One of the features I love about the xbone is the backwards compatibility I hear there's something similar in psnow? Would you say that's good?

Another feature I love on Xbox is how many games they just give away. 4 a month and other games randomly or for things like Christmas. How does PlayStation compare on that level? Sorry for the questions but console purchases are massive decisions for me :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure thing, 

I guess first off it'll be right to say that I'm talking about the single player mostly. GTA is my favourite game series ever and have completed each entry multiple times (even V)

I feel GTA V loses a lot of the charm that made the other GTA's great. Telling a story with three protagonists isn't new grounds for the series at all. The ps2 games (3,VC and SA mainly) had one big story that was told over the course of 3 (and expanded in an additional two) games. This gave each character a full 20-25 hours to sink and for you get to know them. The HD era of GTA had one full game (GTA IV) and two expansions to tell its story with three characters. While the two expansions were shorter it was still their own campaign. GTA V's characters are all competing for game time and that makes me uninterested in them because I'm not given the amount of time to get to know them like the other games. 

Rockstar are also really good at writing and crafting story's and I felt that V's generic heist/revenge story was too basic. Especially after the plot of GTA IV (which admittedly had these elements but didn't focus on them) and Red Dead (which also had these elements) were so gosh dang good. 

I didn't find the majority of missions in GTA V that interesting either and none of the characters I found particularly engaging.

Multiplayer is a great concept but I think it lacks in execution and turns the whole thing into a grind / pay fest. I had countless hours on GTA IVs multiplayer just messing around. And while yes GTA V is also great with that I feel the game punishes you for doing so. Me and my friends used to go on free mode and just mess with each other but now if we kill each other we lose money. If we blow each other's cars up we have to get them back. It just feels so limiting and unfun.

Regardless of all this I do quite like GTA V but for me it doesn't feel like a GTA game at the heart of it. Don't hesitate to ask questions or give me some counter points. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have memory problems, like really bad and this summer I played through all 3 of the original halo games for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed them and decided to take a break however as I want to move on to Halo 4 I can't remember what happened last time. I don't want to read 3 Wikipedia pages full of plots as that will bore and irritate me. Can anyone put a clear, concise plot review of just Halo 1,2 and 3 that I can refer to while playing?

I think because I played them all in one go the games didn't have time to go into long term memory. Thank you! </TEXT>
