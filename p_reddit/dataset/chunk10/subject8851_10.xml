	<TEXT>  As someone who LITERALLY studied not only Brian De Palma and Hitchcock, but their STRAIGHT UP influences such as Soviet Film Theory with names like Eisenstein, Kuleshov, etc. You give people like De Palma and Hitchcock too much credit they didnt invent everything they use its called artistic theft, or as it is better known colloquially as their influences. 

Obviously every artist is influenced by others, when did I ever argued otherwise? The fact that De Palma is influenced by Hitchcock (And Hitchcock by Murnau and so on) among others doesn't change the fact that he is major visual artist. 

 I recommend looking into editing theory because a lot of your favorite moments in film are responsible thanks to godlike editors.

Are you serious? This is subreddit for filmmakers and you think it's some kind of reveleation when you tell us that there is such people as editors?

 A lot of your favorite images in the frame are there because of the production designer see the career of Richard Sylbert 

Thank you for that information. Nobody else here knew that there is such a people as production designers. You surely showed us your superior knowledge. /s

	<TEXT> Especially because of stuff like HBO and Netflix releasing quality content all the time.

TV is absolute no replacement for cinema. 

Cinema is about atmosphere, TV is about information. Cinema is director's medium, Tv is writer's medium.

TV is ruled by show runners and directors change from episode to episode and every single one of them has to adhere to same visual style that was set on first episodes. There is no freedom for visual stylists like Brian De Palma or Hitchcock.

And that's why I think that movies are vastly superior art form when compared to television. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   What's more, these were mainstream, popular films at the time. Fellini made 8 1/2, one of if not the greatest statement on the creative process and film-making at the height of his career and popularity. There is no 2017 equivalent of Fellini.

This is something that many young people don't seem to understand (Some do, like I'm in my 20s myself, but I read film history). Filmmakers like Fellini and Antonioni were almost household names to the point of being interviewed in Playboy magazine in 1960s. That's pretty big difference to the mainstream recognition of someone like Paolo Sorrentino these days.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You go look at interviews of people like Francis Ford Coppola and they will tell you that financing film like The Godfather would be next to impossible in today's market place. 

You talk all you want about how art is only thing giving meaning to your life, but without someone financing your films, your not gonna make films like The Godfather or Chinatown. Maybe you can DSLR mumblecore films on your bed room without money, but if you have more cinematic ambitions, then the market place matters. And to act like that haven't changed for worse since 1970s is just ridiculous.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I remember when I was a teen in 1997, and reading about LA Confidential, a Warner Bros exec said in an interview that he would be really disappointed and worried for film if they couldn't still make movies like LA Confidential anymore. We're slowly getting there.

We are pretty much already there.

	<TEXT>  You might want to take a closer look at Vera Miles in Liberty Valance. Particularly who she ends up choosing in life and what roles each of those men played in the advancement of civilization in Shinbone.

But is she actually happy with that choice at the end of the film? I mean I'm really not sure, so I'm genuinely asking. I think this film is so much more complex than most of people realize.

 Also, I'm not sure Jimmy Stewart wearing an apron, washing dishes and waiting tables is what would be considered traditional.


Funny thing about Liberty Valance is that this assumedly "unmanly politico" is actually brave to the point of being suicidal while facing Liberty Valance face to face while "real manly traditional western hero" shoots behind the back from the shadows.

But Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is great example to pick, because while on first look it might seem like the most traditional old Hollywood Western, it's actually really progressive film, just like Hawks' Red River, but even more so.

	<TEXT> I'd say even the best stuff of now is better than the best stuff of then.

Bullshit. Sure, there are still great films being made, but on average cinema is nowhere near the quality of what it was for example in 70s.

All the following films were released between years 1970-1980:

The Godfather 1   2 , Days of Heaven, Chinatown, Deer Hunter, Heaven's Gate, The Conversation, Nashville, One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, McCabe   Mrs. Miller, 1900, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, Taxi Driver, Annie Hall, Alien, All The President's Men, Eraserhead, The Elephant Man, Badlands, The Exorcist, Death in Venice, Jaws, Five Easy Pieces, Last Tango in Paris, The Sting, Klute, Close Encounters of Third Kind, Cabaret, All That Jazz, Raging Bull, The Shining, Apocalypse Now, The Ascent, Carrie, Dogday Afternoon, Don't Look Now, The French Connection, Aguirre, Ali: Fear Eats the Soul, Halloween, The Last Picture Show, Paper Moon, The Killing of Chinese Bookie, The Long Goodbye, Mean Streets, Mirror, The Conformist, The Bitter Tears of Petra Von Kant, Picnic at Hanging Rock, Stalker, Suspiria, Texas Chain Saw Massacre, A Woman Under the Influence, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, F for Fake.


Good luck trying to make list from last 10 years that can match that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  if you do it right you can produce images that are on par or better with the old greats.

No, you absolutely can't.

 If you disagree, show me iPhone footage that is "on par or better" than Lawrence of Arabia or The Searchers.

	<TEXT> TV, I dont think has taken that place. Not yet, adds Scorsese, whose Boardwalk Empire was lauded but whose high-priced Vinyl was cancelled after one season. I tried it. I had success to a certain extent. Vinyl we tried but we found that the atmosphere for the type of picture we wanted to make  the nature of the language, the drugs, the sex, depicting the rock n roll world of the 70s  we got a lot of resistance. So I dont know about that freedom. </TEXT>

I think that most of great films have simple premises. I hate this trend that movies should have super complicated plots with twists that "mindfuck" you. For me movies are about atmosphere first and foremost.

So good. I always try talk about it, because it got sadly so little attention when it first came out. But I'm sure it's one of those films that will be seen as classic some day. Maybe it'll take decade or two, but I believe that it'll happen. </TEXT>

John Ford is one of my absolute favourite filmmakers of all-time but I've never watched any of his silent films and I think that it's now time to explore his silent era films.  I've been thinking of watching first 'The Iron Horse', '3 Bad Men' and 'Four Sons'. What do you think about these? And are there any other silent films from Ford that you would recommend? </TEXT>
