	<TEXT> I lost my job and had to rely on unemployment. But that wasn't enough to cover all of my bills. $11,000 is mostly heat, groceries, and occasionally part of rent before I found the job I was looking for.  Part of that money, was also put towards a side start up business while I was looking for a job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely have more time than money- another thing I did was try to learn some DIY skills for when situations arose that I would have otherwise had to call in professionals to help with.  I saved about $2000 on car repairs by learning how to change brakes, rotors and struts myself.   
All the little things add up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bull-headed persistence and making that and all accompanying benefits a priority.  I still went out and saw friends but tried to do everything cheaply.   I never reconciled myself to bare minimum payments.  As soon as money came in that wasn't already spoken for, it went to that and it bought peace of mind knowing I was doing the right thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work for a state agency and have a pension building, but need to be putting more towards retirement.  AND a home downpayment, AND a car savings- the list of things to save for seems endless at times and overwhelming.  My CC was at 13% interest so I wanted to throw everything at that...but now I'm looking at where to turn next.  My honda is just at 142,000 miles so it has a ton of life left in it, if I could be free and clear of a $218/ month car payment I thought I could really make headway in reallocating resources into things that work FOR me, not as liabilities.   That being said, I'm kind of a rookie to finances- looking for that advice.  </TEXT>
