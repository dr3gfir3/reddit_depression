	<TEXT> A Deutsche Afrika Korps (DAK) trooper balanced precariously on two M24 Stielhandgranates (Hand Grenades) somewhere in the North African Desert.

The grenades wouldn't have detonated without the end cap removal and the internal cord being pulled but still a dangerous choice of seating, we think.

	<TEXT> Sapper Reginald A. Stevenson (with the fuse cord around his neck) and L/Cpl. Raymond C. Mace, 2 members of the 2/13 Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers, exhausted after the initial attempt to get ashore and blow wire defences at Lingkas, on the Island of Tarakan which is off the east coast of Borneo. 30th April 1945.

The primary objective for the Allied attack on Tarakan (code-named "Oboe One") was to secure and develop the island's airstrip so that it could be used to provide air cover for subsequent landings in Brunei, Labuan and Balikpapan. The secondary objective for the operation was to secure Tarakan's oilfields and bring them into operation as a source of oil for the Allied forces in the theatre.

The task of clearing the beach obstacles at Lingkas was assigned to the 2/13th Field Company. These defences comprised rows of barbed wire, wooden posts and steel rails which extended 125 yards from the beach. At 11:00 on 30 April, eight parties of engineers went forward in LVTs and landing craft to clear the obstacles. The engineers were supported by the guns on Sadau Island and Allied warships and aircraft. Operating under Japanese fire the engineers cleared all the obstacles obstructing the landing beaches. While heavy casualties had been expected, the 2/13th completed their task without loss.

Military Medal award: 'Lance-Corporal Mace was the non-commissioned officer in command of a demolition team engaged in the breaching of underwater beach obstacles on Tarakan. Despite the intermittent fire of the enemy the working party coolly kept on and completed and sign-posted the gap in thirty five minutes. Lance-Corporal Mace then withdrew his party and went to the rescue of another party who were hampered by the depth of the mud. He attempted to carry a line to secure one of the obstacles to enable the Section to drag themselves to the proposed gap but sank in the mud and had to be dragged back. He then took his L.V.T. to the oil pier and led his party to the beach and attacked the obstacles from the shore side with success. Lance-Corporal Mace's personal endurance, courage and leadership were wholly responsible for the effective completion of the two gaps'.

(Both survived the war)

	<TEXT> I'm watching 10 Cloverfield Lane and can't help but see a comparison to the online novels by Hugh Howey, [Wool](https://www.amazon.com/Wool-Omnibus-Kindle-Motion-Silo-ebook/dp/B0071XO8RA) Has anyone else read those novels and noticed the similarities? As a background(f on the synopsis)

" The world outside has grown unkind, the view of it limited, talk of it forbidden. But there are always those who hope, who dream. These are the dangerous people, the residents who infect others with their optimism. Their punishment is simple. They are given the very thing they profess to want: They are allowed outside."

And that outside is poisonous and will kill them...or will it? </TEXT>
