	<TEXT> I wake up.
 
Get up. Get dressed. Bathroom. Brush teeth, hair. Breathe.

*Breathe.*

Watch myself breathe.

*Get moving. You have to.*

Leave the bathroom, wake up the kid. Smile.

Feel warm. Cozy.

Wife is up. Get hug. Better still.

Make breakfast. Quick eggs. Great with cheese.

Shadows creep in.

*Ignore it. Keep moving. Keep going.*

Clean up. Get my stuff. Say goodbye, have a nice day.

Smile. Hug.

The warm is tainted. The cozy has started to tremble.

In the car, drive to my appointment.

Radio on. DJs wont stop talking. Traffic wont keep moving.

The warm is gone. The world shrinks down. 

*Focus. Drive. Get there. You know a better route.*

Take a shortcut. A quarter mile lead, a fifteen minute gain.

Reach the clinic. Try to park.

Nowhere to go but the farthest spot. 

*Fantastic.*

Leave the safety of the car. My car. Impenetrable. 

*Forget that. Keep moving. Keep going.*

Make it inside. Find my place  easy. Walk in, take a number, take a seat.

Called up. Sign in. Take another seat, somewhere else.

Placed. Put next to someone I dont know.

Someone else put on my other side.

The world shrinks. Cant touch the armrests. Cant get close.

*Its happening again. Dear god, why?*

Im looking around, quietly hoping everything will stop. 

The man next to me smiles. Makes a polite comment, a friendly gesture.

Its nails on a chalkboard, feathers on my spine.

The line moves. I get up, shift over. More space, but its too late. 

*Its started.*

Cant focus. Dont know if Im breathing.

Look up. Line moved again. Shift over.

Nurse says something to me. I didnt catch it, couldnt hear her words.

She repeats it, pointing toward the seat I just left.

Didnt hear again. Sheepishly reseat myself.

*Somethings on me!*

Panic! Help!

A hand. A gentle finger on my shoulder, telling me to come along.

Abashed, I comply. Stand, follow, sit.

Time to give blood. I hate needles.

*Dont look. Dont feel.*

*Breathe. Just breathe.*

Its over. Bandaged up. Nurse hands me a cup, says something.

I missed it. My heart is in my ears. I ask for a repeat. Barely caught it the second time.

Stand, walk, search. Where was I supposed to go?

*Where am I?*

*Whats going on?*

Tightly clutch the cup in my hand. I know what Im supposed to do, but where?

I search, wander, cant find my way.

Lost, losing hope. 

*I just need to find the place to fill the cup!*

A nice man notices me. Offers to help.

I hear him, but cant respond. Im frozen. No pride, just hollow desperation.

He almost leaves. I manage to speak, to ask where to go.

He doesnt know. Points me the way I was walking. Probably not right.

*Im an adult. I should have this handled.*

My heart is thrumming, my palms sweat. Tunnel vision creeps in. 

*Where am I? What am I supposed to do?*

Somehow I manage to find my way. I made it.

No relief. 

*Fill the cup.*

Did it.

*Where do I put it?*

Fear. Anxiety. Judgments levied against me, I know it. I should know what Im supposed to do.

*Cant follow simple directions. What is wrong with me?*

As though I dont know.

*There  someone with a badge. Quick, ask for help!*

Got it. Delivered the cup. Now I get to leave.

Consider stopping for food. 

*NO! GET OUT!*

Gotta get out, gotta leave. Get safe.

People arent safe.

*Just get to the door.*

Shit! Someones behind me!

*No harm. Get to the door.*

Nonono, someones walking toward me.

*Go around!*

Help! More behind me!

*Youre okay! Keep moving! Keep going!*

Outside! Almost there!

Breathe

Cross the road, get to the lot and

Oh, no.

Theres a car. Just parked.

Theyre out to get me!

*That doesnt make sense.*

Neither does parking outside of a space.

*The lot is full.*

No, theyre sinister.

*Walk, dammit. Get to your car.*

Shit. The engine is running.

*So what? Get going.*

*Dont stop walking.*

*Dont stop*

Shit, shit, shit...

*Cut left. Get away. Go around.*

Theyre coming.

*No theyre not.*

Theyre after me.

*No theyre not.*

They want to kill me.

*No they dont.*

*Get to the car.*

At the car.

In the car.

Sit. Breathe.

*Breathe.*

Breathe.

Start the car. Go home.

Every car is out to get me. Every driver wants me off the road.

Almost stop for food. Unknown daemons in the drive thru stop me.

Get home. Get food. Lie down.

Breathe.

*Breathe.*

Shit.

My wife stirs from her nap. A gentle kiss, a loving word.

Brief warmth, lost in empty cold. Cozy feelings wrapped in barbed wire and razor blades.

I check the clock. Not even 10 AM.

*shit.*

	<TEXT> Okay. So, my process is to break it down by sentence, asking *does this need to be said, to say it?* Does it capture the idea? Is it enough? Or unnecessary?

 Just as Luca was about to turn back, he bumped into a large object. 

Good start, but a little unwieldy. I'd suggest he bumped into *something.* This sets it up for your later descriptions. It will be assumed by the reader that the *something* is large, and confirmed later.

His fingers fumbled over a shelf filled with upright rectangular objects varying in size and texture. 

This is a bit more complicated. The idea is simple - books on a shelf - but you're using four words where one will do. For example: *He groped through the dark, fingers fumbling across a shelf full of odd objects.*

This reinforces his lack of vision, and sets up that he is about to encounter something unfamiliar.

Some were shorter or taller, thicker or slimmer, solid or flimsy, but all were neatly organized into a horizontal row extending about an arms length in each direction.

I'm just going to put in my edit here, and then try to explain it.

*Some seemed leathery, some solid as wood, but they were all different heights and widths, and seemed to be lined up as far as he could reach in either direction.*

I threw some tactile language in here, a little sensory information for the reader to relate to. 

 Multiple shelves extended vertically as well, from above Lucas head down to his feet, each containing its own row of the four-sided items. 

*Reaching first upward, then down, he felt out more shelves, each with more of the objects on them.*

This is the same idea, simplified. The concept is similar to saying "We" instead of "Him, her and me." (Oxford comma optional, lol) Here's where I remember my old English teacher's line of questioning: Who did what, how, and where? What you had was Who did what, where, who did what, where, and how. MUCH more complicated, and just hard to read.

He removed one of the strange rectangles from the shelf and examined it with his hands. The object was about two inches thick and had a stiff outer cover partially enveloping a stack of loose sheets of material that were stuck on one end to the inside spine.

I'm combining these two, because I feel the ideas belong together.

*Curious, Luca slid one of the items from the shelf. It was vaguely box-shaped, but open on three sides, with something rough in between. He cautiously pressed on it, discovering that it was made of numerous fibrous sheets, which gave way, flexing open and pushing the solid front cover with it.*

 Luca riffled through the sheets, producing a rustling noise reminiscent of the sounds he made venturing through the dry leaves of the forest.

I like this. I like it a lot. I'm just going tweak it slightly , and make it fit the rest of what I have.

*He rifled through the sheets, producing a rustling noise which reminded him of shuffling through dry leaves in the forest.*

He thumbed through the object until he reached the back cover, next shaking the item to see if anything would fall out. 

He already thumbed through the book above. Well, rifled. Similar enough that this seems redundant to read. What about:
*At a thought, he grabbed the solid covers, held them open, and shook lightly to see if anything fell from between the sheets.*

When nothing emerged, he dropped the object thinking it might break open, but it harmlessly fell to the floor with a dull thud.

Honestly, I'm not sure what this sentence is about. It feels unnecessary to me. I'm going to run past it for now.

Confused, he picked the item back up and sniffed it. Right away a pleasant musty aroma filled his nose. 

*When nothing was forthcoming, he leaned in and gave the object a quick sniff. It was pleasantly musty, like some sort of precious heirloom.*

Going a little off-book here, but adding more ideas, trying to make it relatable. Also, just learned that Reddit doesn't think relatable is a word.

It was like nothing he had ever smelled before, but somehow it was warm and familiar, triggering an overwhelming nostalgic feeling that coursed through his veins and engulfed his soul.

This bit is huge, runs on, and is easily where I have the most trouble here. As I said before, he doesn't know what this object is; all he has is this tactile information he just acquired. You have an extremely significant response written in, one which doesn't fit the scene you've set. Let me take a stab at it...

*It was strange and unfamiliar, but somehow... comforting. It smelled both like storage, and people, as though it had seen many hands before finding its way into his.*

Although unable to identify what he was touching, Luca was positive it was something special.

*Whatever it was, Luca felt sure it was something special.*

Minor wording changes.

Okay, so, every step of the way, you've either seen my point, or been outraged at my careless chopping at your work. Either way, let's take a look at it all together:

 Just as Luca was about to turn back, he bumped into something. He groped through the dark, fingers fumbling across a shelf full of odd objects. Some seemed leathery, some solid as wood, but they were all different heights and widths, and seemed to be lined up as far as he could reach in either direction. Reaching first upward, then down, he felt out more shelves, each with more of the objects on them. Curious, Luca slid one of the items from the shelf. It was vaguely box-shaped, but open on three sides, with something rough in between. He cautiously pressed on it, discovering that it was made of numerous fibrous sheets, which gave way, flexing open and pushing the solid front cover with it. He rifled through the sheets, producing a rustling noise which reminded him of shuffling through dry leaves in the forest. At a thought, he grabbed the solid covers, held them open, and shook lightly to see if anything fell from between the sheets. When nothing was forthcoming, he leaned in and gave the object a quick sniff. It was pleasantly musty, like some sort of precious heirloom. t was strange and unfamiliar, but somehow... comforting. It smelled both like storage, and people, as though it had seen many hands before finding its way into his. Whatever it was, Luca felt sure it was something special.

...but then, that's just my two cents. </TEXT>

Maybe, strangely comforting, instead of warm and familiar. Similar idea, but seems to fit closer. To me, anyway.

	<TEXT> I got bookshelf in the second sentence, confirmed with the third. The rest had nice, relatable imagery, but went on perhaps a bit too long.

Was he in darkness, or blind? Unclear, though he never seemed to use his eyes. Does he not know what a book is? Just curiosity, here. If not, though, then that last bit - warm and familiar, nostalgia - doesn't fit. Books are one of those things. If it gives you those sort of emotions, then there's no way to not recognise them - even blinded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I beat him on my first attempt, without really knowing what I was doing. Used probably the cheapest method, though.

There's a spot in the cave as you enter the room, just after drawing aggro from him, just inside arrow range, and with a tiny outcrop from the cave wall on either side. I literally spent thirty minutes jumping out, shooting one arrow, and rolling back behind cover before his web spit could hit, over and over and over again. 

Killed him without really even entering the room. Best way to handle spiders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see you have no feedback after five hours, so I just want to say good for you. 

Anyone who feels the need to dictate your path through life, in my personal opinion, doesn't deserve to be a part of it. If all they seem to do is make you feel like shit, then you're better off.

It sucks, knowing that you've reached a point where you have to write off someone you've known for years. I've done the same with friends and family members I've known all my life, so I can relate to your decision.

It's hard. It sucks. You will miss them. And then, you'll realize that you feel better now than you did back then.

But don't be fooled, it will come back, again and again. To this day, I get wistful about my ex wife of six years almost monthly. But there again, you won't forget. 

It's our past that forms us. Hold on to it, learn from it, and let it guide you on your way.

Oh, and happy new year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know why I did it, exactly. 

Call it a compulsion, an urge that couldn't be ignored. It wasn't the first time, and it certainly wouldn't be the last.

I walked into the bank and approached the teller, palms sweating, nervous, and yet thrilled. My heart pounded in my chest as I leaned across the counter and told her my request.

Her eyes widened, staring at me for a moment as if to ask, "Are you sure you want to do this?"  I stared back, face set in a casual mask, giving nothing away. 

Quietly, she tucked a loose strand of brown hair behind one ear and reached toward her station, going to work. I could tell she was judging me, but I didn't care. This was what I lived for.

I didn't know what I'd do after this. Nothing had been planned beyond getting what I'd come for. 

I started tapping my hand on the counter, getting impatient. I suppose it also showed on my face, as the teller looked up at me, her eyes pleading forgiveness.

After far too long, I hear the printer start up, and my heart thrills again as she reaches under the counter to hand me the cashier's check for $10,000, made out to the local chapter of the ASPCA.

My eyes welled up, thinking back to those Sarah McLachlan commercials I saw on Animal Planet the night before. Normally I was able to move on with my day, but I swear, they played eight of them in one commercial break, and my will broke. I knew what I'd be doing today.

My wife would understand. After all, she spends most of her time there.

I drove over to hand off the check in person, eager and dreading to see the look on her face. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you just introduced me to a decent song I'd never heard before, via a video with questionable choreography, performed by a child with phenomenal physical self-control and an unusually expressive face. Regardless how cringey you might feel this video is, there's no doubt in my mind that the kid is good at what she does here, and I must respectfully disagree with your opinion.

That said, thanks for broadening my musical horizons.

Also: It's"chandelier." Spell check is your friend. </TEXT>

Couldn't play for a few days.



Sunday night, I hit my second system - Discovered by T.C. McQueen.



He only claimed one planet there, so I did some exploring, and moved along the path of Atlas. 



Next system: Discovered by T.C. McQueen.



Same again, next system: Discovered by T.C. McQueen.



And so on, for ten systems. I hate T C. McQueen. </TEXT>

1: Stand at the front of your ship, with the right edge aligned to your screen border.

2: Note where ship cuts off at left screen border. Count 1

3: Move left until previously noted cut off point aligns to right edge of screen.

4: Repeat from step 2 until entire ship is covered.

Should give you a nice visual reference specific to your monitor setup. (I.E. 5 screens long.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, criticism is productive. Hence my criticising the hypocrisy inherent in your calling out what you perceive as unnecessary with something equally unnecessary. 

Further criticism: Your belief in something doesn't make it right. If you disagree with something *many people* are saying, you are not obligated to respect their opinion. Neither, however, can you expect to get anywhere with open jeers.

My advice to you is as follows: If you can't make everyone on the internet believe as you think they should, cry me a river, build a bridge, and get over it - if possible, into a different community, where they all hate the same things you do. 

You'll be happier there. </TEXT>

I started out wanting to play Terraria, but it just felt too... I dunno, full? A ton to do, with no direction. Quit out of frustrated apathy after a couple hours, then noticed this game in my library from ages ago. Thought, why not? Let's fire it up and see what's new.



Aaaaaand, twelve hours later, I realize I should have gone to sleep yesterday, six hours ago.



Since then, I can't stay away. Pretty much all my free time, I'm exploring, gathering, farming, building, crafting, mining, playing, creating, designing, planning... You get the picture.

And that's just single player.



Much love, chuckle fish. Much love. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> To the large group of teenagers who went to see Lights Out at my local theatre tonight... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-30 06:00:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You are solely responsible for the most aggressively irritating and unpleasant moviegoing experience I've ever had. The theater is not your buddy's house, where you can scatter and shout at each other whenever you please. Believe it or not, most people who attend these things tend to be able to stop talking long enough to actually hear and process what's happening on screen - or, at the very least, for ten consecutive seconds. 



Admittedly, there was a ten minute section somewhere in the middle where it actually got quiet enough for me to fall into the plot, and I was just thinking you guys might have calmed down, when I suddenly hear a lot of taking coming from the entryway. You people left in the middle of a horror movie, for ten minutes, as a group, and then came back, still taking more than a filibustering congressman.



Now, I understand that the theatrical horror movie experience involves a certain amount of audience involvement - the jump scares, the dread, the screams and cautionary calls to the person on screen - but you all took it to a new level. It's like there has never been a filter between your brain and mouth. All ten or so of you.



Okay, I don't want to seem unreasonable. I know people talk at the theatre. It's a minor annoyance we all deal with, and I was trying to deal. But you guys couldn't even confine it to one area of the theatre that I could tune out. Half of you say in the top row in the left, and the other half moved to the bottom right section of the theater, fifteen minutes in. I know this, because your whole flock passed right in front of me, and then sat right behind me.



The only saving grace is that I now have an amusing story to tell about the assholes who wouldn't stop trying to one-up each other in a bitter struggle to win the "Biggest Asshole in a Public Setting" contest.



The worst part? You all are black, you're not doing anything to help the negative stereotypes about your people, and now that I've mentioned that, I've already been labeled racist in the minds of most of the people who read this.



But I'm here to rant, not seek approval. 



Anyway. In conclusion, the lot of you suck at being decent in public. May you all live a long and *interesting* life. </TEXT>

2: You have 30seconds to a minute before they'd blink out, and they'll tell you when they've had enough a few times before they go. Just be quick.

3: Interacting with the deed will have it check the area for valid housing. This saves time, if you're worried you left it too long.

In my experience, unless you break a foreground or background wall, they don't seem to care. Beds are nothing. </TEXT>

One workaround is to plant a flag where you *want* to land, then just warp there from your ship.
