	<TEXT> I am curious as to what everyone's faves are in this game. It could be for aesthetic reasons or just because you like how they play but what class is your favorite? I really like the highwayman. His design is badass and tracking shot (while not his best) is such a damn cool move. Another personal favorite would have to be the bounty hunter. I love dealing massive damage to bosses and marked enemies. What are your favorites? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I swear most characters I play against don't give me anywhere near the trouble that a good Bayo does. It is obviously not a match up in my favor of course, but it is just ridiculous sometimes when I can't even get any of my moves out. Her hit boxes seem to come out so fast and are so large that I can never get close enough to land a grab on her, so I have to rely on heavy reads and punishes  (which doesn't really work so well against someone who knows what they're doing). I also can't really edgeguard her very easily because her recovery is nuts.  I'm just wondering if anyone has some good tips to use when facing her and I'd appreciate the help. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-04-21 20:14:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I think one of the flat out strangest and coolest areas of the game for me was the untended graves. Although it's a little barren, I love the idea of returning to an area (looking at you undeadp asylum). The thing that confuses me is what exactly is it? It is one of the weirdest areas because I have no idea what to think about it. So I figured I'd make a little post for discussion. Any theories or ideas are welcome! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PC user here, need some help with multiplayer issues. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-15 05:28:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Whenever I try to play ANY multiplayer (summons,duels,invasions, being *invaded*) the phantom in my game doesn't register correctly. It is a bit hard to explain, but they just sit in their neutral pose of whatever weapon they have equipped, and when they move they just sort of "slide" around without moving at all. This basically makes pvp or co-op impossible as I can't ever tell what they are doing. I can still take damage from them if they attack me on their end, but I dont see any animation from their player, I just act as if I was hit. Before the last patch I could multi just fine with summons and whatnot, but since the last patch literally all pvp for me is trashed. I am on college wifi if that has anything to do with it, but the wifi is very good in my dorm so I don't think that is the problem. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks </TEXT>

For like a full year I breathed, ate and lived fallout. I know where all the locations of the unique weapons are, and my house in megaton is pimped out so much you'd never believe it's filled with shit I took off of dead people.

I love doing mall crasher death wish with a friend. We both put on our mastermind convert builds and hold up in the "t rated" store. We wait on either side of the door for cop to enter, and when one does I give him the ole buzzer and we both scream at him till he surrenders. We repeat until we die. I  call it the conversion chamber and it is fucking great.
