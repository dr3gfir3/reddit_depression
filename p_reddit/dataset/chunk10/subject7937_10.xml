	<TEXT> /r/BuyItForLife took this down because you can't buy it but suggested this sub would be a better home for it.

Back in 2005 I visited Vietnam and forgot to bring sandals so I had to go buy a pair, being raised in America my stature is a bit different than those who are native so it was impossible to find sandals that will fit my US size 12.5 - I had to find a shoemaker to make them custom. We found this tiny little shanty of a store that said they make custom footware and this guy hobbled together (from scraps) this pair of sandles, he even threw a Puma charm on it (lol) and about 30min later and $10-USD, I had a pair of sandals.

My fiance absolutely hates how they look but they are the best sandals I've ever had! I've worn them on boats; taken them into the ocean for extended periods of time; I wore them in the Florida muds fishing for conch and even lost a sandal (for a while); I've dragged them through every terrain imaginable; they've endured the abuse of being left outside in the winters of Colorado; they've baked in the sun for days on end in the summer sun; slipped off my foot and run over numerous times; but I've never once done anything to maintain them. They're practically as good as new despite all this abuse except for some wear on the bottom.

It's unfortunate that I'll probably never able to buy another pair, I have no idea what they're made of but I'm glad I have these. At the rate they're holding up, I'll probably be well into retirement age before they're no longer functional.

I know they're not the best looking but they have freaking seen some shit yet they champion on like they were just made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry about that, these were a hand-made item hobbled together from scraps from a small shop in Vietnam, I couldn't even buy another pair even if I went back. I am interested in what http://bitis.com.vn/ has to offer as a user has commented.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started using NOIP recently and I installed the client at first but then realized that my Nighthawk8500 had DDNS NOIP built-in. I then uninstalled the client and put my credentials in Netgear's UI, seemed to work fine for a while until I turned on PIA and NOIP switched the IP to the one PIA provided me.  PIA vpn runs as a client on the desktop not the router so I have no idea why or even how NOIP even knows, if NOIP runs strictly on the built-in DDNS on my router how the heck would it know if the desktop's VPN service is running?

Now I have to constantly check the router and make sure that my NOIP account has the right IP, is there some way to fix this? Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Z77, i5, 980Ti, Dell U2711 connected via displayPort.

After the Win10 Creator's update I lost the ability to put the monitor to sleep nor do I have a screensaver. I'm on a normal Desktop PC, should I have not forced the Creator's Update? Is there a Creator's update that is specific to standard desktops?

I've clean-installed the Nvidia driver multiple times, reinstalled chipset drivers from Asus. Checked advanced power settings over and over again, checked for multi-monitors, checked for multi display drivers, checked for any 3rd-party drivers, nothing but Nvidia drivers. I've posted to [tom's hardware](http://www.tomshardware.com/forum/id-3386311/monitor-longer-sleeps-win10creator-update-monitor-displays-black-cursor-screen.html), [mircrosoft community](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/updated-to-the-creators-update-and-now-my-monitor/aa25babc-41f6-4c6a-91e0-f8413688a9f6).

Windows boot and performance is fine except for one issue: when Windows puts my monitor "to sleep" - instead of turning off the monitor, Windows just puts up a black screen with the cursor displayed. This leaves my monitor completely ON with a mouse cursor instead of powering OFF the monitor like it used to do; I have to manually turn off the monitor to save energy and avoid any burn-in.

I get no errors or anything, the monitor will not turn off - it just displays black with a mouse cursor and then goes back to working order when I "wake" via mouse movement or keystroke.

I'm very convinced that Windows somehow believes my device is something other than a desktop computer. I've seen an option where you can revert back to a previous build of windows10 during my searches but for some reason I don't have that option in my recovery.

Any insight would be greatly appreciated, thanks ahead!

I've posted a few screenshots in the [microsoft community forum](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/updated-to-the-creators-update-and-now-my-monitor/aa25babc-41f6-4c6a-91e0-f8413688a9f6). </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know western wedding receptions are pretty small most of the time but unfortunately that's not case with traditional Asian ones. Our reception will be 450-500 guests (average for Asian receptions), which means 45-50 tables, which means 45-50 centerpieces.

I'm having a hell of a time trying to stay cost-effective and stay under budget. I've been in contact with a dozen vendors on alibaba and they're all no-go, material cost is really competitive but freight is ridiculous. 

Anyone have any tips on where to go to get like bulk vases or things of the sort? We're looking for something that has a smaller footprint but stands relatively tall. Any input would be greatly appreciated! 

Bonus, any suggestions on party favors would be great too!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked every position imaginable at my parent's restaurant for decades, unpaid except when filling in as waitstaff - I got to keep tips.

Anyhow, this woman comes in with her three young kids for dinner - we were moderately busy and, like in most cases, I was the only one waiting tables. Juggling about six tables simultaneously, her overly obnoxious, extremely misbehaving kids were stirring up a storm of messiness and screaming. It's a small restaurant, you could hear them from the kitchen. She called me over for something every five-minutes so that she can ask for things like refills (when their cups were clearly full, she'd call me over and chug her water while I watched), extra sides, sauces to-go, things that weren't very common at all; I accommodated all of her requests with with the utmost professionalism and grace while her kids threw their food all over the place. After about 40min into the meal, her boyfriend joins her for dinner.

I assume this is her boyfriend because the kids don't call him dad or anything like that and he doesn't seem to have any authority over them nor does he care that they're wreaking havoc to booth while disturbing every other table in the restaurant. I give him a menu, he then starts giving me a hard-time about how there isn't any Chinese food he recognizes (even though he's in a Vietnamese restaurant), takes a good ten minutes of "customer service" guidance until he figures out what he wants.

Whilst he's eating the meal and the mess his girlfriend's kids grows larger and larger I hear him mumble "this is some bullshit Chinese food" while he woofs down the food contributing to the mess. It must have struck a chord because he proceeds to make a take-out order.
I'm going to digress here for a second, being short-staffed at the restaurant makes you wear ALL of the hats, so all facets outside of cooking the food is handled by me that night.

I pack their to-go order and he decides to cancel half of it, I'm fine with that, whatever they want, right? They also ask me to pack what's left of their food to-go as well, there wasn't much left of anything (most of it is on the wall, floor, and table but I pack what I can anyways). The bill comes out to be around $75, this couple and the three kids did rack up quite a bit - note that I did not charge them for any extras or anything like that and clearly took off the cancelled order.
The woman pays the check in cash with a Benjamin, I give her change with plenty of singles and fives. They hang out for a bit, it's now been two-and-half-hours and the kids have been mashing the food deeper into the carpet, stained the table cloths and used the wall as a finger-paint canvas, all the while the restaurant gets busier and busier.

While I'm busy with other tables they up and vanish in a matter of seconds, I go to clean up and collect the tip: forty-two cents, the coin-change I gave back to her, I thought: this can't be right - I looked around the booth, under the table, nothing but food mashed everywhere.
At this point I've basically had it with this table. In the corner of my eye I can still see the woman trying to get her kids in the van so I grab the 42cents and run out to her and say "excuse me ma'am, I think you forgot this". She replies, "no, you earned that" - I then gave the change to the one of her kids saying "I think your mama needs this more than I do, can you keep it for her?". There wasn't even the slightest glimpse of embarrassment in the woman's face. I walk back inside and have to leave the Jackson Pollock of a booth while I tend to the rest of the customers during peak hours, after the dinner rush was over it took me nearly 45min to clean up their booth, it was an eye-sore for nearly two hours, I'm sure patrons were pretty put off by it even though I tried my hardest to minimize the disaster when I had time between serving other guests.


tldr: customer comes in with kids, is rude, loud, racist, wrecks booth, and is a disturbance for over 2hrs, leaves 42-cent tip on a $75 check with zero remorse. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2001 Acura TL intermittent start problems depending on how long it's been off... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-10 01:04:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been dealing this for the last year and cannot figure out for the life of me what's going on. It's a 2001 Acura TL automatic. 

Always cranks, starts intermettent.

I've noticed that the car has some issues starting if the engine is off for roughly 40min-1hr, now I say this because if I let it sit for two hours or longer, there is no issue. 

Long drive sessions yield the same issue: let's say I drive the car for 35min and then stop to get gas or pop in the store for a few minutes it'll have trouble starting if I don't get back to it in the next half-hour. 

Lastly, multiple stops will do it too. If I'm driving for a while but make more than three stops, it'll decide that it doesn't want to start anymore.

If the car sits for a while, it cranks fine. It has no trouble starting overnight or after a full workday.

I did have a few codes saying that the TPS was malfunctioning so I replaced the entire throttlebody since the TPS is revited in. I've cleaned the manifold. I have no idea what the heck is going on, any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance for any input.

Edit: 03-21-17, I've installed a new Fuel pump relay, it was a pain the ass - will report back findings in a week or so.

Edit: 03-22-17, switching out the main relay has not worked, I've been recording video of my start until I caught it. Today I drove roughly 55min and shut my car off, waiting about 20min and tried to start it and caught on video the car struggling, the car finally starts at about 1m19sec https://youtu.be/-omAVsAiwvE - you can see that once it does start the idle is really low and I'm trying to rev the engine (sorry for the angle, I was hoping I'd get audio of the engine because it sounds funny but watching the video now you can't really hear anything) - after some time I turn it off, start the car, and this time you'll notice that the idle is back to normal. Any thoughts? Suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I know having a 6pt and a 12pt is a bit excessive but the space taken is marginal but having standard and extended sockets is really quite helpful. Also, using a large wrench in tight spaces can be a pain so you've gotta have sockets that fit the smaller wrenches too - it's all situational really.  </TEXT>
