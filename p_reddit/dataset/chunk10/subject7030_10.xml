	<TEXT> Of course that's your contention. I'm a first-year grad student; and just got finished reading some Roman historian, Pete Garrison probably. I'm gonna be convinced of that 'till next month when I get to James Lemon. Then I'm going to be talking about how the economies of Rome and Greece were entrepreneurial and capitalist way back in 1740 B.C.. That's gonna last until next year; then I'm gonna be in this subreddit regurgitating Gordon Wood, talkin' about, you know, the pre-revolutionary utopia and the capital-forming effects of military mobilization. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Ten Dollar Bill </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 15:28:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am nobody. Some people lead brilliant lives. Lives of color and achievement. Bright bursts of red, pillars of yellow light. You know, when you look at someone and they seem to just shine. People around them say "That person's going to be someone someday. Real Potential." I'm primer gray.

I have no family; I think the only person that knows my last name is the man that signs my paycheck. I live in a town beat down by progress. The old folks around here only seem to ever speak in the past tense. How great the town used to be before the mines shutdown. They are walking shadows like me. They see the world how it used to be. They don't see a boarded-up storefront on Main street. They see the soda fountain where they had their first kiss. They see the old grocery store where their mothers used to send them for condensed milk. They see the color in the shadow. I wish I was old like them. I'd like to see the color. But that is not who I am.

There is only one gas station left in town. It's old and rusty. I work there. Work if you want to call it that. Most of the time I just sit here and watch the dust collect. Little boxes of spark plugs for cars that probably don't even exist anymore. Gas cans always borrowed and never bought. The only things that aren't covered in dust are the cigarettes and beer. I'm probably a chief contributor to their popularity.

I space out most of the time. The world of sounds and things just blur away. I like watching the dust dance in the shafts of the dusk light. It's like an endless stream slowly floating in the air darting around here and there. My own breath the puppeteer of their dance. It all ends so quickly. My own little world seems to collapse in on itself with the ring of the little bell above the door shattering it. The dust blown away by a gust of air. I get torn from the peace of the light back to my grey world.

"ten on two. Keep the change." That's all the man said that walked in and broke my daydreaming. I take the bill, ring the register open, and flip the pump on. I watch him walk out. A little overdressed for this place. A crisp suit that seems to be equally black and dark blue. 'Must be rich if he overpays this much for gas.' I thought. A black watch on his right hand that glints the sun as he reaches for the door to open it. He walks out of my world as quickly as he walked into it.

The ten bill he gave me was old and wrinkly. I pull it taught on the edge of the register to try and snap it straight. As I hold it up to see If I got all the wrinkles out the date catches my eye. I hold the bill up to the light. Sure enough, the bill says "Series 1995". I glance over at Helena. She's Miss June on this years pin up calendar from 1969.

I sit there for a few seconds. Just staring at the date. It must be a fake bill, seen plenty of those. I stand up and try to look out of the stained windows at the man. His car already starting to drive out. A black Cadillac DeVille convertible. I've seen it around town before. A new car stands out in a place like this. Im sure Ive seen in walking back to my shithole apartment gleaming under the lights of the Motel 8 down the road. Bad counterfeiter to get the date this wrong. 

Just passed midnight. A couple people from out of town and the local drunks my only company this night. I close shop and hit the breakers for lights outside. I count today's take. The ten bill from the suit sitting on the counter. Its staring at me. I pocket it. Toss the rest of the days cash in a used too many times yellow envelope and slam it in the safe. 

The night is damp and ugly for a walk down Blacklog road. Every so often the lights from a passing car or the moon crashing through a break in the clouds light my way. To cars and the moon, Im just a shadow on the side of the road. The swinging glow of my cigarette the only proof of my existence. Eventually I stand in the faint orange glow of the Super 8 sign, and sure enough theres the Cadillac. I feel around in my jeans pocket for the ten bill, sliding it around with my fingers. I can see the lights are still on in the room next to the Cadillac. I guess passing fake bills all day in backwater Inez isnt exactly tiring work. The rest of the motel is dark. Im like a moth to the flame I stand there and stare at the door. Room 7. 

Ive had a few too many run-ins with the law to go calling them. But there is no way Im explaining ten short to the boss. I hate my job, but it keeps beer in the fridge. This shits going to pay. I make way up to the door. Just as I pass the Cadillac I stop. A wall of fear hits me in the chest. It was like turning a corner and suddenly seeing a gun in your face. This unexplainable feeling of dread. There is nothing here, why cant I move? The fear hits me in predictable waves. Eating away at me like a stone at the shore. It takes all my resolve and energy just to raise my eyes from the ground. I can see into the room, and passed it. Its two realities smashing into each other like train cars. A field one second, a room another. Day, then back to night. I feel like my body is being torn apart. Standing in an invisible rift. The pace of the waves slow. I want my knees to buckle. I want nothing more than to fall onto the wet pavement. As suddenly as the waves hit me they stopped. I give in to the will of my body and let gravity do its work. I never thought the ground could feel this good.

Im sure I passed out at this point. When I came to I was in a strange bed. I felt like I just laid four miles of track. This is a problem. a voice said. The world around me is just coming into focus.


I know. Another voice answered.

 
Ill take care of it. I heard that loud and clear.


I looked down at my body and saw the straps. I was tied into the bed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basic income will fail. Communism failed. People and society do not work this way. There will always be rich people propped up by the work of the poor. No matter how many creative ways you find to shift this paradigm (labor, manufacturing to poor countries paying poor wages) you are simply outsourcing the poor. Where there once was Kings and Lords, there are now CEO Billionaires and CEO Millionaires. The only difference is that the law aspect has shifted from the Rich to the government...governments that are easily corrupted by the rich to serve themselves. 


We never learn anything from our history. Rome crumbled and fell due to greed and corruption. Over generations the Rich kept on getting richer and greedier that eventually they owned all the land. And since only landowners could be true Romans and join the military the empire fell. No military to maintain the empire, means no money coming in. The Rich destroyed themselves and everyone else's lives with their greed.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-04-19 08:36:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There is a legend buried deep inside history


Going back to the dawn of man

 
A curve of magnificent beauty, of mathematical perfection


The very mathematical allegory of the human perception of beauty


Those few who have glimpsed an understanding of this mystery have created magnificent masterpieces. From the west, there is the Mona Lisa, Michelangelos the last supper, the Parthenon, Donald Trump. From the east, there is Hokusai the Tsunami, the Taj Mahal, Sonic the Hedgehog.


They all share a mysterious force that binds them together...the golden ratio, the Fibonacci.


To find the answer to the ultimate question I would have to travel the world, and interview the greatest minds.


I began my adventure with the renown genius Reddit user Slasher6969.


"tell me of your credentials Slasher6969" I PMd him.


"Please please, just call me Doc Slasher." he replied.


"I have an honorary doctorates degree from the mods of /r/health."


"Honorary?" I questioned him.


"Yes, but I am more of a doctor than any real doctor. How many doctors do you know that do over 1200 hours a week of Reddit research?" He sniped back.


"but...there are only 169 hours a week?" I asked after querying Siri.


"Exactly..."


I was clearly impressed by his credentials. He had over 6 front page posts in the last 3 months, and only 5 of them where reposts. His Karma was nearly at unheard of levels. He requested a Skype video chat.


"I know the answers that you seek, but..." he shied away from the camera "my intellect is not nearly enough."


"Butbut you are one of the most brilliant minds on Reddit. Over 12K up votes just this week. If you don't have the answers, then who does?" I asked.


Doc Slasher began to speak in whispered tones.


"There is another. No one knows where he lives. Rumor has it he has been training in the art of the Katana in the Himalayas. But he has returned from his study of the blade. His intellect is so great it takes FOUR fedoras to contain it."


"you can't possibly mean...?" I gasped. Nearly dropping my vape.


"yes...yes the legendary Quad-dora." Doc Said, rising his arms in the air.


"you mean you have found him??" I asked.


"Yes. It was the culmination of my life's work of reddit stalking. I was finally able to track him down. You will find him just outside of Pompeii."


"Pompeii? the lost destroyed city?" I asked.


"No, pom-pay-eye...Michigan. about 100 miles north west of Detroit. Here is his address" He PMd me the address.


I immediately dawned the best body armor I owned, and booked a flight on a United Airlines to Pompeii Michigan.


After hours of Siri giving me the wrong directions, I finally arrived at his secret underground compound cleverly disguised as a suburban two and half bath ranch home.


His gatekeeper answered the door. She went by the name of Ms. Stevenson. She took one look at me, obviously impressed by my sense of style and fedora, and quickly ushered me inside. She directed me to a door that led down into the underground compound. How did she know I was coming? I wondered.


I walked the stepped passage down into the darkness.


As I turned the corner is was like the resurrection of Christ, I was blinded by the sheer light from all the monitors.


Cast in their shadow I saw him...the cloaked figure sitting in a meditative state...the legendary Quad-dora.


"I have been expecting you..." He said without even opening his eyes.


He turned in his chair, the light gleamed off his perfectly polished Naruto Leaf Village Jnin headband. I could make out the pair of Katanas strapped to his back.


Clearly noticing my sense of fear, he spoke.


"You need not worry." he assured me. "I only draw my blades to strike down darkness, to defend the innocent and m'ladies."

"You must forgive me" I spoke, "I have heard the legends that you can draw and reseat you blades before the enemy even know they are dead." I spoke carefully.

"yes yes this is true. Now...why have you sought my guidance?"


I showed him the evidence I had gathered. The Mona Lisa, the Trump, the Parthenon. His gatekeeper, Ms. Stevenson, clearly a practitioner of Kung-Fu, brought us hors doeuvres of Totino's pizza rolls as we poured over the evidence.


"Yes yes, I am familiar with this subject. I have many reposts on this subject matter. Even some that have garnered Reddit gold." The Quad-dora spoke.


"With all your research, your honorable legendary Quad-dora, have you found an answer? I queried.


"Yes...yes I have."


I was shocked. I knew his intellect was amazing, according to multiple Facebook IQ tests he was rating over 200, but to be so close to the answer.


"Come with me."


He rose from his meditative pose and directed us down the hall.


"I know the one you seek, the embodiment of the Fibonacci."


He caught me glimpsing his collections.


"Ah yes, gaze upon my armory. The finest collection of Katana and Nerf Guns this side of the Mississippi. I call this one Sheyla." He picked up a large Nerf sniper rifle "customized it myself, illegal spring kit from North Korea, lethal up to 1000 yards. Dart catcher, picatinny rail, red dot scope, and laser."


It was glorious.


"But this" he pointed at a sword protected by a display case "the pride of my collection. The original sword used in the anime Ao no Exorcist...Rin Okumuras swordKurikara." I leaned toward it to get a better look.


"CAREFUL" he cautioned. "even the slightest touch of its blade can kill." I slowly backed away in respect.


"but back to the task at hand." Quad-dora motioned down the hall.


He briskly walked us passed his anime collection, his complete Nintendo collection. We took a left at his Pokmon card collection directly to a set of double doors.


"The one you seek goes by many names; for he has many faces. The founder of greatest empire known to man. Legend says he was born a virgin birth in Israel. He started life as a reposter, much like I. But he transcended. He is the one."


"you don't mean? I gasped.


"Yes, he is an OC... a creator of memes. Born in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five. He has over 9000 likes on YouTube and he is a verified non-virgin." He said.


"what??...I though only a Chad could transcend to non-virgin??" I asked in shock.


"Before the one, that was true. His wife is of the house Hakmon. A legendary beauty, painter and original content creator of her own. It is said on their wedding night a thousand white horses manifested out of thin air in the deserts of the holy land."


"truly amazing!" I gasped. "who is this legend?"


"he is the Papa Bless, creator of the Naysh of Vape, he is the living embodiment of memes, the judge of all goofs, gags, and gaffs, H3h3 Ethan Bradberry Klein!


As he spoke he swung open the double set of doors to reveal his shrine to H3h3 Ethan. His shrine to the glory of it all was too much and I fainted.


When I awoke, I was outside. The sun warmed my skin for the first time in years. I watched the clouds pass overhead wondering if it was all a dream. Did I meet the Quad-dora? Was is all just a hallucination? I felt a note pinned to my chest.


Is simply read. "There is only one place on Earth where a God could walk among us. The one you seek now lives in the city of fallen angels." The paper was embossed with a crest of a fedora crossed by two Katana swords.


"IT WAS REAL!!" I yelled.


I donned by body armor and extra padding and prepared to board the first United Airlines flight to Californ-nye-aye.


There I would seek the legendary Ethan Klein, the creator, the one, the papa bless H3h3.


My journey would be cut short. The answers I seek must be too strong. Was it the illuminati? The Knights Templar? The East Lansing Michigan homeowners association? Perhaps even the Freemasons? Whoever it was they wield great power and influence.


The United Airlines check-in counter lady informed me I was out of good boy points. My card had been declined...she beat me with my own carry-on bag for wasting her time. An entire year of taking the trash out without complaining down the drain. I returned home, sullen, broken, not even my favorite dinner of chicken tendies could absolve me. I must find the answer.


I scoured the entire internet for answers. I left no sub reddit unturned. And just when I was about to give up hope I received a PM. It was from the legendary Quad-dora. "You think in so few dimensions. Do not look at the obvious, the simple plane, you must broaden your horizons, into the third dimension."


It was just the spark of innovation I needed. Thank the gods for his massive intellect. I sought out the most powerful supercomputer in all of Lansing Michigan. The PowerMac G4 at the library. With all the porn surfing hobos it could be weeks before I get allotted a time slot. 


There must be another wayThere was one other wayI would have to trespass onto the hallowed grounds a near console peasant like me would never dare to. I would have to seek the help of a member of the Master Race. The PC Master Race.


Since I was a mere child I have heard the whispers. A child, a prodigy, he took apart a clock and was nearly invited to the Whitehouse. Legend says he actually wields not only the Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker but also the Warglaives of Azzinoth! I told my mother I'll take the tendies to go. I had to seek out a rank one Global elite!


I went two blocks down to Kyle's house. Kyle was his birth name, he preferred Anon now. He belonged to a cult called the 4chan. A mysterious group of hackers that claim to be the origin of the meme. I took one last draw from my vape, blew a sick ass cloud, and walked up to his door.


As I reached up to knock, the door suddenly blew open. It was glorious. He seemed to be illuminated in RGB lighting from behind so bright it was blinding. His golden locks of hair flowed effortlessly in the light breeze. Body of a Greek Twitch streamer. I looked up at him with a sudden feeling of inferiority. What am I doing here? A mere console peasant should not dare to gleam a god like this.


"Ha ho How did you know I was here?" I stuttered.


"The camera," He pointed at the IP camera above the door. "Fucking newfag. Well you gonna come in or just brick like an Xbox 360 on my stoup?"


"How do you know who I am?" I asked cautiously as I followed inside. Through his shirt I could see his back muscles bristle like pythons trapped in a bag.


"I'm a leet haxor, /fit/izen and /b/tard from the land of 4chan you fucking console peasant. Also, some fag named Quad-dora whispered me in WOW said you were coming." How will I ever thank the legendary Quad-dora.


We entered his room on the second floor of the house. I had never been this high up. Vertigo began setting in.


His room was stacked floor to ceiling with e-sports trophies.


"Is that...oh my god." My eyes fell onto a sight so incredibly beautiful.


"Yup. Frostmourne. Legendary sword of King Arthas, the lich king." It was truly amazing.


"What's that in the little box next to it?" I asked.


"The little thumb drive? Yeah that's the actual Sword of a Thousand Truths. I had to suck off a GM for that a Blizzcon last year...literally." I feel to my knees in its presence. A sword of untold power just two blocks from my home. What an honor.


"So what is it that you need from me mortal." He sneered.


"I need to use your computer, I heard it is even more powerful than the PowerMac G4 at the library."


"You insult my rig by comparing it to that Mac trash! And what do you think, Im just going to hand all this PC power over to youa console peasant? Just like that? You see those keys there? 


He pointed at his fully custom key capped keyboard.


Those custom keys are hand carved from molars of Korean StarCraft Players that I defeated at illegal underground tournaments. You are not worthy


I beg you! You must help me. I turned and presented myself to him but he turned away.


What do you need it for anyway? He asked.


I need it to answer the ultimate question. I need it to render a 3d model of the meme God H3h3 Ethan.


He laughed at my face.


Oh sure whats next, you want a live computational model of every molecule in the universe? You cant just PC model a god you fool. He continued to mock me.


Dammit Anon we must try! I cried out dropping to my knees pulling at his glorious zipper.


He swiped my hands away like a child reaching for a cookie jar. Fine, but were gonna have to go 4-way SLI for this one4-way Titans


He allowed me to sit in the corner on the floor and watch him work. The legend of his technical knowledge was understated. He truly is the one who was almost invited to the Whitehouse for taking apart a clock. His fingers moved so quickly I could barely keep up. 

A few hours later he was finished.


I call it Quantum Hydra. He spoke in soft tones. The machine powered to life with the sparks of a thousand RGB lights. The fans whirred to full power.


Oh my god it sounds like the I whispered.


Yes, he finished my sentence. Chidori, One Thousand Birds.


He opened a program on the machine I had never seen before. He casually scrolled through a list of a thousand items.


What is that? I asked.


Its Steam, He said. those are all games. Lord Gaben is good to us.


I had never seen so many games.


We worked for hours on end. I had my mother deliver tendies to me to keep me awake. Anon drank only imported Mountain Dew from Korea and feasted on Doritos of flavors I had never even heard of.


After pouring over all the archival footage of The Meme God H3h3 Ethan our work was nearly done.


We are ready to render. Anon said. Im afraid my machine alone will not be enoughI will put out a call-to-arms to the entire PC Master Race.


He opened a program called IRC, apparently, an ancient method of communication from the dawn of the PCMR. And he sent up a signal. And now we wait He said.


A few minutes passed and then suddenly thousands of confirmations began streaming in from all around the world. Russia, Germany, Korea all the elite gamers heeded our call to action. Anon hacked all the machines together.


It is done. The most powerful computer network in the history of the worldall this power at my fingertips. Anon trembled. 


We are ready to render a Meme GOD!! He screamed as he hit enter.


Around the globe thousands of gaming rigs screamed at once as their water-cooled GPUs maxed out in the computation. NASA reported being able to see spikes of RGB lighting from space.


We need more power! Anon yelled into his custom Corsair headset. Korea, divert power from the StarCraft servers! I could hear the complaints even from the floor.


Still not enough power Anon gasped. Netherlands divert all torrent processing from the Pirate bay!


I could see a needle swing to 85% on his screen. It wasnt enough.


Anon looked down on me from his gaming throne. He looked exhausted and defeated.


Thats all we havewethere are no more GPUs


Just then, a single solitary message popped up on the screen from IRC. The message read Perhaps I can lend a hand. -Lord Gaben


Holy shit. The lord. Anon gasped. Just then the needle shot to 100%! The computer flashed RENDER COMPLETE.


We did it. With the power of Steam lord Gaben himself he pushed the render to completion. It was done. We have rendered the Meme God H3h3 Ethan.


Cortana! Anon yelled. Yes master. His computer replied.


Begin analysis of the 3d render of Meme God H3h3 Ethan.


His personal Ai popped up on the screen I will need your assistance with the mathematical equations Anon.


Anon typed furiously on his keyboard. A thousand lines of code flashed by on his screen as the render of the Meme god came to life. As the 3d model turned, the universe seemed to come into alignment.


We all saw it at once. The answer was right there. 

Cortana confirm what we are seeing against the Fibonacci sequence. Anon commanded his PC. 

The golden ratio spiraled. It was a perfect match. We have found the Alpha and the Omega. Coexisting in a single being.


It had been staring me in the face the entire time. The FUPA. The Chub and tuck. It was mathematical perfection. The golden ratio spiral matched its side profile perfectly. He was truly a living meme. A god amongst us mere mortals.  A single tear fell from Anons face.


It has been a thousand years since a PCMR has criedI have never seen anything so beautiful. Anon sobbed.


There was a moment of silence.
