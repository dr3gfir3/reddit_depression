	<TEXT> Wait, what?

I've read like 40 papers in the last two month, some working papers, others published in magazines, every single one of them in justified text. Also at my college every single faculty wants justified text. I don't know about American highschools but it's pretty much standard in academics in general. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Nolan is a treasure of modern cinema but still underappreciated </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Christopher Nolan is the best director in cinema history. He isn't as popular as Spielberg/Scorsese because his films are intellectual and witty. Unfortunately people enjoy mindless action with weak stories more than Nolan's thought provoking work. Unless there is a revival of intellectualism in American cinema: weak, unthought provoking films will continue to be drooled over by you so called "movie reviewers". The Prestige and Memento alone are better than any film Spielberg has made, so don't get me started on The Dark Knight Rises and Interstellar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Care to give examples for anime that managed to capture this demographic? Also aren't a lot of the SoL shows (K-On, Non Non Biyori, etc.) made with an older audience in mind? As for US cartoons, I feel like theyre often deliberately trying to look "adult", e.g. by being unnecessarily offensive and over the top (e.g. Family Guy, South Park). Anime is often less in your face about that stuff and does not try as hard to look "adult" even when its the target demographic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, that's quite interesting. So is this a problem with streaming sites in general or do official ones, e.g. Funimation, offer a better quality? 

 Most shows do not air on TV in 1080p. They air in 720p or a slightly larger resolution. The BDs are in 1080p, but are not put on streaming sites.

So the only way to watch a show in the highest quality available is to either download it or to buy the BDs? That's stupid, especially considering how ridiculously expensive they are </TEXT>
