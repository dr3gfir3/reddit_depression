	<TEXT> So there is a "past me", a "current me", and a "future me" in a never ending battle. The "current me" always hates the "past me" because the "past me", when in the "current me" state, did not care about the "future me" and therefore did w.e. he wanted and let the "future me" deal with it. So now I'm currently me and I got screwed yet again by "past me". I will inevitably become "past me" myself and there in lies my dilemma.

I want to end this vicious cycle, but since "past me" screwed me and I only have so much time to enjoy being the "current me", I may need to make some decisions that the "future me" won't like. But since by the time the "future me" becomes the "current me" I will already be the "past me", does it matter what the "future me" thinks? It'll be "future me's" problem and I would be ok.

Will this cycle ever end? Does anyone else have this issue? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My issue is there is a past me, a current me, and a future me in everlasting battle. The current me always hates the past me because the past me, when he was the current me, does not care about the future me. Therefore, the past me, in his current me form, does w.e. he wants and let's the future me deal with it once he becomes the past me. So now I'm current me and I got screwed yet again by past me. I will Inevitably become past me, therefore I will enjoy my time as current me and do w.e. I want because that is future me's problem. 

It's a vicious cycle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for providing so many options! The zhummel seems great but at 40 lbs seems like something to keep in a yard or something. How comparable is the skywatcher as far as image clarity goes? In trying to find some sample images from that scope but am not having luck.  Any links you could point me to with some pictures from that scope? The price is great and if it provides a clearer image than my original choices then I'm all for it. 25lbs ain't bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously guys. How you do not see that this blackout can only negatively impact the game at worst, and not impact the game at best, is beyond me. We have already bought the game and they are already trying to fix it. If the community bands together to go long stretches without playing, then why would they keep putting resources into the game when they can just move on to the next project?

Look at the rate of improvements with the playerbase somewhat intact, then imagine the screeching halt that could come if the playerbase suddenly vanishes. 

Seriously people. Grow up. You want to retaliate? Retaliate with your wallets. Don't buy steel. Don't buy season pass. But continue to play. If the playerbase remains the same but steel sales drop immensely then it will incline them to do better and increase those steel sales. But if not one is playing the game at all then why bother?


TL;DR don't be lazy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Nooby looking for guidance/advice on my firs telescopes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-30 19:54:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all.

I've always had a fascination for space and have finally made the decision to buy a telescope. I have my eye on two at the moment and wanted to see if you all had any thoughts on answering the follow questions, of which I will preface with the follow:

1) My budget is up to $550 with wiggle room,  but the lower I can get that without sacrificing much the better.

2) I will mostly view moon and planets since I will be viewing with lots of light pollution, but I have good spots I can drive too for deep sky sessions. So I'm looking for something reasonably easy to move and capable of both.

Right now the two I've found that I have my eye on are explore scientific ar102mm for $549 with a mount included. 

The second is a cheaper one, Orion 9024, with a mount included for $280.

Now, I will mostly be looking at planets, but I want to be able to see deep sky objects as well since I will occasionally make the drive to do so. Will these scopes provide a clear imagine of planets and objects? I've seen some uploaded pictures of Jupiter for instance on some scopes and although I can tell it is Jupiter, it isn't as clear as I'd like. 

Do you guys think either of these can get the job done? Or, do you know better scopes around the same price? I do not mind slightly breaking the budget if it's really worth it.

Thank you all for your time reading and chiming in.






TL;DR Orion 9024 , explore scientific ar102mm, or your recommendation? Budget $550 with wiggle room. looking for both deep sky and planetary viewing, mostly planetary. Please read post  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there's a flaw in yours. With an angry, dwindling playerbase why would you dedicate resources to the game? You've already sold 90% of the copies you could ever sell (assuming some people buy more with sales).

 The profit you'd gain from steel would be a numbers game since most people that buy steel are casual and most likely gone at this point with only the biggest fans and more "hardcore" gamers still playing, which from my experience hate microtransactions; the numbers are not in their favor. So if the player base suddenly drops by half or more after it has already dropped so much, why would you dedicate money and time for small profit when in the greater scheme of things you can just work on new games? Updated and support for this game will drop if not completely worst case scenario, best case scenario as op stated they continue as normal. 

This strike can only hurt the game.

	<TEXT> He could be right. I rarely if ever get disconnected honestly. It comes down to internet imo (mine is great). The worst I get is if the host leaves the game and it tries finding the next suitable host. Sometimes at that moment I may DC but I never just randomly DC from a match. </TEXT>
