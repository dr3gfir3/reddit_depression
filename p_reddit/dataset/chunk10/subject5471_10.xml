	<TITLE> A few questions about reading "The Life of Samuel Johnson" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 07:12:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am going to start reading it this week and I had a few questions for those who have read it. 1. Does it require a lot of background information/notes to be understood or does Boswell assume the reader knows nothing in advance? 2. Is there a better unabridged version than the Penguin Classics and Everyman's Library versions? The Penguin copy has too small print but has notes and the Everyman's has good print size but no notes (from what I can tell). 3. Any tips for reading it? 

Thanks ahead of time  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I read Generation of Swine and Better than Sex (his 80's and 90's book respectively). They are good and I recommend reading them with the following things in mind. At that point in his life all the alcohol and drugs were starting to get to him, he began losing faith in politics, and he had problems with Rolling Stone.

	<TITLE> The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge Best Translation? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-07 02:20:50 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I want to read The Notebooks of Malte Laurids Brigge by Rilke but there are so many translations that and no good articles (besides one comparing Mitchell's and Pike's translations). I am wondering if anyone has read the new translations (Michael Hulse- Penguin Classics and Robert Vilain- Oxford World Classics) or the old ones (Mitchell- Vintage and Pike- Dalkey Archive) and can tell me which one is best. All I have heard is that Pike's is more accurate to the German but Mitchell's is more readable. Thanks ahead of time

	<TEXT> It's a great introduction. It makes Heidegger and Husserl somewhat readable. The historical context for existentialism is key to understanding the works.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently reading P+V's The Brothers Karamazov. I am finding it a little daunting not so much because of the subject matter but more of the translation. The language seems beautiful in some parts and awkward in others. 
I have been reading a few subreddit posts about P+V and people seem to be split over them. Are they good translators? I know that is a vague question because translations are judged by accuracy to the original language, readability, etc. But I am curious if anyone else feels this way about them. Side Question: Are their translations of The Idiot and The Demons good?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kerouac didn't have a driver's license when he was on the "On the Road" journey. So he literally and figuratively was in the passenger's seat for the entire journey. At the end, he kinda realizes that he needs to take the wheel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Sal Paradise (Kerouac) isn't giving into the system but realizing that he doesn't need Neal Cassady (i forget his name in the book) to have adventures. Cassady isn't exactly the best guide (he is kinda an asshole in the book- and was in real life too). Cassady prompts the want to journey in Sal but Sal needs to experience the world on his own.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen the movie but I have read the story. The story offers both an argument for determinism and free will when it comes to time. The aliens think in a way in which they know everything that will happen (maybe a nonlinear look at time). While the humans think in a linear way of looking at time. I guess you could say the aliens are determinists. But the story is more about how you think about life. It asks the question is it better to know what will happen in the future or rather to let time take its course and let the answers come gradually. If you think that life is determined than you might not act out of line. But if you believe in free will exists then you think you  are free and there is no scripted version of life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I know myself but that is all"- from the end of TSOP. I still think about that quote a lot. I was reading TBAD when I visited Fitzgerald's grave. It is a bit boring compared to his other books. As I have said in another fitzgerald post, he is better to read in publication order. You can better see his growth as a writer if you read in order. Also the books are largely autobiographical so they are a nice timeline in his and Zelda's life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With Non-fiction, if it is a book with an argument (like a philosophy treatise) then I do a lot of research on the book and its author before jumping in. I also take notes while reading. A side note on philosophy- it is better to start from the beginning (Plato and Aristotle) before trying to read the new guys. Often the new guys reference works from the past. If it is a general nonfiction book then I usually just read it normally.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would consider leftists and socialists "liberal". He wasn't an authoritarian socialist but rather a more libertarian socialist . A lot of people do not realize there are distinctions between socialists.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say it is objective. But I would say it is a good history book. Zinn wanted to give the other side of American History that gets largely ignored in history classes. Yes, it is liberal. But people need to remember that the history we learn is very narrow. We learn about the "winners". For those who think he is anti-american, citizens have a right to address the problems of the nation and its history.  </TEXT>
