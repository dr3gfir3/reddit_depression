If you are running 64 bit then you want to grab:

1.   linux-headers-4.10.1-041001_4.10.1-041001.201702260735_all.deb
   
2. linux-headers-4.10.1-041001-generic_4.10.1-041001.201702260735_amd64.deb
 
3.   linux-image-4.10.1-041001-generic_4.10.1-041001.201702260735_amd64.deb

After you've d/led them go to that folder (probably ~/Downloads) and enter:
    
    sudo dpkg -i *.deb

to install them. Then reboot. Confirm that you are running the new kernel with:

    uname -a </TEXT>

	<TITLE> QS industry study - looking for recommendations </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-14 23:09:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm working with the [Human Data Commons Foundation](https://humandatacommons.org) in Vancouver, Canada and we are researching and writing a study which we are tentatively calling the **"Quantified Self Industry Report Card"** for presentation at the [Metric Culture conference in June](http://metriclife.net/whats-on/international-conference_-metric-culture-the-quantified-self-and-beyond/).

The description for our study that was accepted is as follows:

*"Who controls the data from Quantified Self apps? The data from Quantified Self apps creates a new layer of complexity around agency, ownership, privacy and security of personal data in a Big Data world. Growth of the QS industry and community invites a deeper conversation about ethics in data collection, use, disclosure, who has agency over it, and how its shared for personal, commercial, political, etc purposes. It further invites exploration of what kinds of policies and practices create the best use and least abuse of QS data. The Quantified Self Report Card provides an opening for this conversation as well as a baseline measure for current privacy and security policies among a range of QS product providers."*

	<TEXT> I presume your wages are still denominated in CAD? If not then you definitely want to do that to help insulate you from volatility. 

I would ask for your invoices to be calculated in fiat using the 24hour sliding average figure on bitcoinaverage.com. Have the payment sent directly to your Quadriga account and then place orders. Follow the market (say with a widget in your phone) and with a little patience you will end up making more than you would with straight fiat payments.

Definitely get a h/w wallet (eg. Trezor) if you plan to store long term. You will have no problem sending the occasional 'savings deposit' from Quadriga to your Trezor.

	<TEXT> I see Heidegger taking a sort of middle ground between a correspondence theory and a relativistic theory of truth.  It's relativistic in the sense that it only exists within a world view/language/culture, but it's also absolute in the sense that you can't get outside your culture's understanding of the way things are.  There's nothing sensible out there disconnected from our collective understanding.  Sort of like it would be relativistic, except there's nothing for it to be relative to.

	<TEXT> I'm in the market for an upgrade and consider the current top contenders to be:

* http://www.geeky-gadgets.com/lenovo-unveils-thinkpad-x1-carbon-ultrabook-06-01-2014/
* http://www.dell.com/us/business/p/xps-13-linux/pd
* https://puri.sm/librem-13/

X1 Pros: Great backlit keyboard, fingerprint reader. X1 Cons: possibly backdoored by China.

XPS Pros: ships with Ubuntu. XPS Cons: reviews are less than stellar.

Librem Pros: hardware switch for video and mic, free and open philosophy, support an underdog. Librem Cons: no keyboard backlighting.

In any event I would be wiping the drive and installing Ubuntu 16.04. Help me decide between these or offer up a model I haven't considered! </TEXT>
