	<TEXT> Fuck them. Fuck people like them. I don't want you to die but I want your parents to suffer as if you did die and they felt completely responsible. Maybe run away and start a life somewhere else completely detached from them with no way to communicate. Even if it means being homeless and hungry for a bit. Anything would be better than the agony of being trapped in a mental prison with people like that. I hope they burn in hell. Sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck depakote. I gained 100lbs in a year and ruined my body for years afterward because of it. It spiked my appetite, I started eating 4k+ calories daily, and had less energy for exercise. I gained weight and it sent me into a depression that was relieved by eating sugar or junk food. My body built a dependency on it and addiction to sugar and I feel so horrible without sugar and carbs that I can't even function. How am I supposed to lose weight like that?? I went from 230lbs with a size 48" chest, 17" biceps, 34" waist to 335lbs, 54" chest (of fat) 18" biceps and 48" waist. My self esteem is shot to shit and nobody cares to be around me anymore. I used to walk into a room and turn heads of most of the women there. Now I gross them out and people avoid me. So fuck depakote. I suggest finding something that won't ruin your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same. Left me breathless for a few minutes and kind of dizzy with sadness and rage. I started with the beheading of Nick berg when I was young, and have seen puppies stomped to death, terrorists executed with dull knives, Mexican drug cartel killed with a chainsaw, hundreds of suicides and freak accidents.. none of them were anything more than entertainment. This one affected me in a completely different way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You make valid points. My rage and hunger for justice clouded my reasoning when it comes to the process. You're right. I just see trials take ungodly amounts of time for dumb reasons and the person is never sentenced when they are found guilty. It should be a month long process. Not decades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Random killings vs justified killings... Homicides back then were mainly driven by religious differences, revenge, self defense, robbery of land or riches, or a reason other than NO GOD DAMN REASON AT ALL just for attention. Those are the murders I'm referring to. Not every murder. I can say McDonald's burgers suck and you people would think I said all meat sucks everywhere.  </TEXT>

It is giving attention to murderers and giving them what they want and the courage to carry out their killings.
