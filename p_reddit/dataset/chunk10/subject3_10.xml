	<TEXT> 1) Read this article for step by step [guide to take SSL certificate and install it](http://www.seotipsit.com/convert-http-to-https-using-rapidssl-certificate-clickssl-and-hostgator-details/). It is an example for free SSL certificate and the basic process to take SSL certificate.

2) If there is no key and certificate that mean website/web page don't have SSL certificate so yes, communication will be not be encrypted.

3) The things which you know are basic but to secure website/web page as per [SSL type](https://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/types-ssl-certificates-choose-right-one) then many things remain to know by you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> HTTPs is the necessity for websites now, because the browser has started to give warning in the web browser for the non-secure website.

HTTPs is very secure and with the help of it, snooper can't crack information transferred between the user and the browser.

Yes, it may happen that website within which you are dealing is not enabled by SSL certificate or https but still, you want to deal with it especially within your confidential information then avoid this type of website or you can give feedback about the website security to the website owner for future use.

But yes as per recent updates from major browsers that they are [displaying warning for non secure pages](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/firefox-chrome-start-calling-http-connections-insecure/) then yes if any external pages which were set on http and given as external link from your website then the reputation of the website (which linked with your website) will decrease not your website.

So, the conclusion is that try to give https links as external link. </TEXT>

You can find above brands ssl certificate at affordable cost from trusted resellers/partners like below:

	<TEXT> Taking domain name is not helping you out. After domain purchasing, you have to take its hosting too because without it your domain/website will not get storage space and access on www. You can get both domain and hosting at affodable price with famous hosting providers like namecheap, godaddy, hostgator etc.

But after all set for hosting and domain, the next step is website design for which as per you told not so much confident you are. 

So in this case, I would like to suggest you go for good web designing service (but for that you have already told you can't afford).

That's why after that there is also two options remain with you:

Take domain and hosting at this time and design website by your own by learning web design.

Take help of free website builder services listed below and forget about taking hosting and domain:

http://www.wix.com/

https://www.websitebuilder.com/

https://www.weebly.com/

https://us.webnode.com/

https://www.yola.com/

Note: One disadvantage comes with this type of website is that your domain will become subdomain of the main domain.

**For example :**

If you set domain name business.com for weebly website builder service then your domain would be business.weebly.com </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Publicaly recognized ssl certificate means ssl certificate of trusted certificate authority which web browsers trust and will not give ssl warning (excluding there is some ssl errors while installing ssl certificate).

Whereas ssl certificate which is made by you is called as self signed certificate which will give error in browser as this connection is untrusted. That's why [certificate authority's ssl certificates are the best compared to self signed certificate](
