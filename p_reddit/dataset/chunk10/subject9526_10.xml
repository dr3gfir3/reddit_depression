	<TEXT> I've never used an e-book before so I know very little. Can I read books without a wifi connection? Are they easy to pack around and are they allowed on planes?

I'm thinking the Kindle Paperwhite looks like a good piece. If anyone can shed some light on whether or not a Kindle is worth it I would really appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] Lucio feels less impactful to play after the changes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-13 05:23:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, I think these changes are completely progressive. However, any Lucio main before these changes would tell you he is massively impactful, and nothing short of a satisfying hero to play. 

It kind of feels like I'm playing Mercy now. A Mercy who can use both her healing and pistol at the same time at the expense of them both being substantially weaker. 

His uniqueness feels kind of lost, perhaps to the much wider playerbase appeal that these changes are promoting. Some things seem to flat out counteract other things (Yeah, he's incredibly mobile now, but he has to stay inside a deathball to be of any use!)

The thing that hurts the most when I play is that speeding a teammate out of trouble (roadhog hook, D.Va ult) is basically exctinct now.

Lots of people probably feel opposed to everything I said, but I do really miss the old Lucio. There was something there that isn't anymore. Maybe it's okay that Lucio isn't for everybody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would definitely have to have an extremely readable emote or very slow projectile speed with that damage, but the pieces are there for sure. The only problem would be differentiating it from rein's fire strike in terms of being a unique ability </TEXT>

What would you say about something more along the lines of a "fix" or a "change" as opposed to a hard nerf? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Suggestion] Hanzo's scatter arrow should deal 40% of its base damage if it's broken against the ground </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-03 06:07:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Stairs don't count. 40% of base damage would equate to 168 damage if all arrows connect. 

I figure this would be a fair way to push some Hanzo players to become more creative with the scatter arrow. I know lots of people hate the seemingly skill-less tactic of aiming at the floor and firing for free kills. 

168 damage is still threateningly high for squishy heroes, but doesn't obliterate tanks either (No Winston main with minor chip damage likes to be instantly killed after jumping a hanzo).

This could mean scatter arrow would be used (more than it currently is) as it's described in the tutorial. I would be very hesitant to tilt if a Hanzo player used a wall or an object beside me to capitalize on full scatter arrow damage. 

What do you think? Is my percentage too low? Should we just leave scatter arrow alone? I'd love to hear your thoughts.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! I definitely figured that these specifics wouldn't have been perfectly panned out lore-wise. Although I have to say it leads to interesting speculation either way. 

I agree with Undead Settlement leading into Lothric as well. It would have been a very cool landmark before the fading fire now that I think about it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Lore] seeking clarification on the converging lands of the lords </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In Dark souls 3, we know that the lands of the Lords of Cinder converge upon Lothric castle as a result of the fading flame. However, being both relatively amateur in DS lore, and extremely nitpicky when it comes to cartography, I'm still unsure about which areas would actually have been connected before the convergence. 

For example, did the Undead Settlement run into Lothric Castle before the game's events? How about the Road of Sacrifices and Farron Keep? And then there's the Profaned Capital being directly under Irithyll (I find it strange that two very big cities would be so close together before the convergence). 

I assume Farron Keep was never actually close to the Undead Settlement due to their walls (One giant wall awkwardly running under an even more giant road lol).

I know these are lots of silly questions but I am hoping someone would be able to share the distinct difference between the areas, as well as ones related to each other.

I AM AVOIDING COMP FOR A WHILE, AND WHILE I CAN USUALLY DOMINATE IN QP, RECENTLY MY WIN RATE HAS BEEN (AND I AM NOT SHITTING YOU) ABOUT 25%. 

I COULD GO THROUGH THE USUAL YADDA YADDA ABOUT DOG SHIT TEAMS BUT HEY; ITS QP. CANT REALLY COMPLAIN THAT MUCH. EVEN SO, THE LEVEL OF DOWN RIGHT IDIOCY I HAVE WITNESSED ON MY TEAMS IS MIND BLOWING. 

WHAT DO YOU THINK, HAVE I TILTED MYSELF INTO A DEEP SPIRAL? SHOULD I TAKE A WEEK LONG BREAK? OR HAVE YOU GUYS NOTICED A CHANGE IN MATCHMAKING TOO?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A question about the master of rings achievement </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 02:02:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am unsure if this is true, but someone on here mentioned that you can find every ring (+0, +1, +2, +3) in Ng++.

I'm fairly confident that i missed a few +0 rings in my first playthrough, as i've moved on to Ng+ now. 

Is there a guide out there for people wanting to find all 100-something rings in Ng++? I already have a large amount of rings, but i feel that the achievement would just be easier if i quickly moved on to Ng++ and started a checklist fresh. 

This is only if I can actually find every ring on Ng++. Otherwise have i pretty much screwed myself by not finding 100% of the +0 rings on playthrough 1?

	<TITLE> Holy King Lothric and Lothric, Younger Prince: Are they the same person? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have always been confused as to whether or not Lothric is a King with a son by the same name. It seems possible that Prince Lothric could occupy both names for some reason, I guess.

"Holy King Lothric, last hope of his line." 

This sentence just sounds so colossal and really doesn't put the image of a tiny incapacitated prince in my mind. I imagined some badass, cursed king when i first read that. 

Does anyone know the lore?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it normal to solo queue in competitive play? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-20 06:31:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am relatively new to Overwatch and I am having an extremely hard time finding a good reason to even attempt competitive.

Whenever I solo queue I basically feel like I'm gambling. And I don't like it at all. I do understand that I myself am a significant contributor to our team's strength and therefore can't entirely blame our defeats on 'terrible teammates', but I still feel as if it's very black and white regarding whether or not you will be paired with teammates that can help you score a win. 

I really am giving it my all and trying my hardest to be as valuable an asset to the team as I can, but sometimes it just doesn't work, and i can understand that. 

When I queue with even just one friend, the communication and verbal support alone is enough to improve our win rate significantly, and even climb maybe a hundred Sr in a day. This has given me the incentive to completely avoid solo queuing unless I have a friend to play with. 

I know that most people tend to initially overestimate their skill level when it comes to competitive games. However, is it even logical for me to aspire to a higher rank without some friends and communication? Or do I just not have what it takes to consistently lead five teammates to victory, no matter their performance?

Sorry for the long text, I am just hoping some can shed some light on competitive play for me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Was Lothric Castle built in part out of a huge mountain or something? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-08 20:09:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always wondered how the castle sat on such an incredibly high landscape with relation to the surrounding mountains. At the point it's at shouldn't it be snowing up there?!

And if it was built out of an ancient mountain, I assume that the incredibly steep (and unnatural seeming) rock face that most of the kingdom sits upon could be chalked up to thousands of years of erosion or something. 

Any thoughts? Or did I miss something that was clearly explained?

	<TITLE> Question about the KitchenAid BCG111 grinder... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-29 02:08:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently received this grinder as a christmas gift and i can't seem to get the right grind consistency. 

I use about 1.5 aeropress scoops of beans for a 10oz cup and the finer grinds either get stuck on the bottom of the bowl or just fly right up and out over the edge. (the lid doesn't seem to completely seal this off even when pressed down).

I held the grinder on for about 30 seconds and stopped after i noticed how much coffee was flying out of the bowl.

I am quite new to brewing my own coffee and I am excited to be grinding my own beans. Is there something i should be doing to minimize such a huge mess?


Edit: here is what was left (stuck to the bowl) after i dumped out the loose [grinds](http://imgur.com/XwA0HfO)
