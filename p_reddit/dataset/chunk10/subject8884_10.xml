	<TEXT> My friends and I want to start a volunteer program at university to give makeovers to patients at the local hospital. I know that a cosmetology license is necessary if you're starting any kind of business doing makeup, hair, and nails, but does anyone know if this applies to a volunteering organization and not profiting? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This video is an awesome intro to a new youtuber for me! Being a smaller youtuber her setup isn't very sophisticated but you can tell she puts a lot of work into reviewing and researching the products. Plus her aesthetic and humour are both great. She really keeps it real. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sub stream games are different because at least he's interacting with chat. The backseating and him getting annoyed at the backseating are what make them fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my classmates pretend to care about these issues to look compassionate, but don't understand how mental illness affects behaviour.

Pretty much how I feel. Always reminds me of [that Hyperbole and a Half post about fish](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2013/05/depression-part-two.html). Hopefully I'll find people like you around who can truly relate :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I'm gonna get myself to my therapist again, pick up a hobby, and come up with better ways to keep myself focused and deal with my mental illness instead of letting it swallow me. And then I would be able to deal with my classes. Even if I still fail then I'll at least know that I tried my best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thank you. Sometimes I feel like most people here are only freaking out because they are used to complaining about their workload as a form of humblebrag- this weird, exaggerated facade that getting an A- is ruining their lives. Most of the people I know here don't struggle with mental illnesses and when I try to open up to them, they can't relate on the same level (like on this subreddit) and equate it to the humblebrag. There is almost never true vulnerability. 
I know people like me are out there, maybe eventually I'll find one of them </TEXT>
