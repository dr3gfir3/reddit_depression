  The Item I am interested in is:

	<TEXT> Just to piggy back on this, you can even break it into bundles and stick a price w/ pics.  All x-men, all flash, etc.  I love to buy comics but with 3 kids in 5 total sports, im on the run constantly and im positive there's stuff here id buy but its presented in a manner i just cant sort through easily on mobile.  Maybe id offer you something for the whole lot but i need precise inventory and pics of keys to validate grading.  Just as said above, not being a jerky boy, want to help you sell those sweet sweet comics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are some nice items in there.  If you don't mind, subreddit rules on the right side require that anything you are selling have a price.

*You MUST provide a value you want for your books/goods. We are no longer accepting "make an offer" posts. This creates a blind auction-type and competitive environment and is against the spirit of this subreddit.*

	<TEXT> There's a lot of excellent observations on here, especially about driving through town...my kids are all in activities and god forbid that those activities are anywhere near our house.  If I have to drive down O street...just shoot me.

Anyways, my point of posting was that recently it was mentioned in the newspaper that there is (was) only one person in charge of all the lights in Lincoln.  One, single, person.  They are now in the process of hiring more in anticipation of upgrading the traffic system in town over the next few years.  I want to say the article mentioned 30+ but I could be wrong.  This should correct most of the issues we've faced for the last...god forever it seems.  There have been a few articles on it, here are two I could find: 

* [Smarter intersections coming to Lincoln](http://journalstar.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/smarter-intersections-coming-to-lincoln/article_80ae18e5-5e97-57ac-bdb2-dd722f97c177.html)

* [City looking to smarter intersections, not wider streets in future](http://journalstar.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/city-looking-to-smarter-intersections-not-wider-streets-in-future/article_d6e28e89-e082-54aa-a151-47b285ba5be4.html)


I am not sure where we are on the time table but one article I read, which I cannot find now, said it would take a few years.  I've welcomed the introduction of the flashing yellow arrow which allows us a longer turn duration but I've also been behind folks that do not know what to do so they just sit there.  When I honk, I get the finger.  :(
  Anyways...for a long time resident who hates driving through town, I thought you would all enjoy what I hope brings us quicker commutes.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know I am late to the party.  I only wanted to try add to the excellent advice already provided.  At this moment in my life, I am primarily a "buyer" looking for a wide range of comics.   I am also a parent with 3 kids in 8 bajillion activities so I am almost always mobile and on the go.  These recommendations are based on things that have caused me some frustration and to move past a posting.

* 1.)  Clear and concise description of items.  What I mean by that is that simply putting "Spider-man #17" is confusing to me.  I would prefer:  "Amazing Spider-man Vol. 1 #17 (1964)".  This saves me time from having to look at the pic, on mobile, and know which of the dozens of "Spider-man #17" there are.  By the time I understand what is being offered, it may be gone or I've spent 10 minutes to learn it's not an item I care about.

* 2.)  Clear and concise description of condition.  I know most of us are not graders, I am not, but if there is a mark or a crease or a something we should note when looking at the provided pics, that is great.  If you were to say, there is an indent by the top staple, then I can pay close attention and see if its of concern for me.  If its a $1 comic, who cares, but if its a $150...please share.

* 3.)  Pictures; clear and provided at the time of posting.  A few times I've seen posts something like this:  "here are my comics...I'll post pics in a day or two b/c I am busy".     Why did you post then??  We are going to ask for pics anyway just wait and do it at once.  Those posts will usually fall back a page and I will forget about them unless its a super key issue.  Or if the pic is blurry, upside down, in a dark room on someones colorful bedsheet...blarg.  Good pics, clear and easy to see please.

* 4.)  Price reasonably.  I track prices on a lot of items or I will check on a few other sites.  Folks on here are savvy and do the same.  I would rather pay a little more for the security of Ebay or the google groups I am on then on Reddit.  With that said, I've spent around $700 on comics here.  I've gotten several of the keys I've wanted and its always been a very positive experience.  Folks on here rock!  :)

Looking forward to what you have to offer.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certainly as a parent, if you feel this crossed a boundary then feel free to discuss it with your teacher and tell your child its ok to say no.

However, as you are asking for feedback, I think this is perfectly fine and normal.  Outside of a few exceptions, teachers are amazing and only care for the well being our children.  Perhaps she was worried your child would choke on it or maybe this was preventing them for eating lunch.  Would you want the teacher to let these things happen?   I would ask myself, what would I have the teacher do instead.  If you feel there are better options for your family, that is what you share with the teacher.

Teachers do all sorts of things, wipe poopy butts (it happens in kindergarten), wipe runny, snotty noses, scoop up puke and so on.  I would want the teacher to do what is, in their judgement, the best for our child in any of those situations.

If they gave a child a hair cut, I would think that is crazy.  Removing a dangling tooth, its happened to all of our children at least once. They even get a special little tooth shaped case to bring it home in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Came here to say the same.  Toys and games have pointed to DarkHawk being in GotG and comic speculators have started to snatch up the available copies of DarkHawk #1 in response.  Whether or not Stallone is this character...I am not sure, I am not very familiar with him.  Reading through Wikipedia, I can see where it could work, specially if there is a Richard Ryder - Nova.  It's at least worth adding this to the conversation.

###
EDIT

and now this morning I see that James Gunn said no DarkHawk.."and Adam Warlock  will not appear in GotGVol2". NOOO! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP here...I hope no one minds me posting this story, even if its a little old.  When I was home visiting my folks for christmas, they gave my son a copy of the local paper with this story knowing how much he would enjoy it.  
 nbsp;

  A quick backstory...about a year ago, we had to move my Grandmother from IL to an assisted living facility near my folks in Nebraska.  She is struggling with Dementia but she is in a safe environment, well cared for and my mother gets to visit her everyday.  
 nbsp;

  Of course, our entire family are all huge Cub fans (Ages 6 - 98) and whenever any of us visit my grandmother we are always wearing something with that big beautiful Cubs logo on it.  
 nbsp;

  Anyways, we were there in the spring and a resident stopped my son (must have noticed his Cubs hat) and said, "Hey, my neighbor used to play for the Cubs, you should go by and visit him sometime"...he then walked on down the hall.  
 nbsp;

  Now remember, we are in an assisted living facility for folks with Dementia and just didn't know what to think.  They are all wonderful folks and we love to visit with them but figured this person may just be confused and simply proceeded with our day.  However, over the last year, my son would bring it up on occasion and we'd wonder if there was a long lost Cub player just down the hall from my Grandmother, a huge Cubs fan.  Apparently there is.  
 nbsp;

  My son and I will see if we can visit with him next time we are in town and take my Grandmother over there to meet him.  She'll be tickled. </TEXT>

Also you mentioned ASM, I'd be interested in issues:  161, 210, 212, 272.  Would you have any pics   estimated grade and what you are looking at for price?

	<TEXT> I'm definitely interested in New Mutants #1 @ $18 and possibly Marvel Premiere #47.  I typically just paypal b/c I'm a hoarder (lol) but I did just acquire a few items you might want.  Not suggesting a straight up trade but thought I'd see where we can end up at.


* Power Man   Iron Fist #125 (nm).
* MARVEL TEAM-UP ANNUAL #4 (nm).
* Defenders #18 (vf - think it could be pressed for a bump in grade, maybe).

I can get some pics later this afternoon if you think you might want those.    The two you have $18 + $60 = $78.  With my trades, how about $60 with shipping included?  I'd ship mine to you at my cost of course.

If you think you'd be interested, let me know.  Thanks!

	<TEXT> It's one of the hottest comics right now, if not the #1 sought after and totally a sellers market.  I've been watching it in a few places and I think the price is a little inflated and can vary wildly from site to site.  The prices I am seeing folks pay for this comic are really surprising ($300 for a raw NM??).  It may calm down a bit until the movie comes out but for the same or less money, there may be a better comic to invest in that we know will continue to gain value.  I'll be interested to hear other peoples take or recommendation.  Like I said, I'm watching too and hopefully I'll find one in the wild for a fair price.  

I was going to try and pick up issue #10 but I just watched the prices jump up on that literally overnight.  Had it in my cart, got busy, came back this morning, tears.

Good luck and happy hunting </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just providing some details for others that may be interested.  I only posted this in case I was missing something that may make another deal more worth while.  You were quite certain the other place was cheaper so I thought I'd see if maybe I was overlooking something obvious.

I also don't see where you said shipping was free in your original post:

Still not as good a deal as ordering off instocktrades (if you're in the U.S.).... (is Barnes and Noble international?).

  If that's the case, that's good to know for future reference.

-edit.  You had asked if it was price from third party seller.  I am not sure, it doesn't indicate that it is.  Here is how it appears in my cart: http://imgur.com/jIxCbfq </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, maybe I'm missing something, but if I want to get the 3 GL Omnibus, BN has the best deal:

**BN:**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 1* - **79.08**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 2* - **64.46** *(Free b/c of promo)*

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 3* - **81.25**

**Total = 160.33 + $11.22 tax = $171.55** *plus free shipping for orders over $25.*

**InStockTrades.com:**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 1* - **68.75**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 2* - **54.99**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 3* - **68.75**

**Total = 192.49**  *(not sure on shipping)*

**Amazon:**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 1* - **78.12**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 2* - **63.20**

* *Green Lantern by Geoff Johns Omnibus Vol. 3* - **67.54**

**Total = 208.86** *plus free 2 day shipping (prime member)*

  In my case, the B N deal is by far the better one.  $20.94 cheaper than the site you mentioned and even more if they charge for shipping.  Ultimately shop around and make sure you are getting the best deal no matter when you make your purchase. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My daughter is 6 and plays t-ball on an all boys team.  I am always proud that she pays pretty close attention but its not uncommon for her to look at the clouds or draw something in the dirt, or any kid for that matter.  When she was at bat in her last game, the catcher from the other team kept saying, "I'm a Dog!" and rolling around in the dirt in full catcher gear.  She looked up at me with the "you got to be kidding me" face.

  There are usually 3 kids playing the in the dirt, one throwing their hat in the air, another crying for some reason and one chasing a butterfly.  It's sort of a giant cute parade of chaos.  You can only laugh and enjoy it.  Again, these kids are six and going into first grade.  Your child is only four and totally 100% normal and to be expected.  I bet if you look close, the other kids are no different.  There are kids in my sons games (he's nearly 13) that occasionally loses focus...hell even pros do.

  The most important thing, they make friends and have fun.  As they get older, that will evolve into a love of the game and desire to get better.  Or not, and that's totally ok. </TEXT>
