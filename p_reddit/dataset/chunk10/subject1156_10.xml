	<TEXT> How limited will Yates be?
Democrats have pinned a lot of hopes on Yates, privately promising blockbuster testimony from the former Obama administration official. But a key question is how much she will be limited in public, either through questions regarding classified material, promises of attorney-client privilege or claims of executive privilege from either Trump or Obama.
Yates' first public hearing was scheduled for six weeks ago, but it was canceled at the last minute by Trump ally and House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes. Reports later emerged that the White House blocked her testimony, which press secretary Spicer vehemently denied.
Monday's hearing comes a week after FBI Director James Comey spoke to the full Judiciary Committee as well as House investigators. Comey, too, was limited in what he could say, citing an active investigation. As senators tried to pry any bit of information out of him, Comey beat back questions about the continuing federal probe into Russian interference in the US elections, and he likewise revealed few new details to the House intelligence committee. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. What was the extent of Yates' warning?
Yates told White House staff and other top officials that Flynn could be a security risk after he discussed Russia sanctions with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak, CNN reported last week. That testimony is expected to contradict the White House's description of her warning, framed by press secretary Sean Spicer as "a 'heads-up' to us on some comments that may have seemed in conflict with what he (Flynn) had sent the vice president."
Trump on Twitter Monday blamed the Obama administration for giving Flynn, who briefly led the Defense Intelligence Agency during the 44th president's tenure, "the highest security clearance." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is surprisingly difficult to estimate levels of voter turnout by race. Unlike the forthcoming report from the Current Population Survey, Catalists estimates are based not on self reports but on actual turnout records. Since most states do not ask voters about their racial/ethnic background, Catalist usually estimates this information from the voters name and neighborhood.

According to recent research, Catalist correctly predicts race/ethnicity about 91 percent of the time. Further, we use Catalists estimates of voter race for both 2012 and 2016. If Catalists estimates are wrong, theyre likely wrong in a consistent way  and so any differences we find in the electorates racial composition are accurate.

The denominator we use to calculate turnout rates is an estimate of the citizen voting-age population (CVAP) by race in November 2012 and November 2016, respectively. To construct this estimate, we use the Census Bureaus Population Estimates Program data to calculate the voting-age population in each state by race, and then use American Communities Survey information on citizenship rates to remove the (often substantial) noncitizen population for each racial/ethnic group. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The House narrowly passed legislation, known as the American Health Care Act,  in a 217-213 vote, fulfilling a years-long campaign pledge and sending the bill to the Senate.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), a member of GOP leadership, also signaled that Republicans are focused on getting a deal that can pass rather than sticking to a specific timeline.
I cant imagine there will be a rush to take up the bill as much as a real concentrated effort to find where the 51 votes might be if the 51 votes are still available, he told reporters.  

The House GOP bill is expected to have to undergo significant changes in the upper chamber to meet budgetary rules that would allow it to block a Democratic filibuster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai says advocates of net neutrality are misrepresenting his plan to roll back the controversial Obama-era internet rules.

For example, saying that you will lose your internet access. Thats simply absurd, Pai told Recodes Decode podcast on Wednesday.

"Anyone who had internet access before these rules in 2015 knows that thats not the case. We werent living in a dystopia before the FCC delivered these Depression-era rules to save us, he added.
In the interview, Pai defended his plan to end net neutrality, arguing it would help foster competition in the telecommunications industry by making it easier for smaller broadband providers to grow and gain market share. </TEXT>

"The events of the past few days have shown whatever our wishes there are some in Brussels who do not want talks to succeed," May said. tThe "misrepresentation" of Britain's Brexit negotiation was timed to affect the election outcome </TEXT>
