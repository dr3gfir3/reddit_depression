I just got out of a 8 month relationship and have jumped back in. Downloaded tinder over the weekend and so far have 11 matches, talked to 3, 1 has responded. Haven't gotten any matches in a few days though. Before my relationship I did fairly well with tinder, 60+ matches, good conversations and 3-4(don't remember) dates.

Maybe I'm just uglier now. Do your worst please, I need some good criticism 

Bio:

I definitely watch more Netflix than you so I can show you all the good shows.

Feed me sour candy and tell me I'm pretty

You is 100% of the shots you don't take and that is why my bank account is so low after the weekend

That isn't my dog, but hopefully you don't care

	<TEXT> First time commenting here. Used to lurk.

Just got out of an 8 month relationship and downloaded tinder a few days ago. Only 11 matches so far I messaged 2 but no response. This will be harder that I thought. Last time I had tinder I didn't do so bad, 60+ matches, a lot of talking and 3 meets/hookups. Seems the game has changed.

Gonna do a profile review so you can all be brutally honest at how much I suck.

There is one girl that I am head over heels for that matched with me and I'm messaging her later tonight so hopefully it all goes well

Other than that breakups suck, especially at a small school like mine. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lifting Goals during the summer. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-19 02:06:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Current Big 3 Maxes (1 rep):

Squat: 245lbs

Bench: 195lbs

Deadlift: 335lbs

Working Sets (3x5):

Squat: 215lbs

Bench: 165lbs

Deadlift: 295lbs

My goal by the end of the summer is to hit 225, 315 and 405 on bench, squat and deadlift respectively. I'm currently following the ICF program(3x5 version). My training will begin the 2nd full week of June(going on a 3 week study abroad trip tomorrow) and I hope to hit these numbers by the 2nd or 3rd week of August.

My main goal is to hit these numbers for one rep each, but I would love to be able to hit these numbers for sets. I did some calculations and it seems that it would take me 7-8 weeks to reach my bench and deadlift numbers and 6-7 weeks to reach my squat number. This is without any deloads and almost constant progress. My question is, is it better to work towards the goal of a one rep max for each, or to work towards the goal of preforming sets?

Any comments or suggestions would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If we keep advancing I think the defining image will come next series.

Most likely we will face off against the Lightning. I believe after a 1-2 start against them we come back in Game 5 to secure a 3-2 lead where someone scores an OT winner or late 3rd period goal. Or on the other end of the spectrum...Murray shuts the door in a one goal game and as the buzzer sounds the Pens jump on him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that. I just wanted to talk about a part of all this that it seems people have overlooked. In no way am I condoning what he said or giving him a pass. In what I saw in the orginial thread was that people were mad that he didn't stop and think of what to say during that heated moment. I'm arguing that it isn't that easy to do and people should realize that.

I agree that what Shaw said was completely wrong. I just wanted to point out another view of the situation. People say things in rage and with a clearer mind they regret them for the most part. Unfortunately it was on national television and reflects poorly on all parties. I bet Shaw does regret saying it and it should be handled appropriately. But those that want suspension shouldn't be disappointed when he doesn't get one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I would really like to say on the issue would probably just get downvoted to oblivion without a reasonable discussion so I'll say this...

In the heat of the moment people can say anything. Anger takes over and you are just spitting out anything to get your point across. There are those moments were you just can't control yourself. Shaw most likely had one of those moments. Everyone has. I remember a specific time where I had the same moment. I said derogatory things. Do I say those things on a regular basis, in normal conversation? Absolutely not and would never, I know better. But when rage takes over sometimes you lose control of emotions.

Shaw lost control of his emotions and I bet he regrets it, it happens sometimes, especially in a very tense and emotional setting like the NHL Playoffs. Calling for his head is just a way to make y'all feel better about this thing. Chances are he will offer a public apology and recieve a fine for all his actions. And that is what should happen. He shouldn't be suspended for being emotional.

That's just my 2 cents. </TEXT>

1st Date: 12/12/15. The day the Pittsburgh Penguins hired Mike Sullivan and we began an historic turnaround into the playoffs and became one of the most dangerous teams in the league.

2nd Date: 4/13/16. The day the Pittsburgh Penguins began on of the most amazing playoff runs in NHL history. Truly a sight to behold.

And finally...

3rd Date: TBA. The day the Pittsburgh Penguins lifted their 4th Stanley Cup in franchise history, catapulted by a core group of some of the greatest players of this generation.

This is it...This is our destiny. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still in college so obviously there is an immense drinking culture. Especially at the small private school I go to where the only thing to do on weekends is drink from dusk to dawn.

Unfortunately I can't follow down that path anymore as I've been diagnosed with substance-induced mood disorder, which basically means if I have too much to drink I run the risk of becoming severely depressed or angry. Last time it happened I was forced to go to the hospital after campus police got involved. Really made me look at things in a different light. My buddies and I are all heavy drinkers so putting down 10-12 a night wasn't a big deal. Now though my view has changed to where I must limit my intake or abstain from drinking all together.

At least there are no more raging hangovers and I can make a few bucks off DDing. </TEXT>
