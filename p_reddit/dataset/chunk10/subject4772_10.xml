	<TITLE> The Evil Within (2017) The spiritual successor to "The Room" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 10:17:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I finished watching this and have no idea what its about or gone on, this is as if The Room crossed Forrest Gump as a horror movie. Dialogue is hilarious "You think i'm a stupid mongoloid?", tons of exposition, dream sequences that cut to a different random guy and his own story... all with those sweet practical effects.

Andrew Getty the person who made this passed away before this movie was completed and had a decade of post production spent on "perfecting it". One thing this has in common with "The Room" is the dedication and belief exhausted into both projects. 

https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/mar/14/the-evil-within-horror-movie-andrew-getty-millionaire-meth

To turn out as hilarious as it has is a testament to the little guys that want their project to materialize without intentionally making trash like Sharknado or 50 Shades of Black etc.

This is more competently made than the room though. Highly recommend watching this fucked up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need help getting Siegward Of Caterina to appear in the well at cleansing chapel?

Here's a rundown of what iv'e done.

- Against the fire demon from earlier in the game he helped me and did not die in the battle.

- At cleansing chapel iv'e opened both locked door to the left and right of the bonfire, iv'e also killed both giants and raised both bridges.

- Now I have no idea how to get up those bridges and i'm up to the part where I catch that lift to the rooftops and head to rosaria's fingers. Apparently if I make it there I will block Unbreakable Patches from showing up hence ruining Siegwald's quest? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because it's on primetime and they also have encore episodes which all get factored in the ratings. Part of the reason "Big Bang Theory" is the most watched comedy ever, is it's usually on at 7pm and three back to back episodes take it to 8:30pm.

It's messed up that we got breaking bad, walking dead and eastbound   down on free to air at one point but they got the graveyeard shift with no episode continuity. Sometimes it's on at 11:30pm on Mondays, then the next Monday it's suddenly not and got moved to wednesdays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rich guy makes his own bets, as does my dad. But they sit next to each other and chat. Maybe a few times a sesh he'll give him $50 for my dad to bet with and says they'll split whatever comes up (if anything).

Rich guy is not disabled he can walk to the teller and place his own bet, just gave my dad the money and my dad picked the numbers, wrote the ticket and put it into the teller all under the impression he also has a stake in the bet.

Well yes.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (AUS QLD) My father and his "buddy" made a bet together, but the "buddy" gave him a minuscule amount of the winnings. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-03 11:17:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just wanted to check and see if my dad can get some money out of this if we got a lawyer or if it's a lesson learned don't repeat scenario.


My dad is a regular at the TAB, goes about 2-3 times a week with about $100 each time more as a hobby than addiction. He's older and the friendly chatty type. He usually stays for 4hrs betting $3-8 per bet. To explain his "buddy" in context, he's not really a friend but more of an acquaintance you see every now and again. Try and imagine a guy at your gym that you chat with at the gym and get along well with, but don't hang out or talk or anything outside of the gym.


So this buddy is older and loaded, made a fortune investing in property and is enjoying his retirement in contrast to my dad who does not own anything of value and drives a shitbox (but he's still  employed for his age). He goes to the TAB about 3-5 days a week with 8k or so and does the same as my dad but with larger bets etc. $70 trifecta compared to my dad who would do a $4 trifecta.


They get to know each other a bit and sit next to each other talking about their personal life, horses etc. and this buddy begins to trust my dad.


So here we go.

My dad makes his own bets with his own money as does his buddy, and for about the last 6 months his buddy would give my dad $50 every now and again and say something like "bet it all in one go, whatever happens we split it" this guy is absolutely loaded remember, his mid 30's son is basically on an allowance living it up.


Usually not much happens, my dad always returns the ticket to him after writing it then putting it into the teller. And on this one occasion a ticket paid out close to 8k. My dad having previously bet in a race for himself decided he'll just do the same bet again with his buddies money but for a larger dividend etc. Dads ticket cost $8 for 44% of the winnings, while the other dudes ticket cost $50 for about 300%. My dad physically goes up to the teller to put his buddies ticket in and also picked the winning numbers. (The employee at this place knows my dad is not a big gambler if it helps). My dad could win $5k and will still only bet up to $8 in any race.


So same thing as normal when he gave my dad the $50 "whatever happens we split". We had a birthday party to attend that afternoon and my dad left the TAB earlier than normal and missed the entire bet which his buddy collects the winnings from solo. He got me to check his $8 ticket which was a winner and was ecstatic to realize he gets half of his buddies ticket too.


So after a couple days they bump back into each other at the TAB and his buddy says "we only had it for about 90%, I got around 2k and lost it all. Iv'e got $700 on me right now here you can have $200" which he accepted in spite. (The claim he got 2k is a lie, my dad knows! he wrote the ticket! as his $8 ticket was an exact copy but for less winnings) the buddy did not know that my dad also won on the same race so I guess he's trying to misinform him.


It absolutely pisses me off that this rich guy would F my dad over like this, 4k would help our family out alot but is just spare change to this guy. I want to check with you guys if there's anything we can do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a movie buff, rest of the family is not. Recently had my brother in law come over and go through my movies to put on something... he has not seen 70% of them and gets to Prometheus.

"That's my favorite movie! i'll put that on" :/

It does seem the theory that the majority of people just want to see what they already are familiar with is true.

Also all I want in a summer blockbuster could be something like The Mummy with Brendan Fraser but about Atlantis and it's never going to happen because studious are heavily investing in proven franchises and superhero properties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sharks winning streak last year was HUGE, yet because they couldn't surpass the old record from ages ago it's been entirely glossed over. 

Also those old margin and tryscoring records are retarded because of how different the game was back then.

I for one, when regarding statistics and records want it to only go back to 2001. So we can stop comparing teams/players 50 years apart. </TEXT>
