	<TEXT> There's never a bad time to start therapy. I know for me, it helps me sort out my feelings and feel a little more sane. It may do the same for you. Sure talking to friends and family helps, but they're not professionally trained to help people work through anxiety.

Additionally, if you're on meds that aren't helping you then you should revisit your psychiatrist.  Good luck, and I hope you're able to enjoy your special day even through all of the calamity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Therapy helped me a lot. 

I also started revealing some of my racing thoughts to my husband when I was feeling particularly awful. It was cathartic for me and hopefully helped him understand me better, but not everyone can handle that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to see a psychiatrist and therapist ASAP if you're having suicidal thoughts. Although your ex helps you feel safe, he is not professionally trained. Seeing a random person about this is scary, but worth it in the end. ::Hugs::
