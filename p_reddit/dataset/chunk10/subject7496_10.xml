	<TEXT> I use vorbis/ogg for everything, because of licensing. It may be less supported than mp3 or aac (so check your game engine), but I don't have to worry about some weird licensing costs in some countries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think deal with Oreo is more probable than deal with Nutella was. You can make at least oreo-cookie in the shape of android (like kitkat one), with nutella what could you do? Jars with android drawing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got from g5 to plat in 1 week in my first season (6) playing only Sona. Now I play mostly Zyra sup and I'm p2 (trying to get dia). Counters don't matter so much in the lower ratings, just picks champs that you like and are at least OK (don't play terrible champs with 40% winrates if you want to climb easily).

About being stuck: You have to realize what is your problem. Is it you? Are you winning your lane most of the matches? If no, are you more usefull in teamfights than your lane opponent? If you own your lane opponent in most of matches and make no use of it it's also mistake. Make cs lead, try to get 1-2 kills on him, push lane and roam to use your strength around the map. 

If you want to learn about specific champs i suggest to watch video of one-trick-ponies of them on youtube or twitch.

If you want to get general-knowledge about game I recommend series from: https://www.youtube.com/user/HuzzyGames/videos (Unranked to Diamond) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I often use sounds from websites like http://www.freesfx.co.uk/  and add notes about them in credits. Just google free sounds / music and you will find a lot of them. When you use sounds take a look at license if it is something like cc0 or cc-by (need for credit) etc.
For music this is great site: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/ </TEXT>
