	<TEXT> You posted me on /r/Gatekeeping which makes absolutely no sense, I absolutely cannot stand socialism, or any government handouts. I'm a libertarian. 

I'm simply correcting you, the ideology you stated that you pursue, is not socialism. 

Socialism is Venezuela. Go look at its current news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only 'definition changes' are ones perpetrated by people who believe in a philosophy but don't want it associated with a previous failure. Communism is a form of socialism, and both have complete control over the means of production. An ideology does not change definition. Only the people change. You are not a socialist. </TEXT>

I'm sorry, but that's not socialism.

What you're referring to is state capitalism.

Socialism still has complete control over the means of production. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do I think socialism is good? Yes

Can I be so dear as to ask why? Have you taken any economics courses? Are you aware of the result of the USSR, Venuzeuala, Cuba, North Korea, Hungary, Poland, Somalia, Egypt, Lybia, Iraq, etc?

Humans are naturally good. People donate, give to charities, adopt, and privately help people suffering under the poverty line. The people who get into power are never good people, so why wouldn't you want to minimize the size of the state rather than have the state be your church when it comes to whether or not you'll be able to eat tonight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry but I really don't understand what we are doing celebrating this win.

1: Macrons entire campaign was created by Frances previous socialist president.

2: He loves the EU.

3: His Friday email leaks were pretty ehhhhh, he even compared himself to Hillary about it.

4: Former Rothschild banker.

5: Had opinion polls before his campaign in order to be able to say exactly what the public wanted. All of his opinions are crafted, extremely unlikely to be the truth.

6: Since when did we like centrism? Libertarianism is far right by all aspects.

7: A right wing statist that would bring them out of the EU is much better than a left wing authoritarian that sucks the EUs dick.

I don't like either of them. But by no definition should we be preferring Macron. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to sleep with you. No I don't mean have sex. I mean sleep. Together. Under a blanket. In your bed. While you're laying on my arm, with my other hand on your tummy. With the window cracked, so it's chilly and we have to cuddle closer. No talking, just the muffled cries that you slowly let seep away from your blood gurgling mouth as I slit your throat and sacrifice your worthless life to the dark overlord. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Jewish as well. I honestly am still finding my place on the topic of Israel. I can see as a fact that it's very corrupt, but I also see sides such as the natural inclining for Christians to help Israel because it's known as the chosen people, as well as the fact that they have much lesser discriminatory standards of most of the middle East. The entire middle East is a very strange subject for me. There's problems riddled everywhere, and I can never pinpoint the blame on one individual or state. Israel is usually an outlier. Always in a strange position. I have absolutely no doubts about the Holocaust. My grandmother still lives in Israel, and I Skype with her every morning. She definitely loves the country, though old she may be she is in no way evil and if anything cropped up there I believe she would be vocal. That could also mean that the government is good at keeping their people out of the know, however.

I'm just a confused teenager on the topic, if you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask because it'll probably help me as well. </TEXT>
