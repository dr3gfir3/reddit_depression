The article is still talking about the play on the page where the posted photo was featured but when this photo is called out they are talking about The Tonight Show and use the phrase first bloom which I thought was a double entendre about the flowers and her first nude shoot. I assumed all of the color nudes were from the playing card shoot which the article describes as in the mid 1960s on Page 23 and her earliest nudes [on the cover.](http://i.imgur.com/rf4gYY4.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am now almost certain the posted photo was taken at the southeast corner of Summer and Atlantic in front of South Station looking generally north. Comparing [a section of the Getty photo](http://i.imgur.com/AJPY9Ev.png) to [one of the photos in this series](http://i.imgur.com/LaaxqY1.png) shows 6 objects that match with the only difference being the second sign that you have pointed out. This sign must have been added sometime between the two photos.

In addition to the objects the shadows generally line up and in the background of the companion to the posted photo you can see gas pumps. In the 1955 Boston directory there is a service station at 184 Summer, see R A F Service near the [top left of this page](https://archive.org/stream/bostondirectoryi02bost#page/1695/mode/1up), which is the northeast corner of Summer and Atlantic.

	<TEXT> When you say two at right angles at the real SS, I assume you mean the tunnel entrance at the southeast corner of Summer and Atlantic which can be seen left of center in the Getty image previously linked. It looks like there was and still is a tunnel entrance at each corner of Summer and Atlantic. Reference the Getty image previous linked, [this photo](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:8c97mg28m), [this photo](https://www.digitalcommonwealth.org/search/commonwealth:8c97mj90h) and [this google street view.](https://www.google.com/maps/@42.3523938,-71.0549001,3a,75y,300.61h,83.25t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sw42EddqZl8GM61HsGPmfSg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656)

There was [a streetcar route on Summer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boston-area_streetcar_lines#7) and as you pointed out there is a streetcar in the background of some of the photos. It would make sense that all those sailors would be at the train station. Based on this and the other clues mentioned my gut feeling is the photo was taken near South Station but I can't prove it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SunCalc appears to be using the users local time and not the time at the chosen location. When I use the NOAA Solar Calculator where the time zone is a variable I get the same results as you. I am on CST so that means the time of the photo was closer to 8 am than 10 am. None of the Operation Teapot tests match that time frame. Maybe the article is wrong about the 1955 build date of the pool and it really is 1953. [The Dixie, Encore and Grable tests of Operation UpshotKnothole in 1953 were at 7:30 am.](http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Upshotk.html) It is not Dixie because it had [a mushroom "cap" but no stem.](http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2012/05/18/friday-image-the-dixie-showgirl-1953/) I found some images that are indicated to be of Encore and [one of them](https://i.imgur.com/pYtaNmU.jpg) matches [this other photo](https://i.imgur.com/OjQogdo.png) taken just after the posted photo. [This image of Encore from wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Upshot-Knothole_Encore_(1953\).jpg) also looks similar and the images I have seen of [Grable](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Upshot-Knothole_Grable_007.jpg) don't seem to match very well. I will try to verify the pool build date through another source but until I can do that I now think the photo is of the Operation Upshot-Knothole Encore test.

Edit: About a quarter of the way down on [this page](http://www.lvstriphistory.com/ie/fron1950.htm) it says the new pool was under construction in August of 1952 and [one of the photos in this series is at Getty Images](http://www.gettyimages.com/license/515279938) with a date of May 8, 1953 which is the date of the Operation Upshot-Knothole Encore test. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look further down on the Operation Teapot link past the Wasp test on Feb 18. The Wasp prime test was at 10 am on Mar 29. Also look at the other tests. Most are before daylight. Anyway if the sign changeovers from The Last Frontier to the New Frontier happened after April 4 then a couple other Operation Teapot tests are possiblilities.

[The old pool](http://digital.library.unlv.edu/objects/sky/170) was between the highway and the front of the hotel. [The pool pictured](http://digital.library.unlv.edu/objects/sky/79) is in the courtyard and is definitely the new pool.

The original posting of the photo [here](http://totalfratmove.com/dad-pulled-this-picture-out-and-said-i-dont-think-the-middle-east-would-be-happy-if-i-went-back-tfm/) a few years ago indicates that he was in the middle east. So probably during the Gulf War. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The full caption for this photo when it appeared in the October 1939 issue of National Geographic was: [Far from railroads or main highways, a combined post office and general store forms the whole "town" of Castolon. It is a survival of pioneer days, carrying everything from horse collars and lanterns to cheese, crackers, and bear traps.](http://i.imgur.com/pVcJNZM.png)

Note that the this is a [Dufaycolor process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dufaycolor) color photo and not a colorized photo.

Also the photo in [a previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheWayWeWere/comments/60uim3/post_office_and_general_store_in_castolon_texas/) which also taken for this article shows the post office mentioned in the caption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [The source at the Library of Congress](http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/ncl2004003081/PP/) indicates that the year is 1913.

The full caption reads: 11:30 A.M. Jennie Rizzandi, 9 year old girl, helping mother and father finish garments in a dilapidated tenement, 5 Extra Pl., N.Y.C. They all work until 9 P.M. when busy, and make about $2 to $2.50 a week. Father works on street, when he has work. Jennie was a truant, "I staid home 'cause a lady was comin'."

[This is a google photo sphere looking at 5 Extra Place](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Extra/@40.7249446,-73.9914269,3a,90y,292.13h,97.18t/data=!3m8!1e1!3m6!1s-yBpCZCg2IFc%2FVk0wENZgiXI%2FAAAAAAABKaY%2FSzOCf83tZVU!2e4!3e11!6s%2F%2Flh4.googleusercontent.com%2F-yBpCZCg2IFc%2FVk0wENZgiXI%2FAAAAAAABKaY%2FSzOCf83tZVU%2Fw203-h101-n-k-no%2F!7i8704!8i4352!4m5!1m2!2m1!1sExtra+Place,+New+York,+NY!3m1!1s0x0000000000000000:0x68e06a7e628e1613!6m1!1e1?hl=en) but the building was [built in 1920](http://www.realdirect.com/e/report/1004570005/free-real-estate-report-for-parcel-1004570005/) so it is probably not the same building that is in the photo. </TEXT>
