	<TEXT> I understand the relief of low blood pressure and weaker heart bumps for false alarm anxiety, but 50bpm sounds scary low to me. Is it sustainable without health issues over the long run? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really worry too much and don't have anything to worry about. I have a job (filing paperwork) where I am waiting anxiously to see the outcome of things I did like 2-3 months ago. I am pretty much always in the mood "WOW, really? who knows what's gonna happen next". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, we discussed beta blockers (nebivolol in my case) because of my high BP and heart rate, but we will only try this if xanax doesnt solve the problem directly from the brain.

The reason I visited a doctor at all was high blood pressure that made me feel like I will have a heart attack. (140/100)

Thank you so much for your answers. Makes me feel better that you can guess so accurately like this is a common issue. I left my doctor having some doubts she knows what she is doing while I am having some rare weird condition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah it was the GP. We spent an hour or so discussing it. In the end I got xanax, which seems to "cure" both anxiety and depression anyway though. </TEXT>
