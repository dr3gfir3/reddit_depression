	<TEXT> I think I would eventually return to the original eventually, maybe not to 100% it, but to beat all the bosses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was playing the original BOI and trying to get to the fight with Mother because I'm not all that great at Isaac right now. But I heard from people that Rebirth was really good and fixed the major slowdown issue, which has caused many deaths.

But I also heard that it's a bit easier, so I was curious if the community would recommend getting Rebirth now or wait until I, at least, defeat Mom.

Sorry if this is annoying, I just figured this would be the place to ask. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really liked Sinister, I thought it was a great horror movie that had me on the edge of my seat. But I was wondering if you could post the link to where you read that it was a Slenderman movie, I never heard that before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In two weeks, I'm going to be finally done with my college course that I hate, but after that, there doesn't seem to be any reason to continue going.

I have no friends, so I'm just going to be stuck at my dad's place, doing nothing. There's nothing going on in my life that makes me want to continue, other than my sister's wedding in a few weeks and a few movies, but other than that, there's nothing.

I just wish there was a way to forward to the end of it all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a trap like that in Saw IV, but it's a guy instead of a girl. But yeah, that was super uncomfortable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything involving eyes getting stabbed or squished. So some of the death scenes in Saw 3D and Curse of Chucky were not fun in the slightest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll be sure to report it to security first thing tomorrow morning. I don't really have any more information on the guy, other than he was wearing brown pants and a brown trenchcoat.

EDIT: I've now reported it to Security and filled out a forum. So if they catch him on camera, they'll let me know. </TEXT>
