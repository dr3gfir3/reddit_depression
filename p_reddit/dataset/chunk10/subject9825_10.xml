	<TEXT> I think the reason people have issue with this is that a lot of the time the people pushing for these laws *genuinely* don't think that they're targeting and disenfranchising the poor/minorities. Sure, those groups are less likely to have IDs, but that's beside the point. For many, at the most basic level, Voter ID laws make sense and their reasoning is benign. Why wouldn't you want to make sure that the person voting is who they say they are? Like, most billionaires are white, but nobody thinks that laws raising taxes on the wealthy are "targeting white people", that just happens to be the case. They feel the same about Voter ID laws. Sure, poor people and minorities are less likely to have ID, but that's besides the point of the law. </TEXT>

A right is something that's *immoral* for the government to take away. However, the *rights themselves* are not subject to what individual people believe are moral. For example, some people believe that hate speech is immoral. That does not mean that a person's right to free speech should be taken away. </TEXT>

But those *infringe on other rights*. That's the difference. 

literally the only way natural rights are possible is because certain states recognize them. How did you even type this?

What? What are you talking about? Things can still exist without states recognizing them. Your line of reasoning doesn't even make sense. So according to you because Turkey doesn't recognized the Armenian Genocide, it doesn't exist. </TEXT>

There's no tablet somewhere in nature with a list of natural rights you have, the entire concept of human rights, natural rights - those are all human constructs dude, every single one of them.

That's just not accurate. Hence the examples I gave as to if you were the last person on Earth. They exist because they are possible.

Go talk about "natural rights" in Saudi Arabia as a woman and see how far you get, I'm sure the Saudi royal family will get a fantastic laugh. Time travel back to Weimar Germany and talk to Hitler about "natural rights" and tell me how it goes over. Without society there to enforce these rights you believe you have - they do not exist.

That's why those states were/are evil. Because they refuse to recognize natural rights. </TEXT>

Imagine that everybody on earth died, except for you. There are some things you would be able to do. You could build a house. You could bear arms. You could say whatever you wanted. You don't need a government or other people to do these because the government doesn't need to provide them for you, because you are born with them, as they are *natural rights*.

Healthcare needs to be provided for you. Ergo, it is *not a right*.

You haven't actually challenged any points made in the articles I posted. You simply believe that since they're "conservative talking points" that automatically makes them inaccurate.

How is that relevant? I honestly don't see your argument here. Of course it's immoral to force people to house strangers on their own property.

Is it immoral for someone to accumulate $150k of medical debt, get denied further coverage because they can't keep up payments, get denied continued care because they can't afford the cost, frequent the ER when the symptoms are bad enough (taking up space your families emergencies), and then die from a completely curable condition.

	<TEXT>  The hilarious part is this person doesn't seem to understand what rights are. There are no innate human rights other than the ones we say exist, and most humans view healthcare as a human right.
 
You have to be joking. Of course we have innate human rights. The people in the earliest civilizations were able to build a home and farm their own land, no?

This is like when conservatives try to claim the only rights you have are the ones listed in the constitution.

Citation needed.

The idea that this is still an argument - we know for a fact single-payer is the best option, we know for a fact that most people view healthcare as a human right, we know for a fact that the current system not only causes us severe economic harm but also causes needless human suffering and these people are still clinging to their delusional worldview that seems to amount to nothing more than pure greed and selfishness. They'd literally rather spend more money for worse outcomes if it means they can prevent someone, somewhere from getting something for nothing.

No offense to you, but this attitude pisses me off. The idea that **MY** way is absolutely true, and anybody against it is simply **IGNORING THE FACTS**! Never mind the *fact* that there are [legitimate](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/851264) arguments [against](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/112713/drawbacks-singlepayer-healthcare.asp) single [payer](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2014-04-30/single-payer-would-make-health-care-worse). No, it's simply because all those people are just **IGNORING THE FACTS**.

Come on, man. Broaden your mind, a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growth rates have been lower after Reagan than those before?

on 8 of the 10 key economic variables examined, the American economy performed better during the Reagan years than during the pre- and post-Reagan years. Real median family income grew by $4,000 during the Reagan period after experiencing no growth in the pre-Reagan years; it experienced a loss of almost $1,500 in the post-Reagan years. Interest rates, inflation, and unemployment fell faster under Reagan than they did immediately before or after his presidency. The only economic variable that was lower during period than in both the pre- and post-Reagan years was the savings rate, which fell rapidly in the 1980s. The productivity rate was higher in the pre-Reagan years but lower in the post-Reagan years.

So you're lying. Even the things that did go down post-Reagan were still better than they were before him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well take that up with the Wikipedia editors, because it literally is a definition of fascism. You may not like it but that's not really relevant, is it? No offense but I don't think you're qualified to argue against this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alternet? Really? That's like Breitbart for the left. Well normally I'd stop you there but I need to show you why you're wrong. Fascism has a million definitions. Here's one by [John T. Flynn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#John_T._Flynn) that will show that Trump is actually less fascist than Obama was.

1. Trump is vehemently pro-capitalism. Obama on the other hand, has been one of the [most anti-capitalist Presidents on record](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasdelbeccaro/2013/04/16/barack-obama-the-anti-capital-president/#7d143f815e4d). 

2. Sort of an extension of #1, but Obama has been far more focused on demand management than other recent Presidents. Certainly more so than Trump has.

3. This one goes without saying. Obama added trillions to the deficit. How could we let him get away with such *fascist* ideas? After all, its on the list.

4. Obama escalated bombings and drone strikes to an unprecedented level. He killed American citizens extrajudicially. Pretty fascist of him to do that.

5. ["I'm still not enforcing immigration law, no matter what the court says"](http://nation.foxnews.com/2016/06/23/obama-im-still-not-enforcing-immigration-law-no-matter-what-court-says). Trump has actually enforced laws.

There. By your own standards of checking off boxes on a list, Obama is a fascist and Trump is not. Why don't you try thinking for yourself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok then let's look at the [11 Steps to Fascism](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/5b/1f/36/5b1f3635a475297ad0c51ded70592457.jpg). 

He's done less than half of these. And he's done the direct opposite of some, like #11. 

Compare that to Obama, who did more than half. Or Bush, who did more than half.

If Trump's a fascist then pretty much every President since FDR has been a fascist. </TEXT>
