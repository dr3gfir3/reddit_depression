	<TEXT> It's a transfer of capital in 99% of cases, clubs don't purchase debts or bonds. Typically, it'll be a lump sum payment however, with the figures nowadays clubs tend to pay over a period of time. I'm actually not sure if there's interest but you can look that up. And yes, they can afford to do that. A club like Barcelona makes enormous amounts of revenue per year that 90M is a fraction of their yearly revenue. Of course they have cash reserves and assets, too. </TEXT>

JK Rowling's Harry Potter books have an immense world to them and that's what I consider important. How would you rank her as a writer all-time? </TEXT>

You should visit Muzik, Cube, The Hoxton,   Luxy. We also have Cabana Pool Bar which is exactly what it sounds like.  If you're into history   art, I suggest visiting the Royal Ontario Museum   Art Gallery of Ontario. If you're looking for theme parks we have Wonderland   Ontario Place. Finally, don't neglect the West end. There's shopping (Sherway Gardens), theatres, bars, restaurants, everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey fellow Inter fan, if you have an offer from U of Ottawa - take it. U of Ottawa is pretty good school. However, if you get into McMaster University then take that ASAP. McMaster is one of the best schools in Canada and the world. 

If you decide to live in Ottawa then don't expect tons of clubs or bars on the scale of Toronto. As a Toronto native, I found Ottawa to be quite boring but then again, I grew up in Toronto. It's a quiet town but I'm sure there's still lots to do there. You aren't too far from Toronto anyways. Canada is vast and there's lot to do: camping, cottages, fishing, hiking, beaches, road trips, etc. And of course we have MLS, NHL, MLB, NBA, and such. </TEXT>
