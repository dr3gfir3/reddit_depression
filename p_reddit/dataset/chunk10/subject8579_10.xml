	<TEXT> I used to go out with a guy for a little while but things didn't work out but we remained close friends for years, he actually became my best friend. Then one night at a college leaving party, I got a little drunk and tried to make a move on him like the idiot drunk I am but he was being very subjective and overall trying to avoid me the whole night even before I started drinking... It wasn't until one of my friends took me aside and pointed out the obvious that I finally got it. Yeah I was an idiot to let me go at the time but as far as I know he's happy in a new relationship as am I so I guess all worked out in the end. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-02-18 02:12:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I currently have a 3 year old female cat who is very territorial. Even if she is just sitting at the window and another cat dares to even just pass on the crass she will hiss and scratch until we let her out for her to chase it. 

Last week we were offered the chance to buy a new kitten from a friend of my cousins, however, our cat being the way she is I don't know if it would be the best option as I don't know if she would ever accept the new cat on her 'land'. My mothers argument, however, is that by having another cat in the house it would help our cat to become more 'social' and give her a 'playmate'. 

I just want to know this subs opinion on the situation? what were your experiences when introducing another cat to the family home?  </TEXT>
