	<TEXT> I hope you don't give up. David Copperfield, as someone pointed out, is one of the more comprehensible amongst Dickens' other novels. 

If I remember correctly, the novel points out early on that it is an older David who is recounting the story and as a result, several times, the perspective provided is one shared between two Davids: a younger one growing up, and the present one who provides snippets of additional 'wisdom' because he has the benefit of hindsight. Then, throughout this continues - the mature David often times alludes to events that might happen in the future, that he has now already lived through, even though he is recalling a point in time where the boy David has no clue whatsoever is happening.

So, it took me a bit of time to adjust with this going forward into the novel. Could this be the same for you? I'm not saying this might be the reason you can't comprehend it, but this was it for me.

	<TEXT> Too many times, you're not alone! 

I remember a creative writing class in uni when the professor gave us only Flaubert's description of Madame Bovary's hat and we were asked to draw that out on individual sheets of paper to be handed in anonymously. When we were all done and the prof was showing each piece off, I noticed mine was one of those that looked just odd and completely different from what it was intended to be (and I am a Lit major, how terrible)... So, yes, I've had to reimagine several times now but I'm glad I'm not alone here :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow, 8 times is plenty! That's amazing, I hope to discover a new fave that will not burn out even after this number of times. I guess my closest comparable read would be Tolkien's The Hobbit - I think I've read it 3 times now but it hasn't gone stale on me, and I hope it will never! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. I borrow books from the library all the time and the deadline is actually a bigger factor in this. Hey, no worries, I wish to live to 120 myself by God's grace so it's only 90+ years more of reading to enjoy :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, there're too many good books out there to discover and time just shouldn't be wasted when a book isn't doing it for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the curious case of iiRenity, you've gone and done it in reverse! :D 

But all jokes aside, congratulations on keeping to your goal - I believe it must've been very tough esp when a comfort read is needed for whatever circumstance. Well, I really hope you get to reread some faves this summer...may it be a happy reunion! </TEXT>
