	<TEXT> In quite a few prize winning authors I've read - thinking particularly of Marquez and Saramago at the moment, however there are more - the narrator will soon enough force himself into the narrative to say "Hey, here's what this passage *means*."

I don't really get it. You think writing so good that it wins an award would be subtle, something where you can derive your own meaning from it. Why are these writers so afraid their readers can't understand what they're trying to say? </TEXT>

Is my best bet just keeping a separate tab open on somewhere like champion.gg? Or is there something in-game that can help me that I've not discovered? </TEXT>

For that matter, what's the easiest way to take half of your mineral mining SCVs and send them to a second base? I'm always accidentally selecting the ones who are gathering vespene gas along with them. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, normal mode is ... pitiful. I can stand right in the middle of a mob and not even take a scratch. I know when the game was released, you couldn't choose harder difficulty modes until you'd beaten the previous ones - is this still the case?

As for skill builds, are you ever forced to make a choice? I'm kinda wondering what is the point of creating new characters within the same class if you can respec at any time, any skill or any rune. 

And this isn't about difficulty, but what exactly is season mode? I've only ever played the Torchlight games so I'm not used to the concept of seasons in a hack and slash game. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The weird thing about reading One Hundred Years of Solitude is that the characters don't really have anything to them. There's Rebeca who eats dirt for some reason. There's Aurlieano who is soooo physically pained by seeing Remedios, a 9 year old girl he doesn't know, just because.. he's a pedo.. I guess..? There are so many moments where Marquez expects you to accept a character is feeling sadness or happiness or whatever, just at face value, without giving you a reason why.

While I'm really elaborating on this one book, I feel like it's a problem with a lot of capital L literature, which is a shame because the writing, line by line, is gorgeous. I'd love to read something with the composition of Marquez that has characters I can actually love and hate. </TEXT>

This is simply NOT possible in Overwatch. There aren't items to farm. If you have great aim, that's cool, but your entire team is still dead and you're 1 v 6.

	<TEXT> I mostly played a lot of Mercy, which I've learned was probably a bad idea. Then I started playing Dva, which seems better, except then my DPS still doesn't do anything. I really don't feel comfortable playing DPS because of how squishy they are and how it's rare that a team has either a tank or a healer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't ever find a group of people I like to play with consistently, so I usually play alone. I used to be 1900 and fell down to 1100. I feel like I'm being punished. The most noticeable thing is I feel like there are a LOT more leavers, so it's incredibly difficult to win. On top of that,  my teammates are doing the dumbest things, like five DPS, and of course there's your typical Widow/Hanzo players with a 25% win rate. Also, it's very rare anyone talks on mic, and if they do it's usually to complain.

Is there any way to win these games as solo queue or do I have to find a group? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just now finishing the Dark Tournament, episode 66. I've mostly been watching just to watch Yusuke finally kill Toguro, yet everything felt very anticlimactic. All these powerups just coming out of nowhere, the only one that felt earned was Yusuke absorbing Genkai's energy in the cave.

There's just not much story here, honestly. For like 30 episodes, it's nothing but a tournament. I like fighting, but there has to be a narrative behind it. The first part of the story where Yusuke has to nurse his spirit egg and interact with his friends through dreams, stuff like that, is quite a bit more captivating than what the series become. I especially like how the first storyline is quite emotional making me cry a few times. Nothing after Genkai's tournament really has any emotional impact.

And when the characters did fight in those early episodes, they used their cunning strategy (bouncing his Spirit Gun off a mirror to defeat Hiei, for example, or when Kurama pinpoints the heart of the stone beast Genbu in the Maze Castle) instead of their monstrous power.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard particularly from Unit Lost's Overanalyzed videos that it's terrible to defend anywhere the enemy can see you from their spawn. And this totally makes sense in theory, I try my best to tell my team to get to a better chokepoint and they'll rarely listen.

The thing is... when we're on attack and the enemy does the same thing to us, more than often, it's a success. Am I getting unlucky or is this a valid tactic as long as you don't die? Most players really don't seem to know how to deal with it, myself included. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm honestly pretty new to snipers in shooters, but Ana appeals to me since she's a healer, and I guess if I get the hang of her I'd want to learn Widow eventually (though realistically I'd rather play Tracer or Soldier)

One thing that really hangs me up is the lower sens for scoped aiming. Now, I've already lowered my sens from what it used to be - a ridiculous 33 - down to a 10, with a DPI of 1000. This is still high according to some, however it's comfortable for me. 

I've currently got the scope sens to 20 and that feels too sluggish to me. What number do I use to make sure it's the same sens as my unscoped sens? Or should I just get used to it?  I've been doing unscoped in general, especially because I hear scoping gives you tunnel vision, but I like to scope to shoot Pharah/Mercy out of the sky.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like this is TOO MUCH of a team game, if that makes sense. Whether I get a 4-man rez with Mercy or 65% kill participation with D.Va, I don't feel like anything I do affects the outcome of the game. It's random chance if my teammates are going to do anything.

At least in Dota, I can farm for items if my teammates are bad. In Overwatch, most of the time it feels like "gg, hope you have better luck next time."

But surely that's not the case. There has to be some way to have a big impact and win more consistently. I know many will suggest communication, but most people don't seem to listen to anything said in the voice channel. You can warn about enemies coming to flank, your teammates are still going to die. So is there *anything else* I can do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I certainly don't pick her *specifically* to kill Pharah. But at the level where many Soldiers cannot aim, just as many Pharahs seem to be oblivious to the fact that a D.Va is slowly killing them. It's weird.

I do like the idea of eventually learning Zarya because of her bubble shield. Seems like a great way to get my teammates to actually break through chokes or to make sure someone like a Pharah doesn't get killed during her ult.

So do you think I should start learning Ana instead of Mercy? I've been wanting to lately, anyhow, it's mostly the difficulty of landing a sleep dart that's scaring me away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah this is really great, thanks. A lot of it is indeed obvious in hindsight, but seeing it written down makes it more tangible. I think the only downside to playing more D.Va is gonna be she's quite popular, so I'll have to instalock if I want her. 

The other downside being, of course, it's sometimes like pulling teeth to get anyone to go healer.. in which case I guess I can do it, but after 100 hours I'm not really seeing much progress on Mercy. Feels like an absolute gamble if your teammates are going to be able to deal damage or tank for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've played a LOT of Mercy and when I don't get her, I go with D.Va. I'm actually thinking about just not playing Mercy anymore because the last few times as D.Va I've got gold elims and like 55% kill participation. I feel like she's good hitscan for Pharah (though obviously not as damaging as others), her shield is absurdly helpful for the entire team, and my playtime on Mercy has really helped me learn baby D.Va's projectile pistol.

The one thing I'm REALLY bad at is using her ult. I feel like killing anyone with it is blind luck because, of course, most people are smart enough, even in silver, just to hide. Communication isn't really an option, either, in most games. Usually I try to talk on mic and no one responds, I'm really convinced a majority of this community plays without sound. So trying to combo with Zarya or Rein or something is a no-go (again, usually, sometimes you do get a great teammate) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Lastly, it is worth noting that many players do think "This is my skill level and I'm having fun here." It's just that those types of players aren't seeking out smallish DotA subreddits dedicated to improving at the game, so you don't hear from them as often.

Well, that's the thing. In the ideal scenario (and again, I know I don't always adhere to this philosophy) you think wanting tips and tricks would be solely for self-improvement. I don't necessarily care if that translates to higher MMR, I just want to know how to play my favorite heroes to the best of their abilities. 

And it really is human nature, because lately I'll try my best in either Overwatch or Dota to say "Ok I made a lot of mistakes here, I need better positioning." I'm absolutely fine with admitting I suck. But then the logic in my head will be, "While I made a lot of mistakes, my teammates made even MORE mistakes." Like.. I don't really care about the rank, I just don't enjoy losing, if that makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lucio, Tracer and Pharah all had their ult and we kept losing every team fight because they refused to use them until overtime. I don't understand this. You could use that ult then start building up for a new one. You could probably use two or three ults in the length of time you waited for the perfect time to use the one you had all match.

Am I thinking about this the wrong way? Is it a good habit to hold your ult? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, so I'm right in taking out the pistol during Mei or Zarya ult? Just seems to make sense, the thing does a "surprising amount of damage" and there's no need to heal anyone at that point. Is it safe to assume I should also pull out pistol for Orisa ult? That's what I usually do unless someone is desperately needing heals. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A few questions about Mercy's damage boost </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-28 22:35:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The more I play her, the more I realize Mercy is a deceptively complex hero. First you have to figure out who to prioritize on heals; then realize holding down space for descent is actually pretty useful (I'm embarrassed to admit I didn't use this for like a month or two); then you need to learn when and where to hide; then when and why to use pistol.

Now I'm finally following the advice that you should damage boost at any time you're not healing. Before I'd put it on healing even when they didn't need it, because I never trusted my teammates not to overextend, so they'd always have insurance to live. I've realized they don't really need this so much when the enemy is already dead because they put out more damage.

So I've got some questions.

1. Ult charge works off how much damage you do, right? I think? Does damage boosting your allies make them build up ult any faster?

2. If I damage boost Ana, does she heal teammates for 30% more of her normal healing? 

3. Is it worth it boosting a Rein or Winston or whoever that's already nanoboosted? Is the boost negligible at this point or is it always going to help?

4. Is there anything else important I need to know about damage boosting? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don Quixote is great from the 200 pages or so that I read... the problem is it becomes quite repetitive. I don't mind long novels if there's some variety, but it just FEELS long for the sake of being long. Seems like it was serialized but I don't think that was a popular method until the 1800s, was it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have this copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin that I was *supposed* to have read back in junior year of high school. I've been reading classics lately and thought, you know, may as well try this. It's actually pretty interesting, not simply a historical footnote as I expected it to be.

I never really finished Macbeth, either, despite loving Hamlet and Othello when reading them on my own in that same year... I think it's just being forced to read something that makes it seem so dreadfully boring. </TEXT>
