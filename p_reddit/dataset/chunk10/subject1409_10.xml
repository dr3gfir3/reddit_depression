His latest project, The Six Forgotten Giants, is based in his hometown of Copenhagen, a project the builds and hides friendly giants throughout the citys forests. Using a treasure map, visitors can find the oversized creatures, each of which comes with a poem that describes a bit of their personality.

All of the giants are produced from recycled wood, material that was gathered by Dambo and his team from 600 pallets, a shed, an old fence, and various other sources. Using local volunteers to build the works, Dambo then names each sculpture after one of the builders

[Here's](http://southburnett.com.au/news2/2017/04/plants-can-listen-for-water/) more info:

Lead researcher Dr Monica Gagliano, from UWAs Centre of Evolutionary Biology at the School of Animal Biology, said water was a basic need for a plants survival, and the study showed that sound plays a significant role in helping plants cater to this need.

We used the common garden pea plant (Pisum sativum) as the model for our study and put the plant into a container which had two tubes at the base, giving it a choice of two directions for the growth of its roots.

We then exposed the plant to a series of sounds, including white noise, running water and then a recording of running water under each tube, and observed its behaviour.

The scientists found that the plants could tell where the source of the water was and their root systems grew towards that source based on sensing the sound of running water alone.

It also was surprising and extraordinary to see that the plant could actually tell when the sound of running water was a recording and when it was real and that the plant did not like the recorded sound, Dr Gagliano said.

She said when moisture was readily available in the soil and the plant did not need water, the plant did not respond to the sound of running water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A research team led by the University of Bath, Cardiff University and the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology analysed the genetic structure of shorebird populations to track how they had evolved over time.

The team found that polygamous bird species, which breed with several partners during a season, are less diverse genetically within the species compared to monogamous species that only pair with one mate per season. This contradicts contemporary theories that predict rapid diversification and thus higher genetic differences between populations of polygamous shorebirds.

Researchers at the University of York say they have identified a potential link between consuming Marmite and the apparent increase of gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA)  a chemical messenger associated with healthy brain function.

They believe this is because Marmite is rich in vitamin B12, which encourages the body to produce the neurotransmitter that regulates the delicate balance of activity needed to maintain a healthy brain.

Study author Dr Daniel Baker, from the universitys department of psychology, said: Marmite contains several substances associated with the production of GABA, an important neurotransmitter.

We reasoned that consuming these might increase GABA levels more effectively than consuming GABA itself as this molecule cannot easily pass into the brain from the blood and is likely to be broken down in the digestive system.

Researchers tested 28 healthy volunteers, half of which were assigned to the active Marmite group while the rest were placed in a control group who consumed peanut butter.

They measured each participants response to visual stimuli and recorded electrical activity in the brain using electroencephalography (EEG). Those who ate a teaspoon of Marmite every day for a month showed a 30% decrease in their brains response to visual patterns.

GABA functions as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, sending chemical messages through the brain and the nervous system while blocking nerve impulses. Its role is to reduce the excitability of the neurons or nerve cells and help maintain a healthy brain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is Sisis first official state visit to Washington as Egypts president. Thats because although the US has long viewed Egypt as a vital strategic ally in the Middle East, President Obama steadfastly refused to meet with the Egyptian strongman over concerns about serious human rights abuses carried out by Sisis security forces  including torture, mass detention, and forced disappearances of journalists, aid workers, activists, students, and Islamists. In one particularly gruesome incident, a 28-year-old PhD student from Italy studying in Cairo was abducted, tortured, and murdered in what many believe was an attack by Egyptian state security forces.

Clearly, Trump  whose lavish praise for another repressive dictator, Vladimir Putin, has already raised eyebrows  isnt bothered by any of that. For Trump, all that matters is that Sisi is a tough leader who has done what Trump seems to think is a bang-up job of fighting terrorism in Egypt and who is one of Israels closest allies in the Middle East.

Speaking to reporters Monday after meeting with Sisi, Trump said, We agree on so many things. I just want to let everybody know in case there was any doubt that we are very much behind President el-Sisi. He's done a fantastic job in a very difficult situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Allings modest boat was left on the coast of the Bering Strait in 1929. It would be the last physical trace of her that anyone was able to definitively identify. If she made it back into Russia, it would have been difficult for word to come back to the curious residents of Dawson City or any of the other towns she had passed through. At minimum, she had walked 5000 miles, with the spacing of the linesman cabins indicating she had often logged as much as 30 miles a day.

For decades, Alaska's Bering coast was where Allings story ended. Then, in 1972, an author named Francis Dickie published an account of Allings trip in True West magazine. Shortly thereafter, Dickie heard from a reader named Arthur Elmore who wrote in with a compelling postscript. Moore claimed that he had visited a town called Yakutsk in Siberia some seven years earlier. There, Elmore met up with a friend who had been in the Russian town of Provideniya in 1930.

Moores friend relayed the tale of a woman in tattered clothing who had been standing near the shore of the Bering Strait surrounded by native people from the Diomede Islands, which lie in between Alaska and Siberia. The entire party was being questioned by officials, who were suspicious of the visitors.

He overheard the woman talking about how she was an outsider in America and felt like she had to make a journey back home. She had walked a great distance, she said, but finally made it.
No one can say with certainty the woman of Elmores story was Lillian Alling. But to think she had spent years in dogged pursuit of her goal only to perish so close to the end seems improbable. Only about 50 miles of the Strait remained, and Alling had proven herself to be resourceful and stubborn beyond belief. Having come so far, the mists of the Bering and its dangerous waters seem inconsequential. For what little we truly know about Alling, one thing is a certainty: She would do anything to get home.

	<TEXT> The new documents released Tuesday by Ukrainian lawmaker Sergei Leshchenko appear to show an invoice for $750,000 from Manaforts Alexandria, Va.-based consulting firm, Davis Manafort, addressed to Neocom Systems Ltd., a company registered in Belize. The bill was for the purchase of 501 computers. Leshchenko presented the documents in a news conference Tuesday morning in Kiev, saying the invoice contained signatures and stamps from Manafort that matched those available in other documents already made public.

Leshchenko then pointed to a copy of a page in the black ledger listing a payment of $750,000 on Oct. 14, 2009, issued to Manafort.

This is a case of fraud, and it proves that the party and Yanukovych used fake reasons to pay their consultant, Leshchenko said. These documents should be investigated.

When asked whether U.S. law enforcement agencies had contacted him about the documents, which first were reported by the New York Times on Monday, Leshchenko said, No comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chand Baori is one of the oldest and most attractive landmarks in Rajasthan.  It was built by King Chanda of the Chauhan Dynasty between AD 800 and AD 900 and was dedicated to Hashat Mata, Goddess of Joy and Happiness upon completion.

The state of Rajasthan is extremely arid, and the design and final structure of Chand Baori was intended to conserve as much water as possible. At the bottom of the well, the air remains 5-6 degrees cooler than at the surface, and Chand Baori was used as a community gathering place for locals during periods of intense heat.  One side of the well has a pavilion and resting room for the royals.

	<TEXT> The Eskimo Nebula (NGC 2392), also known as the Clownface Nebula[3] or Caldwell 39, is a bipolar double-shell planetary nebula (PN). It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel in 1787. The formation resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood. It is surrounded by gas that composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star. The visible inner filaments are ejected by a strong wind of particles from the central star. The outer disk contains unusual light-year-long filaments.

	<TEXT> The [Treasure Act of 1996](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasure_Act_1996) holds that found items that qualify as treasure must be offered for sale to a museum at a price set by an independent Treasure Valuation Committee.

'Treasure' is defined as being:

All coins from the same hoard. A hoard is defined as two or more coins, as long as they are at least 300 years old when found. If they contain less than 10% gold or silver there must be at least 10 in the hoard for it to qualify.

Two or more prehistoric base metal objects in association with one another

Any individual (non-coin) find that is at least 300 years old and contains at least 10% gold or silver.

Associated finds: any object of any material found in the same place as (or which had previously been together with) another object which is deemed treasure.

Objects substantially made from gold or silver but are less than 300 years old, that have been deliberately hidden with the intention of recovery and whose owners or heirs are unknown. </TEXT>
