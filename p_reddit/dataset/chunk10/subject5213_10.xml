	<TEXT> Thank you!  Here's the recipe:

Sorry it's late:

Beans 

2 cups dried pinto beans
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 TB chicken bullion 

1.  Soak beans in a large bowl over night or 8 hours.  Add plenty of water because the beans expand a little.  

2.  Drain water and rinse beans.  

3.  In a large stockpot add remaining ingredients with about 2 quarts of water.  

4.  Simmer for around 4-5 hours until beans are tender.  Add water throughout if it gets too dry.  

5.  Mash beans to the right consistency you want.  I use an immersion blender and it works perfectly.  Season with salt to taste.
