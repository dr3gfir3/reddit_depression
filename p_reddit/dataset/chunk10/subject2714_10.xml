	<TEXT> BPD and PTSD are both bitches, I hate it so much.  
People shouting at me and loud noises is, I shut down or get a bit freaked out. Other triggers are people touching me, or seeing someone that has done something to me.  
They are aware of mine, but not how bad they are, and have said I need to control my temper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a lot more to the day then this, but this was a bit stupid.  
End of lesson, everyone was left apart from Jamie, Elisha, Becky and Dallas. I was sorta just there, but I heard Jamie say he'd rather be Michael Jackson. Went up to him and said he's a pedophile.  
The teacher said they was no proof, so I ended up saying that he was, just because there was no proof doesn't mean he didn't do it.   
She repeated it again. I started raising my voice saying he did do it. She said it, yet again. 
And that's when I ended up shouting that rapists and pedophiles always get away with it and ended up storming out.    
Dallas followed me and said I'm gonna be ok. She offered me some more of a fag, as I had a couple tokes even though I don't smoke earlier and it calmed me down as I was very pissed off and couldn't calm down.  
This time Furnay wouldn't let me, and sent me to lesson, which just made me very paranoid. 
My PTSD is very bad, nightmares, hypervilligence, paranoia, anger, eating problems, depressed ect. and extreme mood swings. I know some of it is due to my BPD too, but I can't tell which is which.  
I'm going through Hell at the moment, I'd rather die then carry on.  
And I can't get treatment while on the waiting list, which is 6 months. FML. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> PTSD playing up like a bitch, BPD is playing up, got diaganosed with severe depression yet AGAIN last week.  
Been actually trying to deal with it, not cutting, no energy drinks as I was on 5 a day. NOTHING IS WORKING.  
I got reffered to therapy for PTSD, 6 month waiting list, but they can't give me offer me any help while on therapy.

Never tried it, but can get it. I have a very low tolerance to stuff, due to my weight and I don't do drugs or drink at all.

	<TEXT> You have 2 mental disorders. BPD and PTSD, PTSD is being a right bitch to deal with.  
Do not even attempt to brush your teeth at the moment, you WILL have a flashback as woke up from nightmare but been finding it hard anyway, that's why your mouth feels a bit weird, you've got chewing gum in your rucksack.  Wear long sleeves at all times.      
You have been having chest pains and trouble breathing with headaches and dizziness which is getting worse, had it over a month. Sitting down helps with dizziness. Doctor suggested blood test for Diabetes, but unlikely as underweight can be explained by eating not a lot, and tiredness is explained by not sleeping enough due to PTSD, have been peeing more but I do tend to more on period, that's irregular due to implant, which might be causing your thrush too. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-05 12:54:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Bascily is when I was 3 I was in Foster Care, with a very sexually abusive foster parent. 
He would sneak into my room when sleeping and feel me up, I am now can't sleep without a night light or something heavy near my bed. The worst thing he did was force me to give him oral.  
15 - Guy forced me to do the same under stairs at School.  
Some more stuff has happened since then, again at 15 abusive relationship with sexual stuff too, I've been felt up plenty of times since then from 16 - 21 most recent 2 months ago always by same 2 guys at College but I can get through that.  
19 - 20 had a VERY controlling relationship where the guy manipulated me into oral.   
Anyway, I can get through most of it, APART from giving oral.  
I feel really bad that I can't do it, he's never had one, we want to spend our lives together, which means he's most likely never gonna get one unless I can get over it. 
Been together 10 months, he finds it a bit frustrating but he said he'd rather have me then one oral.  
I just feel really guilty because he said that is what he is into when he was younger. We have made some small progress which wasn't really planned, like me sucking his fingers which he loves and I was getting quite close to his underwear area and I can spit on it and get pretty close to it.  
Like I can put it on my cheek now which he likes too but whenever it goes near my mouth I just freak out, like we've tried it gradually, we've tried just him tapping the head against my lips, we've him getting me extremely turned on and then him putting it against my lips, and that still freaked me out.  
We thought gradually might work to get me more comfortable about it, but I kept overthinking it.  
We thought that maybe just go ahead and do it because it might be the initial shock, nope that was the worst freak out.  
I can't really talk about this stuff either because I will just stop and shut down completely and just start shaking.  
He thinks we should stop because he doesn't want my mental health to tank, and he hates seeing me like freaked out and that it's so hard.  
I blank out so I don't know what I do, he said that all I want to do is hide into his shoulder and that I just can't talk at all or without a bad stutter and that my breathing is erratic. 
I want to do it for him though because it will just frustrate him and I don't want him to resent this.  
Any help?

	<TEXT> Yes this!  
Or I get too confused with too much stuff going on, like my boyfriend would want to chat to me on the phone while I'm at the shop getting something, but then there's too much going on which makes me paranoid, which happens anyway in public without music.
Or if I'm trying to watch something and there's a conversation going on.  
I can cope with listening to music while in lessons, but only if the music is quiet and I'm familiar with the music.  
My mum said I've always been sensitive to loud noises anyway, but the most annoying which gets me the most riled up is beeping.

I'm not good at knots anyway due to a motor condition, only others is train but it would have to be at a level crossing, nearest one half hour away.  
Not anywhere that high enough,  and I find both of these a bit intimidating, but I have no luck with knots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First one, I just crushed my windpipe, ended up making me cough. 
Second one, I did think I compressed an artery but I couldn't really pass out after like 20 seconds and it was getting really painful, but my eyes did go fuzzy and I am a bit dizzy and lightheaded now and I did the test around 15 mins ago 
Maybe longer next time or different positions?
Or I could of had it too far down due to the red mark on my neck, seems too close to shoulder and it only seems to be on one side.   
https://imgur.com/F96sRFh   
Hopefully it won't bruise
I'd say quite successful due to the actual compression but needs more work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's harder.  
I want to carry on cutting, but my parents found out and they went apeshit, not having that has made my mental health tank.  
So my appitite has gone down, and I've been getting told of for not eating and losing weight.  
Mostly a culmination, main events was 6 weeks ago, talked to police about abusive ex, he's in prison now, not for what he did against me but still.  
A month ago, got assaulted by a guy at College.  
2 weeks ago, boyfreind cancelled on me 3 fucking times so that made me so depressed, and the fact he was hardly texting, because he was ill apparently but he could still browse FB fine and message his best mate Ben?  
Oh, and when he does see me, he now can't see me for a whole day so I've been feeling abandoned, which is sending my BPD haywire.  
Today, there was a massive argument over the fact that ny sisters boyfrieind can stay for Xmas, but mine CAN'T, but the reasoning is my sister only has Xmas and Boxing Day off and she wants it to be family, but that's not all the days, but her boyfriend is still coming over, so it's not really fair IMO, I always knew that she was the favorite, I know I'm the family fuck up and they just prove it.  
Luckily, I  have the house to myself till my sister comes back from work, so I'm going to hang myself on the stairs which is what she will see when she first unlocks the door, she's so selfish, hopefully it will fucking destroy her like she's destroyed any self-esteem I had, I'm so worthless.  
She's the reason I'm such a bloody pushover. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So - there is no cure for PTSD, as it changes the brain structure, not the chemicals.  
BUT...big but, there is research into new treatment for it, and you can make the symptoms not complety dissapear, but so they are hardly there with the right treatment or medication with hardly any episodes, flashbacks, panic attack ect.  
Only problem is it's a complex disorder to treat, and it can take YEARS. Heck, I'm 21 and I got diagonesed at 16 and I still struggle, but keep in mind I have gone through another traumatic event a month ago.  
Anyway, if you are still struggling and you've tried everything, it might be a good idea to mention medication.  
There is also a new treatment called EMDR, which is where you follow a moving light with your eyes and recall the trauma.  
I haven't looked into it that much though, it's pretty effective from what I've heard, the only reason I haven't done it is the Doctor thought I've most likely got C-PTSD, not in the Mental Health Disorders Diagonsis Book, but he thinks that and BPD is the most likey diagnosis for me.  
You might want to check out a therapy called DBT too, and try to practice mindfulness too.

	<TEXT> Yep, it's really fucking hard.  
I can't really tie knots right because of a motor condition., but even if I could, don't really have a place to do it. 
Pills/poison/chemicals - VERY low chance.  
Jumping, only one high enough (At least 250ft into water) is 3 hours away, 30 quid train ticket, and I've been stopped there before and had to run for it.  
Train - There is a couple of level crossing like 30 mins away, but I find the train indimating and I chicken out, and I don't want to scar the driver either.  
Can't order anything to my house as still live with family.
