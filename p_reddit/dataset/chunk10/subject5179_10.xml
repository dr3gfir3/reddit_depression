	<TEXT> Hi All,

This is in context of a discussion I had with another player. I was under the impression that DauT Cup was funded by DauT himself. He says that it was funded by a group of DauT fans (Clan in China). Please let me know what's the correct story!

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bengalis live in West Bengal in India. [That "I know Bangladesh is a different country" was not required] 
Apart from the Pal dynasty, they don't really have much history. There still can be campaigns around Battle of Plassey, Buxar, but still not great enough to be included into the game.

Assamese? Again no great history there.
The rest are still fine, do have history, but if AoE goes that route, we will have 500 Civs to choose from! :D

Wouldn't hurt to have more elephants in the game either
There aren't enough already? </TEXT>
