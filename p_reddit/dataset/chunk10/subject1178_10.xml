	<TEXT> You'd think so right? I work in addiction in Scotland, usually closely with Social Workers who for the most part are under extreme pressure from their bosses in terms of case load. There is a high level of disillusionment about the unions and organising because the unions have been very ineffective in improving these conditions. I'm currently trying to re-unionise my workplace, but it will take a while to bring people round and I don't think it will be with the assistance of the already established unions here.

I think the radical feelings are there, they just haven't been catalysed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been out since January due to a stupid foot issue. I've been taking the time to work in more strength work, doing body weight circuits 3 times a week. I also get out on my bike for a long ride at the weekends + 2 or so days on an exercise bike in the gym. It's not the same but I feel like I'm gonna be at peak condition for starting again when I can. Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a combination of the zero drop, wide toe box, and the way the shoes seem to encourage better, more responsive to terrain form in me.  Ideally I'm looking for something as close to minimal as possible, but still with enough forefoot padding to protect my sesamoids. Is that too fussy? I should probably just go to the store haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey - thanks for the advice! The podiatrist I saw didn't x-ray as he said that no matter what it was, his treatment plan would be the same. Orthotic insoles, no running, out for 8 weeks minimum, and massage/manipulation to boot. 

I figured that it would be one of those recurring assholes, so guess I'll finally cash out for the foam roller.

	<TEXT> That's a complete misconception. The term 'higher power' and God is used frequently in AA but is not a religious God, or even a supernatural one. It is up to the individual to find their own understanding of God. For yourself you may believe that Bob Newhart is God, but the guy sitting next to you at a meeting may only use the concept of AA itself as power greater than him. The guy on the other side may not have any conception of a higher power at all. It's all individual choice. The use of 'cult' in relation to AA is also problematic as it potentially scares away people who may benefit from it, and I would argue that it is purely ignorance that spreads that belief. </TEXT>

 Take a break, compress and raise that as soon as possible, as much as possible.
 I ran on shin splints consistently foolishly for a while and ended up having to take 8 months out due to microfractures. When you start up again go easy, watch your foot strike. Maybe check your shoes too? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much as the title suggests. I'm going to Madrid over the weekend and won't have time to go running whilst I'm there. I'm usually running Mon/Wed/Fri/Sat with weight work on Tues/Thurs, Sunday's off. 
This weeks schedule goes 7x800m Fast 3 min recovery with 1 mile warm up/cool down either side 
2 x 2.5 mile fast with 1 mile warm up/cool down either side 
4 miles easy  
9miles total 5miles steady 3 miles fast 1 mile steady.

I think I'm gonna drop the 4 mile easy and keep the long run, rather than squeezing all 4 into the 5 days with only Wednesday as a rest day. What's the suggestions of folks here?
Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi folks, happy Friday to you all. I'm near 6 months into this now and I am having a ball, apart from having issues with being hella grumpy and unable to lift the feeling from time to time. Once every couple of weeks or so I start feeling irrationally grumpy/annoyed with everything... Almost like I'm spoiling for a fight. I can keep a handle on it most of the time but it leaves me being quite short with people, especially my partner, as she lives with me. Obviously this is rather unpleasant for me and for everyone else.  I was wondering if it's just me or if it's a common thing? And if it's not just me, how do you deal with it? </TEXT>
