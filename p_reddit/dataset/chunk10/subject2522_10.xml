	<TEXT> You are making some very dangerous assumptions in the way you think scientists should communicate. The level of discourse at which scientists should communicate with the lay public is not the same at which they communicate with each other. You are also conflating this with the education of children which is an entirely different level of discourse apart from scientists communicating with each other and communicating with the lay public. 

The level of discourse you are advocating is what leads the public to ideas like, "Evolution is *ONLY* a theory!" The way we as scientists communicate with the public shouldn't be explaining that alternatives exist and this may be wrong but it is the best answer we have. Rather we should speak in the affirmative. Explain the evidence and how it connects together for us to form the fact we then communicate as a theory. THAT is how you communicate with the public without confusing issues and creating more problems. You can't expect the lay public to be able to think as critically about problem and that's fine! That's why we pay people to do it full time! We need to show people that they hire scientists to think about problems and engineers to solve it just like someone hires an electrician or plumber to fix something in their home.

We need to learn that we cannot treat the lay public as content equals but we also cannot talk down to them. We have to be able to talk science like Bob Ross talks painting. That's the only way to rebuild the trust between the public and scientific experts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The French election is not an outlier but the culmination of right-wing populist loses in Europe. First, Norbert Hofer lost in Austria then Geert Wilders lost in the Netherlands. This also isn't the first time a National Front candidate has contested the second round of the French presidential election. Jean-Marie La Pen ran in 2002 and lost. Though the loss was greater then because the parties united against La Pen. This year the lower turnout can be partially credited to the main Left candidate Jean-Luc Mlenchon not supporting Macron which probably meant his supporters didn't go out and vote. 

Macron has five years to produce some growth and this election has certainly given him a mandate. Now, his ability to carry out the mandate will depend on how En Marche and the Socialists (he served as Minister of Finance in a Socialist government) do in the June parliamentary elections. There will be a lot of momentum after June (both the French and German elections) for some major reform of the French economy and the EU.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Employees still have to follow the polices of their employer regardless of whether they are on duty or not. Free speech protections don't nullify company (and in this case police department) policies. 

For example, I'm a scientist. All work I come up with on company time belongs to the company. All information that a police officer obtains in the official line of duty is protected information. Something and ordinary citizen would not have access too. 

I challenge you to find one source that nullifies company policy by citing free speech protections.  </TEXT>

They received reprimands, counseling or lesser discipline in more than 250 instances, the review found.

	<TEXT> Homeless people can't vote because they can't prove residency. Regardless of voter ID laws this has always been a restriction and a rather necessary one. Precinct level voting is where you record whether someone has voted. You can't vote in another precinct and you can't vote in a precinct more than once since you have to sign the voter roll book. In Ohio, you are required to show proof of residency (which is why passports and birth certificates aren't accepted but utility bills are) you then sign the book and your signature is compared to the one on file, then you are given a ballot and the ballot number (which is removed before you get the ballot) is recorded alongside your name. [Source](http://boe.cuyahogacounty.us/pdf_boe/en-US/pollworkers/2016/PEOHandbook09132016.pdf)  
So if you can't prove you are part of a community why should you be able to vote in said community? 

Photo ID laws are honestly not what disenfranchises people the most. It is actually going to vote which takes time and when you are low income you have very little time to spare to exercise your franchise. So rather than waste energy on opposing voter ID laws, there should be a greater effort to provide more options and time to vote. Absentee ballots are honestly the best way to do it, but varies wildly from state to state. For example, in Pennsylvania you have to submit a request that cites one of the few valid statutory reasons, along with proof, to obtain an absentee ballot. Right next door in Ohio, absentee ballots request forms are automatically sent to every registered voter in the state and the only requirement to get one is you wanting one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Process of Impeachment7 Steps
        
I. Impeachment
         A. Being formally accused of unlawful activity, committing a crime
         B. Not necessarily being kicked out of office
        
II. Who can be Impeached?  Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution
         A. President, Vice-President, and all civil officers of the United States
         B. Civil Officers include people appointed by the President (cabinet
              members and judges)
         C. Members of Congress are NOT civil officers
 
III. Process of Impeachment
         A. 7 Steps of Impeachment:
                  1.  Justice Department or an independent council investigates charges   presents them to the House Judiciary Committee
 
                  2. House Judiciary Committee (HJC) reviews evidence
 
                  3. HJC drafts Articles of Impeachment
 
                  4. HJC debates Articles of Impeachment (Nixon)
 
                  5.  Entire House of Representatives debates Articles of Impeachment   votes on them (Simple Majority)
                           a. If this happens, President is considered Impeached
 
                  6.  Senate holds the Trial "Will the official be kicked out of office"
                           a. House Judiciary Committee acts as the prosecution-- presents evidence against the accused
                           b. Accused chooses own lawyers to present defense
                           c. Chief Justice of Supreme Court acts as Judge and rules on admissibility of evidence
                           d. Senate acts as the Jury
 
                  7. A 2/3 majority of the Senate must vote against accused to remove the person from office (Andrew Johnson, Clinton)

They talk about how to build a message, how to formulate attacks and defenses, and speak openly about their allies and opponents. That's like stealing the war plans of your enemies. It gives an overwhelming advantage to your side because you know what they will be doing and why. It has also been proven that the Russians fed the documents to WikiLeaks because they know how much Assange hates Clinton and Obama.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A bit of advice, never use a video/documentary to prove a point. They are highly manipulative and difficult to fact check. Audiovisual media speaks to people emotionally allowing the creator to bypass our logical skepticism. Flat out, if you want to be respected by intelligent people use written sources. 

You seem not to understand fiat currency or why it is important and how it helps debtors while things like the gold standard helps creditors. That is where the whole fight between the gold standard and silver standard came from. Silver prices inflate faster (it is even easier to control inflation with fiat currency) than gold making debt worth less over time compared to the equivalent debt in a gold backed system. [[1](http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/currency.html)] 

It would be incredibly unwise for the Federal Reserve to become a consumer lender in the way you argue. You don't want the government making day to day decisions on peoples lives. That would be socialism and the weakness there is its susceptibility to political decision making  over business/market decision making. The Federal Reserve sets the rates at which it lends to banks to control macroeconomic factors such as inflation. Lower interest rates promote inflation while high rates decrease inflation. Some inflation is good because it lowers the cost of borrowing which promotes growth. This means some inflation is good for small business while it eats into the profit margins of big banks. [[2](http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30778491)]

Quantitative easing is another way to control inflation. Essentially it is the Federal Reserve increasing the money supply which then increases inflation because if the whole of the collection of dollars has some value increasing its number of subdivisions decreases the value of an individual dollar. [[3](http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-5)]

Currency value in comparison to the currency of other nations is a different story. A relatively weak currency is good for an export driven economy since it lowers the price of goods in other countries thereby increasing demand. A strong currency on the other hand promotes the demand for imports since the cost of foreign goods goes down relative to domestic goods. For a heavily consumer based and service driven economy this is a better situation. This is actually one of the major problems with the Eurozone currency. Germany is an export driven economy which is propped up by an undervalued Euro compared to what the Deutschmark would be valued at. [[4](http://www.forbes.com/sites/bobmcteer/2015/01/24/is-a-strong-dollar-a-good-thing-or-a-bad-thing/#21ae510c6b61)][5 ([right-leaning source](http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2015/07/22/how-does-euro-membership-help-germany/); [left-leaning source](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/ben-bernanke/2015/04/03/germanys-trade-surplus-is-a-problem/)]

Many of your viewpoints were that of the Federal Reserve in the 1920's and 1930's, i.e. limiting the money supply. That policy is what converted the 1929 recession into the Great Depression that would last until 1939. So yes the Federal Reserve is to blame, but it isn't the mere existence of the institution that caused it. It was the culmination of bad policy. Even Bernake agrees the Federal Reserve is to blame for the Great Depression, but it acted exactly the opposite way the Federal Reserve did in response to our most recent crisis. [[6](http://www.wnd.com/2008/03/59405/)]

So in summary the Federal Reserve is only as good as the policy decisions it makes, but it needs to exist to be able to make that policy. Here is some good reading on the relationship between Andrew Jackson shutting down the Federal Reserve and the economic crisis that followed.

	<TEXT>   the ACA to remain, then it is a tax imposed on the populace

Uhhh....yeah...don't you remember the Supreme Court decision that said as much in [NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT 
 BUSINESS ET AL. v. SEBELIUS, SECRETARY OF 
 HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES, ET AL.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/29/us/supreme-court-lets-health-law-largely-stand.html)


Health care isn't something markets can deal with efficiently. The free market isn't always perfect there are natural inefficiencies in it with health care, prisons, and the labor market as prime examples. Health care costs only decrease when spread out across a large number of healthy people in addition to sick people. That is the fundamentals of how insurance works, spreading risk out. It isn't access if it is so unaffordable that people won't go when they should. That results in health problems getting worse and more expensive to treat than they would otherwise be. 

The most efficient model for reducing health care costs is a single payer system plain and simple. Anything else breaks down the market and you get skyrocketing prices like in the ACA markets. The whole healthcare system is fucked up and it boils down to the shady relationship between healthcare providers and insurers.  </TEXT>
