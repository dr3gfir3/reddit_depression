	<TEXT> My mother, god bless her. 

**Story from 2000:** She couldn't really do anything on a computer, but wanted to send an email to her friend. I set it up and go to my room while she's typing (she two-finger types, so it took a while) and say to call me when she's ready to send it. I hear her yell "Oh no, subject8546!! I broke the computer!" I'd never heard such panic in someone's voice. The screensaver had come on (that one where the stars come at you). 

**Story from last year:** When I went to college, she finally figured out email, so she's now moderately proficient at Gmail and basically nothing else. She'd snail-mailed me a catalogue with some pages earmarked of clothes she thought I'd like. I didn't like them, but it had some others I liked. To continue the mother-daughter bonding, I emailed her back with links to them on the company's website. She replied "I'm confused. What sweater?"  I called her. Turns out she didn't know what links were. Now she knows that if something is blue and underlined, she can click on it, but she doesn't know how to make them. She just emails me enough info to google whatever she wants to show me.  </TEXT>

First year my parents had wifi, he shut the router off when he wasn't using it. I'd be upstairs in my room and I'd have to walk down to the living room and turn it on to use my laptop. Not sure if he eventually stopped (I gave him a hard time about it) or if he just started leaving it on it on when I visit. He's got an iPad and smartphone now, which have changed the way he thinks about electronics a bit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're still an undergraduate student, there will be lots of opportunity to specialize later with a master's or PhD program. In the meantime, you can narrow your focus within the framework of those classes by focusing the papers you write on science policy (for example how it's legislated in different parliamentary systems). Of course, if you're doing a politics/history degree, you'll still be studying politics/history, not science. So, if you hate those fields, you might want to consider changing directions. But if you like politics and are just looking for a way to work science in, the politics of science can be really interesting. There was a r/science AMA from someone on them just yesterday ([link](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/6974n1/science_ama_series_hi_im_matt_hourihan_and_i/)).

It's been a long time since I've found an internship, so I'm afraid I'm no help to you there, but I'm sure there are job boards out there. I'd also recommend looking directly on the websites of potential internship hosts and stopping by your university's career services office.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this sounds crazy since you're on a tight budget, but do you tolerate quinoa? It's expensive, but I've been able to stretch it pretty far. 1/3 of a cup of dry quinoa cooks up to an amount that mixes nicely with a can of beans, for example. Cook the quinoa in bullion, season with garlic and cumin, maybe top with salsa, and you've got a nice, cheap-ish meal. Of course nutritionally, you'll only want to use that one if you're eating lots of fruits and veggies for other meals that day. 

Edit: you can also browse [this site](https://www.budgetbytes.com/category/recipes/vegetarian/) for recipes that fit your dietary restrictions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you specialize in science and research policy as you study politics? There are jobs in that at both universities and in government ministries, etc.

You might also find jobs that combine science and your skill-set in the for-profit sector (political communication for science companies, lobbying, etc.). 

Don't know much about the job prospects in science journalism, but if you're a good writer, you might look into that too. 

As you're a student, I'd advise trying these things out with internships in lots of different types of environments. That will give you a sense of how easy these fields are to break into, what you need to do to be more competitive in them, good contacts for when you graduate, and (most importantly) a sense whether you like this kind of work.

 when people are asleep or under anaesthetic, their neurons tend to fire in a more predictable way than when they are awake.

 What we find is that under each of these psychedelic compounds, this specific measure of global conscious level goes up, so it moves in the other direction. The neural activity becomes more unpredictable, said Anil Seth, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Sussex. Until now, weve only ever seen decreases compared to the baseline of the normal waking state.

I use Cronometer, and you can really easily see how close you're getting to the recommended daily values of all the nutrients. You also get a good sense of what individual foods contribute to that day's intake of a particular nutrient. Don't freak out if you're not making 100% of all your values. You probably weren't with your previous diet either.

Over time, tracking your nutrition will help you adapt your diet to fill any gaps. If there's still something you never seem to get enough of (for me it's Vitamin D), you'll know whether you should consider a supplement.   </TEXT>

If you *did* have a neighbor like me and she wanted to open up these lines of communication, would you prefer a in-person chat or a friendly note in your mailbox? I don't run into him too often, and I'd rather not ring his doorbell (since that scares the crap out of me if I'm not expecting it), so I'm leaning towards friendly note. 

Anything in particular you'd want to hear to be reassured that I'm not just sitting here thinking WTF is up with that weirdo? I don't want to be intrusive, but I can really see how acknowledging the situation might make both of us feel better about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope this is an appropriate place to ask these questions. If not, I apologize. 

I have a neighbor who (I'm told) has PTSD. He's a man in his 40s who lives alone. When I moved in, I heard occasional moaning coming from his apartment and honestly assumed it was sex. When some of the moaning sounded more like pain than sex, I assumed it was kinky sex. One night it got pretty crazy with the sound of things breaking, etc. 

Then, one day I ran into the older woman who lives beneath him, and she asked if I was the new tenant in my apartment and said "Oh, so you probably hear Mr. Smith sometimes." She told me he has a "psychological disturbance" (rough translation) from a trauma he experienced, and she wanted me to know so I'm not frightened (I'm a young woman living alone). She says she's trying to get him to seek help. I said thanks for letting me know. 

It's been about three months since then, and I've heard him shout once or twice, but nothing major. It's all usually at night. A few days ago, I ran into him during the day (our paths don't generally cross), and he greeted me cheerfully and wished me a nice day, etc. 

But this morning, things seemed really bad for him. He was shouting in a language I don't know and tearing up his apartment (glass breaking, knocking things over, etc.) for two hours straight. When I needed to go to work, he had opened his apartment door, walked out into the hallway, and gone back into his apartment, leaving the door open. I could see inside through my peephole that he was pacing and shouting. 

I was close to calling the police, but I hesitated, because I don't know what trauma he experience and figured it might make things even worse for him if men in uniforms suddenly show up at his door while he's in this state. While I was making up my mind, I heard him leave. 

My question is this: how can I be a good neighbor in this situation? I'd thought the police could maybe get him some treatment, but I've since found out I live in a country where the police or paramedics can't force someone to be evaluated by mental health professionals unless they're suicidal or directly threatening someone, which he's not. And since the old lady downstairs is "trying" to get him to see someone, I'm guessing he's not keen on the idea. 

Would it be intrusive for me to ask him if there's someone I can call for him in these times? Should I just pretend it never happened the next time I see him, since it's really none of my business? 

I know this is all much more awful for him than it is for me, but I was honestly rather frightened this morning, and I wonder if he could be a danger to me if I ever cross his path when he's in this state? 

I appreciate any advice anyone can offer! I don't know much about PTSD and obviously don't know if he has an official diagnosis. Just heresy from our neighbor that he's experienced a "terrible trauma." And again, if this isn't the right place for this kind of question, I apologize.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mature individuals on long forages would have the best chance of survival. If the eruption occurred during breeding season, the chicks and juvenile penguins would be trapped on the island. If parents didn't return from foraging, then the colony could collapse quite quickly. A large eruption could bury penguin chicks in abrasive and toxic ash, and any chicks or juveniles present at the time might be too young to survive in the freezing waters. Suitable nesting sites and materials to build nests can also be buried, meaning that the island could remain essentially uninhabitable for a long time afterwards.

You're of course right, but damn if that wouldn't make a pretty upsetting gentoo movie!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would not be good. My mother is very into thinking of "creative" alternatives to food stamps to force poor people to do things she thinks they should. For example, stores would have to make a different *healthy* item free every day. Like poor people have time to go to the store for just one thing every day to piece together vegetables and whole wheat bread for a meal.  </TEXT>
