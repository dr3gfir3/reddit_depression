The slight buzzing of my phone woke me from my sleep. The soft seat of the bus had put me in a slumber. As the sun rose from the eastern sky, the bus rolled past the sign that read:
"WELCOME TO COLORFUL COLORADO." I took a look back at the buzzing phone. It was a call from Lisa. I quickly snatched the device and answered the screen. Most people on the bus were still sleeping, so I had to whisper. "Hey Lisa, you alright, are you safe?" I asked. There was a small pause, but then Lisa's voice answered back. "I am back at HQ, thank you for asking, but first, touch the scanner on the bottom of the device." I looked at the bottom of the phone, and noticed a fingerprint sized pad. I put my pointer finger on it. Instantly, the environment around me changed.

 The people on the bus had disappeared, and the bus itself vanished as well. It was all white around me. Another five seconds later, a familiar sight emerged. My office room formed around me. My desk, computer, and everything else came into existence around me. At the same time, Lisa just appeared in front me. Her smiling face greeted me as we walked up to each other. She spoke first. "New technology that we're testing, how is it?" "Unbelievable...." I answered, "So am I still on the bus?" "Yes," Lisa replied, "All of what you see is in your brain. The scanner interlocked with your DNA, and your brain to act as a receiving signal. It then-" I stopped her. "I got it Lisa. No need to explain it," I said. She sort of smiled, and than put on her serious face. "Let's get to the point," she said as she pulled up holographic images of newspaper articles. The news depicted another death. An executive was killed in a "car crash". His head was swiped clean off. He was related to T.E.R.C.E.S. In case you
guys are wondering, outside of the agency, no one is allowed to speak about the organization. There are rules. So, all of the organization's executives act like normal businesspeople for precautions. Anyways, that was another death to the list. "A.I's on the move again," I said. "Read the county's name where the body was found," Lisa replied. I glanced at the top of the heading of the column. "Colorado," I answered. 

"He wants to tell me that he's waiting for me," I said as I took a seat on my office chair. I still couldn't process the whole environment. It was like I was back home, back in my office. But I had to tell myself that this was all in my head. I wasn't really in my office. We both sat in silence, until I said, "I'm still going to find him." Lisa just looked at me, a gentle look, a look of hopefulness and appreciation. Suddenly, a noise rang, and I kept feeling something on my shoulder.  "Looks like you're bus has reached its stop, and someone's tapping on your shoulder, thinking you're asleep," Lisa explained. "I guess I have to go Lisa, thanks for everything," I replied. Lisa walked over and gave me a kiss on the cheek. Before I could say anything, Lisa pressed a device somewhere on the desk, and everything went black.

My mind basically drifted back to the bus. I woke up, and was greeted by the sight of an old man. " 'Bout time you woke up, I thought you were damn unconscious," he said as I regained my senses. "Yeah, sorry about that, was in a deep sleep," I answered back. "All's good, we've reached (city taken out for purposes)," the old dude stated. "Thanks," I said as I put the tech phone in my bag, and stood up. I stretched a little bit, and then proceeded to exit the bus.  

I've finally arrived in Colorado. Now, to find A.I. I stopped at a local bazaar, and ordered a sandwich, fries, and coffee. Sitting at the table, I glanced over A.I's file. I looked at the street name where the crash occurred, it was not too far from here. My thoughts also drifted back to Lisa. I didn't know what to say about the kiss. I mean, I like her too, but she never told me that she had the same feelings either. My thought-process was interrupted when the waitress brought the coffee and food. The savory aroma made my stomach gurgle. After my lunch, the time was 1:22p.m. I went and changed in the bathroom, payed for the lunch, and proceeded to the scene of the accident. 

I followed the information on the file, and the GPS on my tech phone. After a few minutes of walking, I arrived a the scene of the accident. I scanned the surroundings. There was a memorial for A.I's wife and child. The pictures of them were exactly like the ones in the file. All around, there were many flowers of all kinds, candles, and letters. I kneeled down to closer inspect the surrounding. There was bits of debris from the wreck, and also what looked to be dried blood. As I was scanning the area, I spotted a shadow next to me. I couldn't react fast enough. I was struck in the back of the head. Immense pain throbbed its way through my body, as my brain wobbled, and my sight became dizzy. I felt my self fall backwards as I was knocked unconscious.

When I woke up, I was in an abandoned warehouse. Typical place for a killer, I should have expected this. I tasted blood in my mouth, and my head ached like hell. I suddenly heard footsteps coming closer, but I couldn't see anything through the darkness of the warehouse. I tried to get up, but my hands and feet were tied together with chains. "I wouldn't try if I were you," the voice echoed, "it won't end well." "Let me guess, you're Matthew," I mumbled. " Well done agent," the voice answered, as the footsteps grew nearer. I could make out a silhouette, but as the figure grew closer, it became more distinct. Standing in front of me was Matthew aka A.I. He had lost the glasses, revealing two dark brown eyes, with a small scar through the bottom part of the left eye. He had a small beard, and was wearing a green cap. He had on a loose jacket, black army pants, and military boots. He put an eye patch over the left eye as he walked towards me. He kneeled down in front of me. "So, I heard you wanted to find me, here I am," A.I. stated. "Take off these chains, and I'll introduce myself too," I answered back, sarcastically. 

"If I wanted, you would already be dead," A.I said, laughing as he got up. "So why keep me here!?" I shouted, "Why keep me alive?" A.I. paused for a moment. "I need your help," he finally answered."What do you mean?" I questioned, a little curious. "You're on of the best agents I knew at T.E.R.C.E.S., and I think you're the only one I trust. They're not good people," A.I. said, his tone turning dark. "But why kill them?" I questioned further. "Self defense. They were hired to kill me," he replied, "It...wasn't supposed to happen. Look, I don't want to hurt anyone, I just need your help." "How can I trust you?" I asked. He walked up to me and untied my chains. I could have punched him right there, but I chose not to do it, it didn't seem right. "You're a strong man, agent," A.I said as he offered his hand, "can you help me?" I took his hand and he pulled me up. My head still hurt. "Sorry about your head, I didn't want to risk us getting caught," he replied. "You're being followed?" I asked. "No," he answered, "you are."

"What are you talking about?" I questioned. "There's a tracker in your bag." A.I. held up a micro chip tracker. "They're trying to capture me, cause I'm the only one who knows the real truth," A.I. continued. "Are they trying to hide something?" I asked. I was starting to question my agency's authenticity. Why were they trying to capture A.I. so badly? "Yes, it's a long story but I'll sum it up for you," A.I. said, "Do you know how my wife and child died? It wasn't an accident, it was murder." "Murder? but who would want to kill your family?" I said, "wait," I stopped myself, "you're saying T.E.R.C.E.S was behind all this?" "Exactly," A.I. confirmed, in a sad, depressed tone of voice. "My poor family was innocent, had nothing to do with it, but when I found the hidden side of T.E.R.C.E.S, they stopped at nothing to eliminate me, including my family...." A.I. explained, his face turning away from me, "But now, I'm going to bring an end to their act." "What are they wanting to hide so badly?" I said, wanting to know the real truth. "Weapons of mass destruction. These weapons have incalculable uses. Controlling minds, viruses, destruction, anything, you name it. It can end major populations, allowing T.E.R.C.E.S to take over the world," A.I answered. This sounds like something from a movie, I thought, but then again, has anything normal happened lately? 

A.I reached to some papers lying on a desk in the corner that I hadn't noticed before. "This is proof," he told me. He handed me the papers. I looked at them. Sure enough, he was right. These were records of weapons being developed to take over massive countries, and they had many uses, just like A.I had mentioned. There were photographs of the machinery as well. "Damn, they love to keep secrets," I implied. "You think?" A.I reasoned, "spell T.E.R.C.E.S. backwards: S.E.C.R.E.T."

"We have to stop them A.I." I said. Dammit, forgot to tell him that I called him A.I. "A.I.? Is that what you're calling me now? he thought for a second, I kinda like it," A.I said, "and yes, we have to bring an end to this."Suddenly, my tech phone rang in my bag. I ran towards the bag, and grabbed my phone. There was a voice message from Lisa: "I've been listening in on your conversation, what he said is true. I hacked the databases, and sure enough, I found proof, and I've sent it to your phone. They're coming for me now, and they'll get to you guys, get out of there, go end this! "We have to get out of here!" A.I. shouted, "follow me!" "We have to save Lisa!" I shouted back. "We'll save your friend, but right now, I need you to come with me," he replied. And so, I followed A.I. Our mission was set. We are going to end this once and for all. Whoever's behind this, we'll find him. I'll keep you updated. This is me signing off for now.  </TEXT>
