	<TEXT> I've always wondered why there isn't some sort of tax break/ incentive bonus if you successfully didn't have any children each year. Like "here's an extra $1,000 for no producing anybody this year, good job" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked in a pet shop where the owners were Eileen and Ryan. They owned an African Grey that they had in the shop and also when they went home at night they took it. This bird learned one telephone noise and apparently I learned that these peoples relationship was way one-sided. All I heard when it was in the shop was "I love you Ryan" or the phone. I would have strangled this bird given the chance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm new to the Rochester area too, I've been here for about four months and I've heard thru a few locals that fairport is the village to be in. And honestly everything is pretty easy to get to and not a lot of "bad" areas to be in. Everybody has been friendly and everything is super close by. No worries on where you end up but fairport is somwhere where I would pick. It is the burbs. Quiet and nice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel the same because of the fact that when I was younger I was sort of hit a lot by a "friend" in the face. This resulting in that my jaw now clicks when I chew so on top of already having the anxiety of eating in front of people, is it in no way quiet because it clicks when I chew. That's all I can think of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've lived in a couple national parks and a few states. I've been to nearly all fifty and they are all particularly unique. I have also put more miles on my car criss-crossing the country a few times now than I thought I ever would. I wanted to see the desert and live in it. Terlingua was a gem to find. I know now that I need to have more greenery in my life. I hope you enjoy your time out there.  </TEXT>
