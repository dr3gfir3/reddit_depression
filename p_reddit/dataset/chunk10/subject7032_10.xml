	<TEXT> **Josh**: Hey man, thanks for staying to help cleanup last night. Hope you had a good time. 

**Me**: Your party was a blast. Howd it go with Casey? 

**Josh**:  No go bro. She had to take her wasted friend home. 

I slid the phone back in my pocket. I was only asking to be polite. I couldnt care less about Josh or his parties. I wouldnt have gone at all if Kimberly, a girl from my physics class, hadnt mentioned she was going too. She only knew my serious, studious side, but theres nothing like a party to show how suave and charming I could be, right? 

Just my luck that she didnt show and I had to endure an evening of beer like piss, screaming idiots, and that damn UNCE UNCE UNCE music which I know is going to haunt me all day. That and this pounding hangover. 

**Josh**: My poor turtle had to put its head back in the shell. You know what I mean?

Why is he still texting me? How do I even reply to that? I hope he doesnt think were friends now. I didnt even know his frat house was hosting the stupid party. Maybe if I dont reply hell just  

**Josh**: The flight was ready for landing, but the runway was blocked by a fat cow. The dive was scheduled, but there were a bunch of needy sharks in the water. It was time for my pizza, but the meatloaf wasnt having any fun so I guess that means ALL the food had to get sent back.  

**Me**: That makes absolutely no sense, but I get it. 

Now will HE get it? Of course not. If he got it, he wouldnt still be texting me. 

**Josh**: BTW bro. Do you know who Kimberly is?

**Me**: Yeah. Was she there last night? 

No. Josh couldnt have. Please God, dont let that disgusting frat boy anywhere near  

**Josh**: Some dipshit wrote Kimberly is dead. Stop wasting time on her with a marker on my wall. Good thing for renters insurance, lol. 

---

The chair in front of me was empty in physics today. The long golden braid which usually fell about my desk was gone. I hadnt realized how long this class was when I had to stare at the whiteboard instead. To make matters worse, the stream of texts from Josh didnt stop. 

**Josh**: Dude I found another message. This one was written in my bathroom: Her head took the longest to remove. The vertebra kept snapping, and her neck must have stretched four feet before it finally popped free. WTF?

**Josh**: Heres one written on my closet: Her breasts looked much bigger when they were still attached. Such a fake girl, no-one will miss her.  

**Josh**: Theres another on the side of my fridge. Im saving some for later. 

I excused myself to leave. I still had biology after this, but I felt like I was going to be sick. This had to be a twisted prank. Maybe he thought I wanted to join his frat or something, and this is what they did to haze people. But then why wasnt Kimberly in class?

I couldnt let this get to my head. All I had to do was check her Facebook, right? Okay, no updates since the day before last. But I could send her a message.  

*Hello Kimberly? Weve never really talked, but I just wanted to make sure you havent been butchered. Hope we can go out sometime.*  


Yeah that isnt the suave first impression I was hoping to make. Think. Think! I was freaking out. Of course I didnt have to mention the butchery. If she replied at all, then she was okay, right? Do you think *you're* nervous texting a girl for the first time? Try it when all you can think about is her dismembered corpse scattered across some frat house. 

**Me**: Hey Kimberly. Did you go to Joshs party last night?

DELETED

I couldn't send that, because then I'd just be admitting to eavesdropping on her plans. How about

**Me**: Hey Kimberly. Saw you missed physics today, so I wanted to remind you about the quiz on Friday. 

I closed my eyes and hit send. I hope that doesn't make me sound like all I cared about was physics. Maybe I should add a follow up to ask -

BZZZ

A reply! She's okay! I mean of course she's okay, but she replied! And so quickly too. You don't reply that fast unless you really want to talk to someone -

**Josh**: [DUUUUDE LOOK WHAT'S IN MY FRIDGE](http://www.fadoflo.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/p376080-Niagara_Falls-Dahmers_Fridge.jpg)

He sent me a couple more texts, but I didn't read them. I was running toward his place. Either something horrible has happened and I had to see for myself, or he was trolling me and was about to receive a beating of a lifetime. By the time I got over, I still hadn't received a reply from Kimberly. That could mean anything though. If she wasn't in class, it was because she was busy with something so of course she couldn't reply. So why did I feel like I was going to die? 

This place looked even worse in the daylight. The building had been trashed and stitched together so many times it might as well have been the Frankenstein's monster of frat houses. I pounded on the door so hard that my hand went numb.

"Josh! Get your ass out here!" 

The door opened and I almost hit him in the face. Then he started laughing, and I really *did* hit him. Right between the eyes. My fist stung like hell, but it felt so good I would have done it a hundred more times. It had all been a prank! Kimberly was okay. 

"Shit dude, cool it. Can't you take a joke?" 

"Who does that? How badly do you need attention that you would screw with me like that? Never talk to me again." 

I've seen enough. I turned around and stomped my way across the yard. 

"Common man, it's not like that. I just found the photo online somewhere, but the messages were real." 

"You're messed up, man. Leave me alone," I said. 

"Look! There's another one on the fence!" he shouted after me. 

"So what? You probably wrote it you twisted shit."

"I swear dude. I didn't write any of it. The picture is the only thing that wasn't real." 

I didn't want to look, but I couldn't help myself. I glanced at the fence. Written in black marker, it said: "She was my third." 

What is even worse than listening to him? Believing him. Because looking at those big blocky letters, I know Josh couldn't have written that. I know because it was unmistakably [my handwriting](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade). 

---

Update: Kimberly is dead. There was a short mention of it on my school website feed. No details were listed, but I'm doing my best to find out more. Shit, I'm doing my best just to stay sane, but if I can figure out what the hell is going on, I'll let you all know.

	<TITLE> The Solution to Prison Overcrowding - Part 1/2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-06 00:14:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *The US prison system has grown 700% over the last generation. It's costing us up to 40k per inmate every year - 74 billion annually nationwide.* 

*This program is exploring a way to maximize efficiency by condensing 10 years worth of punishment into a single weekend. Welcome to camp Rawhide...*

---

There is no Devil, only man, and he does not buy souls. Not all at once anyway. Man is far more insidious than that, for he grinds down his brother's soul one layer at a time until the residual humanity begins to devour itself. It's hard to believe, but it's true. Begin to break a man, and he will finish the job on his own. That is because it is much easier to live as an animal than it is as half a man. 

I felt the first part of my humanity die when I was 12 years old. How do you explain a knotted garbage bag full drowned kittens to a child? I was young, but not too young to know that someone had done it on purpose, and that they had gotten away with it. Not too young to understand that evil wasn't just a thing in cartoons and movies; not too young to realize that I too was capable of evil if I ever got my hands on this monster.

Over the years I felt more of myself slip away. Sometimes it would break off in big chunks like when my mother died, but more often my soul simply eroded from the steady tide of petty grievances, jealous greed, thoughtless anger, and the thousand other frustrations that make up the life of any "civilized" man trying to find his place in the world. 

My defense attorney wanted me to talk about how I regretted killing Edward. That it was a defining moment in my life, and that my mind had been blown wide with righteous rebirth and revelation. There wasn't enough left of me to lie though. I don't think my pulse even rose the night I took my neighbors life. Edward used to beat his wife, and now he doesn't. That's all that changed, because there wasn't enough left of me to change. It almost makes me laugh now to think how far I still was from rock-bottom.

I got 15 years for that. Could have been worse, but the judge and jury were sympathetic after hearing the widow tearfully thank me for saving her. I can't even say I found jail any worse than the outside either. The only difference was my daily routine, and the blur of a different set of faces performing it with me.  

I gained a reputation as a loose cannon in jail. People said I'd go from deadpan silence to an incoherent rage in one second flat. I don't think of it that way though. I think of myself more like a brilliant pianist: seeming ordinary until sitting down to play. The musical ability didn't suddenly appear out of nowhere, it had been inside all along. It was the same with my anger: it was always there, but it was my choice whether to let it play. 

I was five years into my sentence before one of the guards took my moods personally, landing me in the hole. It was only supposed to be for a week, but everything I did seemed to extend the time. Unresponsive to the officer? Add a week. Didn't eat the food? Add a week and get my next meal replaced with "the loaf" (rotten cabbage and bread). Didn't eat the loaf? Another week, and no other food until I choked it down. Even after I vomited it back up, they wouldn't give me more food until I'd eaten my sick just to teach me a lesson. 

I don't know what that lesson was, but the only thing I learned was to hate the hole. Having nothing to do is boring, but knowing it will continue without cessation is despair. I was never a social person, but I found myself so starved for human contact that I even tried hugging the guard. It was like I needed someone to touch me just to prove I was still real, but nothing relieved the relentless pressure of the second by second attack on the soul which was isolation.

I knew I was really losing it when a fly found its way into my room. I named it Ribazzzio and talked to it just to hear something beside the droning of florescent lights and the distant shouts from other cell blocks. I told Ribazzzio about the girl I liked in high-school, and how beautiful the sly wrinkle at the edge of her smile was. I described to him what a sunrise looked like, and the taste of chocolate cake, and about the drawings I used to sketch, and a thousand other things which I hadn't appreciated at the time. I didn't tell the fly that I never expected to see them again; I didn't want to make him sad and leave. It didn't matter though, because the next time I woke he was gone anyway. I'm not ashamed that I cried to be alone again, in fact I was relieved. It meant there was still part of me which was human enough to feel. 

"Pssst. Hey buddy." 

I opened my eyes. I wasn't sleeping - I was just lying on my back, preferring my malleable imagination to the stagnant cell. The voice had come from behind me. 

"Can you hear me? What's your name?" the voice asked.  

Someone else must have heard me talking to the fly. I turned around and found a crack in the mortar behind my bed. It must have connected with another cell in the Housing Detention block. 

"Does it matter?" I asked. 

"Of course it does. It's the most important thing in the world. It's the thing they can't take from you. My name's Riley." 

"Hi Riley. I'm Travis," I replied. 

"Have you been recruited yet, Travis?" 

"I don't know what you're talking about," I said. I glanced back at the closed door of my cell. Even if someone heard me, they'd probably just think I was talking to myself again. It's not like they checked in on us very often. 

"Okay good," Riley said. "They're going to offer you a deal soon. You have to take it - trust me." 

"What deal? Why would I trust you? I don't even know you." 

"Sure you do buddy," he said. "I'm your only friend in the world." 

I heard metal scrape on metal. My door opened. I threw the pillow over the crack in the mortar and sat riggedly upright. 

I was reluctant to leave my new friend, but I don't think the guard noticed. My muscles were stiff from the cramped quarters, but I didn't even run around much. All I could think about was how great it would be to have someone to talk to now. And the deal? It couldn't have been that special if he was still in prison, but it was something to think about. Something to look forward to. Maybe they'd even given him books or a notepad. A laptop or TV would be almost as good as getting out. 

Riley never answered again though. For two days I tapped on the wall, but all I heard was ceaseless muttering. An old man swearing under his breath kind of muttering, like he was trying to talk but couldn't decide whether he was talking to himself or someone else. All hours of the day and night - non-stop muttering. I don't even remember him pausing to eat, let alone draw breath. 

Most of it was inaudible gibberish, but there were a few things I finally made out after they were repeated for the thousandth time.  

*"Didn't expect to see him again. No sir-ee no."* 

*"Just pretend to be human for me, will you? We can both pretend."* 

*"I'm Riley. You're Riley too, but I was Riley first."* 

I lost track of how long I was supposed to stay in here, but I'm sure I should have been out of solitary a long time ago. By the time they came to offer me the deal, I was completely convinced that accepting it was the only way to ever get out. 

"It's very simple, we have nothing to hide," the prison warden told me. He looked like the type of man who would force his children to only speak when spoken to, and even then only if they addressed him as 'sir'. 

"We could easily force you to accept," the warden continued, "after all, you are in my power. I choose when you sleep, when you eat - *if* you eat - but I am still making this a completely voluntary arrangement."

"What do you want from me?" I asked. 

"Prison overcrowding is a serious issue," the warden said. It felt like he was reading from a pre-prepared script. He was looking at me, but I wasn't really being *seen*. "The prison system is rapidly becoming unsustainable, and the government is actively exploring alternative programs which can satisfy the need to deter and rehabilitate criminals without the prohibitive expense and opportunity cost of prison. I'm offering you the chance to volunteer in one of these programs." 

"You're going to take me out of prison? Then how come Riley stayed in here?" 

The Warden's face screwed up like he'd just taken a bite from a lemon. "Riley is gone. He's been gone for awhile now." 

There was something about how he emphasized the name which made it seem like Riley hadn't changed locations. He'd changed from being Riley. The warden was already talking again though, and there wasn't any space to ask more questions. 
 
"I can't disclose all the details with you, but rest assured your sentence will be considerably abbreviated. Our programs are designed for maximal efficiency, and fifteen years of wasted time and money are going to be condensed into a weekend."  
  
I didn't care about the time. What did I have to look forward to on the outside? It might seem inconsequential to you, but the only reason I accepted his offer was that I missed having someone to talk to. And if this was a government project, then what was the worst they could do? Maybe I really could get a clean start. 

The warden gave me some papers to sign and then left. I was handcuffed by the guard and escorted out of my cell. He tried to keep my head low, but I caught a glimpse of the adjoining cell where Riley must have stayed. A man in a rubber suit was pressure washing blood out of the stone tiles. 

"What happened to that guy?" I asked the guard. "Is he hurt?" 

The guard shifted uneasily and looked around like he wasn't sure if he was supposed to say or not. Then he shrugged.

"What was he still doing in there?" I pressed. "I thought Riley made the same deal."

"Yeah he finished his deal," the guard said. "He was supposed to be released in a few more days after the official pardon was granted, but I donno. Guess he wanted a quicker way out." 

The man in a rubber suit picked up a fork on the floor. It was covered in congealed blood all the way up the handle. I tried to get a better look, but the guard shoved me onward. I was put into the back of an unmarked police car. Somehow I'd expected a whole bus load of people, but it was only me. In a few days I'd be a free man. It hardly seemed possible. How was I supposed to pick up the pieces and become something new? And it sounded like Riley really was going to be released, if he hadn't... well I wasn't as fragile as him. I could survive anything for a weekend. 

I wasn't paying much attention to where we were going, but we drove for a long while before the car stopped at a ranch deep in the desert. There weren't any pens for animals, just wide open spaces separated by low stone barriers which I could have easily stepped over. I guess they didn't worry much about escape when there was nowhere to escape to. 

"Welcome to camp Rawhide," I was greeted by a man wearing a leather vest and denim pants who stood outside the ranch house. The officer un-cuffed my hands, but I didn't move. I couldn't believe what I was seeing. 

"Ten years left on your sentence, all over in two days. Seems like a pretty good deal to me, eh? But don't you worry, you won't miss out on anything," the man continued. His voice was muffled from speaking around the cigar in his mouth. His eyes didn't leave my face - mine didn't leave his. "It's my job to make sure you still get 10 years worth of punishment this weekend." 

I heard the sound of tires roaring over dry earth. I hadn't even noticed the officer had gone, but it was too late now. I couldn't look away from the man in front of me. The man I killed. 

"What are you doing here?" 

Edward grinned. He took a step closer to me and took the cigar out of his mouth. 

"Same thing as you, darling. I'm just trying to find some justice in this shit-stain world. But between you and me, I don't know if there really is any justice out there. I reckon there's just people who got what they deserved, and people who got lucky."

Another step closer. I could feel the heat radiating from the end of his cigar as it brushed my hand. He was exactly the same as that insufferable creature I used to live next to. His words blew onto my face alongside his rancid breath. 

"And by the time I'm through with you, there won't be any doubt. You weren't one of [the lucky ones](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog)."

	<TITLE> I have a new scar every morning </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-03 19:11:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> No not a cut. Not a bruise from sleepwalking or a bang where I drunkenly hurt myself without remembering. I'm talking jagged, gnarly, vicious scars which looked like they've healed years ago. 

The first one to appear was an inch long incision on my stomach, almost like a surgical wound. I live in college with a roommate (Robert), but he didn't remember anything happening. Then I called my parents and asked them if I'd ever had a surgery before, but the only procedure I'd undergone was having my wisdom teeth removed; a dead end, unless they thought the stomach was a shortcut to the mouth. 

I figured that I just hadn't noticed it before. Or perhaps something traumatic happened and I completely blocked out the memory, but I didn't worry about it. I played basketball in high-school and have had my fair share of being knocked around, so it must have been from something then. Those were the glory days man. I play on my collegiate intramural team now, but it's just not the same. I was a school *hero* back then... but life goes on, you know? All the victories and mistakes I made on and off the court, they're all ancient history. 

The next morning I woke with a long scar along my forearm. It must have been deep too, and the skin holding it together was stretched like I've grown since it closed. I ran my finger over it, but it didn't even hurt. The skin was slightly raised and hard, but otherwise I wouldn't have noticed if I wasn't looking right at it. I thought about going to the doctor, but it looked so old that he'd probably just say I forgot what caused it. 

I tried not to think about the scars for the rest of the day, although my buddy Chase noticed it during our practice that evening. I didn't want to sound like an idiot, so I made up a story about this time I fought off a mugger to protect my girlfriend and got a swipe from his switchblade.

"Yeah, I think I remember you mentioning something about that bro," he said. 

Bitch please. I doubt that since I just made the story up on the spot. It wasn't interfering with my game though, and I was so tired afterward that I just hit the showers and went straight to bed. I completely forgot about it until I was falling asleep, and then it was all I could think about. What if something was attacking me in the night? But no, that was ridiculous. But what if something was attacking a younger version of myself in the night? Even stupider. I eventually convinced myself that I was making a big deal out of nothing and fell asleep but...

It was still the first thing I thought about when I woke up. I immediately stripped naked and checked myself in the bathroom mirror. 

"Man are you trying to shit a log or a whole forest? I gotta take a piss." My roommate Robert was pounding on the door. I ran my fingers over my chest for the hundredth time. A giant cross shaped scar on my right peck. The undulating lines wandered haphazardly - grotesquely - like it hadn't been a clean heal. But it was healed alright. I opened the door and stared at him. 

"Have you seen this before?" I asked. 

"Dude are you drunk? I'm not looking at your -" He started back peddling. I grabbed a towel and wrapped it around my waist.  

"Not that, you idiot. This scar. What happened to me?" 

"Yeah, you got in a fight with a mugger when you were in high-school. You said he cut you up pretty bad but you chased him off." 

"I never told you that," I said. "That never happened!" 

"You're being crazy, man. Just let me use the bathroom, okay?" 

Robert pushed past me and closed the door. I went straight to my computer and logged onto Facebook. I've had that thing setup since my freshman year of high-school. There had to be some pictures which proved - man I looked like a little shit back then - okay here we go. Senior Ditch day we all went down to a river and hung out. I was in my swimsuit and - 

And the grotesque scar was on my chest. The ones on my stomach and forearm were there too. I flipped back a few more years and saw it disappear during my sophomore year. From the photos, it looked like whatever happened was in the first semester of my junior year. 

When I thought about that time in my life, there was only one memory which burned so brightly as to cast shadows on the rest. I narrowed down the range of dates, and there was no mistaking it. I found a photo of myself running shirtless with the team the week before - no scars. The week after I wasn't present at the game, then after that I was covered in bandages. But that hadn't happened! I remember we started off the season 4-0 and I played in every game. 

Somehow, there was something about that night which was changing my past. I hadn't meant to hurt her. There was a party to celebrate our homecoming victory game, and everyone was having a little too much to drink. I thought Jessica wanted it - she certainly seemed like she did. There's no way I could have known how she would react the next morning - or what she would do to herself the next month when she found out she was pregnant. It's not my fault Jessica is dead. 

Life goes on, you know? Ancient history. And if somehow these scars appearing on my body were related to that night and I had to carry them as penance the rest of my life, then I could accept that. If that had been all there was, I wouldn't have been so scared or angry.

But the scars this morning were more deliberate. Etched into the back of my hand are the words:

*5/3/17. 6 PM.      
The house where it happened.  
See you there.*  

---

I can't not go. Not with the power she has over me. But I also can't go for the same reason. I don't see any other way to resolve this though, so if you don't hear back from me well... 

I guess she's taken what she needed for her to [find peace](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

	<TEXT> "I can take care of myself. I'm not crazy, you know. Why does everyone think I'm crazy?" 

"No one thinks you're crazy, Dad. Dementia is nothing to be ashamed of. It's a common medical condition with people your age."

"You wouldn't have locked me up in here if you didn't think I was crazy. When is Elise going to pick me up?"  

It's the same conversation every-time I visited dad in the Forest Glen retirement home. At first he just started forgetting what things were named. Pepsi became "bubble juice" and he'd call his dog a "woofer". We all thought it was hilarious until he started forgetting who we were too. 

He thought I looked familiar, but the helpless frustration on his face as he tried to remember how he knew me was excruciating. My childhood - all our time together - my whole life was just being erased.  

After his wife (my mom) Elise died, Dad completely fell apart. It was like she was his only reason to keep trying at all. He used to passionately assemble model planes and ships, but he smashed them all and wouldn't touch them again. He wouldn't even read or watch TV, preferring to just sit alone and stare at the wall. He stopped taking care of himself and became belligerent when someone tried to help him. 

"Just bury me already, if I'm such a burden," he'd say. 

My wife and I would laugh it off, but we all knew he wasn't joking. He *was* a burden. He needed help going to the bathroom, and showering, and getting dressed, and as much as I told myself that sending him to the home was for his own good, I was relieved when he was gone. 

That's why I was so worried when I got a call from the retirement home two weeks ago. They said Dad was missing. It wasn't the first time he tried to get out, but the nurses always stopped him before he made it past the door. He could barely lift his foot high enough to put a slipper on, but this time he somehow managed to climb straight out the window. 

If he was lost out there, he wouldn't know how to get back. He probably wouldn't even remember who he was. That would have been bad enough, but the note he left behind made me even more anxious. 

"I'm going to be with Elise, and I'm not coming back. Goodbye everyone." 

Dad was going to kill himself tonight. I knew it. I frantically drove up and down the streets around the home, shouting his name - wondering if he'd recognize it or even respond if he did. I checked every puddle he could have drowned in, every bridge he could have jumped from - everything I could think of. My wife was visiting her relatives out of town for the week, but she stayed on the phone with me the whole time to keep me calm. It didn't work.

"But didn't he forget Elise even died?" She asked. "He's probably not trying to kill himself. He just wants to find her." 

I checked back at the house - nothing. I might as well stop by the graveyard where Elise was buried too. It didn't make much sense if he still thought she was alive, but I was desperate. It was about 3 in the morning when I saw his shriveled form hunched over her headstone. 

"Dad? Are you okay?" I approached cautiously, terrified that I was too late. He didn't stir as I drew up behind him. Did he just realize that she was dead? Had he spent the last of his strength coming here to say goodbye?

He didn't turn from the grave when he finally spoke. I remember his words as clearly as the cold night air.  

*I met her in the Spring, she wakes me from my deathly slumber,    
wedding bells in joyous ring, summer toil could not encumber   
one shared soul as ours so blessed, and through Autumn's firey air,   
am I to love her any less, now Winter rips her branches bare?   
Or softly shall I sit and mourn, all the dark hours of the night   
Until once more is spring reborn, and her eyes refill with light?*    

Did he really believe she was coming back? Or was this his way of understanding? I sat down next to him and wrapped my coat around his frail shoulders. His eyes sparkled in the pale moonlight, but not from grief. I don't remember ever seeing him look so happy. 

"But it's already Spring," a voice said. *My mother's voice*. I was watching my Dad and didn't notice until she was standing directly before us. Or maybe she had just appeared there - I don't know - but she wasn't old anymore. She looked how I remember her when I was a child. She embraced my father, and before my eyes he shed his years as lightly as his tears. 

Dad was growing taller. My coat which draped around his shoulders swelled like a balloon as his muscles became firm. The bulging veins in his hands receded as he held my mother, and his skin pulled taut as the deep network of wrinkles which mapped out his life vanished. They both looked younger than I did now.  

Mother winked at me from over Dad's shoulder. She held a finger to her lips and said: 

"It'll be our little secret, okay? Let's all go home." 

---

My wife called a dozen times over the next week. I just told her everything was fine and we'd talk about it when she got back. It was better than fine though - I felt like I was living inside a dream. 

I woke every morning to my mom's scrambled eggs and french toast. I wanted to call in sick from work and spend every minute with them, but she insisted I still go and threatened to drive me there herself. Every night I'd return to watch Dad rebuilding his models, swearing good-naturedly when he couldn't find a piece. Then we'd all eat dinner as a family and watch a movie together - Dad making sarcastic comments throughout and Mom giggling like a school girl with a crush. 

I've never seen them so happy. I've never remembered *being* so happy. They had aged so slowly over the years and I had pulled away from them so gradually that I never really dwelt on how close we once were. It was just like being a kid again. After a disagreement at work, someone even shot back that I *smelled funny*. Who since the 3rd grade has ever used an argument like that? 

I couldn't wait for my wife to get home. I'd kept my parents a secret from everyone, and I was so pleased with myself for resisting the urge to tell her. Sure they couldn't live with me forever, but just seeing the look on my wife's face when she walked in would be priceless. 

When I picked her up from the airport, she seemed a little withdrawn. I tried to kiss her but she pulled away. 

"Have you been okay alone? You've been taking care of yourself, right?" 

I just laughed. She seemed worried about me. Maybe she was tired from traveling, maybe her relatives stressed her out, but as soon as I showed her what had happened she would forget all about it. 

"Welcome home dear!" My Mother said when I opened the door. "And isn't she darling!"

"How was the trip?" My Father asked. 

I just watched my wife's face, unable to contain my gigantic grin. She was shocked alright. Her mouth was just hanging open. Then she coughed and covered her nose.

"Well? What do you think?" I asked her. 

"I think I'm going to be sick," she said - and she was. Right there on the entry mat. The smell of her vomit was like some kind of trigger. Suddenly the whole house smelled absolutely rancid. 

"Do you smell that, Mom? What is it?" 

Mom - what was left of her decaying body - was propped up on the sofa. Dad, bloated from gas and covered with a yellow/green mold, was sitting in his armchair. I couldn't understand what happened. 

My wife ran out and called the police. They took away the bodies and took me in for a psych evaluation. The next few days were a blur, but eventually I was released with the diagnosis of "hallucinations stemming from PTSD". They said my Father had died the night he escaped after catching pneumonia in the night air. They said my mother had been dug up, and that the trunk of my car contained a dirty shovel. 

I don't believe them though. I didn't even own a shovel. I think they were just trying to cover up for something they couldn't explain. I don't get what the big deal was anyway. Even if they were gone, so what if I did want to keep them?

Should I love them any less in [the winter](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade)?

	<TITLE> Welcome to Anger Management </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-30 00:13:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hate Clive. His smug lopsided grin, his greasy comb-over, his horn-rimmed glasses - I don't think I'd brake if I saw him crossing the street. In fact, I fantasize about it every time I sit down in his office.  

"Third time this week, huh?" he asked me. 

"It's not my fault," I said. "I gave Robert every chance to back down. He's the one who should be in here, not me." 

"He's not the one who punched a dent in someone's car." 

Of all the things I hate about Clive, nothing compares to his title as Human Resources Director. I wonder if he ever had sex, or if inconveniencing my life was the only thing he needed to get off.  

"I apologized already, okay? Can I go back to work now?" 

"I can't just keep letting these incidents slide," Clive said, pressing his glasses into his face like he was trying to glue them on. "This is going in my quarterly report to management." 

My fantasy of hitting him with the car now included a section where I back up once or twice. I clenched my fists and took a deep breath, counting off a full ten seconds in my mind. 

Getting written up would jeopardize my shot at the branch manager position. I didn't waste four years of my life in this shit-hole just to stay in sales. As much as it hurt, I was going to have to suck up to this bean-bag masquerading as a human being.  

"You're right, you're absolutely right," I replied. "I was in the wrong there. Even though he was in my parking spot, I shouldn't have punched his car. I know I have a problem, and I've started taking an anger management class. It's going to help and this won't happen again, so please give me one more chance before you report it." 

"Good for you buddy." 

*Buddy*. Call me that again and I'll jab my pen in your neck, *buddy*. I smiled.  

"I'll tell you what," he added. "Give me the number of the place you're meeting at and I'll check in with them. If they think you're showing signs of improvement, I'll keep this out of your report." 

Shit. Now I'll actually have to go to a class. My mouth hurt from smiling so hard. "Sure thing, *buddy*," I said. "I don't have the number with me, but I'll bring it in tomorrow." 

---

I opened the door and immediately shut it again. This couldn't be the anger management class I found online. There was *incense* burning in there, and drums like some kind of freakin' hippy circle. The door opened, and an old Asian man blended into the doorway. 

I felt a certain tranquility just from looking at him. He wore immaculate ceremonial robes like some sort of priest, and his snow-white hair cascaded down his back in gentle waves. He bowed low to me, his body curving with a supple grace which utterly belied his apparent age. 

"Hi, is this where the United Way anger group meets?" 

"Welcome kind sir. My name is Ikari, and it is so good to see a man such as yourself so in command of his own destiny. Won't you please come in?" 

---

There weren't any corny brochures with perfect models saying anger gives you ulcers. No dolls for me to be nice to, no punching bags to vent on. I don't really know what I was expecting, but it definitely wasn't this. 

"The website said 6:30. Where is everyone?" I asked. 

There weren't even any chairs in the small room. Two cushions were placed on the ground between a pair of bonsai trees, and Ikari sat down on one to face me.

"No others, only you. I do not need groups, because those who seek my help must only ask once to be saved."

"I don't need saving, okay?" I was starting to feel uncomfortable. The website looked legit, but this guy seemed more like a cultist than a therapist. What if he didn't have the right accreditation or something? I could be wasting my time.  

"I handle my own issues just fine," I added. "All I need is for you to talk to the HR director at my work and tell him whatever - tell him I'm master of my destiny or something. I already paid online, so are we good?" 

"We are far from good, for we are each imperfect beings inflicted with the human condition. Do not worry though, you will soon be better." 

I checked my watch. Tight smile. Can someone sprain a muscle from forcing too many of those? It felt like it. I sat cross-legged on the available pillow and tried not to swear at the awkward position. 

"Fucking shit. Sorry. Don't you have a chair?" Oops. Oh well, he already knew I had an issue. 

Ikari just smiled, but his was nothing like my smile. His bubbled straight up from the warmth in his heart. It was patient and wise, almost as though he was reading straight from the Divine playbook of the Universe and knew everything was following the script.  

"Do you know why there is suffering?" Ikari asked. The measured tone made me pretty sure he wasn't talking about the lack of chairs. 

"Because we're all evil sinners who deserve it?" I asked. 

"No-one deserves to suffer," Ikari replied. "But we do, because we each carry a Demon in our hearts. Anger, jealousy, hatred, misery, these are ways we feed our Demon. And do you know what happens when we've fed it for too long?" 

I shook my head. My Demon must be pretty full by now. 

Ikari leaned in close to me and whispered: *"Gobble gobble gobble. It eats us right up."* The way he said it made me shudder. It was like he was satisfying a greedy pleasure just from speaking the words. I felt immense relief when he settled back into his own cushion before continuing. 

"Eventually, our Demon becomes stronger than we are and it gets to be the one on the outside. Who we are - who we were - that gets locked away. And unless someone tricks the Demon into eating kindness, gratitude, patience, and other virtues, we will never become strong enough to wrestle the Demon back down." 

"So how do we stop feeding the Demon?" I asked.

"You take away its food," Ikari produced a small wooden jewelry box, every inch of which was engraven with Japanese lettering, "and you put it in here. Have a bad feeling? Write it down on a piece of paper, slip the paper through this hole in the top. Angry at someone? Give it to the box. It won't be long before your Demon begins to starve. Every problem can be solved by simply putting it in the box."

"And that's it? I won't be angry?" I was trying really hard not to laugh at him. 

"And I shall tell Mr. HR that you are all better," Ikari smiled and handed me the box. "Only one more thing - you must not ever open the box, or *Gobble gobble gobble.* Your Demon will feed again." 

---

What a load, right? But that was easier than sitting through a bunch of dumb meetings. I would have just thrown the box out right then, but Ikari might check it later to see the notes I'd put in. 

When I got home, I figured I'd just get it all out of the way at once so I wouldn't have to think about it. I grabbed a notebook and tore out a couple dozen pieces of paper.

**The feeling when I'm stuck going 5 mph on the freeway.** Slip.  
**Clive's everything. I hate him so damn much.** Slip.   
**People who kick dogs. I wish they'd kick Clive instead.** Slip.   

The more I wrote, the more ideas began flooding into my head. Everything I could think of that pissed me off started cramming into the box.  

**People who steal parking spaces (fuck you Robert).**    
**The taste of orange juice after brushing your teeth.**  
**Every girl who has ever given me that "it's not you, it's me" shit.**  

The box didn't look that big, and I expected it to only take ten minutes to fill. Three hours later though, I had emptied an entire notebook and still couldn't feel the paper inside. But do you know what I did feel? 

Like a mother-fuckin' Buddha. It seemed absolutely ludicrous that any of those things have ever bothered me before. Poor Clive, just trying to do his job. Why did I have to give him such a hard time? And Robert *should* have my parking spot near the door. He was older than me, and I didn't mind the exercise. So how in the world did I get to the point of punching a dent in his car? 

I've never slept so well in my entire life. I'm usually tense and unable to find a comfortable position, but five minutes after I lay down I was sound asleep. I did have one troubling dream though: there was a soft light coming from inside the box on my night-table. In my dream I got up to reach for it, but then I heard something inside of it *scream* like a man who has been pushed past the edge of breaking. I opened the box to see what was making the noise, and then *Gobble gobble gobble*. I woke up to the freshest, most miraculous morning I could remember. 

---

The last two weeks were perfect for me. I worked tirelessly, unfettered by the daily aggravations which I used to spend half the day obsessing over. I started bringing the box to work just in case something came up in the day, and things always came up. No point in risking my promotion, right? The box went everywhere with me. 

**The sound of dry erase markers on a whiteboard.** Slip. 

Suddenly the morning meeting was bearable again. 

"Hey did anyone hear that?" Mr. Elsworth turned away from the whiteboard to address the assembly. "Something like a scream?" 
 
A collective shrug and sip of coffee. I thought I'd heard it too though. The moment I slipped the paper in, there had been a soft *flash* of light and an echoing *scream*.

---

**Clients who think they know how to do my job better than I do.** Slip.  
**Having to wear a tie all day. I could strangle someone with this tie.**   

There it was again. It started out as a low *moan*, but rose into a gurgling *scream* after I had slipped the second note in. I glanced up to see Clive standing outside my cubicle. 

"What? What are you doing? What do you want?" Just looking at him made me agitated. 

"I wanted to let you know that I called Mr. Ikari, and he said you showed a complete turnaround. As long as nothing happens before tomorrow, your report is going to be clean. Congratulations buddy."  

**When people I hate call me buddy"**    
**Clive again.**  

The box *screamed*. It was louder this time. Clive had already gone, but someone was going to hear it if I kept this up. This was the second note I'd had to use for Clive too. I guess some hatred is too deep to extract all at once. 

Worse still, the moaning continued even though I wasn't putting anything in now. It sounded like the lamentations of a dying man. I shut the box in my drawer, but I could still hear it *groaning* away. Then a soft *rattle*. I opened the drawer and saw the box trembling as a frightened animal. 

Well shit. I couldn't just throw it away. I had to get my anger out somehow or that promotion was gone. I couldn't keep it here either though, because someone was going to -

"What's that sound? Is that the pipes?" 

I didn't answer them. I didn't look at them. I walked fast through the building with the box in my pocket. The warehouse - it's always noisy down there. If I hide the box, then no-one will hear it and I can still get down to slip a note in if I need to. 

**The sound of forklifts backing up.**  
**The restaurant which always gets my lunch order wrong.**   

It was 4:30 now. Only half an hour to go and I was in the clear. I was walking down to the warehouse to slip my last note of the day into the box.

**Mr. Elsworth keeping people till 5 even when there's nothing to do.**  

I opened the crate of printer paper where I'd stored the box and reached around. Odd, I usually could hear the screaming when I was this close to it. Especially now, since the machinery was all quiet after the warehouse workers left for the day. 

It wasn't there. I practically dove into the crate, but my box wasn't anywhere. It was only half an hour though, right? I could make it half an - but no. Without the box, the anger would still be there. Even if I did get the promotion, I'm sure Elsworth would notice sooner or later and bump me back down. It wasn't fair. I'd put in the work - I was better than any of them. It wasn't right for me to keep getting passed over just because -

*Scream*. There it was. What started out as a horrible sound now filled me with relief. It was the next sound which I dreaded more. 

"What in God's name are you doing in there?" 

I pulled myself out of the crate to face Clive. He was holding *my* box in his hand. And it was open. 

"Give it back. Now," I snapped. "It's mine." 

But he was reading my notes. Those were personal! He had no right to - 

"Is this some kind of joke?" Clive asked. "Why is my name in here? And such rude language -" 

"You want language? Give me back my fucking box." 

My last note of the day was crumpled up in my hand. I was seeing red. I wanted to grab him by the throat and - but no. I needed that promotion. I couldn't lose it now. 

"I'm sorry, Clive. It was just an assignment from anger management class. It's supposed to be confidential, so give it back. This doesn't need to change anything with your report."

"My report?" Clive practically shrieked. "You're still worried about your promotion? You aren't going to have a job at all after this. If this is how you really think, then we have no place for you -" 

I punched him across the face. I didn't want to, but I couldn't stop myself. All the little frustrations and pent up anger from the past two weeks were flooding back. I hit him for every day this company has stolen from my life, for every promotion which passed me over, and for every lonely night I sat at home too tired from work to go out. I pummeled his face into a pulpy mess and still couldn't get enough. 

The box was *screaming* like a banshee, convulsing on the floor where Clive had dropped it. I couldn't tell how much of the blood on my knuckles was his and how much was mine, and I didn't care. As good as it felt to be at peace with myself, this felt *better*. At least for a little while, until Clive stopped moving. 

I dropped him back to the warehouse ground. The *screaming* - it was driving me crazy. I tried to stuff the scattered papers back into the empty box, but they wouldn't fit any more. They spilled out over the ground, covered in my bloody finger prints. 

How did I let this happen? What would Ikari have done? He said any problem could go away if I put it in the box. Well shit, Clive was a problem and now he was going in a box, but that only made things worse. I stuffed his body and the bloody papers into one of the warehouse crates, mopped up as much of the blood as I could, and ran. 

---

"Open up! Open up old man!" I was back at the anger management class. If this was anyone's fault, it was Ikari's. He must have known what the box did or he never would have given it to me. He must know how to make things right. He *had* to. 

The door was unlocked, so I went in. Ikari was sitting on his cushion across from a middle-aged woman. I didn't want to involve anyone else in this, so I waited in the corner for her to finish. She handed him a box which looked just like mine to Ikari and thanked him. She was so grateful. It changed her life. Well good-for-fucking her, because it ruined mine. 

"Please have a seat," Ikari said after the woman had gone. 

"It was opened," I blurted out. "Not by me - somebody else - and they're dead now. This isn't my fault, so you gotta help me fix this." 

"I understand," he replied gravely. Then he leaned in real close - so close I wanted to hit him, but I held myself back - and he whispered: "Gobble gobble gobble." 

I actually pushed him back into his seat. "Don't give me that shit. You must know what happens. Why do you do this to people?" 

A slow smile crept across his peaceful face. "Because I am so hungry. And all the hate they pour into their boxes returns to feed me. But you have already let your Demon out, so what am I to eat now?" 

The dead man in the warehouse was suddenly the least of my problems. Ikari was standing, although for some reason I never remembered watching him stand. Then he was behind me, not having touched the intervening space. I was absolutely speechless. I back-peddled until my back hit a wall -

No, not a wall. He was behind me again. His arm wrapped around my neck, his long nails digging into the side of my throat. 

"When I look at you, all I see is a Demon now," he said. "All I can see is your selfish *hunger*."

I didn't dare speak. Even swallowing was enough to push those nails deeper into my skin. I strained against his implacable grip with my hands, but with every motion the puncture became deeper. His arm constricted with the relentless predatory pressure of a boa, and I was utterly helpless in its grasp. 

"But your Demon has already fed on my meal, so here is what you must do. Find those like yourself with anger burning in their hearts, and collect it for me as I have done with you. Twice each month you will bring me a new box filled with hatred or..." 

He didn't need to finish the sentence. *Gobble gobble gobble*. The pressure slackened just enough for me to nod. 

Maybe someday I will learn how to trick my Demon. Someday I will learn how to be kind even with this hatred burning in my chest, and I will lock him away. Someday I will learn to control my anger and not the other way around, but until then ...

Would you like to stop feeding your Demon? You only need to ask once for me to [save you](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

That's what I heard from beside me at 2 AM. 

"What did you say?" I asked my husband. He didn't answer. Good, then it wasn't important. I had to use the bathroom anyway, but nestled under a down-comforter with our tabby cat Meeps snuggled between us made me seriously consider my options. Wet the bed? Too sticky. Excavate myself from the pile of blankets and face the cold hard bathroom tiles? Please no. Hold it in and develop a weak bladder? 

Eh, we were all going to get old and fall apart someday anyway. I had no intention of getting out of that bed for anything short of a nuclear strike. Just when I started flirting with the other side of consciousness though, I heard it again: 

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

"Wake up Jordan. You're having a bad dream." I sat up and shook my husband's shoulder. He grunted and half-halfheartedly pushed my hand away. That should do the trick. But as long as I was up... 

I uprooted Meeps and climbed out of bed. He gave me that "how dare you, peasant" expression that all cats have mastered without parallel. I was half-way to the bathroom and wondering if I could teach myself to piss while sleepwalking when - 

*"Run away, or -"* 

I stopped and rubbed my eyes. That wasn't my husbands voice. It wasn't coming from my bed at all. That was unmistakably from inside my closet. Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong independent woman. I kill my own spiders and everything, but there's no decent minded person anywhere who could hear that without screaming bloody murder. 

It wasn't really a scream - more of a "what the thunder-flicking-fuck was that?" - but it was loud enough to get Jordan on his feet in a second. It was so cute how protective he was of me. My father never approved of him because Jordan had cocaine trouble as a teenager, but to me he had always been the perfect man. 

"What's going on? Are you alright?" Jordan asked. 

"There's someone here," I replied with the same wide-eyed sincerity a four year old might muster. 

"Honey come back to bed. There isn't anyone-"

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."* 

"There!" I said. "It's coming from the closet." 

"I didn't hear anything."

"Check it for me? Please? Pleeeeease?" I gave him my best impersonation of a desperate puppy. He sighed and headed for the door.   

"Don't! I changed my mind!" I said. "There's a murderer inside!" 

"I wouldn't worry," he replied. "It's probably just my laptop randomly unpausing a video or something. Besides, if it was a murderer, he'd just kill us in our sleep." 

"Real reassuring. Thanks." 

Jordan opened the door, but his body was blocking my view. I hopped around on my toes to peer over his shoulder. 

My Doll - my Angel Doll, the one I'd had since I was a baby - was lying on the ground. I rushed to pick her up, reverently cradling her and completely forgetting about the monster for a moment. She wasn't really an Angel, just a Raggedy-Ann Doll with little cloth wings sewn onto her back. But she was mine, in the same way as my hair was brown or my skin was fair; she was part of me. 

"Well there's nothing in here, so I'm going back to bed," Jordan said, slumping off across the floor. 

"What do you think knocked her off the shelf though?" I asked. "And look! Her stomach is all ripped open." 

"I'll call a doctor in the morning. Goodnight." He was already consumed by the indistinguishable blanket blob. 

I sat there on the floor holding my Doll. We were inseparable when I was a kid. This doll had endured everything, including a part time gig as a bulldog's chew-toy and the lead investigator of a vacuum's inside. She had been ripped, stained, shredded, and impaled a dozen odd times, and Dad had always been able to fix her for me before. Of course, now that he was gone I would have to learn to fix it myself, but that was okay. When I have a kid of my own, they'll probably need me to fix it for them too. 

I gently poked the leaking fluff back into the Doll's chest cavity and - 

"Shit snacks". Something stung my finger prompting its quick passage to my mouth. Was something in there? I opened the Doll a little further, careful not to lose any of the stuffing, and pulled out a tightly folded sheet of paper. I recognized the handwriting immediately.

**Dear Amelie**

It was the same handwriting with the same loopy "D" I had seen every year on my birthday card. Every year except this one anyway. I sat cross-legged on the floor and Meeps wiggled her way into my lap while I read my father's secret letter. 

---

**Dear Amelie**

The telling of an adventure becomes an adventure in itself. Fantasies will unburden your spirit from the constraints of reality, and horror is as thrilling for the author as it is for the reader.  

But my story is not so easily told. Every time I try to bleed my memories free, I am frozen with helpless shame and guilt. The events of my youth have haunted me throughout my life, and I fear I will not go quietly into death until I have found peace in their recounting. 

I hope you will forgive me for inscribing my story in verse. It is the only way I know how to distance myself from the pain and turn the tragedy of my life into something beautiful. I hope before the end of your days you too will find a way to burn your darkness with such brilliant fire as to illuminate the way for others. 

Forever yours,  
-Dad

It should be said, right at the start,  
all happy families are the same.  
For joys are shared in equal parts,     
though misery is unique in blame.  
It comes in many varied forms,  
but you will know it when its seen.     
When the perfect mask is torn,   
and sundered at the seams.   

So it was when I was young,  
a son first and child after.  
Playing with father was endless fun;  
and every shared moment laughter.  
I learned how to view the world  
from astride my fathers knee.  
And when the night left me curled,   
his stories would bring sleep.  

But life is heavier for some than others,  
and it pressed hard upon this man.  
A war waged between him and my mother -  
he stopped trying and simply ran.  
I was left to wondering,  
where my father went at night.    
Then home late with blundering,    
too much drink had made him fight.     

One night the drink brought a rage  
that I had never seen before.  
The beatings could not be assuaged,    
so out I fled through kitchen door.  
I wandered the streets very late,  
hiding from that awful noise,  
not knowing it was my fate,  
to find salvation in a toy.  

Tossed upon garbage and refuse,  
the broken Doll of an Angel lay.   
It was worn-deep from over use,    
but I still took her home to play.   
When the violence was lit by booze,   
I held it to keep my fears at bay.   
Then finally when there came a truce,  
I would thank her when I prayed.  

The quiet never lasted, nor the peace,       
and I kept the doll close beside.   
Once I was too bruised to sleep,  
and waited instead to finally die.  
Instead the Doll began to speak,  
telling me that I was safe.  
That even when the world was bleak,   
I must trust the Doll with faith.  

The Doll offered more than reality,  
and proved my great escape.  
It would sing tales of fantasy:  
of villains, heroes and their capes.   
Beasts and monsters with their fangs,     
of highway men and roaming gangs,   
who were locked up tight with a clang,  
prevailing justice when she sang.  

Since then we never parted ways,  
where I went, the Doll followed after.     
She sat beside me when I played,    
or sheltered me in the attic rafters.  
The doll peaked from my bag at school,    
(the other children laughed, I know).  
But I didnt mind the jeering fools  
who didn't know how to take a blow.  

I wish my mother had a Doll    
to take away her pain -   
to free her back against the wall,  
and cease the falling of the cane.  
I offered the Angel Doll to her,  
but she insisted that I keep.   
Saying it was too late to deter,  
the wounds which cut too deep.   

One night her screaming wouldn't end,    
and I offered up a solemn plea:  
That even this hurt would mend,  
I begged the Angel answer me.  
No comfort now like in the past,  
the Doll offered this foresight:   
"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."   

---

I stopped reading. I was so tired, I had completely forgotten about what made me get out of bed in the first place. I stared at the coarse face with its black sewn on buttons and flame of red hair. It was just a Doll - the same Doll it had always been. 

"Jordan?" My voice was timid. I shouldn't wake him up again. It was stupid to think -

"Yeah?" 

"Do you trust me?" 

"Of course, honey. What are you still doing up?" 

"I want to get out of the house. Now." 

The pile of blankets slouched aside and he sat up to stare at me. He looked at the letter in my hands, then nodded. He put on his robe and handed me mine, and we walked out the front door in silence. 

"Where are we going?" 

"Away," I said. "Can you drive?" 

It was like he could sense when something was important to me. He smiled and nodded. We didn't need words. I hopped into the passenger seat and flipped on the reading light to finish the letter while he drove. 

---

"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."   

I grew angry and yelled louder,    
but no other sound came out her.    
I flung her from my window seat,   
out of the house, into the street.   
Telling her she was no good,  
if the Angel no longer could   
speak and tell me calming tales   
drowning out the fighting wails.  

Mother was in pain, a bestial yelp -  
through the thin walled home.  
I couldn't face my fear and help -  
I couldn't bear the sound alone.   
I ran until I was out of breath,  
far away from here.  
I didnt care if I met my death,   
I willed to disappear. 

Snow and bitter winds cut in  
probing through my jacket thin.  
I leaned against a tree to rest,   
yet dared not chance to sleep in less   
I would waken to find myself  
alone in the world with no one else,  
or waken not, stiff frozen skin  
a tribute to what might have been.   

I wish I hadn't thrown the Doll away   
when I needed her the most.  
It wasn't her fault she had to say  
that death was flying close.  
The morning found my mother dead,  
as the Doll that I once found.  
Forsaken and thrown on garbage bed;    
a trash heap burial mound.  

For many years, a lost Raggedy-Ann,  
my Doll must have searched the Earth.   
Until she found not a boy, but a man,  
and his lady who was giving birth.  
I had run so far from life,  
that I had found a life anew.  
The Doll gazed upon my beautiful wife,   
and the child who now grew.   
 
The Angel Doll lay down softly,  
knowing her part had been played.   
The boy was gone, and though missed awfully,    
times direction could not be swayed.  
I found her there, against hospital door,  
still and quiet as the dead.   
I scooped her up and to her swore   
to fix her tattered threads.  

By my word, she was cured  
of the ills this world had shown.   
My baby girl brought in the world   
was gifted with a Doll newly sewn.  
I will never make the mistakes   
that drove my mother to her grave.  
And the Doll will never lie awake  
to take away your pain.

I was in tears by the time I finished. Dad would have been 58 on the first of May. Jordan kept giving me these nervous glances, but he was respectful and didn't pry. 

"How much further, you think?" is all he asked. "There's a motel up ahead. Want to spend the night there?" 

These weren't pretty tears. They were big, snotty, sloppy tears. I was too choked up to answer, but he pulled into the parking lot anyway. He understood me so well, it was like he was made for me. 

---

I held the Doll while I fell asleep in the motel. I knew I owed Jordan big for this. I felt so stupid for dragging us out here, but the letter and my cry had been cathartic and I was so tired that I felt oddly at peace. It was the best I'd felt since the funeral. And who knows, maybe some freak tornado will hit the house and I'll know some part of Dad really is still out there watching over -

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

It came from the Doll: a small voice like a child who was afraid of being caught. 

"I already did run away." I felt too guilty to wake Jordan up again after all this, so I whispered the reply.

*"Not far enough. He's still with you,"* she replied. I couldn't see the Doll's mouth moving or anything, but there was nothing else which could have been talking to me. I looked over at Jordan's harmless, sleeping body. Was I really going to trust a phantom voice over my husband who I've known and loved for years? 

But it wasn't just any voice. Somehow it was my father trying to reach me, and him I would trust till the ends of the Earth. I took the Doll and my phone and quietly slipped out the door. I wasn't going to leave him stranded, so I took an UBER back home. While we were driving, I wrote him a long text message thanking him for being so understanding and apologizing for my behavior. I told him how much he meant to me, and that all of this was just because I was having such a hard time with Dad's passing. He was so kind that he probably wouldn't have even needed it, but it felt good to tell him anyway. 

I hope Jordan got the chance to read it before he died. The next time I woke, it was to the hammering of police on my front door. They informed me that my husband was found dead in his hotel room with three bullet holes in his chest. Future investigations revealed the coke habit wasn't as ancient history as I thought. He owed a lot of money to the wrong people, and they followed our car to the motel. If it wasn't for the Doll, I'd be dead too. 

I still think Dad was wrong about Jordan though. I don't regret a minute of our time together. And Dad was wrong about another thing too - the Angel Doll was going to have to lie awake with me for a long time before she can [take away the pain](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog)

	<TEXT> I agree. At first I thought it was my father warning me, but if the doll warned him too then I wonder what kind of entity it is though. </TEXT>
