	<TEXT> I like to educate those who scream "free speech" that there is a difference between the government persecuting you for what you say and your fellow citizens managing social norms. The latter is no different than your grandmother flicking behind your after you said something rude. Having someone call you out on your inappropriate behavior is someone giving you that proverbial flick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The batshit is understandable. Let's look at this under societal norms. YOU are dating a mature older gentleman. That gives you some street cred. HE is dating a ninth grader (in the U.S.school system anyway). You won't see this until you get to his age, but when you do become 21 you'll look at 14 year-olds and realize that he is a predator.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I see a kid holding out his/her hand in front of me during a race I yell out "Are you my turbo boost?! I need some help! ".  When I slap their hand I do a little sprint and say "thanks! " over my shoulder. It's a total waste of energy, especially near the finish of a marathon, but it makes the kids visibly happy. </TEXT>
