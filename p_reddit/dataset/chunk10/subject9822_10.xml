	<TEXT> Hello everyone! I also posted this to r/jobs but I figured I would try here also, you guys and gals are the best.

Just a FYI, you're dealing with an extremely nervous/anxious person so you've all been warned. 

Here's the deal...I've been working for a public accounting firm for about two years now. During that time I've done primarily state government audits, two of which I've been the in-charge on. For the sake of anonymity I won't say which state. As great of a time I've had at the firm I'm at, I am ready to move on. As luck would have it, an accounting position opened up at a state agency. I applied for it and received a letter in the mail for an interview shortly.

My mother already works for the state so I was aware of the whole process. To help matters, her boss (significantly higher up at the state) knew my interviewer and put in a good word for me. My interview was last Wednesday (April 5th)...I'm a very good interviewer and I know it went well, we laughed and joked and went about our way. She stated during the interview that the process takes about 4-6 weeks...a person would either get a letter in the mail saying they were not selected or would receive an email regarding background check information. The next day, Thursday, April 6th I received an email requesting my information for a background check. All last week I received calls for a drug test, fingerprinting, they contacted my local police departments to check my record, you name it. I have no criminal history, no firings, not a terrible credit report but no gold standard (I'm a 24 year old with student debt). One thing they wanted was to talk to my current employer. I directed them towards out HR department and all was well. I received a call from the individual in charge of the background check saying they needed more information so I gave them a previous boss (who worked for the same firm) and they were to contact her.

Fast forward to today. I called the person in charge of the background check to make sure she had everything, as she had not yet contacted my old boss (I keep in touch with him and asked him...nothing). She replied "we have all the information, I will let you know if we need anything else." Feeling nervous as I haven't heard anything one way or the other, my mother asked her boss what he thought and he said it was all a very good sign, as they normally don't go through this process for all candidates as it's rather expensive for the whole process. 

So what do you all think? I really, really want an offer as this would be such a big step up from my current position. I'm extremely nervous about it as I had to tell one of the partners at my firm (who was very understanding) about the process as they wanted to contact the firm I work for. Now I feel like if I don't get it I'm going to be in a bad light at the firm, regardless of what they really say. And I realize this Wednesday will only be two weeks from my interview but like I said, super nervous here. 

Thanks everyone! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey thanks! The 1,800 came from a re-calculation...I'm wondering if I need to do a larger deficit to shock my body a little...

It's actually a pretty funny story, I was seeing a personal trainer and he got let go from the gym (a totally bullshit reason but that's too long to explain here) and he taught capoeira on the side. I didn't want to abandon him because we had became friends so I joined capoeira. That was last March and I've loved it ever since. I am nowhere near agile or flexible but I still find things I love doing and it pushes me in ways I never would have thought. I highly suggest giving it a go!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone!

I feel like I'm stuck in a huge rut lately...I went from 331 down to 228 and now I've been stagnant since October. Here's a quick run-down of my routine:

Monday, Wednesday - Weight lifting coupled with cardio.
Tuesday, Thursday, Sunday - Rest.
Friday, Saturday - Capoeira. 

I'm normally eating around 1,800 calories completely plant based. My protein levels are very high so that's not an issue. I'm burning close to 3,500 calories a day.

So what's going on...is this just something I need to wait and break through or am I doing something wrong? My goal is to be below 200lbs but god dammit it's frustrating hitting this big of a road block.

Thanks everyone!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Help] Crying Coming Home from Daycare </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-20 01:42:00 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone!
Meet Annie, my 11 week old, 21lbs little terror! 

http://imgur.com/a/VFJuV

Her Dad is a golden doodle and her Mom is a golden lab and she's 100% adorable. I work every day and thus, have put her in doggy daycare so she can get some running around as well as a chance to socialize with other dogs.
For first two weeks she was in daycare, she would run out of my arms to get inside in the morning she would run into my arms at night, lick me to death and we would leave. Recently, she still runs inside in the morning and runs to me at night but has also begun whining when I pick her up and for the first few minutes after we leave. Is she crying because she doesn't want to leave or crying because she's happy to be leaving? I don't want her hating it there and crying because she's essentially so happy to be gone haha.
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because I love dogs and wanted one, that's why. Why are you so rude? I don't keep her in a crate for 10 hours a day, if you read the post right you would have noticed that. I've been having someone take her out, play with her, feed her, etc...I'm not some raging asshole that's the whole problem here. 

I'm taking her to doggy day care, hopefully that's enough to satisfy your pretentiousness.  </TEXT>
