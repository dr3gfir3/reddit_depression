	<TEXT> Yeah man I got flawless using it on my at the time 420 cp Magsorc, (first try I'll add). I didn't really have a choice tho, didn't have ANY illam or groth shoulders. But hey, free 10k shield with near 100% uptime. Put some cp into bastion if you do go this route.
  
Fwiw- I've run it countless times on Xbox, decided to switch to PC a few months back </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "SB" was found written on my door frame at my apt, about the same height as the dead bolt. The letters are around 1" high, written in pencil.
  
Theory 1- SB stands for the initials of a maintenance person. After checking out hvac + sprinkler heads.
  
Theory 2- SB stands for single blond. 
  
What do you folks think. Should I be alarmed?
  
I'm not the blond but my gf is, obvs not single but if it was a casing of the place I could have been absent, but her present. </TEXT>

Full divines necropotence, gold mats to gold it
More gold mats
More gold mats
Around 1000 spell power pots
A ton of tanking gear, dragon armor/weps, werewolf hide
Inventory space for all Alts and bank
Guild raffles
  
I bought an extra 30 rosin or so to sell after morrowind drops, I have a feeling more staves/traits will be viable and rosin will get a hike in price. Could be wrong, since it's the cheapest gold mat </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some tips for dungeon healing - at your stage in the game, chances are your group DPS will be pretty low, so instead of full on healing- do dps! Templars have a great spammable that is an area come that also heals you. It's almost god mode while hitting targets, use this to help your group clear mobs and bosses. As for heals- drop your area heals and heals over time, then do DPS, reapplying those heals of the group needs them. Use honor the dead or breath of life for the harder bosses, or when a group mate takes a huge hit. This is your strongest heal. You should be able to get thru any group dungeon with sweeps, harness magic, and breath/honor. Pro tip- 2-3 sweeps then reapply all your dots/hots. This is your rotation. When you get into harder content you can become a full blown healer, but having dps early on in the game will help you immensely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey!
  
Looking to break 40k Dps on the skeleton. I'm bouncing btwn julianos and md w/ groth as well as BSW, md, and groth. My highest is with BSW at 38.1k, but I am more consistent with juli at around 37k. Rotation is empower heavy trap spear wall swap reflective sweep sweep purifying swap spear wall ritual swap. I swap on purifies and (ritual or trap, alternating). Meteor for ult right before first bar swap. So pretty much 2 sweeps and dots til around 30% and then execute light weave. LAs throughout each skill, am high elf, maxed out gear with undaunted (except infused shoulder :/.)
  
I have someone giving me synergies for MD and ele drain. 
  
Any suggestions? Any gameclips? I can post mine when I leave work and record a new one, if anyone would like to crit the clip. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, I'd go with BSW or spinners. Spinners would be better. SM 2-4 piece bonuses aren't as good as BSW or Spinners. Plus, you get more upfront damage with spinners, no proc necessary. BSW procs for me when I don't want it and when I want it it hardly does, so I'm not a fan of it in PVP unless it's on a magdk. </TEXT>
