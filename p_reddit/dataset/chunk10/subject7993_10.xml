	<TEXT> As a Habs fan the Caps-Leafs series had me cheering hardcore for Toronto.  I hated them beforehand and I was hoping they'd miss the playoffs so I could laugh at them.
But damn it, I think I'm a fan now. I'll find out for sure next year I guess.   
The worse was Calgary/Anaheim. I forgot it happened until reading this thread. </TEXT>
