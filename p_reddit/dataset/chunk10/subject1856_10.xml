	<TEXT> Hi guys! I have a friend visiting Oregon in a few weeks and I wanted to take him on a few hikes near Portland or on the coast. I know of the multnomah falls hike and plan to take him there but just wanted to know if there are any other hikes along the way. We're both in decent shape and can handle hikes that are more than 3 miles. We'd love to see nice falls and walk in a creek if need be. Thanks in advance for the suggestions!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The prescription has to be typed first, then processed through insurance, then checked for interactions/dose appropriateness/etc. by the pharmacist, then counted, then checked again by the pharmacist. 
Sometimes phone calls to the doctor's office or insurance company have to be made. Oh and this is on top of at least dozens of other prescriptions that are constantly coming in on the voicemail, fax machine, and electronically. If the medication is a C2, it gets pampered with an additional step or two.
So there you have it really.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They called me Chinese back in elementary school and would make fun of me and pull my hair. For a while there I wished I wasn't Asian and didn't have thick black hair. Eventually I went to middle school where I met totally different people and there were more Asians around so I didn't get teased as much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on how shy he is on the spectrum of being shy. If a guy is too shy to approach me but will open up and tease me a little once we get a conversation going then that's fine. But if he still can't make eye contact or flirt back after we've been conversing for hours then that's no Bueno. Guys, We have to somehow get an idea that you're interested. what's the worst thing that could happen if you ask a girl out? She says no and you learn how to tweak your strategy attack next time.

On a side note, being slightly awkward is also very endearing, to me at least.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to call a locksmith once because I locked my car Keys in the trunk of my car. I was unsure at the time if they were locked in my car, but knew I had a spare in my studio. So I got the locksmith to meet me at my place (dumb I know, but I was desperate at this point). Long story short, he started texting and harassing me afterwards (he got my number from the company he worked for) about going on a date with him and having movie nights. I still have uneasy thoughts going to bed every night.  </TEXT>
