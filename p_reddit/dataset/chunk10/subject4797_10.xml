No, what the investigation found was there was no intent.

She did do something. Just not anything that was strong enough for a criminal case.

Let us not pretend Clinton fucked up using a private server because she did. I voted for her, i was happy to do so and excited to see her be president but she fucked up there in that regard.

Downplaying the severity of something just because no charges were filed diminishing the severity of the actions taken in this ordeal and that shouldn't happen.

	<TEXT> Why would a left-leaning independent media outlet such as ProPublica deflect from the Trump Russia scandal?

Why would the people/the media not also provide oversight into intelligence agencies if they operated not truthfully or wholly accurately compared to their public statements on their actions?

Why can't we talk about both? 

To paraphrase Crooked Media's Lovett or Leave It, why don't liberal people understand that this was a serious investigation into misconduct into the Secretary of State's office's handling of information? James Comey basically tried to explain that it was a serious and legitmate investigation to Sen Feinstein during his hearing last week. Why is that anything that doesn't talk about Trump/Russia on days that there is big news about that get dealt with the same seriousness or at least tone as other news pieces, especially ones from a site like ProPublica? 

That's just ignornance on your behalf for not knowing ProPublica and that is fine but your comment , the tone of it and the idea that others will see this article and think of it as nothing more than deflection rather than reporting is annoying.

The FBI was investigating a legitimate fuck up by Hillary Clinton and her staff, Huma Abedin included.  You or I or anybody else shouldn't write off independent reporting from places like ProPublica into the conduct and actions of the FBI and Director Comey just because it was published on a big news day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So let met get this straight.

Are you claiming that an independent news organization, albeit somewhat left leaning, is chosing to research and report on something that probably the more mainstream NYT/WashingtonPosts of the MSM-sphere are reporting on as to "change the subject?"

I find that to be extremely fucking stupid thing to want an independent outlet like ProPublica to do. Reporting on things that don't get a lot of coverage elsewhere is exactly what ProPublica does best and should do.

Just because they report on something that isn't Russia or today's hearing doesn't mean they are trying to change the subject. Spoiler alert but there are a number of angles and valid criticism of both sides, the investigators and the investigated.

The fact that you said "Don't change the subject" to a ProPublica article is down right insulting and laughable.

We are fully capable of criticizing and investigating Donald Trump as we are the actions of the FBI and James Comey and their operating as well. 

I know that we are capable because we are humans but also because the Senate is doing the same thing. They are investigation Trump and providing Oversight to the FBI.

The people are and should be doing the same thing. The Washington Post and NYT and NBC News and CNN and other outlets big and small are investigation Donald Trump and his  ties to Russia. And the people should continue to critique and oversee the actions of the FBI and it's director much like any organization. 

These people and outlets should also not care too much about when they publish their articles if they do so in the future on a day when some other big news because they should just ignore people who claim they are trying to change the subject by talking about something else of importance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well let's think it out. I think the is a case to be made for yes and no but we need to establish some things and get questions answered.

Treason is defined has giving aid to our enemies. It's in the Constitution and that definition is the only one that matters.

Was Flynn giving aid to our enemies? That is a question we need answers to.

Firstly we should decide who out enemies are and is Russia one of them?

Also would it matter that legally Mike Flynn was not a legal registered agent of a foreign governments? 

I can't say if Flynn committed treason in the legal sense. But I believe that Flynn committed moral treason acting against that which or country was founded on, what he did might not have been treason in the legal sense buy he certainly betrayed his country and his fellow citizens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes and no.

I think that if Mike Pence isn't a moderate neither is John Kasich.

But John Kasich is a man of his views, he is not moderate in his opinions. The difference this election was that he was moderate in his way of speaking, his tone, demeanour, his public persona. He was and is easily digestible on public. Making him seem like the moderate compared to the bombast of Trump or the ideologue of Cruz.

What would make Kasich better than either of them is he's pragmatic. He will take what he can get. My problem is that what he wants is not moderate 
and given a competent republican Congress would give him a lot I disagree with strongly.

So perhaps Kasich is a moderate lawmaker but he's not a moderate in opinion. Perhaps his private view is far far less moderate than good public view or accomplishments but he takes what he can gets.

From the Rolling Stone:

Despite his carefully cultivated appearance, and despite comparisons to the moron and the goblin left standing next to him, John Kasich is no moderate. A cursory look at his record proves the opposite: On the issues that matter, Kasich is a deep-red conservative who would do everything in his power to move America in an uglier, more regressive direction.

Let's look at just one issue: the right of women in Ohio to get an abortion when they need one. As governor, Kasich has done everything in his power to put roadblock after roadblock in their way.

Kasich has worked with the legislature to jam some of the nation's most restrictive anti-abortion policies into the state's budget (a neat trick that makes them easier to pass).

In 2013, the budget defunded Planned Parenthood, eliminating $1.4 million in federal funds that went toward a wide variety of health care services  and not a penny toward abortion, since federal dollars can't pay for abortion anyway.

That same budget funded so-called "crisis pregnancy centers," fake health clinics that offer free pregnancy tests and sometimes ultrasounds to draw women in the door, where counselors ply them with false information claiming abortion causes everything from breast cancer to cooties.

Thanks to Kasich, women in Ohio who need an abortion must undergo an ultrasound  and a doctor must describe the fetus to them  a condescending, harassing provision that implies women don't understand what being pregnant actually is, and that once they find out, they won't want an abortion anymore. (Turns out they pretty much all still do.)

Perhaps ugliest of all, Kasich's 2013 budget banned rape crisis counselors from referring victims of sexual assault to abortion services. Tell a woman who's been raped how to end a pregnancy, and you lose your funding from the state.

John Kasich thinks women who are raped shouldn't be told where they can get an abortion, and he used the power of his governorship to stop it.

The 2015 budget included further restrictions to abortion clinics, meaningless requirements masquerading as "protecting women's health" with the actual purpose of shutting clinics down. And shut down they have: About half of Ohio's abortion providers have shuttered since Kasich took office, and that number could easily rise.

That's the real John Kasich. Not the friendly dad on the debate stage shaking his head at all the bickering. Not the guy who attended a same-sex wedding  the one who went, and still opposes same-sex marriage. Not the one who sounds reasonable and kindthe one who would keep a rape victim from learning where she can end her pregnancy.

	<TEXT> Yes, I am against it. Not only is it not enough money it's a lazy half-assed way of fixing a problem. 


Why go half-assed, halfway with pre-exisiting conditions. Just make it fucking illegal to discriminate against it. Don't bullshit it halfway.

It might pass the house but i will not pass the Senate unless Pre-exisiting conditions are covered wholly and fully as they are in Obamacare. 

Seriously? These guys think that $1.6 billion per year actually makes a difference?

Anyway, who knows what's going to happen now. The basic problem is still the same, namely that this is a very dangerous vote for folks in swing districts. That might be worth it for a higher cause, but not for a bill that can't come close to passing in the Senate.

Plus there's the fact that 24 million people would lose coverage if the bill passes. I suppose that might be a factor for a few Republicans. Maybe.

Everything i've read and heard about Pelosi outside of Reddit, says she was a fantastic House leader that whipped votes and got things done.

Paul Ryan for both issues of himself and of the House Republican party, cannot accomplish the single biggest legislative agenda they have claimed to have for 8 years.

But a good leader as you say gets people on the same page for major legislation. They make compromise, they promise something down the road. 

Paul Ryan can't do that because of the ideaology fracture in the House GOP party but it seems like he isn't trying. He can only placate to the Freedom Caucus or the Tuesday Group because they are so large and because of the intra-partisan divide so different.

That is a whole another problem for the House GOP party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well then Paul Ryan needs to realize that not only is he bad a whipping votes for something the party as whole promised to do but also that they need to pick their battles and/or accept their losses.

Republicans aren't going to get a win repealing or doing anything that restricts Obamacare. Yes there are fixes that need to be done but it's clear that those fixes are not going to be accomplished by letting the market decide or other conservative ideas.

There are plenty of ways "small government" or the Conservative way of thinking of politics could help or at least not be as unpopular. He or they need to accept that Healthcare is not one of the issues they can win on or get something helpful done.

It's obviously a multi-faceted issue with a number of problems from both the party's spin, Ryan's incompetence and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What? What sorta of distorted view do you have that this is the take away you get?

I didn't hear any news of deaths following the strike so I asked if that is true, for i don't know, proof or a source or news report to show that "oh people did die."

And you can't even confirm whether or not people actually died and whether your comment is legitmately truthful? How fucking shameful.

There is plenty to shit on Donald Trump about and you better be god damn right and not just be making up details about things because that is a poor way to do it.

And a minor detail of a missile strike intended to damage an airbase is the deaths of people in surrounding areas? How the fuck are unintended deaths a minor damn detail?

That is not a minor detail and that is not something that should be questioned. It's literally life and death, it's supposedly a simple fact you should know and be able to answer very simple with the words.

"Yes people did die."

You think i'm trying to distract from the main issue? That's absurd, i wanted to clarify what happened because i wasn't sure.

In fact it helps your comment and makes Wilbur Ross's comment more outrageous if you can literally know for a fact people died. But you seem to fucking lazy or intellectually dishonest to bother to do that or clarify and innocent query.

Fucking shameful. I'm embarrassed for you. </TEXT>

No that is not basically all the Chief Justice does.

You should just read the wikipedia page. The Chief justice does more behind the scenes of the court itself as well as other duties. There are some interesting tidbits.

One of the more topical today being the appointment of federal judges to the FISA court and the overseeing of the impeachment trial of POTUS.

I heard that it's because of the destructability that the gas goes through things. Something to do with the game engine you can't have the destructablity and the gas not go everywhere.

But you could also just think that no walls are air sealed perfectly so gas would get through eventually.
