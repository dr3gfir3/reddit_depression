	<TEXT> If we are to judge business by Open and Click Through rate of its newsletters, I guess it's safe to say business is good. As far as having inventory goes... a different story. 

How did I get into Freemason ties? I joined the Freemasons between 2007-2008. I was a callcenter agent by day, and graphics artist / web designer by night with baby number 2 on the way. I wasn't a tie guy but the masons like to meet in suit and tie so I was forced to buy one. I searched online looking for a Masonic tie but everything that was available at the time were tacky and loud looking (keep in mind Freemasonry is supposed to be about subtlety). My wife thought it would be cool if I could just make one for myself- so I made a pattern in Photoshop and had someone overseas made the tie for me. The manufacturer sent me two ties instead of one. I kept one for myself and auctioned the other one on eBay (sold for $70+). Reinvested the funds, rest was history.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My method is synchronicity. I might not be able to help you with the christening but I'll share you how I got mine. "FraternalTies" is my business name and my tagline is "The tie that binds."

Please indulge me.

I'm in the business of designing and selling fashion accessories for the members of the oldest fraternal organization in the world- the Freemasons. My main product is the [necktie](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5xi94y/i_saw_the_location_vs_picture_in_rfunny_and_it/). But I also design [shoes](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/0152/t/2/assets/slideshow_4.jpg?6889911725727113096), [watches](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/0152/products/Wooden_Masonic_Watch_V2_copy_large.jpg?v=1423682345), [Handcarved box](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/0152/files/FraternalTies_Masonic_Wooden_Box_eye_of_providence_2_b_51416fcf-f8f1-4d66-9956-60045953ceeb_1024x1024.jpg?7096394448000122269), etc. 

I first encountered the term "fraternal ties" as a [DeMolay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeMolay_International) (youth organization for young men ages 12-21) back in the Philippines listening to speeches delivered by Freemasons. I have always liked the way it sounds. I love it when heads of countries the term "fraternal ties" to describe their relationship. 

Around 2008 I joined the Freemasons, realized I needed a tie (wasn't a tie person prior), searched online for a Masonic tie and all that's available are loud and tacky, the idea to just make my own tie came up, I thought that my favorite term "fraternal ties" will sound great as a tie brand for a fraternal organization, checked online and found out that fraternalties.com was available, and the rest = history YAY!

As entrepreneurs, I like to think that the products and services that we promote are extensions of ourselves. With that in mind, I'd say that the best name that we can give our business is a name or idea that will describe the essence of what we're trying to do. Only the individual entrepreneur can discover that name for him/herself. #knowthyself

	<TEXT> I'm feeling quite bummed to be honest... I was avoiding this issue because it could trigger an anxiety attack in me but I checked earlier and I found out that so far they have only removed 2 designs- those 2 are the ties I designed for very exclusive sub-groups within Freemasonry. 

For one they are [still selling](https://www.uniqueregalia.co.uk/collections/masonic-ties/products/copy-of-masonic-regalia-freemason-tie-with-square-compass-blue-new-design) my flagship necktie, [the memento mori](http://www.fraternalties.com/collections/classic-collection/products/memento-mori-masonic-tie). We had 5 major deaths in the family and that necktie (tears with the memento mori symbol on back) is a reminder personally to me of how fragile life is. I part of me feels really bitter that they won't stop selling my work despite many appeals from myself and my supporters. But also a part of me is feeling proud for having such loyal customers who would fight for the brand without expecting anything in return.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate your comment Brother. Exact copies. I made the designs from scratch and have the sketches, versions, pretty much the evolution of the designs I have them. Not only that. 2 designs are made exclusively for members only Masonic groups such as the College of Freemasonry in Ontario, Canada and Arabian-Milo Lodge No. 882. Those ties that they have copied as is are not meant to be for sale to anyone outside of their own groups.  </TEXT>

We like to call ourselves the original [6 from the6ix](https://www.instagram.com/fraternalties/). lol. We recently invented on a DYMO LabelWriter 4XL.

	<TEXT> Kumusta kapatid! I'm a 36yr old father of 4. I began smoking cigarettes when I was 14, a meth addict in college, was on Lipitor before I was 30, I used to suffer from severe sleep apnea and was so unhealthy I had to sleep with a CPAP mask to help me breath at night. To top all that, I was also diagnosed with severe social anxiety and PTSD.

I never played sports my entire life but when my kids signed up for muaythai not too long ago, I decided to follow (October 2015 to be precise) and I was hooked. [My story here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MuayThai/comments/5c9alm/for_those_wondering_if_its_too_late_to_begin_muay/). I'm sharing this here as proof that the past abuses that we put our body through shall not hold us back if the mind and body is willing to move forward and leave the past. How to gain lost stamina and endurance? The answer is already in you. Like anything in life, you get what you put in it. So train hard and get it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your post! We've been selling to UK since 2010 but there's not always enough inventory to go around. I actually found out about the infringement from my longtime customer from UK who happened to buy an apron from them. He noticed that one of the ties on sale looks exactly like ours and he notified me. But yeah, on my "contact us" page there's a dropdown menu where people can select "testimonial", "inquiry", or "complaint"- the usual complaint that I get is that our products don't stay long enough on shelf. Sold out usually within hours. Good business problem to have I suppose... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, if you follow that logic, how do you explain designers who use the cross? Or other important ancient symbols for that matter? Do they own those symbols? Did I ever claim owning the S C? I don't appreciate your comment at all. I find it highly offensive. I don't just use the S C and make money of it. I contemplate on it and I spend countless hours making patterns that compliment our Badge. Freemasonry is near and dear to me. I credit it for saving my sanity and my life so I surround myself with it. Don't question me about my motive because ultimately I'm just trying to feed my family. Sincere best wishes? What is your motive for saying what you said? Encourage industry, reward merit- lessons from the Second Degree. Keep that in mind.

	<TEXT> I appreciate your comment. I have a tendency to take like a hundred photos and pick just one. My wife used to hate it but I think now she understands. I have severe social anxiety that prevents me from doing what other business owners consider mundane (like checking email, picking up the phone, talking to potential clients/partners). 

I'm quite a prolific designer though- I do have a variety of products that my target customers really want (but I never get to produce in bulk)- I mentioned some of them on a [previous response here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/5to3t7/im_a_necktie_designer_from_toronto_a_regalia/ddowncm/). 

I'm familiar with fulfillment centers- I received an offer last year from Shopify to be one of the first to try their Shopify/Amazon integration. Prior to this, an Amazon executive have been emailing me (between 2013-2015) asking if I could give them a time over the phone. I never called. 

I know I need help, but knowing myself, getting me to get help could get tricky. LOL </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks Brother... I did consider that many times... 

2 things prevent me from doing it:

(1) Can't pay them. I don't have a regular flow of income so we're living day to day on a very tight budget. 

(2) It makes me very uncomfortable working with other people. I get debilitating physical manifestations of my anxiety when it hits... I don't want people to see me at that state (happens on a daily basis).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That means only one thing- those in charge of the company in question probably know nothing of the Craft. Almost all the necktie collections that I designed since 2009 get sold out within the first few days, if not within a few hours, of offering them for sale. Enterprising individuals know that there's a great demand because they see in my social media channels that customers  keep on asking for more ties. I get a lot of complaints how there's always not enough ties to go around. Unfortunately, increasing production quantities is totally not an option for me at the moment. They're probably trying to fill in the gap or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that the black square and compass tie is a generic pattern. However, the Scottish Rite tie, like the ties in my signature collection, is made from scratch so it is pretty much impossible that you the design from 15 years ago. [Here's a link](http://www.fraternalties.com/products/pre-order-double-headed-eagle-of-lagash-32nd-degree-tie) to the pre-order page for the Scottish Rite tie- the interlinking chains held together by the Square and Compasses as far as I know is an original concept of mine and created from scratch. The simplified and stylized double headed eagle logo itself is created from scratch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Innovate constantly- I totally agree with that! This custom box is one of the ways I innovate. Drawback is I am now about a couple of weeks delay of my shipping deadline. At the risk of sounding boastful though, my company is at the top of the Masonic necktie niche. I made about USD $10K on our latest collection, $8K of that was made within the first few hours of pre-order. I guess that one thing that makes my customer stick is that I share my life story and the designs I make are usually inspired by what I'm going through at the time of design. I don't know anyone else within our community who does it the way I do.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is partly my fault that this is happening to me. At some point in time I've been so pre-occupied about my mental health issues that instead of talking business, I mostly bombarded my customers with postings and blogs about my struggles. I suppose from those articles where I talked about not wanting to confront people in any situations, certain enterprising individuals realized that I will not go after them if they steal my art. I don't go after individuals anymore but, to borrow words from my daughter, I get "triggered" when a business with an actual physical location does it to me.

I just checked. Formatting is messed up that's why you didn't see it.

Anyway, Im an artist based in Toronto and I design neckties for a particular demographic where word travels fast. I found out last night from a customer that an established store in the UK serving the same demographic have stolen two of my designs. When I looked, I found out they have taken not just 2 but 8. I didn't know what to do because I'm a business newb so i jus calley them out on social media. </TEXT>
