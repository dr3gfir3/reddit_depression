	<TEXT> Plus the cost of transporting said food up Everest by people and the experience of the guides, expertise in getting permits and paperwork done, someone to guide you up the mountain etc. Also, difficulty does not scale linearly. The route, the decreased oxygen, the weather all make Everest harder than the climb you likely did... also under certain weather conditions your climb could have been dangerous in jeans and a carhart too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do find it unusually upsetting because I deal with entitled crap like that every day at work where people expect the rules bent for them, or break the rules, and then use the system is against me victim logic when caught. 

It feels like a lot of the shittier things in this world is because entitled pricks like this guy abuse resources and other people and then blame everyone else when caught. If rules are not enforced then why should anybody follow them and saying well most people are decent and follow the rules so why does it matter if some people do not... know incentivizes indecency. 

Also, glad you get to feel superior judging me without knowing anything about me... maybe I am bored and have trouble sleeping, or slow day at work, or maybe can't get around much because of issues, or go on Reddit to get away from my life issues, or maybe don't have friends... we are all on Reddit, I am not trolling, what's it to you why I am here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tragedy of the commons? 

Property ownership has been at the core of most human societies as people stopped being nomads. 

For nomadic society their society is based around cattle or hunting territory. Part of the basic tenants of society governs ownership and sustainable control of limited resources.

Ownership of property and capital allows for the advancement of human society and has allowed for the creation of cities and advanced institutions and is the basis for midern life. Land is a big part of that, and a lasting and important commodity in human society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think there is a revision of history in certain circles that tries to make Hitler into some effective populist leader undone by his generals, Soviet numbers and American arms, who happened to have an unfortunate side hobby of industrially murdering Jews (these revisionists tend to downplay the number he murdered).

They forget that genocide was the doctorine, not the side effect and that Hitlers plan was only sustainable through the conquest or large territories and obliteration of their peoples... the Jews were just the start. He refused to allow retreats because his vision and plan required those territories where he planned to murder 100s of millions and colonize with germans. This was the endgame.

They got some of it funded by seizing assets and murdering parts of their own popoulation and needed to invade their neighbors to continue. For all the effectiveness of public works like the autobahn, much of the rest of the industrial activity resulted in little benefit for the average German and was not generating sustained economic growth.

	<TEXT> Seriously, any gains he achieved were unsustainable, and his management of the civil and military aspects of Germany was amateur at best and many of his successes came as strokes of luck. Some of his subordinates were more effective than others but much of that was also luck as their positions were based as much on ideological grounds as personal ties and loyalty to Hitler.

He was a very accomplished propagandist and orator although he did luck into a natjonal mood amenable to his messaging and an existing moverment/organization in the form of the freikorps to add paramilitary muscle to his propoganda. 

He also lucked into a convenient boogieman, the communists, in getting establishment Germany to back him. The old conservative guard (who would later form the core of the Valkyrie assasination attempt) helped lift him to power in an attempt to counter leftist movements (only to ultimately lose everything because of it). 

Hitler is not so much an example of leadership, as a testament to the dangers of steam rolling reactionary populist sentiment backed by conservative elements trying to regain control, and the almost invetable war of conquest and genocide to feed the resulting ideology and unsustainable government initiatives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, for a significant back fracture opiates are reasonable... I don't know why you didn't get them. The problem is in this thread people are treating all back pain as the same. Back spasms, slipped disks, radiculpathy, just chronic back pain are not well served with long term opiates. 

An acute fracture especially requiring a brace, which is acute reversible bony pain, it's not unreasonable to get opiates... it's actually what they are meant for (outside of cancer/ acute abdominal pathology etc) so I don't diagree with you. Your initial comment wasn't clear. 

As for ibuprofen being ok for fractures? Most orthopedists and neurosurgeons give it to humans all the time with no change in healing. There are no human studies showing it to be a problem. Older doctors quote this based on a mouse study and theory but has not borne out. If you pull out a recent review it will discuss how in vitro and animal models have conflicting results, human studies are inconclusive, and they will hedge their bets saying in patients with high risk for non union (elderly, diabetics, smokers, etc) NSAID use should be limited. In older people we already avoid ibuprofen because of risk for stomach bleeding, heart attack and stoke. Young lawschool student ok for ibuprofen (although with food no alcohol becuase of risk of stomach bleeding).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, it depends on the cause of back pain, people have pain for different reasons... amytriptylline is a anti depressant which works for neuropathic pain.

Medication is applied chemistry to a system we poorly understand and opiates high jack a system not meant to be long term stimulated. Long term opiate use cause long term changes to that system that are problematic. Dependence and tolerance are pharmacological events. 

Wtf is even permanent spinal injury anyways? Are we talking radiculopathy? Or actually soinal cord injury? That's the problem, is that not all pain is the same, opiates are for a specific subset of short term pain. 

It's amazing, somehow other countries get by without the metric tons of opiates the US consumes every day. And people take any discussion personally without any nuance in regard to the 1000s of causes of back pain and indicate treatment. Compression fracture? Fine opiates. Bulging disk for past decade? Probably not... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) tolerance... with any prolonged use you will need an ever increasing dose.

2) dependence... you will get a pharmacological dependence, so you can have withdrawal and a need that can progress to addiction. At some point you just need a baseline amount of opiate to function so you don't withdraw instead treating your pain.

3) You become tolerant to respiratory effects faster than the pain effects so at certain doses you just run the risk of not breathing... and still being in pain.

4) they are sedating and have other adverse effects on normal function.

5) opiate hyleranalgesia... you become less tolerant of pain in general when off opiates (controversial).

6) studies suggest opiates don't help people be more functional and long term doesn't really make a difference in pain scores.

7) long term opiate use has side effects like sleepiness and constipation, it can also cause stomach pain because of the problems with you gut working.


Alternatives:
Complicated, depends on your cause and the type of pain (nerve, bony, muscle pain)... for some diet, weight loss and exercise, for some its anti depressants (for nerve pain old school one like amytriptyline), for some it's surgery, and others it's nsaids and time...

Our armanamentarium for pain isn't great...  but we are starting to find out opiates are a short term crutch which long term makes it worse. 

Other developed countries use a fraction of the opiates we use and they get on about their lives without worse functional outcomes or being in pain all the time.

Not to sound corny, but it's about america changing cultural expectations and focusing on mental health and fitness and lifestyle. Less sitting, less driving, healthier food, access to mental health. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any opiate that hits the mu receptors can cause withdrawal and tramadol withdrawal unlike other opiates has a seizure risk. It also interacts with other medications to lower seizure threshold. Furthermore it is habit forming, dependence forming and addictive too.

If you use it daily or multiple times daily you for a prolonged period of time you are can withdraw.

Also, you can't get high on antidepressants. Also overdosing on antidepressants is unpleasant and still doesn't give you a high... which is why outside of suicide attempts people do not do it.

	<TEXT> Tramadol is a crappy drug with seizure risks and is messy meanhing it hits multiple receptors so cause some other effects. You can have seizures in withdrawal, you can have siezures in therapeutic dosing and in overdose. It interacts with other meds that lower seizure threshold. It is habit and dependent forming, has poor or limited pain control and being an opiate is still not indicated for back pain. You still get tolerance, dependence etc.

Maybe valium or flexeril or robaxin to take the edge off but still not great from long term use. Honestly some things hurt and take time to heal... it's something people have to accept. There is limits to what medicine can do and sometime a long term holistic view is required. 5 months of suffering is nothing compared to lifelong dependence. 

Also good luck studying on opioids. Good luck functioning. And people also develop opiate hyperanalgesia where they tolerate pain worse.

After 5 months of tramadol or worse oxycodone good luck stopping, you will have to wean yourself becuase you would go into withdrawal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nsaids, in particular ibuprofen don't impede healing, that was a claim made onsome bad rat studies but does not bear out in humans.

Back pain sucks but long term opiate use is risky. Just because you went to a decent law school does not mean you aren't at risk for dependence and tolerance.

Opiate use is not appropriate for long term back pain and also would have made your studies difficult. If you became dependent and developed life long opiate habit you would ruin your life.

Yes it hurt, back pain hurts and not much helps, however most studies suggest long term  opiates are not the answer.

Also if you weren't in a brace it was probably a mild fracture like coccyx or transverse process and the opiates are particularly unnecesary.

Sorry you had a crappy time but in the long run it was probably better. </TEXT>

Although the nursing hanging the bag would not be in the emergency services bill.

Anyways, it's a reminder why free market healthcare doesn't work, when you need healtcare, even is hospitals disclosed pricing its not like you have the time or knowledge to hospital shop and compare prices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure but also Americans refuse to wait for anything, accept any risk, accept any lifestyle responsibility, tolerate pain etc...

We spend so much money torturing elders at the end of their life to prolong it for a brief period of time. We do too many CT scans, too many MRIs, to many surgeries, etc. Every cancer has to be fought, every condition intervened on. 

Instead, we need to focus on quality of life, cost effective care, and reasonable limitations on care without people freaking out about "death panels"...

Furthermore, we as a society need to invest in the quality of life of our citizens because these drive healthcare costs. Healthier food availability, walkable communities, less sedentary lives, less stress, less opiates...

With all the baby boomers who don't tolerate any pain, are scared of death, are overweight and unhealthy, entitled and have no savings start to overload our hospitals the game is over...

Also the as much as healthcare is a drain on the economy, the gross disproportionate sector of the economy, unequal compensation, and brain drain of the financial services sector is a problem too... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is rising nationalism and the concern is the Japan, in never really owning the human rights atrocities of the 30s and 40s, sets up the potential for a resurgence of militarism built around WWII symbols and doctrines. 

This is particularly problematic because aside from geopolitical issues in the region, the surrounding countries, allies like SK, and non-allies like China and NK, are all still rather sore about the rape, murder, medical experimentation, biochemical warfare, slavery and prostitution of their population by the Japanese... which the Japanese only really have partially acknowledged. 

The guy who ran Unit 731, the Japanese version of Mengele, unlike Mengele who died in exile a pauper... went on to run one of Japan's largest pharma companies. The guy who ran the rape of Nanking was a royal who escaped prosecution. Abe visited the shrine were some of Japan's A class war criminals are buried. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was an unarmed/ minimally armed supply ship so nominally needed an escort.

However, the "destroyer" Japan sent is actually huge (3x bigger than most destroyer) and is actually a helicopter carrier that can only really do anti-submarine warfare in this scenario (no missile interception). Has no offensive weapons of its own and carries no STOVL jets for air defense/anti surface warfare/missle defense.

OTOH the main threat from NK is submarines. 

But America has more than enough ships in the region to spare for escort duty. 

So mainly a, we are in this together, kind of display... oh and btw a message to NK that Japan now has a more offensive posture than in the past.  </TEXT>

Australia would not fair well, only probably saved by the fact that major urban centers on the Southern side of the continent.

In the pacific, the only force outside US comparable to China are Japan and distant 3rd South Korea. 

India of on its own has some modern ships but given mismanagement of their navy and aging fleet carriers and support ships, unclear how effecive a fighting force they are vs China. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump has little foundational knowledge and little experience actually running a complex organization. 

His business is just a large family wealth fund grounded in real estate. It's run through a rather rudimentary s corp ane operates without accountability or disclosures. 

It's not like Trump ran Apple or GM or even a midsize organization like a hospital or a regional brand. Add in a knowledge deficit on most aspects of government and the fact that no rational person is going to risk their career by working for him and you get a situation where:

1. He doesn't know what he is doing
2. He doesn't know how to organize his staff 
3. He doesn't have enough of a staff
4. Experienced staff won't work for him
5. He lacks the connections to staff the government
6. Those who do work for him have ulterior motives
7. He has no ideology or doctrine so staff can't work independently to advance the administration agenda, identify problems, generate solutions.
8. His ~~parties~~party's ostensible agenda will hurt their own base. The party cannot even advance an agenda through other government branches because they won't be re-elected because their platform is not actually fit to govern.

The republicans seized all levers of power and now realize they don't know what to do with those levers or what the levers even do. Trump is incompetent, his staff is a shell of incompetents and ideologues,  he has no experience with government or running a large organization, his election platform is undeliverable and self-contradictory, his party has no feasible or passable platform for him to fall back on.

The country is currently like a headless chicken. The brain stem works so it can shit and walk around but it's screwed if anything mode complex arises and eventually it will starve to death. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose Trump doesn't care about the global economy or Seoul. Within the first hour of the conflict, Seoul, millions of South Koreans are at risk from a conventional North Korean artillery barrage (35 miles).

That is the dirty secret, Kim does not need nukes, his artillery can hit Seoul. That is millions of lives at stake (10 million population). 

The global economy won't handle to the obliteration of the capital of a major economy (11th by GDP), the headquarters of Hyundai (18th largest company), LG, Samsung (13th largest company). 

Not to mention the destabilization of East Asia as the power balance is upset. God forbid there is a nuclear exchange. China has to decide if their troops enter Korea. Who is going to absorb the refugees? SK troops and US troops cross the DMZ? Run into Chinese troops? 

The whole situation portends to be a cluster on an unprecedented scale.

There are cases of spurned lovers killing women, corrupt police murdering rivals, people killing because they can. 

The problem with extrajudicial killing, aside from the killing part, as is the lack of accountability to any rule of law... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump wants his aides to distil it to 1 choice... and since as you pointed out the government at the senior level is half staffed, and they fired everyone before getting replacements, it is really Kushner or whatever aide is the flavor of the month, given Trump 1 choice. Amateur hour with nukes, geopolitics, taxes and healthcare... buckle up America. That 1 page tax proposal probably taxed the Trump administration's policy capabilities... just wait what happens when faced with real crises....

Also, in the absence of government staffers, the legislation and policy is written by corporations like we saw on the executive orders allowing coal to pollute rivers. Diplomats are irrelevant at this point because Trump has no cohesive foreign policy... foreign diplomats are saying they have started ignoring Trump pronouncements since they change so rapidly and are often rapidly disputed by himself or senior administration.

Example: Nato is irrelevant, next day Pence tells them the are essential. China needs to fix NK. Talks to chinese leader and takes back his earlier statements. Same with NAFTA... No one knows what to expect from a Trump administration that is totally reactionary and clueless. 

The problem is he doesn't have the organization, the people and ideas to actually create policy and maneuver in Washington. Because he is an empty shell and a con man he is going to slip into irrelevance... and Trump is not a man to handle irrelevance very well so the worry is that he will do something insanely stupid (like bomb NK) to get attention again... 

Lets us hope that when the time comes, when faced with a destructive order, the junior level staffers/undersecretaries are ready to say, "no Mr. President, as an American, I cannot follow that order." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His whole brand is about bragging about being successful... its all hot air. He can't show introspection and think about the substance of his policies because, even if he is capable of such a thing, his whole brand collapses.

His entire brand is bluster, never admitting fault, confidence... that he plays on a different level. Since he has nothing beneath that, if he loses that, then he has literally nothing. He doesn't have the connections,  the people, the intellectual framework, or the charisma to run the government... this and the 40% of America that buys it or just despises politicians/elite/complex thoughts/books is all he will ever have.

Early on he had opportunities. If he turned around and said we will put Gorsuch to SCOTUS, but next we will put Garland, or if he just put Garland on then he would have neutered a lot of democratic ammunition against him. 

He could have pushed real bipartisan health care reform, or a bipartisan tax package. He can do it because he needs democratic support and he is not that behooven to the actual republican party.

The problem is he doesn't have the organization, the people and ideas to actually create policy and maneuver in Washington. He had a real opportunity but because he is an empty shell and a con man he is going to slip into irrelevance... or do something insanely stupid (like bomb NK) to get attention again... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, trial by firing squad vs hanging was a convention thing, criminal vs military, so symbol-wise hanging him was important. 

Executions are not to make the perpetrator pay... he can never repay his wrongs, they are a mechanism for society to sanction inappropriate actions.

But let us not reduce his role in one of the largest and most brutal genocides and oppressive regimes as a mere paper pusher. The nazis are one of the few examples in history of an almost comically 2 dimensionally evil enterprise on a continental and even near global scale and he played a central role in propagating these actions.

	<TEXT> He was supreme commander of German forces and wrote decrees authorizing war crimes both at Hitler's behest and on his own initiative. He might have not shot anyone with his own hand but his pen doomed plenty... the courts didn't accept his defense of merely following orders and pushing papers because of how heinous his crimes were... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But aegis has much greater range, 3 aegis ashore systems can cover Europe, while they would need many more THAAD systems and that is with SM2 block II not even SM6 missles. THAAD is a medium range system, that barely covers Korea while a US carrier group transiting the Taiwan Strait can see half* of china....

	<TEXT> Addicts come in different flavors. Some do benzos, some cocaine/ meth, some opioids... saying addicts like opioid suggests that there is a sub class of people who are just addicts... the truth is much more complex. 

People are predisposed to different substances differently and have different risks of becoming dependent or addicted. Some people drink their whole lives but are never alcoholics and some people try alcohol once and then cannot get enough. Same with opioids.

Narcotics are very addictive. Drugs have different addiction rates, opiates in long term use have a rather high rate. And if you add dependence in (which is different than addiction but still and issue) the problems are even worse. 

A lot of those studies suggesting opioids were not very addictive was pushed and funded by pharma. It now seems that those previous studies were wrong and some are based on old data that does not take into account modern synthetic opioids. 

It seems like in addition to the typically predisposed population who biochemically are just more susceptible to opiods there are people who are at risk.

It seems like duration of use matters, greater than 3 days sets up more risk. Other social and psychiatric issues probably play a role. Furthermore, not all opiates are equally addictive. Vicodin is less addictive than oxycodone or percocet. High potency short acting opiates seem to be more addicting. 

Physicians were taught by purdue driven studies that you cannot get addicted to opioids if you are not using them recreationally and that simply proved false. 

Ask any clinician and they run into this all the time....

Also, with the easy street availability of heroin and fentanyl, if someone gets cut off from opioids its very easy to transition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> sorry, I forgot the /s... I agree with you. It is a problem, overworked docs have patients in pain who need to get back to work etc. It is easy to write that prescription, everyone is happy at first, but later you end up with problems as you just described. What is worse is that decades of medical education taught healthcare providers that what happened to you is rare but this turned out be not true. The medical community did fail you...  despite physiologic, biochemical, historical and clinical factors suggesting that pharma's claims about opioids were false the medical community bought into handing out opioids like candy and we now live with the consequences... and you live with the consequences.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump is only fine because he has been incompetent. He has sold out the government, bombed Syria, done nothing of what he promised but has made sure big companies can pollute, appointed an AG who thinks canabis is evil, proposed a healthcare plan that was more costly and worse than obama care, proposed cutting taxes for the wealthy and corporations, plans to gut the EPA, destroyed climate change intiatives, wants to cut funding for science, cut funding for combatting the opiate epidimic, set a new low for nepotism in the govement, spends millions of federal tax dollars on trips for himself and his family, set a new standard for hiding conflicts of interest... I mean what has Trump done to promote transparancy, the common persons interests, roll back the military industrial complex... etc??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We already have satellite systems that do this, and somehow the long-range interceptors can zero in on warheads during the ballistic phase... modern ICBMs can alter course to make tracking based on launch vector more difficult. 

Also, I have trouble believing SK's Sejong the Great-class destroyers, Americas Arleigh Burke destroys and Ticonderoga cruisers, Japan's Kongo, Atago destroyers don't have more powerful systems... not to mention the radar on the Nimitz and Ford Classes... these integrated Aegis ships can target ballistic missiles and satellites with SM6 missiles. 

THAAD seems a small issue compared to the US and Allies Aegis equipped armada constantly off of chinese shores. I wonder if THAAD is an issue because no one knows it capabilities?
