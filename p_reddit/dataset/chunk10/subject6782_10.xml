	<TEXT> Hmm always wondered myself about those date codes and tyre evolution - are there any 'average' type tyres that you found changed significantly over time? Ie. not slicks/track tyres. I've heard on the grapevine that the old Bridgestone RE050s changed a lot since they were an OEM tyre on plenty of cars but I have no sources to back it up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh and don't go by what an owner may claim. Most owners will not know about a car's issues unless they actively work on it themselves, especially with these types of cars. I've looked at so many cars with so called full service histories, and they are sometimes worse than those with no history at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be a Liberty not a Legacy. I would not by any means take out a loan for this car. Can almost guarantee something will break and you will not be able to afford it unless you do the work yourself (in which case yes, it can be very cheap to run and maintain). 

$5,500 is also way too much for a Gen 3 even if it is that clean. You can easily buy a Gen 4 for that much, I almost sold mine for a touch more and it's ridiculously clean compared to the average Gen 4. 

As someone with 2 Libertys and someone also looking to buy another one, I would never buy a Gen 3 for that much unless it was a clean B4 (even then it would not be an easy yes).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just had a similar issue myself. TPG was quick to send their own technician to check the lines and I got the all clear on my end, they blamed Telstra (issue outside the premises). Telstra was a mess to deal with but eventually admitted fault on their end (just this morning, after about a month of complaints). 

Check your home phone connection, assuming you have one. Mine was dropping out every day from around 9AM to 5PM, sometimes taking the DSL connection along with it, or slowing it to a standstill. There was also a lot of noise on the line when it was connected. Do what others have said here to check your own end before going elsewhere.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's like they make it intentionally grindy and inconvenient to make money normally so you're pressured into buying shark cards which in themself are poor value unless they are on sale.

I truly believe they make this game extremely frustrating like this on purpose. It feels like every legitimate money making method on this game is somehow subdued and attached to some time limit instead so that you're forced to grind for hours regardless of how efficient you are. Example: mission (un)replayability, crate or vehicle buy/sell timers. What on earth is the purpose of this other than to simply stop you making money? I'd like to think people could make so much more legitimate money if these artificial and unnecessary timers were history. If people want to be super efficient just let them... but of course that wouldn't sell cards would it.  </TEXT>
