	<TITLE> Word Count Web Sites? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 05:34:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for a web site that publishes word counts. I don't know if anyone else does this, but I like to plan my reading in such a way that it'll be convenient for me to finish without being rushed because I want to get on to my next book.

Specifically, I'd like to know the word count of John Muirs "The Yosemite" as I'd like to read it on the plane out there. Should be 8 hours of airplane/airport time and I'd hope that would be enough to finish before I arrive. If not, I'll have to start before I go. I read at a rather leisurely 200 wpm but I make up for it with 80% comp!

Anyway, any help would be great. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I forgot to follow up!

450F for 15 min got a nice brown crust on the top of the roast. lowered the temp to 325F for an hour. Checked the temp, it was 105F. Left it in for 45 more min, temp was 125F, I pulled it and let it rest under tinfoil for 15 min before cutting into it. It was a good medium color. Tasted great. Pretty tender. I was a little disappointed the herb garlic marinade didn't penetrate into the meat, especially after a full day of marinating, but the crust on this thing tastes fantastic.

I put both carrots and asparagus under the leg and although the carrots turned out perfectly, the asparagus was mostly mush. They didn't burn, probably because i covered them in olive oil, so they tasted decent, but the texture was awful.

8/10 would do again if it goes on sale. That's really the genius here. "organic" fancy brand boneless leg of lamb for $2/lb (maybe it was $3/lb?) so my 4.5 lb lamb dinner cost me like $10 including the veggies.

Thanks to everyone who helped me out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well thanks everyone! I've got the oven preheating. I found a recipe that says to do cook at 450F for 15 min then turn it down to 325 for an hour. That is where I got the 450 from, I just hadn't read further. I'll let you all know how it turns out! Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the response. I don't have a roasting pan, just a 3 inch deep baking dish. Will this do? Can I put the lab just in the dish? Should I put water in it? Should I put the left over marinade in the dish?

Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Boneless Leg of Lamb Question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-19 22:22:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello There!

I bought a 4.5 lbs boneless leg of lamb last week and was really struggling with figuring out how to cook it. At first I was going to just jam rosemary and garlic into it and cook it for a few hours. Then I found a recipe for a marinade and thought, "hey this might work!" So I've got the lamb still wrapped in netting, marinating in herb and garlic marinade for...like 24 hours now? I was going to put it in a baking dish and bake it for an hour at 450F. Thoughts? Will this work? Should I do something more complicated with it? My plan is to do a side of grilled asparagus.

Any and all advice is greatly appreciated.

BTW: My broiler isn't working. I could grill it but that'd mean I've need to clean my small charcoal grill :(

	<TEXT> Hey there! Looking for some advice on what bike to buy! Haven't really biked in 10 years but I figured this would be a good way to get around and stay in shape!

I don't plan on doing a lot of crazy rough terrain biking. Mostly neighborhood streets and maybe some trails. Some of the streets do have large potholes and they haven't been resurfaced in years. I'd also like to join some friends on a 18 mile, mostly city some country, ride in the fall.

After talking with a friend who biked to class everyday for about 2 years, it was suggested I find a road bike rather than a cruiser, mountain or hybrid bike. I have an opportunity to get a new schwinn high plains mountain bike for about 60% off (some assembly required). I looked at decent road bikes and they seem really expensive. I don't want to spend a lot of money because there is a 20% chance it'll get stolen in the next year. I do plan on buying a Ulock but you never know.

So my question is, do I go for the cheap mountain bike? If it turns out I hate it I can return it in 30 days. Will I be uncomfortable on it while riding? Is a road or hybrid bike worth it? 

Thanks for any and all comments, advice, concerns, questions, and wise remarks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a) I looked at zodiacal at some point and it still said diamond because of the time of the month. and b) I don't think bloodstone would be that great of a ring? a black ring? with some flecks of red? probably won't go over well.

That being said, we are nowhere near the point in the relationship where marriage is discussed. Just because it's crossed my mind doesn't mean I should bring it up...right? frankly, every second she puts up with me is good enough for now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in tokyo for the first time and a bunch of us went out for drinks. We went to, of all places, a british pub. After a few drinks I go outside for a cigarette and this large eastern european dude comes up to me and asked to bum a cig. We start talking, he seems like a nice guy, tells me he runs a club down the street and that me and my friends should come over for some free drinks. 

Sweet! I start texting my friends and they start to file out of the pub. Lastly was our guide, who obviously had drank a lot. He had been talking about how his wife was pretty strict and this was his only chance to let loose. Anyway, I introduce them all to my new European friend who now has a few more of his friends behind him. Our guide decides to be a dick, and right there on the street, insults the Europeans mom. 

I try to calm things down for a sec, then spit starts flying, then arms start going. I grab two dudes that I knew well in our group and book it down the street, grab a cab, and head to the hotel. We all think we dodged a bullet. Like possibly a real bullet. I did not want to die on the streets of tokyo.

I call our guide the next morning and try to figure out wtf happened. Why would he just randomly insult a guys mom? Turns out our guide knew what was actually happening. Turns out these "owners of clubs" trick tourists into coming to their places, give them a few drinks, and then essentially hold them hostage until they pay a shit ton for their "free" drinks. I didn't believe him, until I ran into the rest of our group that I dipped out on. They went with the guy to his club, and got fleeced for about $200 each for 1 drink. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on a panel for a call center manager position where one of the most veteran agents was interviewing for the position. I knew this guy was great and knew his shit. I was so excited for him to be going for this job and I thought going in he would be a good fit. After all, he's been there for 15+ years. There must be improvements he could drive. Must have ideas on how to get the most out of younger agents. He was a top performer!

We started asking him the standard manager questions. What would be your management style? "I don't know." What changes would you make? "I don't know." How would you deal with *specific situation we just had to deal with*? "I'd have to be manager to know what i'd do." 

....ok.... So I toss him some softballs. 

Me: You've seen many managers come and go in this position. What have you learned about being a good manager?

Him: We've had some good managers and some bad managers. 
...and proceeds to rattle off all the characteristics of our bad managers over the years

Me(after like 10 minutes): So those are things you wouldn't do. What are some things you would do?

Him: I don't know. I'd have to be manager first but I wouldn't...continues to say bad things about his previous managers, and then begins to weep.

It was like I opened some vault of repressed memories. Through the crying he just kept going with how agents aren't treated fairly and managers abuse their power.

We stopped the interview. I got him some water. I told him this would be an opportunity to "right the wrongs" but he needs to give us something. He didn't get it and thanked us for the opportunity, went back to his desk, and continued to be the best agent we've ever had.

While this is the worst interview I've ever been a part of, I learned the valuable lesson that just because you're good at your job, you may not be good at running the show. </TEXT>

Also, thanks for being smart about this. I spent $100 on an old flat screen TV that I am struggling to take apart, since I wanted a big mirror. But then I see yours where the monitor is small but the mirror is big because you used a large frame. So simple, I'm kinda mad I didn't think of it! So now I have a half ripped apart tv sitting in my hallway :/ </TEXT>
