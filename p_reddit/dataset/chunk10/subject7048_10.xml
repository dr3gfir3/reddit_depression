	<TEXT> Couldn't find "Orientalist Fiction" anywhere. There's only Orientalism itself, and it doesn't explore fictional or futuristic elements (androids, huge inhuman architectures).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right! But worry not. I really like to avoid stereotypes and constraints.
I want to make my audience experience a mind trip.
Thanks for your feedback anyways. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say I'm just curious to know the territory I'm putting myself into.
Writers/screenwriters usually say that every genre has its rules to follow, so knowing the genre you're going to write about is a good start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I assume time paradox is wrong, because the narrative runs from people perspective, and not from the Androids.
It's only to tell about this society the protagonist lives in, so you can leave time and space travel off from this one. 

Guess sci-fi or dystopian fiction are the best definition.
Just in the middle between these two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read about speculative fiction a bit, seems fitting. But it's way too vast to define a genre. If we follow the structure, it would point out to sci-fi, although as i said, it recalls to a world way too evolved for this story. 
Dystopian fiction seems right, to be honest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nosomn, you're completely right! 

To begin with, the androids are what they are, and not upgraded humans (as you can see, for example, in Ghost in the Shell) and they come from a different universe. People in the city don't know about their existence, but the androids do, because they are all experiments of a project with the objective of creating the ideal human race. 

I thought about that twist in the process of plot outline, believe it or not. But then the movie "Pan's Labyrinth" came to my head at the exact moment, and I think it would be way too similar to it. I really wanted to write something as innovative as possible, and the "is it real or not" subject in these kind of stories is getting worn out. I mean, the tragic ending is already there for this one, waiting to be written. 

So, would sci-fi describe it? Usually the term recalls to a world so much more evolved. Feel it doesn't fit anywhere! Damn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not factual, and there's not much elements of fantasy, besides the androids. 

It's like a mature approach to fantasy storytelling, blending antique society with a bit of futuristic stuff. 

Can't see which of the "punk's" subgenres would fit here aswell.

	<TITLE> What genre would this book be classified as? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 20:51:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's a story that unfolds in a persian-teocratic society which lives secluded in a desert, with huge architecture and buildings, but also smaller residences in outskirts where the protagonist lives in. People dress with mesopotamic clothing and soldiers wield scimitars. It is ruled by a very corrupted fraternity of priests with a gloomy secret, and the city is visited by a pair of strange androids that are searching for something. 

The thematic talks about about belief, politics and corruption in an adventure-oriented style, and inevitably the conflict of two societies with different knowledges.   
How could I define this book genre?

	<TEXT> The mix is really clean, the kick and snare hit hard. 
About the song structure, I believe it's fine, but you shouldn't be afraid of adding some new sounds, and I found out that the main lead is particularly annyoing, at least for me. The melody is fine, the sound design that just didn't buy for me. 
But don't worry, the other instruments are pretty cool and interesting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey thanks a lot Baylo. There was actually an instrument there but with the same melody from the drop, so I decided to remove it just in case it gets repetitive. 
Someone also said that the mix was too bright. And I noticed most of my songs have this kind of characteristic. Maybe I'm mixing out way too loud? Or it's just me going crazy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's good, but for me, it's kinda generic much. Wish there were some variations or progression shift. Also, the snare sinks when other instruments come up. 
But in general, the overall mix is decent.

PS. those chords unfortunately reminded me of Martin Garrix's "Animals" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I get that. And it's strange since my AKG pair of headphones already have a boost around mid-high to high end frequencies.
I think I'm trying to mix thinking about the loudness and high frequencies are related to perception. Maybe I should only think about the loudness thing when I get to the mastering part. 

And sorry about that! Will def take a look there to see if I can get any help. 
Thanks for your response. </TEXT>

I'm trying to come up with some different compositions and I need someone to point out what could be improved regarding this mix I've done.
