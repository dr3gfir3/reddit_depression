	<TEXT> First, LM was sued for libel and not for the stuff they published. Second, it may serve your cause but there was no UN resolution admitting genocide in the Yugoslav Wars as such resolution should include all parties committing acts of mass killings and they, believe it or not were from all participants in the wars, not just the Serbs, but also Bosniaks, Croats and Kosovars. As I said there are no innocents in those wars. Now, after obviating your bias, let's get back to the essence WHICH was that the picture shown is NOT what it is presented for, the same way acts of genocide took place not only in Bosnia and not only against Bosnian Muslims. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And Kaliningrad was a Prussian territory before Russians came, so what?

Germans were repatriated from Kaliningrad which changed the demographics and respectively the language spoken there. Nothing like California where the Hispanic/Latino population continued to grow and is a majority in the State of California now. You see the difference? So sending back population which was already there before the whites and offering the 8th largest economy in the world and the largest US state economy to secede and claiming that nothing will be lost is kind of inane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You, specifically, suck at many other things but that's what karmawhores like you do. If you did intentionally posted the NSFW pics knowing that they were **FAKE** I wish your family the same. Cause we take things personally on the Balkans as some lying douchebags from other parts of Europe might have noticed. 

# So here is  about that pic titled "Two kids killed by Serbs" in your photo diatribe:

*Those are not kids, first! Second, that's only a snippet of the pic. Third it's in Vukovar and not Srebrenica. And last but NOT least, those people are SERBS, killed by the Croats and there has been plenty of such cases when the NATO countries scum masquerading as UN troops, blamed the Serbs for their impotence and sheer betrayal of the local population.*

**"As Croatian forces withdrew from Vukovar on 15 and 16 November 1991, they dragged Serbian civilians from the cellars where they were hiding, and massacred them. These Serbs were axed to death in a courtyard, after being dragged from the cellar at 74 Nikola Demonja Street in Borovo-naselje, near Vukovar [Names, courtesy of the 4international blog: Radosav Pavic and Velimir Trajkovic (both wearing red); Zorica Pavlovic, her brother Zoran, mother Nada and Milojka Pavlovic.]"**

The photo appeared in the March 1993 issue of the now defunct British magazine Living Marxism, my convergence with whom I explained here. The article was titled Hidden side of the Yugoslav war: the pictures they dont want you to see, and explained:

The British government has banned an exhibition of photographs showing atrocities committed against Serbs in the civil war in the former Yugoslaviaunder sanctions imposed on Serbia by the United Nations. Croatian and Muslim groups from the former Yugoslavia have been allowed to stage their own exhibitions of atrocity photographs in Britain without hindrance.

Living Marxism takes no side in the Yugoslav conflict. But we have sought to expose the distorted way in which this war has been presented to people in the West. In particular, we have opposed the dishonest campaign to demonise and scapegoat the Serbs

[Original captions by Living Marxism preserved:](http://www.juliagorin.com/wordpress/index.php?s=dorich paged=2) 

You can google that image yourself and stop whoring and spewing BS. [Here is NSFW!!! Srebrenica for you](https://zarfiinfo.wordpress.com/2015/07/09/ekskluzive-masakra-e-srebrenices-ne-fotografi/) but NOT that pic hosted on imgur. 

That's just to remind you that that there are always at least two sides of each story.

	<TEXT> The origin of militia is Latin. Basically it means armed citizen army/forces for self-defense purposes i.e. armed citizens defending their own and that was its original and genuine purpose since 1580s when these formations appeared in the US where most likely the concept was adopted from. The militia is a self-defense against criminals and later one during the War of Independence against the professional British army trying to stifle the popular revolt. So the original idea has just a partial overlap with the modern concept used by the MSM though not that remote to cause confusion. And indeed, as mentioned below, it has to do with the socialist idea that those are armed representatives of the citizenry/ the masses defending it/them from law-breakers and criminals thus to make the difference between the police which defended the rights and the property of the bourgeoisie but not the proletariat. </TEXT>
