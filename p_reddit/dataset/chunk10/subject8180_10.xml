	<TEXT> Sign me the fuck up. I'm from the UK also and I am literally salivating over the promise of the next RaM episode coming out this year as we speak :)))))))) 
I have my fair share of issues too (had them for quite a while) so I imagine we're in the same boat in that regard.
I'm pretty into creative shit, about to go study graphic design, game dev, and film studies at college, and I'd like to think I was an open minded person. 
And I am hopelessly kinky to boot, so there's that. ;) 
Hit me up if I sound like your type of person and we can get to know each other!

	<TEXT> Hey :) 16 (turning 17 soonish), big horror fan myself (especially that weird obscure shit - I'm a huuuge nerd for Junji Ito manga) and I'd like to think I have a really dumb sense of humour, if I have one at all :')))))))))
I dont have Kik sadly, but anything else (Discord, email, snapchat, etc) is fine by me!

Looking forward to getting to know you, if you decide you want to chat :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cant. We've already been through the social services route and she has somehow managed to convince them that everything is okay, and it went right from being the risk of rehabilitation to the closing of the entire case. Nothing I say now would work as they will most likely just think I'm using my mother as an excuse to do badly at my exams. 
I say 'revenge' loosely as I really just want my mother to realise how much she is (and has) hurt me.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trying to get back at my intelligent, emotionally abusive mother. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-29 16:26:39 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I'll keep it short - for as long as I can remember, my mother has consistently emotionally abused me, but done so in a way that makes it incredibly hard to spot. She is very well spoken, has a respectable title, and is looked favorably upon by all of her peers. But behind the scenes, she has an alcohol problem which she refuses to fix, going back and forth between help services only because people tell her to, and then lying about 'getting better' only to continue her drinking. Social services have been involved and the police have had to come over on some occasions, and she has even been threatened to lose me (I am 16) but she always seems to get away with it. 
I am sick of having to deal with an abnormal and nasty human being and I have tried my very, very best to understand her side of the story, but the way she treats me and just how vastly different her behaviour is from other parents has drawn me to the edge of the line. I cant report her, as I said above, as she is very smart and does what she does in a way that makes my complaining look childish. She is incredibly manipulative, making me look like a spoilt, ungrateful child whenever we go out to meet family, being nice to me one week, and then making me feel like shit the next. Sometimes she says she's proud of me but I don't know whether that's just so I can be her trophy or whether she really means it. 
I want a way to get back at her by digging in deep. I have considered messing with her bank account but the legal repercussions have turned me off. I can only seem to inconvenience her by unplugging devices, emptying things, and 'misplacing' items, but aside from these (which are very petty) I cannot think of anything else. 
I have a toolbox with plenty of things that can help in dismantling items, and i have grown relatively nifty in swiping things when she isn't looking, if this helps. 
She says she cares, and then she tells me to slit my wrists. I honestly don't know what to do anymore. My GCSES are 4 days away, and all of this shit going on is just wearing me to the bone. It's been 8 years of this now and my patience is gone. 
Please help me get revenge on her.  </TEXT>
