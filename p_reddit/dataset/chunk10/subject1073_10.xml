	<TEXT> That's like asking how they could push through a "healthcare" bill without reading it after screaming for years that a healthcare bill had been passed without being read first.

The GOP long ago abandoned any real pretense of trying to govern in the best interests of the people.  They're nothing more than a racketeering operation set up to funnel money to the already wealthy by exploiting the fears of the ignorant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a nutshell, Kaine notes that the guy who had to recuse himself from the Russian investigation is the same guy who strongly recommended that the guy leading the investigation in to Russian ties be fired right after that guy issued subpoenas to find out about those ties.

This is getting deep.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was writing in general about the suburban and rural voters who trashed Kilpatrick for his shady behavior (and it was pretty shady), but then voted for, and still support, a mobster conman practicing witness intimidation for the entire world to see.

	<TEXT> France had exports worth over $46 billion to the US in 2016 with a net surplus of nearly $16 billion.  How does it help France for Macron to say "fuck you" to the leader of a major trading partner?

Yeah, Trump is a moron but that doesn't mean world leaders don't have to find a way to work with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The truth is that every nation must deal with the US, which unfortunately means dealing with Trump until we can find a way to get him out of office.

From what I've read, most world leaders are using flattery to stroke his ego and get what they want.  Or blackmail, which is likely in the case of Putin. </TEXT>
