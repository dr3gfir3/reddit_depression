	<TEXT> The debate rages on.  
[Armstrong long insisted he did say "a man" but that it was inaudible. Prior to new evidence supporting his claim, he stated a preference for the "a" to appear in parentheses when the quote is written. In September 2006 evidence based on new analysis of the recordings conducted by Peter Shann Ford, a computer programmer based in Sydney, Australia, whose company Control Bionics helps physically handicapped people to use their own nerve impulses to communicate through computers, indicated that Armstrong had said the missing "a." This information was presented to Armstrong and NASA on 28 September 2006 and reported in the Houston Chronicle (30 September 2006). The debate continues on the matter, as "Armstrong's 'poetic' slip on Moon" at BBC News (3 June 2009) reports that more recent analysis by linguist John Olsson and author Chris Riley with higher quality recordings indicates that he did not say "a".](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Neil_Armstrong) </TEXT>

They believe that the party leaders are acting with their best interests in mind, so when the potus and speaker both say this is a good bill, they will follow and believe it is a good bill. Most voters don't read into the details of legislation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wiki - [Gaslighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighting)  
  
Gaslighting is a form of manipulation that seeks to sow seeds of doubt in a targeted individual or members of a group, hoping to make targets question their own memory, perception, and sanity. Using persistent denial, misdirection, contradiction, and lying, it attempts to destabilize the target and delegitimize the target's belief.  
Instances may range from the denial by an abuser that previous abusive incidents ever occurred up to the staging of bizarre events by the abuser with the intention of disorienting the victim. The term owes its origin to Gas Light, a 1938 play and 1944 film. It has been used in clinical and research literature.

Nixon wasn't impeached because there was a break in (i.e. DNC hack), he was impeached because of the cover up. The cover up could break Trump, but there is so much evidence to support he and his campaign colluded with Russia to get him elected, the House and Senate could still go after him for the primary crime. And they should. </TEXT>
