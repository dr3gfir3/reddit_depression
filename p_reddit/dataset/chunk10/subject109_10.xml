	<TEXT> It's called flex time.  Some people take no time off and you have to basically tell them to.  Some people abuse it but they get bad raises or no bonus.  For most normal people, it works out fine.  I would say on average people take less time then when they had a fixed amount every year.  Keep in mind that 5 weeks is typical for someone in their 40s and younger folks get about two to start. </TEXT>
