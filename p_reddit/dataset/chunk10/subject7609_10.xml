	<TEXT> But their reports were wrong. Hamas never accepted a state based on the 67' borders. What they said is that a state based in 67' borders was a "national consensus". Then many news outlets, not all of course, reported as if they accepted the 67's borders. And that's is simply not true.

The supplementary charter unveiled by Hamas last week says a Palestinian state based on pre-1967 lines with Jerusalem as its capital is a "formula for a national consensus," but "rejects any alternative to the full and complete liberation of Palestine, from the river to the sea."

He is right.

You cannot say that they accept the 67' borders when they don't recognize Israel's right to exist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't mean they are enemies neither. 

Also a report  saying that Israel's counter-intelligence is  threat to the US doesn't mean that they are enemies. The Mossad is one the best intelligence agencies in the world. So yeah, you could easily say that the MI6 is also a threat to the US.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If you listen, he very much does NOT support killing civilians.
 

No, he supports the killing of civilians. The guy is a completly fanatic. 

Finkelstein has stated he believes Hezbollah has the right to target Israeli civilians[90] as long as "Israel persists in targeting [Lebanese] civilians until Israel ceases its terrorist acts."[91]

	<TEXT> This doesn't make sense. I don't think you understand what loans are. 

 Israel's doesn't pay back the US with US money. Israel works for that money and pays it back in the most common currency in the world. This doens't mean the Us is giving free shit to Israel.  The Us also benefits from other things like sharing intel, keeping an eye on the Suez Canal, etc.
