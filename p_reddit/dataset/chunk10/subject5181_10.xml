	<TEXT> It doesn't matter what the artist intended, but it can sometimes help when you're faced with something that's this bad. 

From looking at her other work on her site, it seems like this statue is a departure from what she normally does, and it shows. Not that her other stuff is so fantastic, but there are a some nice bird pieces. Like this one:

Okay, I get it now - Trump is a gaudy (gold), stupid (monkey), boob (breasts).

Not impressed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I'm enjoying a book, I either want to sit and read it for hours, or not read it at all. I have a lot of trouble reading only a few pages of a really interesting book at a time - it's frustrating. 

But when there's a book that I like the subject matter or the story but the writing is kind of dull, then reading a few pages here and there really works. 

This is how it goes for me: Pick it up, read a little, feel like I've had enough, put it down, pick it up again the next time I have a few minutes. Lather, rinse, repeat.  </TEXT>

Though in the olden days it was the reverse. People moved away from the northern Brooklyn neighborhoods and LES because they could afford to. They weren't the gentrified hipster paradise that they are now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends what your goal is. Meditation is good for calming the mind, yoga is good for calming the body. 

In other words, if you feel anxious a lot, have racing or intrusive thoughts, or can't switch off your brain when trying to go to sleep, then meditation is for you. 

But if you feel that your muscles are stiff a lot - if you feel tension in your shoulders, back, jaw, or if you get headaches a lot, yoga may be more helpful.  </TEXT>
