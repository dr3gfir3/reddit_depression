	<TEXT> Rust is a lot of fun. 

I've played it off and on since the very beginning of the beta. 

It's changed so much, both graphically and functionally. 

If you love the building and combat minus the Dino's of ark, you'll love rust. Getting fire arms in rust is much easier too. So it's more of a shooter than ark. 

You'll need a good computer to play rust. Before when the graphics were shit, the game would play on a potato, but now it needs a decent PC to play at decent graphics settings. 

As far as my ark experience, would you suggest a 3x3 base, 2 floors? Will that get me to level 70?

My plan is to level up and then apply to some active tribes once im more useful. 

Also which attributes are safe to pump?

I've been doing 300 hp

200 stamina

250 weight. 

So far.  </TEXT>

Yeah it was one dragon and one bird looking thing, and they pecked the shit out of my base until it was gone. 

I was close to the beach. I'll try hanging out further in land this time around. 

On the 120 man server, I have a full stone base now, and over night no one touched my base. 

So I assume once I hit metal, the chances of being bothered is low. 

I'm hoping the same is true on Dino servers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, Im on one right now after you suggested it.

What's funny is that the couple of these 120 no tame servers, are all the most populated servers on the PS4 version.

I wonder if a lot of people dislike the Dino mechanics? Or is it just a more Rust experience people are after.

Im going to hop back on the regular Dino server after I get a bit more experience in this game. I just hope I can find a server that has people who don't take pleasure in griefing low levels for the sake of griefing them.

What material, do wyverns and the birds have a very tough time breaking through? Metal?

Because they absolutely destroyed my stone base. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've played a lot of Rust, but with the release of Ark on PS4, I wanted to try it out, since I prefer playing games on the couch.

Last 2 nights, I've been having fun, dying a lot (I'm on a PvP official server), but as a Rust player, deaths, especially at the beginning, come part in parcel for the game genre.

The one thing that did annoy me though, is that once I completed my small stone base, out of the sky, a dragon and a wyvern, came down and literally destroyed my base that took an hour or so to build, in a matter of minutes.

The dragon looked like Smog from the Hobbit movies, and the wyvern from WoW alliance flying mount.

Are these really high level beasts you tame? As in are these something only a high level can tame?

I just find it a little ridiculous that a high level can come and absolutely destroy my base, with little or no cost.

So my question is, maybe I'm confused and naive, as I am a new player, but are there any costs for these high levels to mobilize these really powerful beasts?

In Rust for instance, a medium progression base, still requires some time and effort, and maybe even some C4. It's costly and it makes it so you don't waste your time griefing newbies for the sake of griefing them.

But if these high levels can mobilize these massive dragons to come and smash my base in a matter of seconds, then this game may not be for me, as it makes literally no sense.

At least in Rust, while it's a brutal existence in PvP, it has some mechanics that keep high level players from wasting valuable resources in griefing low levels.

This isn't a complaint, but more of an inquiry, as to what I'm getting myself into.

The game is fantastic as far as everything, but the Dino's and their mechanics may not be something I'm into, especially if they are as strong as that massive dragon that ate my base.

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

Is it possible to hack an iPhone and a MBP to access the isights on either? And by hack, I mean through the internet or wifi network, not having physical access to either device.

For the record, I've never seen the camera on either my MBP or iPhone as a threat for personal privacy, since I keep both fully updated 100% of the time.

Can someone enlighten me?

I also always thought newer MBP's and iPhones have their LED's hardwired to the power source when the camera is access, so you will know when the camera is accessed. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "Hello,

As you know, we care a lot about our customers. And we spend a lot of time troubleshooting and improving our customer service. Its at the core of what we do. But some of that lies beyond what we can do ourselves: it depends on rules set by the CRTC.

Well, were writing to ask for your help about issues we know matter to you -- because we believe that sharing your story with the CRTC will make a real difference.

Whats this all about?

As you know, TekSavvy serves most of its customers over leased last-mile facilities. It goes like this. We pay incumbents a rental fee to use their line into your home. We interconnect that line with our Internet and phone networks. And we provide Internet or phone service to you over the combined system.

Most of the time, that works out. On rare occasions, it doesnt. Now -- as in, right now -- the CRTC is asking for the publics views about fixing two problems:

Renting the incumbents last-mile means renting their install and repair services for that last mile, too.  But the CRTC has few rules about how many no-shows or how fast those installs   repairs happen.  Shouldnt it?
When the last mile is fibre in a new building or development, we still cant lease it.  Theres a plan for that to change once a long list of technical questions is worked through.  Eventually.  But what happens in the meantime?
If either of these has ever affected you, frustrated you, or moved you, its time to tell the CRTC about it. Heres how.

By end of this Monday (April 24): installs, repairs et al.

Until 8 p.m. Ottawa time this Monday, April 24, the CRTC wants to know what it should do about what it calls Competitor Quality of Service  rules on things like how many install visits are missed, how many repairs are delayed, how long last-mile service delays can last, and so on.

We know how often issues like these frustrate our customers. Well, this weekend, or Monday, are the time to tell that story to the CRTC.

Theyve boiled down what theyre looking for into a series of questions, and are looking for folks to type answers into an online form.

Were asking you to click to that form Here are some of the main questions and our takes on them (all of which are posted at the bottom of this document, known as Telecom Notice of Consultation CRTC 2017-49):

Q2. Are market forces sufficient to ensure a high level of service or are Q of S regulatory measures required?

Market forces are the status quo -- no rules. If those have meant frustration for you, heres where you tell your story. How many times did you wait? Did you have to take the day off work? Why did it suck? Specify that youre answering question 2.

Q3. If a competitor Q of S regime is required, what should its objectives be?

We dont see why a TekSavvy customer should have to wait any longer than an incumbent customer for an install, for a repair, or for service. If you agree, say so -- identifying that as your answer to Q3.

Q10. What specific services should be subject to the regime?

We think the last-mile lines we lease should be -- it's the link that we flow your Internet and phone services over. We call that Wholesale Network Access, if youre looking for a term. Dont forget to note youre answering Q10.

Its clunky. But it could make a huge difference. Consider stepping up.

By end of next Monday (May 1): fibre me up?

Is fibre the only Internet access option where you live? But you want your ISP to be an independent, like TekSavvy?

If youre moving to a new building or development, we cant lease the last-mile fibre there. Eventually, we will. But its taking an awfully long time. How much longer? To be honest, noone quite knows.

Well, until 8 p.m. Ottawa time next Monday, May 1, the CRTC is asking for comments that either support, or oppose an application by our industry association, the Canadian Network Operators Consortium (CNOC) to expedite wholesale access to fibre where there are no other options, so we can quickly fill service gaps in vigorous competition.

Tell the CRTC that competition matters to you, and that you want them to break down the fibre wall, not eventually, but soonest. The fill-in form to that is here.

Gang, we wouldnt ask if it wasnt important. This time, it really is. The CRTCs asking, so if youre answering, nows the time."

	<TEXT> Back in high school, we had this 5'10 grade 11 kid bullying this grade 8 or 9 kid who was around 5 feet tall.

One of the male teachers caught the 5'10 grade 11 kid punching the younger kid in the face.

The older teacher grabbed the 5'10 grade 11 kid by the back of the head and slammed his head into wall.

He ended up being fired over it. Many people argued that what the grade 11 kid was doing to the younger kid was assault, yet the police were never involved, yet when the teacher gets involved, it ends up being assault (even though he was doing it to protect the younger kid, and also send a deterrence to the older kid to stop).

Ridiculous. </TEXT>

I was wondering what kind of finish this was.

According to one response from my previous post:

[]AngrySquid1979 2 points 31 minutes ago 
I think it's anodized titanium. Also I think there is a way to do it on polished steel with a blow torch.

Another response:

[]CoyoteBanned 2 points 36 minutes ago 
That would either be a high polish blue of some kind of fancy case hardening. Either way someone went above and beyond on surface prep.

Any idea what kind of finish if the two above responses are wrong?

All it is in my opinion is a change in functionality, if THEY the companies can sell a license, why can't WE turn around and use the same infrastructure to do the same thing?

Obviously the service should charge us a nominal fee to cover their administrative costs, but in the end, we own that license key, and therefore should be able to transfer it to whoever we want, as long as it doesn't infringe on privacy or abuse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For instance, if you want to sell a digital version of a game you own or license, why can't you?

You can do it with a physical copy, yet we're restricted to do so with digital copies?

Legally this should be a regulated part of running a business that involves online licenses and IP's.

This should include Microsoft, Sony, Steam, Apple etc

If developers and publishers want to have an online store, they should offer a means to transfer licenses to other users of their service. They can do it for a small fee for whatever administrative costs it incurs.

I really see this as a way of curbing resell of a product, regardless if its online or not. I can resell physical objects, what makes online different?

This should be inclusive of everything in my opinion in regards to online sales, including games, music, whatever.

If you offer an online store, you should have to offer a way of allowing the consumer to resell the product (for a small administrative fee).

Furthermore, for MMO games, you should be able to sell the license of the game itself, but not the account or saved characters.

Obviously there should be a system in place to prevent piracy, possibly a one month timed lock on each license transfer. 

I don't feel that piracy and "game sharing" are a fair  defender against transfer of license. Especially if proper systems are in place to prevent its abuse. 

The doctrine of exhaustion is extended to physical objects, yet digital games are exempt. This makes no sense, as it isn't piracy if each license isn't duplicated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most hilarious thing is when you have western women advocating for Muslims who believe in sharia law. 

All of them have no idea what the fuck they are advocating for, because if they knew what sharia law promoted, they would know it would strip them of all of their freedoms and equalities that our evil western civilization has given them.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> You guys ever wondered what would happen if you handed Pauly Shore $20, and told him to go make a movie? Whiskey Business (2012 TV Movie) (self.movies) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's very Pauly Shore'ish.

He's the son of a Godfather in an Italian mafia.

He's the heir to the family business.

Pauly Shore hijinks ensue, it's almost reminiscent of Pauly Shore in Encino Man.

Pauly has this old weathered beat up look to him, like he's been living a long hard life of partying and doing drugs, with a strange orange tan that doesn't (well a little bit it does) suit him. 

It's like driving by a bad accident, you want to turn away, but you can't. </TEXT>
