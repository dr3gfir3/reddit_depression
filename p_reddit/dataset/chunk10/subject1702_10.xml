	<TEXT> WASHINGTON (AP)  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell fended off criticism Tuesday that a working group of Republican senators hes asked to craft a health care bill lacks women, saying all 52 GOP senators were shaping the legislation.

The all-male makeup of the 13-member group was clearly an irritant among some of the chambers five GOP women. It also became a target for Democrats eager to paint the evolving Republican legislation as a measure thats damaging to women needing medical care, even as key decisions are being made by men.


Thats really up to the leadership, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, the longest-serving female GOP senator in her 21st year in the chamber, said of the groups lack of women. It seems to me theyve already made their decision. The panel has apparently been meeting for some time, and Im not a member of it.

Asked about the group, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said, I just want to make sure we have some women on it.

We know it makes a difference when women are in the room, and we know it makes a difference when women arent in the room on what is brought up, how its seen and how its put together, said Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., the No. 3 Senate Democratic leader.

GOP efforts to repeal former President Barack Obamas health care law have shifted to the Senate, five days after Republicans pushed a version of the legislation through the House.

GOP senators have made clear they will likely make substantial changes in the House bill. Some have criticized that measures cuts in the Medicaid program for poor and disabled people, the federal subsidies that would leave many consumers with higher out-of-pocket costs and the estimated 24 million people whod lose coverage.

The 13 senators McConnell appointed to the informal group include himself and other party leaders and committee chairmen, conservative mavericks, lawmakers from states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act and others.

Facing solid Democratic opposition and controlling the Senate 52-48, Republicans can lose only two GOP senators votes but prevail with Vice President Mike Pence breaking a 50-50 tie. McConnell said all GOP senators are meeting daily and discussing the health care effort.

The working group that counts is all 52 of us, and were having extensive meetings daily, said McConnell, R-Ky. Nobodys being excluded based on gender.

Pressed by reporters, McConnell added, You need to write about whats actually happening, and were having extensive discussions about the real issues. Everybodys at the table.

White House spokesman Sean Spicer distanced the Trump administration from the groups membership.

I think the more voices that we can put on a panel to help get this done, the better. So, to the extent  Im not going to tell Leader McConnell or the White House is not going to tell him how to conduct a panel, Spicer said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the House bill is so discriminatory against women. He cited a provision that could let insurers levy higher premiums on some people with pre-existing medical conditions, which in the past has included pregnancy.

Its a very, very bad thing to exclude women from the working group. Theyre more than half the population.

One of the Senates most moderate Republicans, Collins, 64, has at times been a problem for party leaders, such as opposing a cutoff of federal payments to Planned Parenthood. Shes viewed as one who might vote against the GOP bill.

Collins is the 15th longest-serving current senator and hasnt missed a roll call vote since entering the chamber, a streak her office says reached 6,352 votes Tuesday.

Collins told reporters that GOP women senators are not afraid to make their voices heard and said she was not worried they would have no input. She said shes working with Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., on an alternative health care overhaul and with other senators on how to revamp Medicaid.

She said shed spent 15 minutes at Tuesdays Senate GOP lunch describing a high-risk pool Maine uses to help cover costs for people with serious diseases who are expensive to treat. She said to replicate Maines program nationally would cost $15 billion yearly, which I do not see in the House bill.

Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., said she was unconcerned about the panels roster, saying, Every senator has their say.

The working group met Tuesday and members said they discussed how to handle the Houses plan to phase out the current laws expansion of Medicaid to more low earners.

Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., whos criticized those Medicaid cuts, attended the private meeting, senators said. Her state is among the 31 that has accepted additional money to expand Medicaid. </TEXT>

Even though some might say its popcorn-y entertainment (top-notch, of course), in our conversation he was very focused on the serious issues of greed as it oftentimes comes up in those movies, and the marvels of science and reason and the very fascinating point at which our species finds itself both in real life and in this imaginary world too. Im very interested in that myself, so Im looking forward to this. Ive got a few things to do. Im nothing if not conscientious, so Im enjoying working on it every day.

Off I go in a few weeks to London, where theyve been hard at work, and Ill try to contribute something to the plate of dino-entertainment. I like my character. I think my character is a saucy, sassy man of some integrity and deep thinking. And of course, that whole world continues to be popular, slam-bang, top entertainment. I talked to the director, J.A. Bayona, over the phone. I enjoyed his movie The Impossible with Naomi Watts, and hes something else. I didnt realize he was a good friend of a friend of mine, a director I worked with a while ago in Spain named Fernando Trueba, whos just fantastic. Knowing that the two of them are brethren and brotherly in their friendship makes me feel very good, too. </TEXT>

Future episodes will feature Bernie Sanders and Neil deGrasse Tyson.



Wilmore most recently co-created Issa Raes HBO series *Insecure*. He also helped to launch ABCs *Black-ish* as an EP.  Wilmore famously created, wrote, and executive produced of *The Bernie Mac Show*, which earned him a 2002 Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series and a 2001 Peabody Award. But hes maybe best known for serving as Senior Black Correspondent on John Stewart-hosted *The Daily Show*, and for hosting of Comedy Centrals *The Colbert Report* timeslot replacement, *The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore.*



Even as a kid, casting pods was something I could only dream of, and now its here, Wilmore said in todays announcement. Ringer honcho Bill Simmons, meanwhile, called Wilmore one of the best thinkers and fearless voices we have, which is why it makes perfect sense for Larry to become the 22,354,919th human being with a podcast. </TEXT>

Whilst at some town halls constituents are putting up cardboard cut-outs or hanging empty suits when their Republican member of congress doesn't show up, one town hall in upstate New York where Republican John Faso would not show up, did get a congressman, just not theirs; they got their neighboring district's congressman, Democrat Sean Patrick Maloney. 

 Rep. Maloney is calling on other Democrats to do the same, and at least one other member of congress is trying this, in Arizona, where Rep. Martha McSally has yet hold a town hall in face of much protest, so Ruben Gallego of a neighboring district is holding a town hall in her district to answer questions about healthcare.  </TEXT>

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP)  Being a communist would no longer be a fireable offense for California government employees under a bill passed Monday by the state Assembly.

Lawmakers narrowly approved the bill to repeal part of a law enacted during the Red Scare of the 1940s and 50s when fear that communists were trying to infiltrate and overthrow the U.S. government was rampant. The bill now goes to the Senate.


It would eliminate part of the law that allows public employees to be fired for being a member of the Communist Party.

	<TEXT> From Variety.com:

The presidents of the Writers Guild of America East and West said that FCC Chairman Ajit Pais plans to review a Stephen Colbert joke about Donald Trump was an indication of the administrations **"willful disregard of the First Amendment.**


A week ago, on his CBS show, Colbert quipped during his opening monologue that the only thing [Trumps] mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putins c holster. Colberts mouth was blurred and the term was bleeped out for the broadcast, however.

In an interview with a Philadelphia radio station on Friday, Pai said that **"I have had a chance to see the clip now and so, as we get complaints  and weve gotten a number of them  we are going to take the facts that we find and we are going to apply the law as its been set out by the Supreme Court and other courts and well take the appropriate action.**

The FCC does not monitor broadcast content, but it reviews or investigates all complaints. But it is highly rare for it to take action or issue fines, and that is the case with Colbert, too. The FCC has issued no fines under Pai, who was appointed chairman by President Trump, and last issued a sanction in 2015, against a station in Roanoke, Va.

Broadcasters have a safe harbor for indecent and or profane content between the hours of 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.  and Late Show falls within that time frame. (Broadcasters have no safe harbor for obscene content, but that tends to be applied to pornographic material). Moreover, what Colbert said was bleeped  which would make it all the more difficult for the FCC to make a case.

The FCC does not take action against individual shows or performers. Rather, it issues fines or sanctions against whatever station aired a broadcast.

But Michael Winship, president of WGAE, and Howard Rodman, president of WGAW, said that they were appalled by Pais remarks, apparently because he didnt dismiss the complaints out of hand and view Colberts joke as a form of protected political speech.

Pais remarks are just the latest in a series of statements by the current administration indicating a willful disregard of the First Amendment, they said in a statement. Colbert was poking fun at authority, a time-honored American tradition and an essential principle of democracy. What is obscene is not what Colbert said but any attempt by the government to stifle dissent and creativity. Our unions vehemently support Colbert and his writers and will fight for their or anyones  right to publicly express his or her opinion of our elected officials.

An FCC spokesman had no comment.

What seems to have triggered alarms in this case is that the Colbert joke was already the source of controversy  and Pais comments quickly went viral. In the past, FCC officials would stop short of characterizing their normal review of complaints as investigations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LONDON (AP)  Police in Ireland are refusing to comment on a blasphemy complaint and investigation involving British comedian Stephen Fry.

The inquiry came to light when the Irish Independent newspaper reported Saturday that a member of the public had contacted police about remarks Fry made in 2015 to Irish broadcaster RTE.

**The individual told the newspaper it was his duty to complain under the Defamation Act, which makes blasphemy a crime punishable by a fine of up to 25,000 euros ($27,500.)**

**In the interview, Fry was asked what he would say if he were confronted by God.**

**He replied: How dare you create a world in which there is such misery that is not our fault? Its not right.**

Police say they wont comment on an ongoing investigation.

Frys agent, Christian Hodell, also declined to comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **From CNNmoney.com:**

Bill O'Reilly says his former protege at Fox News, Jesse Watters, will continue to make a series of public appearances with him this year. Fox News has other ideas.

O'Reilly has been actively promoting upcoming dates for "The Spin Stops Here Tour," a variation of the political comedy shows he has performed with Dennis Miller, the "Saturday Night Live" alum, since 2011.

Watters joined the tour this year. In March, he appeared with O'Reilly and Miller at a show held in Omaha.



For days on "No Spin News," the podcast that has become his primary outlet since he was ousted at Fox News, O'Reilly told listeners that Watters will appear at upcoming shows, which include stops in Baltimore, Tampa and Las Vegas.
"We're going to do the tour," O'Reilly said last week. "The tour stays. Miller and Watters and me."

**But a source close to the situation said that Fox News is working out contractual issues to get Watters off the tour.**

Both Fox News and Robert Barnett, Watters' agent, declined to comment. Representatives for O'Reilly and the tour did not respond to multiple inquiries.
O'Reilly continued for most of this week to promote Watters' planned appearances on the tour. But on Thursday, while encouraging listeners to purchase tickets to the shows, O'Reilly left Watters' name out.

"Miller and I will make it worth your while," O'Reilly said.
The prospect of Fox News' on-air talent appearing alongside O'Reilly is clearly something the network's brass would like to avoid.

After reigning as the king of cable news for 16 years, O'Reilly was forced out of Fox News last month after the New York Times revealed that five different women had been paid settlements totaling $13 million after accusing him of sexual harassment or verbal abuse.
For Fox, it was another public relations nightmare and another meteoric fall for one of its icons, coming nine months after the network's powerful former chairman Roger Ailes left his post amid a number of sexual harassment allegations. Both O'Reilly and Ailes have denied the allegations against them.

The tour, if it continued as planned, would serve as a reunion for O'Reilly and Watters, who appeared on Fox News together for years.
Watters was a longtime regular on "The O'Reilly Factor," on which he hosted a recurring segment that was best known for ambush interviews.
But this year, Watters stepped out of O'Reilly's shadow with the launch of his own weekend program in January. Two months later, Watters landed an interview with President Donald Trump. On top of that, Watters is also a co-host of "The Five," Fox's roundtable program that moved to a primetime slot following O'Reilly's exit from the network last month.
Watters himself attracted criticism late last month after he made a remark about Ivanka Trump that many people perceived as vulgar, although he denied that he was implying anything suggestive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People did not know what Obamacare is, nor did Democrats move the debate away from "keep or repeal" or express and fix the flaws of Obamacare appropriately, or rather, explain how the Republicans created those flaws in the ACA and/or held up the fixing of those flaws.

But, now, public opinion and awareness is changing and Rep. Maloney is making a direct appeal to Dems to show up and explain what the ACA *is* and how Trump is changing it for the worse.

**Rep. Adam Schiff on ACA to constituent and why GOP repealing:**

"And I like the fact that tens of millions of people that can't get access to healthcare are going to get it."


"And he said something after that Rachel, that i have to say SHOCKED me, and I thought I'd heard everything, he said: *You really think that's such a good thing?* And I said: *Well yes, don't you?* And he said: *No, I don't. If they can't afford it, they shouldn't have it.*"


"And I knew the second he had said it, he was speaking for a great many of my colleagues in Congress, who at root believe that if you can't afford coverage, if you're, you know, you have pediatric cancer and your parents can't afford it or you are elderly and have diabetes and you can't afford it, [GOP says] that is your problem."


"And, at the heart of this is a conclusion that among a majority of my colleagues sadly today, they would rather give a big tax cut for people that are already doing well, then try to help people get access to healthcare.  And that made it a sad day, all the sadder to see people celebrating it." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From parents.com..:

When you talk about preexisting conditions, you probably think of things like diabetes, heart disease and cancer. But the reality is that healthcare companies consider a whole slew of common health concerns preexisting conditions. Odds are, if youre a mom, you probably already have one of them. And now that the American Healthcare Act passed the House of Representatives todayif it becomes law, your health insurer could charge you thousands more for your coverage or reduce your insurance coverage because of these "preexisting conditions.

"Things that are incredibly common for women, including C-sections, pregnancy and postpartum care, will all be considered preexisting conditions," says Kristyn Brandi, OB/GYN at Boston Medical Center, and current fellow at Physicians for Reproductive Health. "A lot of women would end up paying out of pocket for healthcare, which would definitely be a big problem for most women across the country. Women are particularly at risk because they use more healthcare than other people do. They dont think of pregnancy as a preexisting condition, so people dont realize how much they will be impacted.

"That's one of the main concerns with the revised American Healthcare Act, which has came back to the House for a vote this afternoon after failing to attract enough votes when first unveiled back in March. What's new with this one? Rep. Tom McArthur (R-NJ) added a new amendment that allows states to apply for waivers from enacting any portion of the lawincluding requiring insurers to provide any of the "essential health benefits," like emergency care benefits and preexisting condition coverage... </TEXT>

"By which I mean he was impulsively tweeting venomous, half-baked thoughts  in this case his reaction to late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel's monologue Monday about his newborn son's dramatic battle for life at Children's Hospital Los Angeles."

"*Sorry Jimmy Kimmel*," wrote the feisty Republican who represented the northwest suburban 8th U.S. Congressional District from 2011 to 2013. "*Your sad story doesn't obligate me or anybody else to pay for somebody else's health care*."

"Jimmy Kimmel tearfully spoke about how his newborn son had to undergo open heart surgery:"


"*If your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make*," he said. "*I think that's something that, whether you're a Republican, or a Democrat or something else, we all agree on that, right*?

"Well, no. Wrong."

"**I understand Kimmel's desire not to sully his powerful tale with partisanship, but the central difference of opinion in this major battle over insurance coverage is partisan. Democrats generally believe that access to consistent, affordable, quality health care is a right. Republicans generally believe that it is a privilege properly enjoyed by those with the means to afford it, like access to quality restaurants.**"

***But the MSNBC host said she's "worried that he will figure it out."***


President Donald Trumps incompetence isnt such a bad thing, according to Rachel Maddow.


On Tuesdays Late Night with Seth Meyers, the MSNBC host said she was actually comforted by the fact that [Trump] cant do anything that he wants to do  despite the GOP also controlling both houses of Congress. But Maddow did says shes worried that he will figure it out.


I mean, its weird, its like the overall question is: Are you comforted by his incompetence? she asked. Would you rather have a competent person trying to do bad things or would you rather have an incompetent person trying to do bad things?


Maddow also said leading Democrats needed to re-discover their inner water skier and allow themselves to be towed along by the boat that is the American people.

Counting on the Democratic Party and its elected officials to sort of lead an election campaign against Trump, or to lead on policy stuff, or to lead people toward making Democratic choices hasnt been working, she said.

Those officials would be unstoppable if they took their cues from grassroots activists who have come to the fore in protests during the Trump administration, Maddow said.

Interestingly, former business secretary Sir Vince Cable said on BBC Radio 4's World at One that Ofcom told him they were in listening mode. And there is certainly a lot of noise emanating from Fox News HQ in Manhattan right now."

"There is a palpable fear in New York that the sexual harassment scandal which has toppled Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly could be an American version of the phone hacking scandal that dogged Rupert Murdoch's British newspapers. The echoes are eerie"

"In conversations with seasoned observers of Planet Murdoch, individuals at 21st Century Fox, and opponents of that company's bid for the 61% of Sky it doesn't already own, that narrative finds plenty of support."

"That both Ailes and O'Reilly have gone does give credence to the idea that Fox News is being reconfigured by its parent company, 21st Century Fox, where Executive Chairman Lachlan, and CEO James - who are of equal status - want change. Since they acquired this joint status in June 2015, these two have made a concerted effort to modernise their father's firm...."

Former UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage, who works for Fox News, told me a fortnight ago that Tucker Carlson, the anchor who has replaced O'Reilly in the key 8pm slot, has long been thought of as his likely successor. In his first few days, Carlson has rated well."


"But the bigger drama is yet to come: the federal probes into whether payments were withheld from investors could intensify just as Ofcom consider whether to approve the Murdochs' bid for Sky. The last bid was of course derailed by the phone hacking scandal; and while Ofcom won't comment on what is a quasi-judicial process, their deliberations aren't taking place in a vacuum."

*The lawsuit, filed on the basis of gender and disability discrimination, comes as the embattled network faces mounting claims of sexual harassment and racial discrimination*

Fox News reporter Diana Falzone filed a lawsuit Monday against the network claiming she was sidelined from appearing on-air after writing an article detailing a medical condition which led to her infertility.

Falzone, host of Fox411 and other FoxNews.com shows, alleges that three days after her company-approved article titled "Women Should Never Suffer in Silence" ran in January, she was informed by her manager that she would never again be permitted to host her own show, conduct her own interviews, or even do voiceovers.

In the article, Falzone shared that she suffered from endometriosis  a condition where the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus actually grows outside of the uterus. This can cause severe pain and inflammation.

Shortly after the article was published, Falzone's supervisor told her the "second floor"  which houses the offices of Fox News executives  permanently banned her from appearing on air.

"The male-dominated senior management of Fox News obviously objected to the
fact that a female on-air host had disclosed that she suffers from a women's reproductive health condition, which, in their eyes, detracted from her sex appeal and made her less desirable," the lawsuit states.

Falzone also says she asked for an explanation, but her supervisor allegedly told her to look for another job.

	<TEXT> **Key Man Clause**

The departure of Bill Shine could become that opportunity. Mediaite has learned that Hannity has what is called a key man clause in his contract. That means that his entire contract can be torn up if a particular person, the key man, leaves the company. In this case that person is Roger Ailes, who obviously left Fox last year. Mediaite has also learned that while Hannitys current contract is up in December of 2020, he must only provide 60 days notice if he intends to execute on that key man provision. At that point, he would be free to pursue other opportunities. </TEXT>

"However, with Shines departure on Monday, one source told The Daily Beast, theres no reason for Hannity to stay."


"The network now belongs to the Murdoch sons, another Fox insider said after learning that Shine was gone."


"One insider speculates that the negotiations could end this week and Hannity might be out by Friday. Another said his final show could even be tonight or Tuesday evening, given Shines Monday resignation."
