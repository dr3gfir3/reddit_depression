	<TEXT> I think the title here is misleading. It made me think Hatch said he wants to ban native Americans from public land when he said he thinks federal control will hamper their activities. 

It's racist and ignorant anyway. Just pointing out the potential confusion.  </TEXT>

Little random lies that I try so hard not to say but end up saying anyway wreck my relationships with so many loved ones. 

Someone else mentioned it in this thread but compulsive lying can be a real problem for otherwise good people. Especially those who struggle with mental illness.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you.

I'm not sure why there aren't more theories, at least on the play. The references to mythology and other works, as well as the possible explanation for character motives, are pretty rife. Hell, I haven't even touched on the origins and nature of Bert, which could be another post entirely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I'm glad you enjoyed it. 

I do like that theory. I hadn't considered it at all. I think it's one of the highlights of the play that the mystical elements intentionally draw on several aspects of world mythology simultaneously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true, and I considered that. But as you noted, I don't think that's particularly important because the Greek gods don't particularly treat each other like siblings even though they all are. But you know. Different cultures.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mary Poppins is Hestia, Goddess of family </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-24 20:48:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My brother is in a production of Mary Poppins right now and we were debating the nature of Mary as a character. The three theories that came are, first, that the children are just imagining Mary Poppins as magical, the second is that Mary is a fairy, in the Irish folklore sense, and the third is that Mary is Hestia, Greek Goddess of the hearth and family. 

[Note: This theory is centered around the play, not the movie, although they are very similar so I think it applies to both.]

Mary clearly demonstrates magical powers in the play. She can fly and possesses the ability to control others (such as when she forces Ms. Andrews to drink the brimstone and treacle. This is also noted when the children tell her she must have put the idea to let them visit the bank into their father's head and she laughs.) She also brings the toys and statues to life, and consistently forces the children to and from sleep by snapping. 

These powers could be attributed to the imagination of the children but I would argue otherwise, considering she actually forces Ms. Andrews to both drink her tonic and leave.

When the statue of Neleus comes to life it tells the children Mary is an old friend of his father's. We later learn that his father is Poseidon, God of the sea. This would go a long way to explaining Mary's powers. I would like to think this comment means that Mary is part of the Greek pantheon, given that she knows Poseidon. But that leaves the question of which character she is. 

We know that Mary goes from broken family to broken family and mends them. This would hint at Hestia, Goddess of family. Furthermore, the symbol for Hestia is the hearth, or fireplace. The fireplace in the Banks household is not a plot point, but is mentioned multiple times and is a centerpiece of the set, at least in the original Broadway and London runs of the play. 

Furthermore, and more obviously, the image of chimneys is pretty consistent throughout the play. Bert himself is a chimney-sweep and the children, and especially Mary, spend quite a bit of time around the chimneys on the rooftops. If we're willing to accept chimneys as a substitute, imagery wise, for the fireplaces themselves, that brings even more relevance to the hearth and a further link to Hestia.  </TEXT>
