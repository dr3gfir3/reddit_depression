	<TEXT> I hope this isn't against the rules. I made a video trying to come up with the "perfect" Black Sabbath album from some of my favourite tracks. I thought it was a fun idea, I'd love to see some other people's tracklists, or any feedback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have only filmed 3 weddings (I mainly do corporate videos), but for one of them what I did was set up a little booth for people to record video messages. Some of these were hilarious. Later in the day when people have had a couple of drinks people loosened up and gave some really funny messages. It helped when they give messages in groups and have a bit of an audience to egg them on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have found that a lot of the ones I take short cuts with and don't bother making stories for I end up having to relearn and don't stick with me very well. I did a test once where I tried to learn 20 new words using mnemonics and 20 without. I remembered way way more of the mnemonic ones. In that sense spending a minute to make a word stick is much more time efficient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend (in the vid) showed me this method a while ago and I don't know how people learn vocab without it. It's made a big difference to my learning, and he has just published this vid about it, with part 2 coming, so I thought I'd share it.

The actual method is in the last third of the vid if you wanna skip right to it, but the whole vid is interesting I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Inglourious is a tighter and more disciplined movie, I really like the structure, but I think I like Django more in terms of sheer enjoyment, although I think parts of the third act drag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree about not being an elitist, but I don't see why having a wide taste would be linked to maturity. Some people are just into particular types of music. For example, if Jazz music is your thing and you don't have that same passion for other genres, I would struggle to call that immature taste. You just have a genre that speaks to you more than others do.

On the flip side, I would suggest that understanding that all taste is inherently subjective, and not objective, is a more mature approach.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually like every album Metallica has put out. I think that in terms of style, Hardwired and Death Magnetic SOUND more like Metallica's best work (their first 4 albums), but are ultimately less interesting than St Anger and Load, for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I vaguely remember this story I read, can't remember the context, but the gist of it was: 

"Aren't you a bit old to be studying medicine, you're gonna be 60 next year!" 

"I'm going to be 60 next year whether I study medicine or not."

I've always found it quite inspirational. </TEXT>
