	<TEXT> Actually I don't think the US was able to prove the Chelsea Manning publications cost lives during her trial. They had a long time to investigate too. 

Brigadier general Robert Carr, a senior counter-intelligence officer who headed the information review task force that investigated the impact of the Wikileaks disclosures, said they had discovered no specific examples of anyone who lost his or her life in reprisals following publication of documents on the internet.

	<TEXT> FOIA actually. A lot of FOIA requests become lawsuits because of the infamous foot-dragging that occurs in the process. E.g., one funny and typical story - ["Justice department 'uses aged computer system to frustrate Foia requests'"](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/jul/16/justice-department-freedom-of-information-computer-system)

There are a lot of examples of FOIA lawsuits emerging from these tactics. In fact, a certain public official was suspected of dodging FOIA requests when they put government correspondence on a private server, and later deleted portions of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Freedom of Information Act actually gives that right with certain exceptions. FOIA requests are in-general resisted through a wide variety of means. E.g., using extremely old hardware   software to process them, some people suspected that a US Secretary of State of storing correspondence in a private location (and later destroying them) as a way to avoid being subject to FOIA requests.

If you look online, a lot of FOIA requests result in lawsuits because of various stalling and avoidance tactics. You can find more examples here if you want: https://www.techdirt.com/blog/?tag=foia </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that scummy marketing was the biggest reason people were bitter about that game. I was completely out of the loop (I try my best to avoid marketing and pre-release talk) until after it came out, and I think I enjoyed it more partly because of that. However I had a friend who's impression was pretty much the same as yours, so I understand what you mean.

I wish more entertainment realistically explored the topic of societal dependence on technology, because the current real world has a lot of thrilling examples as-it-is. Would only need a little imagination to write quality plots with those tools. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't have to be a conspiracy. Other journalism issues can be cause for a trust fallout. Like, in the NYT case:

[+] a Harvard study showed they were among the sites that used euphemisms to describe American torture programs during Bush

[+] Heavily pushed for the Iraq invasion based on documents a Bush government official leaked about WMDs in Iraq

[+] Was the last news outlet to admit the US bombed a DWB hospital, despite other outlets including the AP having long-said so; and followed it up with an article saying the US was *accused* of bombing a DWB hospital   later a long article explaining why it was understandable that they did.

[+] Refused to publish Mark Klein wiretapping story until after Bush's reelection

[+] Suggested Snowden gave documents to China, based off their official government sources.

[+] Published controversial articles from Snowden's documents, and then accused Snowden of leaking documents that were not in the public interest (even tho he relied on journalists to make that call about what to publish)

I don't mind giving sources later, if you want. At work atm. But people may not like NYT for reasons beyond just Alex Jones and reptilian conspiracies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't recall, Brown is an award winning journalist, who certainly went deep with Anonymous and other online groups. Eventually that resulted in him being arrested and harassed by prosecutors for sharing a link. When the infamous Stratfor hacks were released, he shared a link to the files to get people to sift through them. Because some of the files included swiped credit card numbers, he was charged with "trafficking" in stolen credit cards. Oddly, right before trial -- realizing how insane it was to charge him over this -- the feds dropped the charges around linking, but pushed forward on other charges because he hid a laptop in a cabinet and (stupidly...) got angry at the FBI when they came to investigate. The odd part is that following a plea deal, the judge sentenced him to an astounding 63 months in jail -- and cited the sharing of the link (again, those charges were dropped, but it sometimes appeared the judge didn't realize that) to explain why.

	<TEXT> Depending on which journalists you're talking about, they push a variety of different agendas. However, I suspect if you gave the government the power to silence publishers based on what they publish - they aren't going to resist going after journalists who do actual reporting and speak truth to power (and make other journalists more hesitant to follow their example). I doubt they'll going to go after sellout journalists that serve corporate or government agendas, like say, journalists that pushed for invading Iraq because of the leaked fledgling 'evidence' of WMDs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doesn't this open the door to SLAP cases where people can use legal intimidation to silence legitimate criticism? Legislation for the purpose of regulating free speech and the truth can backfire massively on all of us. E.g., there was some investigative journalism done about a US Presidential candidate in 2008, but the articles were self-censored after libel threats were made. https://wikileaks.org/wiki/Eight_stories_on_Obama_linked_billionaire_Nadhmi_Auchi_censored_from_the_Guardian,_Observer,_Telegraph_and_New_Statesman </TEXT>

I don't have time to talk about Russia's complaints (at work) but I don't think all the blame for the situation is on any one country, and I think there are places for wiggle room if leaders were willing to consider it. There are a lot of things the US does that would totally freak out Americans (and be shouted loudly in media) if Russia did. I mean, for one on military spending and military bases around the world - US hugely outnumbers any other country. Again, I don't have time to cite sources and post a meatier comment - but just wanted to say there is more to this issue than just Russia being bad. </TEXT>

Like look how hard it is to pass legislation in the US to make it legal for security researchers to break DRM, thanks to the CFAA   DMCA. In that instance alone, there are companies that benefit from preventing researchers from uncovering issues with their software. DRM gives tremendous control the maker in many more ways than that (like forcing mechanics to repair your vehicle with only their parts) and in a world rife with corporate lobbying - this small step from Portugal is praiseworthy. </TEXT>

I am sure the lesson taken here by DiGiovanni and his ilk is to learn a small modicum of self-control and immediately and fatally shoot the person they decide to molest instead of enjoying a little of the old ultraviolence. They won't talk back after that. Not in court or anywhere else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think the article was denying the security advantages. In fact, it talked about that when it described the "network effects" of this - which is the same point you are making.

It more talked about the danger of mandatory centralization of your online identity. Brazil passed a law requiring web services like blogs and forums to require additional identifying information about users, which likely wasn't intended to improve website security.

Also, since this was somewhat a speculative topic - it's possible Spotify's policy didn't work out for it because the alternative is always piracy. Convenience is the biggest killer of piracy, and perhaps making logging in more annoying wasn't helping the site. Or maybe they were too early. I remember years ago, when websites started requiring social media logins - I just stopped going there. Perhaps people will be more comfortable with it over time? </TEXT>
