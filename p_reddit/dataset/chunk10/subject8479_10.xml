	<TEXT> To be fair, guessing calories in food seems to be very hard in general. I've read that according to studies even nutritionists only achieve an average accuracy of around 80%.

	<TEXT> But how is "Not good" more helpful than my (exagerrated) example. It's not as harsh I agree, but it's still unusable as a critic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's still not my point though. I don't care if you can't help but tell someone their work is utter shit and you got eye cancer from watching it. But if you don't provide them with any usable advice when you had the necessary knowledge to do so, your "critic" is just hate/spam and I will professionaly distance myself from your opinion. Fuck me right?

	<TEXT> My comment wasn't about your opinion being unvalid. I was referring to your total lack of respect for someones hard work. You have every right to be a douche on the internet, I just wanted to point out to you, that you're not helping anyone with your "critic". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While a decent fanbase really can help you with getting signed, most labels will not care about your following if you present them an awesome tune. I would recommend you creating a professional looking Facebook/Twitter/Soundcloud etc. though. An A R will want to check out those pages if they are interested in you. Proving that you're able to market yourself and your music is quite important to some labels from what I've experienced. Also if your music is good, social media is the only way to get audience in the first place and can serve as an indicator if your sound/style appeals your listeners. Still, at the end of the day it's all about making great music.

Edit: added a sentence </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to call a customer at work to tell him we fucked up his order once. I overthought that conversation so much I couldn't say a word when he answered the phone. It was the most embarassing moment I've experienced. Now I'm writing down everything I plan to say on the phone including multiple possible alternatives. </TEXT>
