	<TEXT> I took the exam twice,  first exam I failed by like 5 questions... And it was similar to the one I took today,  although I will strongly recommend to take the official ptce practice test,  and continue studying out of the Mosby book. And I'm certain you'll do great!!  Gl pal </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I passed ! The math was the easiest part (and that's coming from someone who's math isn't their forte). I had about 3 generic to brand questions. So don't spend too much time studying your drugs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is post is written for the fellow pharmacy techs who are not yet certified and are looking for words of encouragement/advice. Personally passing the PTCE was a challenge for me. The first time I took the exam I was overwhelmed with exam anxiety fearing that I would fail the exam. I let the anxiety of the exam get in they way and I failed the exam by a couple of points. I felt lost and confused and felt severely depressed about my result. At one point I even thought of calling it quits and pursue something else in life. But being a pharmacy tech made me generally happy(except when angry customers are screaming at me lol) . So this time I decided to study more efficiently, I took the subreddit's advice and bought the Mosby book aswell as taking the official practice test online and passed the exam! Despite me wanting to give up  multiple times I stuck to it and passed the exam.
Tl;dr: this sub reddit does an amazing job at providing resources to pass the exam and don't quit! cus I'm pretty sure momma didn't raise a quitter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just took the exam like 5 minutes ago!  And from the exam I took there where around 5 apothecary exam questions. I think if you take the practice test it will help you see how the actual exam is going to be like.  </TEXT>
