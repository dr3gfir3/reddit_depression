	<TEXT> "Like I could give a shit" sounds right to me and I'm Irish.

I interpret that as "pfft. As if something like that would warrent me being able to give a damn". 

"Could care less" is simply just wrong though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I can say is avoid the Fitzwillians Institute. I did a digital marketing diploma with them and it was next to useless. I've learned more from self study and just delving into it doing small projects for local businesses. I went down the internship route for a while then. I guess it all paid off because I landed interviews with a lot of the major tech companies. Facebook, Apple, Amazon etc. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Japanese hiring style </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-16 20:05:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm wondering anybody have any information regarding the Japanese style of hiring? 

To give some details, I did the whole teaching thing for 2 years in Japan and returned to my country for postgraduate school. I am now trying to return to Tokyo and start working in a non English teaching position. In the past few weeks I've applied to about 20 positions and not a single one of them has even confirmed receipt of my application. Is this normal Japanese HR behaviour? 

Some of the jobs I found were posted on LinkedIn. Im using LinkedIn Premium on a free trial and can see that for these jobs, there are only a handful of applicants. So it's not like the recruitment staff are overwhelmed with applications!

Any info would be appreciated. </TEXT>

I'd recommend a move if you ever get the opportunity. </TEXT>
