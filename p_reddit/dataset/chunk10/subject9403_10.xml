	<TITLE> Should I read WoK? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-09 04:29:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I read Elantris and Misborn and really enjoyed them. But I never read past book one of the MB trilogy, because book 2 just didnt capture me like the first had. It felt a little too YA for my tastes.  
  
Knowing that, would I like WoK? I enjoy huge fantasy epics like Malazan, but didn't know how WoK compares. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love HPL. I think you're right in that the best horror is what lurks in the readers own imagination so sometimes saying less does more.  
  
A good example of him avoiding this trope is the ending of Dunwitch Horror, where what he does describe is spine chilling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some books make you wonder if you should give up, and some reward those who stick with it.  
  
For me that book was Gardens of the Moon, the first Malazan novel. It was tough going at first but really ramped up in act 2. Now maybe one day I'll finish the series! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it was preoccupation with a busy life, and then simply lesser forms of entertainment. I found myself wasting free time on mobile games which didn't offer a tenth of the depth and richness of novels. But games are easier somehow, than reading which takes mental engagement.  
  
Anyhow, it was Something Wicked by Bradbury that rekindled my love for reading. Ebooks help too as I listen while I drive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> u/Schneedly you guys should read Something a wicked this way comes. I read it this summer and was blown away. I expected nothing more than a pulp horror fiction. I got a superbly well written coming of age story about the poignancy of growing up and the struggle of what you love along the way. Passages about friendship and fatherhood will habeas you tearing up. The creepy carnival has some awesome intense moments too. </TEXT>
