	<TEXT> I haven't checked the paleogeography, but I suspect this is *not* evidence in support of an antipodal impact/volcanic hypothesis. The KT impact is in fact not antipodal to the Deccan traps: http://i.imgur.com/h8e1pJQ.jpg
___
 The Princeton model shows (at left) that the structure of the Earth's surface at the time of the meteorite impact that caused the Chicxulub crater in Mexico would have placed the Deccan Traps in India far west of the crater's antipodal point, instead of directly opposite of the impact. Correspondingly, the model shows (at right) that the meteorite struck far east of the antipodal point for the Deccan Traps, which are remnants of large volcanoes thought to have contributed to the mass extinction event at the end of the Cretaceous period. The model also revealed that the Chicxulub impact, when the Earth's surface and shape are considered, would have likely been too small to cause the Deccan Traps.

	<TEXT> I haven't ruled magnetite out entirely, though I am skeptical. The colour is not like any magnetite I have ever come across - it's almost a blue grey, rather than the typical black, it's not granular and feels quite smooth, waxy to the touch, and my pen magnet doesn't 'stick' to the surface on its own (weakly magnetic rather than strongly magnetic). When there's some more light out, and I have some more free time I'll take another look. Thank you for your thoughts thus far. </TEXT>

I suspect you may mean oil (in this case bitumen)? The oil sands is [dominated](http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/energy-statistics/canadian-crude-oil-production) by the production of bitumen which is subsequently upgraded (not refined) broadly speaking. The vast majority is [exported](http://www.oilsandsmagazine.com/energy-statistics/canadian-crude-oil-exports-imports) to the United States [PADDs](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=4890) where it is refined.

	<TEXT> Came across a bit of '[float](http://imgur.com/a/mQ5wC)' at a new development. All the rock used as fill, etc. is said to be sourced from on site, and the local geology is dominated by basalt. Here the ore occurs as: massive, grey to black with a metallic luster. It is weakly magnetic (video: https://streamable.com/d2xqo) (to strongly magnetic?), and occurs with the basalt which appears to have been serpentinized. A scratch test suggests a hardness of ~5.5. I did not / do not have a streak plate; however, using the bottom of a ceramic white dish showed a dark green to brown streak. I don't believe the brown reflects the mineral in question, however, and believe it stems from small amounts of hematite that occur with it. I would be certain it was [chromite](http://geology.com/minerals/chromite.shtml) if the streak was definitively brown, however, it is not - as far as I can tell. Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I'm aware of the ages we are discussing; however, I was simply informing you by painting a broad, generally accepted theory / timeline about something in which you clearly lack an educated understanding in.

Broadly stated, up until the Miocene the waters flowed from East to West (as was depicted in the previous comment) 

The uplift of central and northern Andes occurred concomitantly with an important reorganization of the drainage pattern in the northern South America. In Early Miocene, the fluvial systems that flowed from the Amazonian craton towards the sub-Andean basins and northward to the Caribbean were replaced by a megawetland, the Pebas system, covering more than 10^6 km^2 in western Amazonia. By Late Miocene the Pebas system progressively disappeared and gave place to the transcontinental Amazon River, connecting the Andes and the equatorial Atlantic margin.^[1](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012821X14004075), ^[2](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n12/fig_tab/ngeo1017_F1.html)

A relatively good summary (though missing the Purus Arch which can be seen in the previous comments illustration.) has been illustrated [here](http://i.imgur.com/nHGE4o2.jpg). I hope that provides you with a clearer picture.

	<TEXT> I believe the leading theory was that 'it went elsewhere.' As a part of Gondwanaland it flowed from East to West. As the Andes formed it began to change direction; however, it didn't drain into the ocean, but rather into an inland sea, and eventually forming into a freshwater lake system. More recently, with the onset of the glacial / interglacial periods (the start of the Pleistocene ~2.58Ma and the drop in sea levels, the lake system drained forming the present day Amazon river which drained from West to East (see [here](http://i.imgur.com/c33vjtq.jpg)). 

These new age estimates appear to disagree with this however. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rocks were first discovered in 2007, originally dated to ~3.7Ga, though later dating of the rocks, increasing their age to ~4.3Ga^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5897/1828), would lead to controversy... a disagreement which remains unresolved^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuvvuagittuq_Greenstone_Belt#Age_controversy)

The previous method used (leading to the much contested age) the same dating method, and was conducted by, in part, the same authors of this current paper.

Currently, the most widely accepted ages for the oldest known rocks on Earth belong to the [Acasta Gneiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acasta_Gneiss), dated to 4.03Ga^[3](https://journals.lib.unb.ca/index.php/GC/article/view/3966) </TEXT>

EDIT:

In summary:

(1) Nanodiamonds do not require an impact hypothesis for their formation. The so-called nanodiamonds, aren't actually nanodiamonds^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2892/abstract;jsessionid=51A787DCE92D9C69E34E89E21AD85D2E.f02t02)

(2) Their samples are not from the same stratigraphical layer^[3](http://www.pnas.org/content/111/21/E2162), ^[4](http://www.nature.com/news/prehistoric-impact-idea-smacked-down-1.15194)

(3) There's no evidence of wide spread fires via impact^[5](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2914/abstract)

(4) Suggested Iridium anomoly is not a result of comet impact, but rather from common wetland processes^[6](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/19/7208) 

(5) Black-mats result from changes in the water table, not from an impact event^[7](http://www.pnas.org/content/105/18/6520.full#sec-11)

(6) The Clovis culture was not 'wiped out'^[8](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305440310001731)

(7) 
In summary, none of the original YD impact signatures have been subsequently corroborated by independent tests. Of the 12 original lines of evidence, seven have so far proven to be non-reproducible. The remaining signatures instead seem to represent either (1) non-catastrophic mechanisms, and/or (2) terrestrial rather than extraterrestrial or impact-related sources. In all of these cases, sparse but ubiquitous materials seem to have been misreported and misinterpreted as singular peaks at the onset of the YD. Throughout the arc of this hypothesis, recognized and expected impact markers were not found, leading to proposed YD impactors and impact processes that were novel, self-contradictory, rapidly changing, and sometimes defying the laws of physics. The YD impact hypothesis provides a cautionary tale for researchers, the scientific community, the press, and the broader public.^[9](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012825211000262)

	<TEXT> Every kimberlite diamondiferous deposit consists of various sized diamonds. Microdiamonds are by far the most abundant, and further drilling is required to estimate the fraction of larger diamonds. If you don't have microdiamonds, you're simply not going to have any macrodiamonds. 

With regard to diamondiferous kimberlite, exploration requires that you first find KIMs (Kimberlite Indicator Minerals) which indicate the presence of kimberlite (a unique magma that transports diamonds from depth to the surface). KIMs are a set of minerals that are rather unique to kimberlitic magmas: chromium diopside, chromium spinels, magnesian ilmenite, and chromium rich pyrope garnets. 

Once you locate the mineral train full of KIMs you trace it to its source. Generally speaking it is rare to find microdiamonds within the mineral train. Once you have located the source of the KIMs (the kimberlite pipe / dyke) you can sample it in hopes of finding microdiamonds which would suggest that there may exist macros as well. You would then conduct more drilling and bulk sampling to determine the fraction of macrodiamonds present. 

Furthermore, generally kimberlite pipes occur in clusters. If you have located one, there is a good chance that more can be discovered within the region. Hope that helps bring some perspective to the article, and the significance of finding microdiamonds. </TEXT>

Admittedly, I haven't read the study at length, however, I'm not sure I follow that interpretation. IIRC previous studies have shown that while some percentage of H2O, derived from comets, may have contributed to Earths  oceans, comets could not have supplied the majority. Other than mass calculations, strong evidence suggests that Earth's water was here all along^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/795) (as the article states), with contributions from chondritic bodies suggested by D/H composition^[2](http://i.imgur.com/Swz01Mr.jpg), ^[3](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/346/6209/623) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is room for debate in regard to the effects on Earth and microbial life from the LHB, with some research concluding that there exists "no plausible situation in which the habitable zone was fully sterilized on Earth"^[1](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7245/abs/nature08015.html) .  The upshot is that this also implies a submarine zone which remained habitable, in agreement with submarine hydrothermal vent origins (black smokers), and others such as the Lost City hydrothermal field^[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_Hydrothermal_Field) .

Another interesting point regarding the Faint Young Sun must also be emphasized. The Earth's atmosphic composition lacked any significant amount of oxygen, and thus lacked an ozone layer; in other words, life would have been bathed in radiation, and again submarine environments would have provided a habitable zone. There are polyextremophile bacteria ([Deinococcus radiodurans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deinococcus_radiodurans)) able to withstand an acute does of ionizing radiation upwards of 500,000 rad, but supposedly([?](http://www.astrobio.net/origin-and-evolution-of-life/could-natural-nuclear-reactors-have-boosted-life-on-this-and-other-planets/)) there is no evolutionary reason to develop such high tolerances.

As for Venus, it has been proposed that it may have been the first habitable world of our solar system^[3](http://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069790/full) </TEXT>

While interesting to think about, I tend not to give much weight to such thoughts (adding unnecessary complexity where none may be needed). If life can readily emerge during the Hadean / Eoarchean on Earth, the implication suggests life could also arise elsewhere. Arguing towards panspermia, to me, tends to diminish the value, and importance of having multiple points of origin in the search for life. If we are to think along panspermia though, perhaps it's best to regard Earth as the original source?    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article does a poor job of explaining why I should be convinced of the studies conclusion. 

What lead the authors to confidently conclude that the local, single site analysis of Clay:Calcium are a *confirmed* result of a chaotic resonance transition associated with interactions between the orbits of Mars and the Earth?

Without reading the paper at length (the abstract is certainly no help), I can only assume there are a plethora of non-astronomical possibilities that may have contributed to the ratios discussed... it's a rather bold leap to make. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and so far I have not been privy to such evidence. </TEXT>

Because it's not factual. Waste water injection and hydraulic fracturing have both been linked to induced seismicity.

	<TEXT> As far as temperatures between the surface of the Sun and Earth's inner core go, no that's not surprising. What's surprising is the body-centered cubic (BCC) crystal structure at these P-T conditions. As the abastract states:

The two leading candidates are hexagonal close-packed [hcp] and body-centred cubic (bcc) crystal structures, but the dynamic and thermodynamic stability of bcc iron under inner-core conditions has been challenged.

Note the following phase diagram ([here](http://i.imgur.com/h5Qsyzy.png))^[1](http://www.spring8.or.jp/en/news_publications/press_release/2010/101015/) which depicts hcp and note where on the phase diagram bcc is found.

I've modified the above diagram to highlight P-T conditions (330GPa - 360GPa and 5300C - 6000C respectively) within the Earth's inner core: http://i.imgur.com/o0BaqRN.jpg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are correct in that geophysical models, and any mathematical model for that matter, contains the problem of non-uniqueness. That is to say, any number of modeled variables may be able to fit the data; however, you must obey geochemical and geophysical constraints at any set of P-T conditions and produce the most probable solution. In doing so we can arrive at an acceptable interpretation, as in fact, the study does:

"Analysis of the seismic signature reveals that the compositional heterogeneity can be ascribed to a small volume of partial melt (0.5  0.2 vol% on average)... Despite spatial variations in temperature, the calculated melt volume fraction correlates strongly with the amplitude of PS conversion throughout the region. Comparing the values of temperature calculated from the seismic signal with available petrological constraints, we infer that melting in the layer is caused by release of volatiles from the subducted Farallon slab."

Provided your extensive background in geology, what would you propose other than a volatile rich melt fraction from the subducted Farallon slab capable of producing such an anomaly?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A number of comments have stated the problem is effectively heat and pressure. I'd just like to add some rough values to further elucidate on those comments. Earth's geothermal gradient is ~25C per kilometer of depth, and Earth's pressure gradient is ~30MPa per kilometer of depth (1MPa = 296.077atm, where 1atm is equal to the weight of the atmosphere at sea level). Therefore, at 350km depth temperatures could easily reach 8,750C with pressures equaling 10,500MPa (103,626.94atm).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Viscosity primarily relates to the silica content of the magma, the higher the silica content the more viscous the magma, although temperature and gas content also play a role. The greater the silica content the more bonding of [silica tetrahedra](http://i.imgur.com/EBsMSFT.jpg), and therefore the greater the degree of polymerization (ie. the greater the viscosity of the magma).

	<TEXT> So I only had time to look one of the photos you provided and mark it up for you (so I chose the easier one). Solid red lines I am confident those are dumlins (I've marked ice flow direction on them). It's not uncommon for them the have a small basin in front of them (note the small pond for example). Dashed lines I am less confident without seeing them in 3D. Blue lines encircle what could be kames / hummocks and yellow indicate what I believe may be eskers (can't be confident in those though): http://i.imgur.com/pFW2tmr.jpg There are a number of other glacial landforms that I left unmarked simply because it was not clear what they could be given the resolution.

Here's an [ice flow indicator map](http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/PublicationsCatalogue/OpenFiles/2013/Documents/2013-06/OF2013_06_Sheet1.pdf) for BC (large pdf). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What area are you referring to (google map)? Are they mostly till, or bedrock? It can be difficult to assess without real world context. If the region has seen several glacial-interglacial episodes complex landforms may arise as latter flow regimes may modify previous landforms.

From what you're describing, these could range from pods of whalebacks, drumlin swarms, roche moutonnes, flutes, crag and tails, rogen moraines, hummocky terrain, etc.

Generally speaking, they are relatively short-lived^[1](https://qz.com/903913/lava-from-a-hawaiian-volcano-continues-to-flow-like-an-unstoppable-firehose-into-the-pacific-ocean/)

Is the lava in the flow typically of deep Earth origin, or more shallower slight sub-surface melting?

This is an area of active debate with generally two camps. One favours a deep mantle plume sourced from the core-mantle boundary, while the other favours a shallower thermal anomaly.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Water is a volatile so that is why you get the explosive reaction

I don't believe that's entirely true, or in the very least I think it can be explained more correctly as it sounds like you're refering to oceanic water. The oceanic water flashes to steam but that's not where the explosiveness comes from. Magma contains volatiles which exsolve at lower pressures such as at the surface. Here, as the volatiles are in the process of exsolution the lava is quenched by the relatively cold oceanic water. Quenching the lava as the gases are rapidly exsolving generates the explosion. The concentration of gases is not homogeneous (it's heterogeneous) and therefore you get periods of increased explosivity relative to other periods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, dark colours will simply look like shadows, outcrop, or ground litter. It's best to wear bright colours that are not typically found in nature as they stand out like a sore thumb. Fluorescent orange for example (ie. street cones), amongst others. 

I do mineral exploration as a field geologist and the worst thing you can wear, so as to be near invisible from the air, are dark colours.

	<TEXT> I'm failing to see your point. We can continue to provide papers to one another, but that only further proves my point that there is still much debate as to which factor played the more dominant role, climate^[1](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/33/9310.full?sid=2615f780-5bd1-4c50-8992-842af7312d98) and ecological changes^[2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v506/n7486/full/nature12921.html) , or human colonization. </TEXT>

In fact, there is still debate regarding Australian sites as well (though I am less familiar with studies regarding Australia), see: "[The timing and cause of megafauna mass deaths at Lancefield Swamp, south-eastern Australia](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379116301949)" </TEXT>
