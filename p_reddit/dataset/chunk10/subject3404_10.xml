	<TEXT> I think the movie was not the best from MCU but it certainly far from worst. To be honest I really enjoyed the movie.

I found that in the first part and half of the second part of the movie, the narratives were shaky and it was not progress as fast as I want. But I am glad that most of the characters got a lot of development in this one, especially Yondu and Nebula who were one dimensional in the first movie.

I also appreciate that this movie going really bold with the color and scenery, from Gold Sovereign planet, white snowy city planet, to green ego planet.

Overall, I would give this 7.5 out of 10.

P.S. I would watch the movie with Stakar and his team. On the paper itself, that team sounds interesting </TEXT>

 It is no exaggeration to say that a goodly portion of planet Earths most famous residents have gathered today at Longcross Studios outside London to shoot a scene set at Stamboul (now Istanbul) train station for director Sir Kenneth Branaghs adaptation of Agatha Christies Murder on the Orient Express (out Nov. 22). Branagh, who also plays Christies famous Belgian detective, Hercule Poirot, is present and properly dressed in 1930s-era attire. So too are Star Wars heroine Daisy Ridley, Michelle Pfeiffer, Willem Dafoe, Hamilton star Leslie Odom Jr., and British acting royalty Dame Judi Dench and Sir Derek Jacobi. But wait, theres more. In one corner of the soundstage, Josh Gad and Olivia Colman (Broadchurch) are discussing the Police Academy franchise; Penlope Cruz is gliding past the re-creation of a vintage train talking on her phone in Spanish; and Johnny Depp is ruminating to your reporter about the likelihood of his characters long brown coat being made out of leather. Im feeling like its fake, he says  incorrectly, as the films Oscar-winning costume designer, Alexandra Byrne (Elizabeth: The Golden Age), will later attest. However the most eye-catching sight is not a person but a thing: the fake mustache sported by Branagh. The item is so extravagantly outsize it almost seems more alien face-hugger than facial fuzz. When I saw it I was like, Holy moly! says Ridley. But this is a larger-than-life story, so why not make the mustache larger, too?

 Poirot is always well-groomed, whether on the page or the screen. The Belgians care over his appearance reflects an obsessively meticulous nature, which enables him to investigate the most complex and horrific of crimes, including the brutal attack at the center of Murder on the Orient Express. First published in 1934, and inspired by Christies journeys on the real-life luxury locomotive which then ran between Istanbul and Paris, the book finds Poirot investigating a fatal stabbing. With the Orient Express marooned in a snowdrift and the murderer trapped on the train, Poirot interrogates a dozen or so suspects before gathering them together to hear him solve the case. The books large number of supporting characters allowed Branagh to cast stars keen to take roles that were chunkier than cameos but did not demand too much of their time. Even so, putting together a schedule capable of catering to the collective calendars of Depp, Pfeiffer, Cruz, et al. was no easy feat. It was a ton of planning, Ill tell you, the director concedes. A delicate web of availability.

	<TEXT> [Spoiler](/s "It is the 1969 Guardians of the Galaxy from the Comic AKA the OG Guardians of the Galaxy. Yondu was one of them. The team consists of Starhawk (Silvester Stallone), Martinex, the one with diamond face (Michael Rosenbaum), Aleta Ogord (Michelle Yeoh), Charlie-27, the big Guy (Ving Rhames), Mainframe, the Robot face (Voiced by Miley Cyrus) and Krugar, the one with claw ")


James Gunn stated that he want Stallone to be more prominent in the future and I think it will established the cosmic sides of MCU. I think the group will regroup again.

That being said, I really enjoyed the movie. The visual was gorgeous and colorful. This movie got the character development right.

	<TITLE> [THROWBACK] Alphabeat - Boyfriend </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hope I am not too early to post Throwback Thursday since it is already Thursday in here .

So for this week's  throwback Thursday, I picked Boyfriend by Alphabeat. One of the best Danish band in my opinion. One of the reason I posted this is because there was new song by Paramore that reminds me a lot of Alphabeat, which is good because I am a sucker for a song that influenced a lot by 80's.

There are two version of this song. The 2007 version and 2008 version. Enjoy.

[Alphabeat - Boyfriend \(2007 version\)](https://youtu.be/0NOFVjjQ_2c)

[Alphabeat - Boyfriend \(2008 version\)](https://youtu.be/dSZS1Hx0TAo)

In the mid to late 2000's, there are rarely artists that inspired by 80's like ABBA or B-52's and Alphabeat at that time feel like a fresh air and nostalgic at the same time. I think this song is heavily influenced by 80's R B/Disco but there are some 2000's alternative vibe that keep this song new and unusual but in a good way.

Fun fact, according to their lead singer,  Anders SG, this is song is inspired by a Swedish film about two lesbians. They're teenagers and it's a story about them discovering love and how they feel about other girls. 

[Another Fun Fact was  Katy Perry kissed their lead singer, Stine Bramsen after they performed this song in 2008](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1061516/Is-Katy-Perry-kissing-girls-Singer-flirty-time-female-friend.html) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Article from EMPIRE](http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/exclusive-new-look-kingsman-golden-circle/)

 Theres an opportunity with Kingsman 2 to make it bigger and bolder and funnier and crazier, says Matthew Vaughn of The Golden Circle, the follow-up to 2014s Kingsman: The Secret Service. Given that movie featured Colin Firth going nutso in a church, and a sequence where a whole bunch of heads explode in technicolour unison, thats quite a statement. The church sequence, everyone wants something like that, he says. But weve got action sequences which are just as original but different.

 We wont be able to fully assess the bolder, funnier, crazier claims until September, when The Golden Circle hits cinemas. But bigger is pretty much a given. The sequel has added a raft of big-name heavy-hitters to the cast, thanks to the introduction of the new American secret agent organisation, Statesman. Theres Halle Berry as the Statesmens tech guru, Ginger, Jeff Bridges as their leader, Agent Champagne (or Champ, as he prefers people to call them), and Pedro Pascal as Agent Jack, who teams up with Taron Egertons Kingsman, Eggsy, to try to take down Julianne Moores Poppy, a megalomaniacal villain Vaughn describes as Americas sweetheart gone wrong.

[Agent Tequila](http://i.imgur.com/ayje74Q.jpg)

 And here, as part of two new images from the film, we get a new glimpse at Channing Tatum as one of those Statesmen, a cocky cowboy spy codenamed Agent Tequila. Theyre great characters, says Vaughn of the new additions. Theyre multi-billionaires with huge jets, and their base is a giant distillery in Kentucky. Which explains the alcohol-related nicknames, then. "Weve got all this fun Americana and were combining it with the Englishness.

[Eggsy](https://i.imgur.com/93H1CIE.jpg)


 Our other exclusive image shows Egerton returning as Eggsy, the boy from the streets made good as a gentleman spy. Weve got a huge arc for Eggsy, says Vaughn. Where does he go? What does he have to learn? And now hes got a huge moral dilemma the audience will totally relate to. Plus, if the presence of one Mr. Colin Firth is anything to go by, he may have to contend with an unexpected blast from the past in the seemingly back-from-the-dead form of Harry Hart. But to find out more about that, and indeed more on what the mysterious Golden Circle is, were going to have to wait a while

	<TEXT> My theater played the Beauty and the Beast before they put the Fate and the Furious. It was a technical mistake.

Maybe the projectionist gave a sign that Luke Evans will appear in this movie even for few minutes. I was surprised by his apperance because I only watch one trailer.

I like the second act when Cipher hacked Cars and controlled them and it was over the top and Very FF.

I just do not like how Cipher blackmailed Dom, it was really cliche in my opinion.

I like this movie more than Fast and Furious 6 and Fast 7. I appreciate the Rock and Jason Statham banter it was one of the highlight in this movie. When The Rock in danced in the soccer field, it reminds me of Moana, maybe it was intentional.

It also has information about Halle Berry and Julianne Moore characters.

Anyway, this bit is kinda excites me for a bit.

 If the first Kingsman was Captain America, Egerton says, then this is very much The Avengers now
