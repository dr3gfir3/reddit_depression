	<TEXT> I actually just went back and rewatched it. The entire part where the camera follows Charlie around is continuous, so there are no cuts to other shots. However, they probably did cut and then edit them together to make them look continuous (I think the shots that are close ups of the door are the "cuts).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was one of the best and funniest scenes where it was one continuous shot of Charlie working IMO. I couldn't stop laughing </TEXT>
