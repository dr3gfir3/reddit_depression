	<TEXT> [Part 3 Here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/69tnen/i_wish_my_roommate_was_here_part_3/?st=J2H8GE8W sh=ce169111)

I had never been in a fight in my life, which is what made my body surprise me so much. I manage to sidestep my dads charge and place a hand on his back, shoving him into the wall of the building behind me. He manages to turn sideways a bit and save his face, but he still hits the wall with a loud smack. He turns back to face me and I can see the anger in his eyes. I turn towards the alley exit and take off at a full sprint again, hoping to put distance between us. It may seem cowardly to some of you, but my body was running on what felt like autopilot and apparently it thought that was the best option. I had never seen my dad run before so I had no idea how fast he could run. I check over my should and see that hes not too far behind me, gaining only a little at a time. I face forward again and give my body an extra push to run faster.

I dont really know where Im running to until I realize that Ive made it to the front of my dorm. Dorms on-campus have electronic locks that keep anyone who doesnt have a fob out. I begin to feel some hope again, until I reach into my pocket and realize my keys are gone. For the second time that night, I find myself wishing my roommate was there. My heart feels like it drops all the way down to my stomach. I look behind me, expecting my dad to grab me from behind. To my surprise, hes nowhere in sight.

I look around a couple times to be sure, but I never catch even a glimpse of him. At that moment, another guy from the dorm opens the door to leave and I dash in. I hurriedly walk to my room. I should tell someone, I think to myself. But what if you only imagined it, Erich? What if this is all just a really bad dream or something? I make it to my room and am happily surprised to find my door is unlocked. I open it door and step into the dark room, breathing a sigh of relief. I close the door behind me, locking it and switch on the light. As I turn around from the door, my eyes widen in horror and my stomach twists into an inconceivable loop. Standing against the far wall in my room is my dad, staring directly at me. In his hand are my keys.

I immediately fumble for the doorknob unlocking it, but he swoops across the room and grabs me from behind before I manage to open the door. He slams me down on the floor on my back and stands bent over me. Nice try, kiddo, he says with a slight rasp. He backs up to the door, keeping an eye on me the whole time. He reaches behind him and locks the door again.

In the split second that I have before he steps back to me from the door, a million thoughts race through my head. This is just a dream, loops through my head. For some reason, I am convinced it is a dream. All of sudden, an idea pops into my head. In dreams, people can take control, right? They can make the dream turn out how they want to, they just have to realize they have that power. It was at the exact moment my dad reached my body again that I decide, Im taking control of this dream.

I bring my foot up quicker than even I thought I could, slamming it deep into my dads stomach and knocking him backwards. As he staggers, I get back up to my feet. He recovers quickly and charges me again. I sidestep again, keeping my leg out to trip him but he avoids it. He swings at me wildly but I duck and his knuckles slam into my lofted bed frame instead. I drive my fist into the same area I kicked and quickly follow up with a punch to the side of his face. This dream seems to finally be going my way. I continue swinging, a punch here or there getting blocked but many of them hitting their mark. It was hard to tell who was more surprised, him or me. I finally sweep his legs out from under him with a kick and he topples to the floor. Unable to control myself, I kneel down on top of him and begin driving my fists into his face.

He manages to block the first few, but more and more begin to make it through and his face begins to turn bloody under my knuckles. I shout, This is my dream, you fucking dick, over and over again, with a punch in between every word. I dont stop when he stops squirming. I dont stop when he stops blocking. I dont stop when his nose squirts blood on me. I dont stop when I feel his jaw crack. I dont even stop when I feel my knuckles begin to crack from the trauma. In fact, I never stop, not willingly anyways.

My next door neighbors had heard the commotion and reported it to an RA on the floor. Apparently the RA had come in the room and shouted for me to stop as I sat on top of my father beating the shit out of him, but I never heard. The RA then ran to call 911 as people gathered into the hallway, looking into my room. About 5 minutes after he had initially come into the room, the RA came back to see me still swinging and shouting. He tackled me off of my dad and held me tightly as I resisted and continued swinging.

After a couple more minutes, I stopped resisting and shouting. I just feel deathly silent. The police arrived and were clearing everything up as my RA escorted me from the room. I was shaking violently from all that had happened while my RA gave me some water to drink and talked to me about the police needing to speak to me. I spoke to them and explained what happened. They escorted me to the station a few blocks away so I could give them more concrete answers. I told them everything, my childhood, the first time my dad sexually molested me, that it had carried on until my parents separated, the phone call I had with my mom, and all of the incidents of tonight. They were alarmed, asking me why Id never come forward before, but I didnt have an answer for them. One officer was assigned to put me in a holding cell for the night, since my dorm room was a crime scene.

The next morning, I woke up in the cell with an officer sitting directly outside. Whats going to happen? I ask. He tells ,e there will more than likely be a court case and hearing, but then reassured me everything would work out and be fine now. Am I going to have to see my dad? I ask him. His eyes immediately become filled with worry and sadness. Son, your fatherhes dead.

Honestly, the rest of the semester was a blur. I made it back to campus, moved to a different dorm. My old roommate and I still hang out weekly and things are actually going pretty well now. I have a girlfriend, am doing well in all of my classes, and even have an amazing internship opportunity lined up. Everything is going spectacularly. So why do I still feel terrified inside most of the time? 

Constant knots in my stomach, snapping awake in cold sweats, no longer being able to sleep, headaches, paranoia, everything. I couldnt figure it out for the longest time, but since Ive started sharing my story with the rest of you who, like me, can longer fall asleep because of the horrors that lurk in your mind, Ive discovered why Im still so afraid: when I was sitting on top of my dad, pounding his face in repeatedly, shouting at him, I didnt want it to be a dream. Im no longer afraid of the monster my dad was. Now Im afraid of the monster he made me.
