	<TEXT> $75k for a housekeeper and $100k for a chef! Someone's getting ripped off!!

When I sold my house I had 2 housekeepers come by on a Sunday and they cleaned my *entire* house for $300. I could eat off the floor in my garage when they were done!

And average salary for an executive chef is $75k (thank you, Google.)

Apparently rich = stupid according to this article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dinoland USA feels that way because it wasn't the original plan for that area. It was originally supposed to be mythical beasts but they scrapped it to tie into the movie Dinosaur (which was in production at the time.)

Basically, Dinoland USA is Disney's equivalent of losing their homework and trying to recreate the assignment before the teacher walks into homeroom.

A movie-centric attraction to every land in Epcot that doesn't have one. For example, remove Impressions Of France and put in a show or movie related to any of the myriad Disney movies with French roots.

Retire:

The Speedway by Space Mountain. The ride is showing its age and there is enough room in that location to add something that will excite guests.

Improve:

The ridiculousness of trying to eat at Cinderella's Royal table. I should not need to plan meals months in advance for the privilege of eating $50 eggs.

By using the emoji, the girl is saying, "when a guy sleeps with another girl, then goes back to his regular girl, then that makes him a fop" - fop being a pejorative term for homosexuals.

	<TEXT> Oh Magic players today, gather 'round and let me tell you of the great WoTC purge of the mid 90s.

You see, some stay-at-home moms on Long Island happened to catch their sons playing magic one day.

*unholy strength?* (with blood pentagram)

*demonic tutor?* 

*demonic attorney?*

*doomsday?*

*"what is this devil worshipping game you're playing?"* they questioned.

News stories began swirling and then, in one fell swoop, **those motherfuckers at WoTC banned half my goddamn deck!!**

BECAUSE OF MOTHERS ON LONG ISLAND!!!!!!! </TEXT>
