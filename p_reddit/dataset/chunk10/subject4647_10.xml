	<TEXT> I am not right. The sources and the history I cite is. I didn't document them. Nor is this emotional topic for me. But as a general rule of thumb I don't like when people ask for a source on a topic they know little about, get a good source, then without a source of their own dismiss what they see. Granted you didn't quite do this. You at least acknowledged there is something and said you would look into it rather than saying *no the source is wrong*. But at the same time you aren't saying about the source other than *I'll give it a raincheck*  

And you are wrong about modern day Russian oligarchs not having ties to ussr  oligarchy, but that is a different topic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It proves exactly what I said. It isn't a theory either it is what happened. If you don't want to believe it I don't care, but your rejection of history won't change it. 

So here is what we can do since the ball is in your court. You can get your own sources and play ball or we can call it a game.  

Don't ask for a source for common knowledge if you aren't willing to accept it. There is millions of sources on it as the elitism and corruption of the elites in ussr  is well documented. Good luck showing otherwise.   You would have easier time denying the holocaust.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you arent aware. 

There is what you want to happen and what will happen. If they arent institutionalized they will institutionalize themselves with their own private police force and militaries. They have resources to build them. Maybe they will be replaced by some ruthless warlord type who doesnt respect their wealth, but then you have a dark ages strongest barbarian becomes leader type situation. 

That is who you want to empower, ruthless rich people or ruthless/cunning warlord types. 

The issue is the system is not strong enough to deal with those that would subvert so they can control it. We need more checks and balances to stop the republicans, and their rich backers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would never beat you down. But yes someone will. Your ideology fails to understand the world. There are very bad people in it that would kill or enslave you without a thought, or with pleasure. 

In a system of no rules they make the rules. Only united and together can we stop them. That cost money. 

They promote your ideology to try and get people to remove the only obstacle from them having absolute power. Right now they use their money to have a lot of influence but it isnt the same as direct control. To do that they need to kill the beast. Make no mistake they want the same thing as you, then you will meet the real beast.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is a fact of life, somebody is going to spank you if you step out of line. You want them to add a spiked gauntlet when they do it, in the name of some misguided view of *personal freedom.* 

Libertarianism is not only immature but purely foolish as it leads to outcome that libertarians dont want.

If you want to get rid of the state you should be supporting Trump he is dismantling it as we speak for the benefit of the rich.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> well that gasp is going to screw over a lot of other generations. You see the bills they acquire are very real and will not be paid by them as they are dead. That debt is very relevant. The damage Trump is doing and the way Republicans are undermining democracy to cement their rule even with a tiny minority supporting them while a larger majority hates them is very relevant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not saying you are calling for violence. You are calling for something foolish that leads to violence against the ideals you believe in. 

The Ayn rand banner is put forward by the corrupt elite who work with Trump. In the absense of a democratic government and a just society that looks after its people, it will be replaced by a dictatorship. 

The Mercer's and Trump want to kill the beast too, so they can become the beast. Either you get a dictatorship or you get a brutal dogs eats dogs anarchy. 

If you want to end the state you need to build up the people, create ways to ensure wealth is shared and people are taken of, and build a system so robust that even in the absence of a state it can exist. 

Nobody takes libertarianism seriously except for libertarians, which you obviously are. The thing is your beliefs are not beneficial to yourself, as libertarianism will end in either a left or right dictatorship. Dont be so quick to kill a beast that keeps a much more vicious beast from devouring you, but you never need to worry as what you want isnt happening.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The irony here Ayn Rand is that your own belief leads to all of these things you mention. 

Your view lets the wealthy plunder everything and pursue these stupid policies you mentioned, and then force the cost on others under *taxes are bad.*

Starve the beast philosophy with taxcuts is always coupled with authoritarianism. They just want an excuse to fuck over 99% of Americans to benefit the rich. The theft here is from the rich not paying taxes.

	<TEXT> Russia did not have great economic growth. it simple recovered to where it was solely because of oil prices. It should have much higher growth. 

Putin is part of a bigger problem. A corrupt oligarchy that has always controlled Russia. They hijacked USSR and hijacked Russia after USSR. They ran Russia pre-USSR. They divert the anger from themselves to others. 

Maybe Putin, Le Pen, and Trump voters lost in life. But the thing is hatred of them wont make them change. It will just make them more fascist. People dont turn to fascism if things are going good for them. 

Putin and Trump dont mind people not liking them and the people who turn to them. They thrive off it. What scares them is showing their followers there is a better way. Putin didnt invade Ukraine because he really felt NATO or Ukraine is threat. Rather he is afraid if Ukraine joins the EU it will succeed, and Russians will want the same for Russia. Same for Trump, he isnt afraid of progressive policy, he is afraid people will see it work and not let it be reversed. 

Trump and Putin arent wrong. They have every reason to fear progress and a better world. You are helping them by embracing hatred. We dont have to like them or approve of support for them, but we need to help the losers of the world, and you cant let them know they are losers or you think they are losers. People dont take kindly to being looked down upon even if the criticism is valid. 

You either need to help them rise up, or put them down. I find the latter unacceptable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Things weren't good in russia. Everything was not perfect and they suddenly did this. 

They aren't bad people. They went from a mighty empire to a collapsed state on verge of failure. The promised benefits of their new found change did not benefit the average russian. The world forgot about them. Same with trump voters and Le Pen voters. Sure many are scum but most are people forgotten by the world and in need of help. Their feelings of powerless becomes fascism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most Americans don't want the EU to break up. The ones that do are known as altright. They want it to break up because their views perfectly align with Russian propaganda and they view the EU as a *SJW gay feminazi Marxist jewish islamist* entity. I am not even joking. I wish I was being sarcastic but alias no. People are this stupid. 

To be more elaborate. 

*Do they know how to works?*

They think they do. To them it is part of some gay Jewish conspiracy to make the world islamist. 

*do they view it as a threat*

Yes. They think eu wants to force them to convert to Islam and become gay. Possibly jewish too.  

*Is it because trump or someone us told them to hate it and they mindlessly do so* 

Yes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump admitted he sexually assaulted people. People didnt see through them, his voters just did not care. Same with his Russian ties, he purposely is obstructing the investigation, he could end everything really fast by letting a independent investigation clear him if he truly is innocent. Instead he is just desperately trying to delay his discovery.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Russia already has a fucked up economy, and not due to anything west has done to it. 


The bad Russians are just a few people. Yes they are terrible but Russian people are hurt more by them then we are. 

Russian people need our help. Russia collapsed twice within a century. We didnt help either time and look where it led. We are in this together, we need to unite with Russian people to get rid of Russian oligarchs and their puppets in the west. If we abandon Russia it will become spawn point of chaos. 

Putin is a competent version of Trump. Imagine how scary that is.   </TEXT>
