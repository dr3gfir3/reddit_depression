	<TEXT> I shall.  While the title sounds a little corny, well, that's where its at.  Being jaded and cynical just closes off options, and its mentally lazy (being cynical or misanthropic) because you don't have to do any work for it; everyone sucks, and thats that. You don't have to take anyone at face value, you then don't have to open yourself to being vulnerable.  Maybe I was cynical in my twenties.  That was twenty years ago. I will give it a read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> cheated on my ex husband; he was very abusive; I figured if I'm getting my ass kicked for this thing he thinks I'm doing, I may as well be guilty.  Word to the wise: all this does is confirm to him he has been right all along.  I was 20. I hated him, a lot.  Easy to say, just leave!  I was working on that.  Part of the plan. </TEXT>
