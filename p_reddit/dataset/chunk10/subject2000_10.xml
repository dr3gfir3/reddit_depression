	<TEXT> It started with the water. Every single faucet in my small 1 bedroom 1 bath apartment was pouring out dirty, brown water. I called my landlord fearing it was a problem for the entire building. To my surprise, I was the only complaint. It seemed damn near impossible to me considering we all share pipes, but stranger things have happened. He sent a plumber to my place the next day. 

It seemed it was just as I thought. Iron was contaminating my water. The plumber poured CLR down my drains and told me to let every faucet run on top pressure for twenty minutes. He said if that didnt get rid of the brown color, to wait another half an hour and try again. It worked after two tries. I thought that was the end of it.

I was wrong. 

The next day, same thing. Brown water. Frustrated, I went to the store after work to pick up CLR and take care of it myself this time. Only, after hours of trying to flush out the potential rust, the water was still coming out brown. I rang up my landlord again but it instantly went to a pre-recorded message.

On vacation for the week. Leave a message and Ill get back to you first thing Monday. Thank you.

Of course, just my luck. I looked through all the paperwork I was given upon signing the lease but nothing had the number for the plumber. I wasnt surprised. My landlord was shit. In fact, this whole complex was shit. Things were constantly falling apart: water stains on the ceilings, faulty air conditioners, graffiti in the stairwells. But I couldnt afford much else living paycheck to paycheck as I was. 

I could last a week though. It was just one week. I could buy those large water jugs from the supermarket and just hold off on taking a shower. It would be okay. 

That night I woke up at 3 am with the driest throat in the world. Every breath I took led to the feeling of sandpaper being pulled down my pharynx and to my esophagus. It was excruciating. I grabbed a glass and poured out some of the water from the jug I had bought a couple hours before I had gone to bed. I drank and drank but the feeling persisted. It felt like it was getting worse. Desperate, I pulled the cap off the jug and chugged the entire thing. Five gallons of water and it still felt like I had shards of glass embedded in my throat. 

With tears building up in my eyes from the pain and out of clean water, I toyed with the idea of just drinking from the faucet. Was it dangerous? How much iron could I consume before it was an actual danger to me? I mustve been standing there at the faucet for a long time because I blinked and the dimly lit room was casted with the glow of the clock telling me it was 4 am. Strangely, the feeling went away. 

Relieved, I went back to sleep. 

The next night, the same thing happened. I woke up around the same time with a burning in my throat that had me yearning for more water. I drank and drank and drank. This time I had bought several jugs. I must be coming down with something. I continued to drink and drink and drink but it seemed like the burning was only spreading down my esophagus into my lower sphincter. Once I was out of clean water, I turned my attention to the faucet. 
My thoughts were the same as last night. How much iron could I consume before it was an actual danger to me? 

As I peered at the faucet, I swear I began to hear a voice urging me to drink.

The voice was brittle and croaky, as if it were dealing with the same pain as me. The gravelly voice seemed like it was coming out of the air vent in swirls until it reached my ears. I could almost feel a faint breath on the back of my neck although the voice sounded far away. 

Im so thirsty. So very thirsty. Water. I need waterthirstyso thirsty

I felt hypnotized despite the voice being so grating rather than soothing. I found my body moving by its own accord. I felt water pouring into my mouth, soothing my scorching throat. The hoarse voice continued to encourage me, professing its own thirst and need. I kept drinking until the voice slithered away and suddenly I was snapped back into reality.

Realizing my head was under the kitchen faucet, brown water pouring into my mouth, I sputtered in surprise. I jumped back and spit out the remaining water in my mouth, nearly scrubbing my tongue with my fingers to try and get out any lingering molecules. I dont know what came over me, but it mustve been due to long hours at the office, little sleep and whatever illness I was coming down with. 

A little perturbed, I went back to my bedroom in hopes for just a couple more hours of sleep before work.

The next night I was awoken at 3 am again. This time not due to my throat aching, but someone knocking on my door. Groggily, I sat up in my bed wondering what someone could possible want at this time in the morning. Slightly annoyed, I got up and walked into the living room. The knocking turned faint, as if they were just taping their knuckles gently on the door. Despite there being a door between us, it almost felt like they already knew I was standing on the other side. 

Since I live in a crap area, I wasnt just going to open the door. I went to peer through the peephole and the knocking stopped. I paused for a second thinking they mightve left but I still leaned forward to get a glimpse of who it could be.

Someone, or should I say something, was standing there. But he had his back turned to me. Whoever he was, he appeared to be shirtless. He was thin with the most awful, greyish, shriveled skin. Perhaps a homeless man? His head had little hair left, only long, stringy patches. It had to either be a homeless man or a tweaker, or hell both. 

I was about to back away when he suddenly whipped back around and pressed his face directly to the peephole. I screamed in fright, jumped back and tumbled to the floor.

That was not a man.

Whatever was standing at my door was nothuman.

He had the same face structure as a human: eye sockets, a nose, the outline of a mouth. But there was the same grey and wrinkled skin stretched over all of it. 

It began to pound on my door. The sound echoed in my apartment. My heart was pounding just as hard, my breaths coming out fast. I couldnt feel my legs, much less stand back up. 

It was pounding so hard on my door; it was rattling almost out of the frame. The only thing keeping it from busting open was the door chain. 

Thirsty.so thirsty.water. I need water

It was the same voice from last night only instead of being hypnotizing, it felt almost like a threat. It kept repeating that over and over again as I was frozen in terror. I mustered up as much courage as possible and shouted that I was calling the police even though my cellphone was charging in my bedroom.

It let out a deep, raucous laugh that sent shivers down my spine. 

The kitchen faucet suddenly turned on at full pressure, blowing brown water everywhere. His pounding continued to rattle the door and his voice shrilly resonated in my apartment. 

I sprung to my feet and ran to the kitchen. I turned off the kitchen faucet, getting water all over me. As soon as the water stopped pouring, the pounding stopped as well. My heart was nearly jumping out of my chest and I stayed frozen next to faucet, not even a breath escaped my lips. 

I could hear heavy footsteps like it was leaving. I let out the breath I was holding and walked towards the door. I stayed there staring at it. I dont know how long passed but I eventually built up the nerve to peer through the peephole again. 

Nothing was there. 

I felt a bit relieved and unhooked the chain lock to open the door. There was some sort of black slime covering the area on the door he was pounding on. Its smell was so rancid, I nearly threw up. I covered my nose and looked down the dimly lit hallway making sure whatever was just at my door was gone. 

Nothing was there so I closed the door, locked it back up and turned on every light in my apartment. I didnt sleep for the rest of the night.

Guys, I dont know whats happening but theres something weird going on in my apartment. Its the morning now and Im writing this out because I dont know what to do. I cant call the police. Theyll probably just tell me it was a homeless man or drug user or something.

But I know what I saw.
 
Thatthing was not human.
 
The water is coming out even darker than it has been. Its almost black now. Im scared for tonight. I might just sleep at the office instead. Its Wednesday and my landlord wont be back until Monday to call a plumber. Though Im starting to think the color of the water has nothing to do with the plumbing. 

If anyone has any idea what could possibly be happening, please please let me know. Im one more step away from calling a fucking priest to come and bless the place.
