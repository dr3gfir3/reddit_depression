This lawsuit should be seen for exactly what it is: A partisan attempt to change the rules in the middle of an election for a nakedly partisan outcome.

Handel knows she's outnumbered and her ideas are outnumbered. Her only hope is that less people vote. And that's not democracy, that's partisan politics. </TEXT>

And that there's no way the Russia links could actually be true, considering that most of Trumps financing during the last decade has actually come from Russian interests which themselves are thinly veiled Russian state actors. But Occam's Razor states the simplest explanation must be true. If Trump doesn't know the truth about his own Russian ties, it's because he's truly that naive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's true. But when you add the repeated stress of being fully responsible for another human, some people will. And that's why this guy shouldn't have had a kid either foster or adopted. And it's clear you have no kids. Because if you did, you'd understand the ever-present vigilance that parents have for the welfare and safety of our children. I'm saying, this guy didn't have that. If the child was his biologically, and he helped raise him from birth, there's a good chance he wouldn't have done this. It's because that process changes people.

There's a question on most personality tests which asks, "Aren't babies incredibly special?"  If you answer anything other than yes, you don't have your own kids. It's simple and precise and those who don't have kids understand it. And that's the core of this issue. This guy shouldn't have been allowed to adopt. He wasn't mentally prepared to be a father. If he had raised his own kids, or even raised this one from a baby, he probably would have been better equipped to handle the situation. My kid has acted out at school. I didn't do any of those terrible things. I took away his laptop. It's a lifetime of learning for a parent. What this guy did is indefensible. And I'm not defending him. I'm saying adoption agencies need to do a better job of vetting potential parents. Because they let this one slip through, a child is dead. And this guy is entirely at fault for his actions which resulted in the child's death. But the adoption agency also bears some responsibility for placing a child in a home with an unstable individual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because people tend not to read multi-line comments. They try to get the gist from the first line and run with it. Yes this guy was very messed up and never should have tried to become a father. And I'm also saying as a reply to the parent question, being a father is a process. One which this guy didn't go through. Biology is pretty weird when it comes to fathers and babies. Our instincts are the only thing that allowed us to survive as a species to get to the point where love took over. Today, instincts still play a role. But there is a certain subset of men for which their instincts are broken, never take place, or something else is damaged within them. So they never imprint with a child. Mothers usually imprint within a few weeks but they have a head start. And for some postpartum depression blocks that. So when asking why would someone do this? There's the answers. I'm not defending a monster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being a father is a process. A lot of us guys don't tend to have a lot of patience to begin with. Caring for a newborn and then a toddler changes you. I grew new patience like I'd never dreamed of. Instincts kick in.  For a guy who probably had little patience to begin, he just wasn't prepared to be a father. The severity of his actions prove he should never have tried to adopt a child. He belongs in jail. And I'm a guy who was primary caregiver for my two kids from 4 months onto seven years of age. I have way more patience than I used to, but I have the instinct to protect my children at all costs, something this guy lacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, you really misunderstand. This subsidy wasn't for customers to pay premiums. It was more like a kickback to the insurance companies to charge less money for premiums. In the same way that farmers are paid a subsidy to grow corn. You, the customer, don't get money from the government to buy corn. so, when those subsidies (kickbacks) didn't come through, the price of premiums went up. Do you understand now? Yes, every plan was subsidized because the industry was subsidized. And next time you want to try to school a liberal, actually read the law. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's incorrect English to use two of them together when you can convey the exact same meaning without it. You wouldn't use "had had" together. You could use "have had". Occasionally acceptable would be a contracted form, "they'd had", but only in casual conversation. </TEXT>
