	<TEXT> The eyes of fish and other sea creatures evolved to see underwater. Life first originated underwater but without eyes, so the first sea creatures had no vision at all but over time some  evolved to have special proteins or chemicals that were sensitive to light. At first it was just a few patches of light, then some colours, then a blurred vision and then came the eyes that were perfect to see underwater. But when life evolved for terrestrial life and when the first sea creature came on land it didn't have the proper eyes to see the world above water. Light when passes from one medium to another, it bends, this is known as refraction and this happens when light passes from air into water, so the eyes of the first land creatures were made to see underwater. The eyes of fish and terrestrial vertebrates today are almost the same but for one difference, fish have a more spherical lens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think there is much of a difference between them except for the way they are obtained by our body. Both the Vitamin Ds serve the same purpose. There is something called 7-dehydrocolesterol under our skin which when hit by sunlight gets converted into vitamin D.

Feel free to correct if I seem wrong anywhere. </TEXT>
