	<TEXT> I play with this racquet and would rate myself between 4.0-4.5. I used to play with lighter racquets and moved up to this one. I would consider it an intermediate-level racquet. The moderate weight and 18x20 string pattern make it a pretty good racquet to develop your game with. It's main strength is control; it wont give you a ton of spin or power, but provides enough of each. I have since added about 14g of lead tape throughout the racquet to add a bit more power and a more solid feel. Overall, I would recommend to any 3.5-4.5 player.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hearing all of Boris's comments about Djokovic's decline, this kind of seems like another dig at Djokovic. It makes me wonder what really happened between them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe look into I/O Psychology? It is sort of a middle ground between the two areas and there are job options available to those with just a Master's rather than Ph.D.  </TEXT>
