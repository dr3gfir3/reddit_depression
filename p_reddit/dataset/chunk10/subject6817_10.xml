	<TEXT> Considering that arbers have (allegedly) been able to shrink the gap between BFX and GDAX/GEMINI etc, would you expect the price to reenter the multi-year channel once everyone who wanted out of BFX did so? Or is it terminated once we get out for a while?

Am I wrong to keep that channel in such high regard? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont need to hit the top, i just don't want to sell at 1800 if I could sell at 3500. I dont want to miss the peak and then baghold like i did for years hoping it bubbles again. 

If it would stay in this tight channel I probably wouldnt sell a single one, its the bubbles and crashes that are bothering me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, I have no idea what the fuck I should do. I have been lurking here since I bought and held in '13, average entry cost is around $700, 10.83 coins. 

Yesterday I sent them all to GDAX just to be ready to sell whenever I think it tops.

My dad is asking why I havent doubled my position yet.

	<TEXT> I am looking for a new leather work bag, mainly its going to hold all the crap that would otherwise go in my pockets as well as a Macbook Air. Budget is around $150 or less. The look I am going for is nice business casual, I dont wear a suit to work, wool dress pants if I have client meetings or a tradeshow.

It should have an opening at the top, not a folding flap. I also need the option of shoulder strap as well as handles.

	<TEXT> Hello,

I received a quote for website rebuild for $1800.

Its a simple website with about 400 items listed for sale, they will be broken into several categories and subcategories. All of the items will be uploaded via spreadhseet and the pictures via FTP, probably by me, not the dev.

the quote lists the job as:

1. Improve visual layout.
Update site to use responsive AJAX layout.
Will be compatible with all browsers and devices.
Will have modern, clean layout and graphics.
2. Improve Functionality with product import module.
Products will be able to be added or updated en masse through upload of CSV file.
Images will be uploaded separately through FTP and linked to items by name in CSV file.

It wont even have a functioning shopping cart as we dont sell online, it will tell people to call for delivery options.

I feel like this is pretty high in 2017 when there are tons of plug and play options for pretty much everything.

Can one of you Magicians please share some insight? </TEXT>

What shook me the most is realizing that i don't even crave these things anymore after just a couple of weeks. Also its really easy to go over your macros with that stuff, it has a lot of fat. </TEXT>
