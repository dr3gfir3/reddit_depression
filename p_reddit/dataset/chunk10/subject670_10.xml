	<TEXT> He got a lot of ideas from Revan about how the Dark Side worked, but Bane was the one that came up with the specific Rule of Two.

It would be like saying Maxwell discovered Einstein's theory of relativity. Could Einstein have come up with his theory without the work done by James Maxwell? Probably not, but it was still Einstein that made the leap to his theory of relativity. </TEXT>

Sidious only encoded the "Rule of One" after killing all of the Jedi. This is -again- in line with Bane's teachings, since the purpose of the Rule of Two was to find a Sith Lord capable of wiping out the Jedi. After Sidious wiped out the Jedi, there no longer was a need for a "Rule of Two."

Still, we can see his Baninite beliefs ran pretty strong even after that, since he still courted Luke as his Apprentice, and then pitted him against his current Apprentice. </TEXT>

He had multiple Apprentices for *short times* only. He would quickly pit them against each other to see who was the strongest.

In accordance with Bane's teachings, he wanted his Apprentices to be  the **second** strongest Dark Side user in the galaxy. Whenever he met someone he thought might be more powerful then his current Apprentice, he would do some preliminary training and/or corrupting, and then make sure they crossed paths and fought his current Apprentice. If they won, they became his new Apprentice.

The fact Anakin kept killing his Apprentices was one of the reasons he made corrupting him a priority. Clearly, Anakin was demonstrating *he* should be Palpatine's Apprentice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The theory behind the practice was sound (given Bane's assumptions about how the Dark Side worked). But, there certainly were some issues with individuals that didn't fully agree with his principles. Bane himself had to kill a few Appearances because they weren't on board with all of his ideas, and -down the line- there were some Master/Appearances that didn't follow the code as Bane intended.


IMO, the theory was sound, but people (or Sith) are flawed. But, Bane was a purest, and his laws reflect that purism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It made sense if you think about it in the terms of individualistic Social Darwinism and understand Bane's Dark Side philosophy.

Darth Bane thought that the Dark Side (being very individualistic) was only as strong as the individuals practicing it. He was upset that sometimes weaker Sith would team up to kill a stronger Sith. He felt this weakened the Dark Side itself.

The [Rule of Two](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rule_of_Two) was made to stop this practice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Darth Bane started his own Sith Philosophy, underpinned by something called "[The Rule of Two.](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rule_of_Two/Legends)"

Basically, he thought that the Dark Side (being very individualistic and akin to Social Darwinism) was only as strong as the individuals practicing it. He was upset that sometimes weaker Sith would team up to kill a stronger Sith. He felt this weakened the Dark Side itself.

So, he took it upon himself to kill all the other Sith, and then declared there could only be two: One to have the power (The Master), and one to desire the power (The Apprentice). It was the job of the Apprentice to kill the Master if/when they become more powerful than the Master. Thus, the Dark Side would become ever stronger, as stronger and stronger Sith took on the mantle of Master.

Emperor Palpatine could trace his training back, Master to Apprentice, to Darth Bane. He was a true "Baninite," and took the Rule of Two pretty seriously. </TEXT>

If you fold your arms and say "Well, I don't want to play until the rules are fair," then you'll be marginalized. Why should politicians care about someone who doesn't vote? If you want to make changes, then you have to participate. Why do you think Bernie become a democrat and didn't stay as an independent? Look at what's happening now that he did. If he has ran as an independent (as his ideology would dictate), he would have been marginalized. But, because of what he did we are now seeing sweeping change in the Dems.

If you want to make practical changes, you have to be pragmatic. </TEXT>

I was sitting at the table. We had finished dinner. Were now having dessert. And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that youve ever seen, and President Xi was enjoying it, Trump recalled in an interview with Fox News Business host Maria Bartiromo that aired on Wednesday.

And I was given the message from the generals that the ships are locked and loaded, what do you do? Trump went on. And we made a determination to do it, so the missiles were on the way. And I said, Mr. President, let me explain something to you.
So what happens is, I said, Weve just launched 59 missiles heading to **Iraq** and I wanted you to know this. And he was eating his cake. And he was silent, Trump added.

Yes. Heading toward Syria, Trump affirmed. And I want you to know that, because I didnt want him to go home. We were almost finished. It was a full day in Palm Beach. Were almost finished, and I  what does he do, finish his dessert and go home and then they say, You know, the guy you just had dinner with just attacked a country?

How did he react? Bartiromo asked.

So he paused for 10 seconds and then he asked the interpreter to please say it again. I didnt think that was a good sign, Trump said. And he said to me, Anybody that uses gases ... but anybody that was so brutal and uses gases to do that young children and babies, its OK.

He was OK with it. He was OK, Trump added. </TEXT>

Regardless:

If you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the Judeo-Christian West and its tenets, oftentimes, particularly when you deal with the elites, youre looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength. But I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was  and we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them  we have to face a very unpleasant fact. And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war thats already global. -Bannon

I mean, we can disagree on terminology of what constitutes a big "C" Crusade. But, he is saying he is expecting a "major war" in "defense of the Judeo-Christian West and its tenets." </TEXT>

Its important to note, however, that most high-paying **jobs available to high school grads involve skill sets that require extensive post-secondary training or several-years worth of prior experience,** and are often in fields that have seen **declining employment** in recent years.

But, you don't feel this is true for a *trained* labor force? As in, you feel high school is all the training a labor force in 2017 needs to facilitate the economy? 

You should have health insurance. Should the state be responsible for someone who eats themselves into obesity and then has to spend lots of money dealing with their obesity related diseases?

By "should" do you mean that the state should provide it? (within certain bounds, like your example?) Or that people should buy the product of health insurance? Like people 'should' buy soap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Universities are specialized schools. Why should my taxes go to some idiot that wants to take a major in ancient greek economics with a double minor in interpretive dance and aura reading.

Why should your tax dollars go to a road you'll never drive on, or a policeman you'll never see, or a military?

I am happy for my taxes to go to general education, to teach people the basics but then they need to figure out the rest on their own. It's called personal responsibility.

Is getting cancer also part of "personal responsibility?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are universities also schools? Is wanting to put medicine in with the police, roads, and school bad? Should a government that runs the roads, schools, and police also help the sick? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is Bernie Sanders also confused as what he is? Is the "Socialist" parties of England and France also misapplying the term? What is the point of the word if it doesn't actually describe any country or group? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I *asked* if the USSR was or wasn't.

And, based on this discussion, I think I was only talking about the work-ability of "socialized programs," not what you are calling "Socialism." I also think that the person in the OP's video is only talking about "socialized programs," not Totalitarianism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I am getting more confused. How can there be no 'real socialist countries?' You said you came from a socialist country, didn't you?

I was born and lived in a socialist country.

What did you mean? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's the difference between that an Fascism? [North Korea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea) is normally classified as a Totalitarian State, for example. Yet, I often hear France is 'Socialist.'

What's the difference between what you are describing and Totalitarianism? In my confused mind, it sounds more like Fascism. </TEXT>
