	<TEXT> But it does specifically have the text saying that it's attack and health values can be changed, so if the health is "changed to 0" somehow it might die. If Aegis every became a serious enough problem for Cygames for have to print counters, the counters would focus on that weakness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Came here to say this, I think this is what their eventual goal is. Naturally it will take some time to create that many PvE encounters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In fairness there are no doubt many people who don't realise how shady G2A is. But those who don't care about industry ethics as long as their games are cheaper should really think about what they're doing.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Doing nothing would have just confirmed their guilt. It's a typical PR statement that a lot of uninformed people eat up because things were presented in a way that "seemed reasonable" (informed people will often see through it mind you). Wording can be make or break in marketing and saving face </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe that Auctioneer is still limiting design space in Rogue a bit more than reasonable. I do think it's great that they actually need to use synergies to be effective rather than broken cards.

	<TEXT> I think it's interesting they called it Anyfin can happen, when the normal reason for playing the card is not so that anything can happen, but rather a particular OTK that the deck is built for will happen every time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that the rogue reward makes sense in paladin, but Galvadon isn't all that flavourful for rogues with the current adapts, but yeah if he was in Rogue he should have a strong battlecry that benefits from bouncing, maybe adapt all your minions three times? Works with stealth minions so you're guaranteed a board when your turn comes around, and synergises with bouncing due to the powerful battlecry.

Edit: That battlecry would probably be broken in Rogue, but you get the idea. </TEXT>
