	<TEXT> Homer, but I think Seahawks are going to lead the NFL this year, or at least try. Everything Pete and John have done recently lends itself to that idea. We are currently sitting at 13 RBs on our roster, including a top-3 of Lacy, Rawls, and Procise.  We picked up Pocic in the draft, who was a great run-blocker for LSU. I think there is a decent chance we go back to our bread and butter, if they can get the O-Line somewhat better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly it's a lot more than just THC level. Taste is a big one as well, as more expensive strains usually have more terpenes. More expensive strains are usually much less harsh on your throat and lungs too, and will generally burn easier. If I roll a joint with cheap weed it goes out more than the expensive stuff. Same with pipes.  </TEXT>

All of these questions can lead to good and bad products, even in one single strain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so since I've enjoyed edibles, err, quite a bit, I can help you out.

First off, most edibles are candy, mints, or baked items (cookies, etc). Not all, but a good bit. The reason for that comes from a few different places. The first is that candies are easy to make with cannabis infused. One of the easiest ways to prep cannabis for edibles is making an oil or butter, and since so many candies and treats use these two ingredients, it's an easy jumping off point. A second reason is that weed can have a powerful flavor, so the sweetness of the treat can balance it out. 

So, the next logical step past just these treats is to use it in actual cooking, like in this video. This is where it gets really interesting. One of the basics of cannabis is that there are a ton of different strains. A lot of these strains have much different effects from one another. They also have different flavors. For beginners it's a bit difficult to pick out flavors, but they are definitely there. 

**Much like how certain alcohols are used in cooking and provide certain flavours, did the cannabis also provide a different flavour/aroma/sense to each dish?**

If you use these different strains in different dishes, you can absolutely impact the dish in different ways. One of my favorite strains I ever had was a Mango Kush. It naturally tasted pretty good (although I'm "seasoned" a bit, and can taste the flavors underneath easier, kinda like Wine). I would have loved to use it in a fruit based dessert. 

Now here's the problem though. As I mentioned before, cannabis has a pretty strong flavor in cooking, especially for beginners. Imagine never trying cilantro in your life, then finding it in a cookie. It absolutely changes the flavor of a dish, it's just up to the chef on deciding the best way to use it.

**Were there different dishes that brought out different aspects of the cannabis that would otherwise go unnoticed if simply smoked in a joint?**

Well, sort of. If you take one strain, and use it in all the different ways of consuming it, you will absolutely notice different things. With Mango Kush as an example, while smoking regularly I might notice that it's relatively smooth, and the smoke isn't as harsh. If I use it in my Wax pen I can really taste the mango flavor. In an edible, you can definitely highlight the flavors of the strain, especially if you pair it well. 

**What other side effects were there from consuming the cannabis in such a prepared manner?**

Okay so this is where you can go really in depth, and it's also where chefs have to be really careful if they are cooking like this. I live in a "legal" state, and I can go to the store and by edibles. By law, these edibles must list how much THC is inside them, generally it's 10mg per cookie or mint. Now with 10mg, my mom will eat one and be good the rest of the night, while I would need 3 or 4 to have a really good night. 

The problem with this comes from time-to-activation. When you smoke a joint, you will usually feel the high within 10 minutes. But with edibles, you have no idea. Depending on how big you are, how much food is in your stomach, and how experienced you are, it could take anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours. 

You have no idea how many times I've seen somebody eat their first edible, say it's not working eating, eat 1/2/3 more, and later on regret everything. That's why a chef would have to kind of hedge their bets against this, potentially by letting people choose how experienced they are, and preparing the dishes accordingly.

Aside from this issue, you have the different effects from different strains. And to give you an idea of how this impacts people, I'll just lay it out how I would plan a meal like this in my head. 

I would first start with an early appetizer, and pair it with a strain that I know sets up the person for the rest of the night. There are two main categories to choose from, Indica and Sativa, and a bunch of hybrids that combine the two. Sativa heavy strains are good for physical activity and keeping you up and active. Indica are more "heavy-head" strains, and are good when you know you have nowhere to go and want to sit and enjoy a movie, music, etc. 

So in the case of the appetizer, I would definitely go with a Sativa heavy. From there, I would look at the various Sativa strains, and find some that have effects I want. Since it's early, I would avoid anything that is know for being too giggly. Alternatively, I would look for something that makes people more "euphoric" and out-going. 

You can kinda see how theses choice could apply to the rest of the dinner and all that. Hopefully this is a good primer, and please let me know if you have any other questions! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted this before as an idea for a full Minecraft Let's Play, but it could work under the King series too:

---

The Tri-Wizard Tournament

Recreating the Harry Potter Tri-Wizard Tournament, except instead of a big Goblet the final goal is to mine the Tower of Pimps.

The first task emulates the dragon task in Harry Potter. A large Obsidian Pit is made, with viewing areas on the side. One side of the pit is the entrance, the other side has a small raised area with a chest. Between the two sides is a Wither. The chest contains some regular apples, plus one golden apple (Withers love apples). Lowest time to steal the Golden Apple wins.

To mix it up a bit, and make it more like the Harry Potter Experience, each contestant will draw before the match to choose the Wither's assistants. This will be something like three skeltons, three creepers, three zombies, or something else. Just something to make that much harder.

The second task is the lake task. There will be a large lake, and the bottom will be covered in chests. For each contestant, one single chest will hold a block of wool that is their assigned color. They need to find that block and bring it to the surface. Once again lowest time wins.

The final third task will of course be the maze. The person with the best time of the first two tasks goes first, and so on. They will be armed with an iron sword and a diamond pickax. The maze should be dark and full of terrors - like zombies and spiders. First to find the Tower of Pimps and the center, mine it, and bring it to the judge on the outside is the winner.

If you die you have to restart from the outside of the maze. </TEXT>

I do know parts of the Spokane River are closed right now, including potentially the area you like, so you can ask them about that too. 

Also, if you do fish the Spokane River in that area, it's probably best not to eat the fish. They say one serving a month, but in my opinion I don't care enough about eating the fish from there to risk it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't necessarily agree that NK reached a critical stage, but he has a point. NKs previous missile and nuclear tests were all building block or proof-of-concept style tests, at least as far as public knowledge goes. They proved the stuff can work in theory, so the logical next step is the refinement stage. 

With this new stage, NK would be attempting to refine their nukes and refine their missiles to do better. We have already seen this with them claiming to both have hydrogen bombs, and miniaturized nukes. Even if these claims are doubtful, there is no doubt they are still working towards it.  

In the missile refinement stage, their recent military parades and missile tests show that they are now working on missiles that have maneuverability in the terminal phase. Although they have apparently yet to succeed, this is one of those things that makes defending against them that much harder. 

So, at least to me, there is a critical point in North Korea. That point is whenever they can take all these tests and displays, and make them actually usable in warfare. While they may not be there yet, a lot of experts seems to think they are getting there quick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Didn't you see the newest season of Dancing with the Stars? To boost ratings, they added a Q A section, whereupon the contestants are judged on their response to questions like the following:

 - What do you see as the biggest issue facing small business owners in today's economy?

 - What are some ways smaller film/tv/online productions can mitigate a sudden drop in ad revenue?

 - What are the socio-economic effects of an island nation allowing foreign fishing corporations to utilize their territorial waters?

The joke comes from the fact that the "regular" contestants will generally be prepared for these questions, while the pros will not and will usually "dance-around" the question at hand. 

Ratings overall are still dropping, but the show has seen a massive influx of new viewers aged 60+.

Edit: I have no idea where the fuck I was going with this comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dichotomy between the two articles on the sub right now is kinda funny. One is trying to say we don't need a stamp of approval from anyone, while the other lists reasons why we're so "hip". Nothing against this writer, but I think Spokane should aim for it's own, unique identity.

While some people like to make fun of it, or make their own ("Spokane doesn't suck"), our city motto is a good jumping off point. We don't have stuff that other cities have, *because* we have stuff that other cities don't have. 

We have 5 ski resorts within a two hour drive. We have a river running through the city that is both breathtaking and float-able in different spots. There are 17 fishable lakes within the county alone. Incredible hikes are within walking distance of downtown.

I just think some people are looking in the wrong direction for Spokane. We don't need to be a follower, when we are already a trailblazer. If we try and follow the cookie cutter mold of a big city, then we lose our identity overall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This shows a fundamental misunderstanding of MAD doctrine. MAD came about because the US and USSR could theoretically destroy the entire world with their nuclear weapons. North Korea is nowhere near that capability yet, and I would argue that the goal for the US and our allies, plus China, is to never let them get close. 

However this mismatch in number of weapons means that NK and Kim require a completely different doctrine, different than we have used before. Their apparent willingness to use weapons of mass destruction (the VX assassination), combined with rapid development of miniaturized nuclear weapons puts the world in a spot it hasn't been in before. 

People keep trying to assign old Cold War roles to North Korea, when it should be evident that they are a different beast entirely.  </TEXT>

Alternatively, maybe this isn't a bubble, and these openings are in response to the population growth and average age of the city dropping (I think). I guess it's hard to say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everybody. My family and I are looking into putting a game we invented on Kickstarter in the somewhat-near future. To give you a quick rundown, it is a Golf/Putting game, played on a fake grass surface that will be marked with lines, circles, and labels.

With this surface, we have a set of rules that are simple, but unique to the game itself. As far as I can find, there are no other games that have rules like this, but it's also simple enough that we can explain it to somebody knew within minutes.

Before we publish to Kickstarter, we would like protect our work so, in the unlikely event it become truly popular, we have protection from people stealing the idea. 

From my research, I believe that I would need to file for two different protections. A design patent for the gaming surface, and a copyright for the rules (plus a Trademark for whatever name we come up with). Is this correct? Can somebody let me know what I should do instead if it is incorrect?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it would be cool if they invested in LED lights for the existing stuff. The Pavillion could have LED light strings going up to the top along the wires already there. Then they could light up the gondola cars too and make them all pretty.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I kinda cringe at the money the council spends sometimes, I think this would be a good idea. If we built a Ferris Wheel that matched the Pavillion (and added more lights to the Pavilion overall), it would be a great addition to Spokane's skyline, and definitely could be used in marketing for the city.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kinda understand what you are talking about, but I think you're seeing it from the wrong perspective. The news is letting people know that it may not be safe to go on the trail right now, or that women should at least go on the trail in the company of others, not alone. While you may not see this as a big deal, I'm guessing it's very traumatic for any woman it happens to. 

Also, come on, you have no idea how big this guy is, if he had any weapons, or anything like that. You can't seriously think these women should try to fight the random guy going around slapping asses, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally baseball taps happen between guys that know each other, in a place where it is accepted. Equating a random guy slapping girl's asses in public to baseball slap-ass is ridiculous almost to the point hilarity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For sure. In fact they even said him and Aleks don't get any money from Cow Chop, despite starting it, as they want all of the money to go to the channel and their friends they work with. 

And no harm! Their humor definitely isn't for everyone, I just wanted to make sure nobody would get the wrong impression of James from this video alone. As a comparison, it would be like calling Michael a dick based on Rage Quit alone (which almost all of us know is false).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you don't watch more of their content, please try to watch some more videos from James. He really is a nice guy, and it would suck if your entire opinion of him is based on this one episode of On The Spot. I think his Twitch has old broadcasts that you could try?

But yeah, if you didn't like this episode you probably wouldn't like Cow Chop as a whole. Their humor is based on stuff like this, RT knew what they were doing when they brought them on this show.  </TEXT>
