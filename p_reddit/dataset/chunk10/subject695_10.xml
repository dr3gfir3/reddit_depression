I hate seeing this circle jerk everytime that all chocolate is garbage in the U.S. There's quality chocolate available, if you are willing to pay for it. If you want to be cheap, you get cheap shit.

Edit: Also, this reminds me of Europeans claiming American beer is terrible because they drank Budweiser or Coors.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, another factor could have been Michael Bloomberg running as an independent if Bernie got the Dem nomination. Bloomberg only decided not to run because he's fond of Hillary and she was moderate enough for him to not be relevant. I'm pondering an alternate world where a lot of centrist and moderate Democrats would have flocked to him in the general to still cause Trump to win. We very well could be stuck with Trump no matter who the Democratic nominee was.  </TEXT>
