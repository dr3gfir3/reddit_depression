	<TEXT> Actually since posting this, I did a little research on the YouTubes and you know what? Lionheart's not too shabby, and Call to Arms is pretty good. I'll have to dig deeper into the post-2000 catalog. Glad I listened. Another thing, is that their mid- to late-80s sub-Def Leppard balladry is, for what it is, not awful. I mean, I can't listen to that stuff for more than two or three tracks at a time, but I guess I do have a soft spot for it, god help me. My opinion of this band seems to be consistently going up.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Saxon is important to me. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-09 00:35:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I discovered Saxon late.

I was 25 before I bought my first Saxon LP. That's nearly ten years past. I'd heard the name before, possibly while flipping through an uncle's record collection, or maybe from watching one of VH1's *super-fuckin-saucy* retrospective mish-moshes. Who knows. I'm more of a casual metal fan, as it represents, maybe, 10-15% of my musical diet? Big on Sabbath and the other '70s heavies, NWOBHM, early thrash and that stoner/sludge/doom/desert business... but that's the extent of it. I never ventured too far in the Byzantine world of so-called extreme metal. Maybe just a pinch, a *sprinkle* of Meshuggah, but, like, whatever.

Anyway, Saxon... fuckin' A. They may look like a "beer soaked pub dart club," and decidedly un-metal, but I'm not one for fashion. But the sound, the *sound,* brothers and sisters, is what pulled me in. They sound like my mind's nostalgic  representation of a heavy early '80s metal outfit (I'm only referring to 1979-1984 Saxon, as I can't get into their more recent stuff and don't want to get into their mid-period). After two decades of trying to process all the music that's been part of me, whether it be Maiden/Priest/Lizzy twin-guitar attack or the NES Bionic Commando level where Joe's in the sewer and those blobs come out of the drains  and he has to grapple the ceiling with his *Bionic* arm and the music's all like dun-nuh-nuuhhhhh...dun-nuh-nuh-nuhhhhhh ( you know the one), my inner self has printed me a report and it reads "for fuck's sake, put the kids to bed and have a beer or ten and listen to Saxon." And godammit I comply.

As I sit here being figuratively pseudo-pummeled with some of the finest riffs that  South Yorkshire ever produced, I can't help but wish that it wasn't my dad who had a big, white trash trailer 'stache and knee-high socks with the blue strip on the calf, but *me*, as I might have had the chance to experience Saxon in real time, as the albums were released. I would have loved to comment on my neighbor's cousin's T-top Trans Am as he peeled out of the Dairy Queen parking lot while simultaneously soaking my girlfriend's basement, all the while slowly nodding my head in agreement to the stylings of "See the Light Shining" or perhaps "Never Surrender." I''ve launched myself into dreamland many-a night thinking of this. 

Please forgive me, as English *is* my first language, but can you forgive the face melting guitar of " Street Fighting Gang?" Don't think so, bro. 

For your benefit, I beg you to listen to more of this and get back to that early '80s nostalgic haze that calls you, even when you're not entirely sure you were ever there. 

My brain's dry now, besos y abrazos. </TEXT>
