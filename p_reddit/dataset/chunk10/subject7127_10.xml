	<TEXT> My Personal notes:

1-The dough making is time consuming but the results are worth it as the buns are light, fluffy and not too sweet.

2- served with fried food to compensate their lack of texture.

3- I used Fuku's recipe for pickles.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I tried to link but it does not appear here for some reason. It is from BBCGoodFood and the post title is "Steamed bao buns"

Ingredients

525g plain flour, plus extra for dusting

1 tbsp caster sugar, plus a pinch

1 tsp fast-action dried yeast

50ml milk

1 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing and brushing

1 tbsp rice vinegar

1 tsp baking powder

1-Mix together the flour, sugar and 1/2 tsp salt in a large bowl (see tip). Dissolve the yeast and a pinch of salt in 1 tbsp warm water, then add it to the flour with the milk, oil, vinegar and 200ml water. Mix into a dough, adding a little extra water if needed.

2-Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 10-15 mins, or until smooth. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth and leave to rise for 2 hrs, or until doubled in size.
Tip the dough out onto a clean work surface and punch it down. Flatten the dough with your hands, then sprinkle over the baking powder and knead for 5 mins.

3-Roll out the dough into a long sausage shape, about 3cm thick, then cut into pieces that are about 3cm wide  you should have 18.

4-In the palm of your hand, roll each piece of dough into a ball and leave to rest for 2-3 mins.
Use a rolling pin to roll out each ball, one by one, into an oval shape about 3-4mm thick. Rub the surface of the dough ovals with oil and brush a little oil over a chopstick.

5-Place the oiled chopstick in the centre of each oval. Fold the dough over the chopstick, then slowly pull out the chopstick.

6-Transfer the prepared buns to a baking tray lined with baking parchment, cover with a clean tea towel or lightly oiled cling film and leave to prove in a warm place for 1 hr 30 mins, or until doubled in size.

7-Heat a large steamer over a medium-high heat. Steam the buns for 8 mins until puffed up (youll need to do this in batches). Prise open each bun and fill with the barbecue pork and Pickled carrot   mooli. Eat while theyre still warm.

Chicken sandwich=batter fried chicken+round bun

Chicken burger=ground chicken+round bun

Fish sandwich=batter fried fish+round bun

Fish burger=ground fish+round bun

Veggie burger=ground veggies+round bun

Rule of thumb: not everything served in round buns is a burger.

ground meat+long bun= What is your problem? make a meatball sandwich instead.

chopped meat+long bun=Welcome to Philly

	<TEXT> There are many things to try in Hoboken and the other side of Hudson river. If your first time here, I would recommend trying classic slices from Joe's, Grimaldis, Patsy's, Artichoke any many others. Tony Baloney's does very modern slices which some old school NYers hate. I actually love them!
I hope you found this useful and honest.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you love it given that you have not lived there? It is a difficult city to live in. It is dirty, expensive and crowded. You can't park your car, won't have many grocery shopping options and most of the time you will realize that many people have already queued up for an event you are interested in attending. But in the end, there is nowhere quite like it!  </TEXT>
