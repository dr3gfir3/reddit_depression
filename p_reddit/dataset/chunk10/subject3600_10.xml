	<TEXT> You can help me. Please. Hear me out. It's the only way to save us all.

[They targeted the most vulnerable.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted) They gave it five days, but it only took one. One day to feed the masses nanites disguised as pixie stick sugar atop a sugary concoction, the sour topping hiding the metallic tang, though the mango flavor probably helped.

The population was infected, and they didn't know it. Yet.

But I would make sure to save humanity even if I had to eradicate every last unicorn-infested person myself.

Damn Starbucks, damn it to hell.

The Northstar Initiative wasn't what they promised. A pledge to return to Seattle roots and simplify the menu sounds great until you realize how they planned to accomplish that. Brain washing customers with an infection of microscopic brain bugs so people would only want the original menu?! Devious. Evil. I pledged to save you all.

Not that I don't prefer plain coffee, but mind control is heinous.

It took me a while to realize it, but with extensive research to unravel the web Starbucks had woven, it became so clear.

The Unicorn Frappuccino was a mind control scheme hidden behind the Northstar Initiative. Starbucks must be stopped. It must all be stopped.

My first rescue attempt was a young woman I knew from work. She had posted a selfie while drinking the Frap on Instagram. I had to help her. Jessica didn't deserve to be mind controlled. No one did.

She protested when I took her from the parking garage at our office, but soon I'd have her back to normal.

I'd prepared the spare room. Blocks of foam and plastic wrap. Sanitized blades and styptic powder. Bandages and morphine.

I'd untwist the monster from her spinal column. I would save her.

It took long hours. She stopped screaming twenty minutes after the first incision, the brain-controlling nanomachines paralyzing her.

It was for the best. I had to dig deep into her neck. I can only imagine the pain she'd have felt if Jess remained conscious.

But all my extensive research and knowledge couldn't make up for human biology and the super powered nano-bugs invented by someone much smarter than me.

Jessica shuddered to a halt before I could remove the infection.

I laid her to rest in my backyard and pledged to try again and again until I saved everyone.

The cops had other plans. The camera in the parking garage and the fresh turned earth in my backyard has spelled out my doom in the form of an APB aired over the radio while I was taking my next rescue. They swept through my house, finding the sound-proofed and bloody room, and Jessica's ruined body.

I'll hole up in this motorcourt hotel, and try to save more, but I may be stopped before I can achieve my goals. That's where you come in.

Before they find me, I wanted to warn you all. Finish what I tried to start. Save the world. [Save yourself!](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Death took my time a lot differently than I thought she would.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/560k6z/things_my_grandmother_taught_me/) And I didnt understand until recently.

As a child, my dreams were strange, but the absolute weirdest of them were the nights I walked empty hallways, museums, malls, and streets. I would travel along alone, shuffling through different venues until the air would grow cold, and my breath became visible in the chill.

I would know they were coming, and Id fall to the ground, to my knees, and tuck my head into my arms, cannonball style, so that all I could see would be a small amount of the ground around me. Thats when they would come; a multitude of people walking by, some slow, others in a hurry, all different. I could only see the shoes, their ankles or hemlines. Some wore boots, heels, flats, tennis shoes, all in various stages of wear.

I didnt know who they were, but as long as I stayed tucked into the ground, they continued past. No one stopped to ask a little girl what she was doing.

Now I know, I was was walking the dead road.

Waves of people streamed past me. At times, Id try to count, but the dream world doesnt work in order, so Id quickly drift off, or lose track.

Feet would shuffle along, and while I was curious about the faces of those passing me by, I somehow knew looking would bring ruin as I would be forced join their trek.

I acted as a beacon, lighting the purgatory, until enough souls found my light and followed.

Where I fell, just beyond a door would open, and they would trudge past to the ever after.

As a child, burrowed into my knees, daring peeks of shoes, and little else, these dreams were oddly terrifying. Alone, surrounded by walkers that I was too afraid to look at, I only buried my head deeper and waited for the multitudes to pass.

Sometimes my entire night would be eaten by these travelers, while other dreams were short, only a dozen or so shoes.

These night time adventures eventually faded some years after they began.

I didnt miss the dreams, almost didnt notice when they stopped, and as such, I cannot pinpoint the exact date of their disappearance.

Im only reminded now of them, because these dreams are back.

Last night, I walked an empty aquarium. The tanks held water, rocks, and myriad decorations, but no life swam behind the glass, and no people milled around to see the displays.

I was alone with the blue lights and dark corners.

It was silent, no buzzing of electricity, no music, no sound.

I walked in a vacuum, turning corners, passing through the trails, and by the merch stands. Not a soul could I find.

And then the air grew cold.

At twenty-seven, curling into a ball seems harder than when I was young. Theres more of me to compress.

Sitting and dragging my knees to my face, I wrapped my arms around my head and dared to peek at what came by me.

Droves and droves and droves of people, footsteps thunderous in the silence, echoing off the too-still water, reverberating along the empty paths.

They flocked to me, a glowing guide in the dim blue aquarium light. I felt like there was a backlog of people rushing by me, as if all the years I escaped this dream left stranded the people who passed me now.

The door opened beyond me, and they surged through. Hours passed or so it felt, before the crowd lessened. I saw a pair of Martens step by, and then it fell silent again.

In the emptiness, silk brushed skin, the noise of it deafening. I felt a tug on my arm, and saw little feet in ballet slippers with pink tights. I dared not look, but the child persisted, pulling my arm up and forward. My eyes shut tight, I let myself be dragged me to my feet. The little dancer giggled, and the hair on my neck stood, but still I dared not look.

Delicate fingers gripped my wrist, leading me forward. I felt the light of the door as we drew closer.

No, I choked out. No.

A child shouldnt have so much strength. She pulled me into the light, and the ground fell from my feet.

Long moments passed before I landed in what felt like a grassy expanse. I felt around, but found no other person. Opening one eye, and then the other, I took in the empty field I stood in. Wild flowers grew numerous for miles. The sun was warm overhead.

And before me, Death stood once more. Her smile dripped over her lips, as her inky eyes took me in. Her wings were neatly tucked away, the pinions lost in the tall grass. She beckoned with a hand to me. 

I shook my head. Youve taken your years in my dreams. I owe you nothing else.

Death bared teeth, the smile growing to swallow me. You pledged three years, and time does not pass truly in dreams. I have made of you a reaper, now and always, and your service will stretch across your life. Will you serve me willingly?

You will take no more than I promised. I wish to wake in my bed.

Death laughed, sandpaper on concrete. You will walk the dead road each month, whether you will it or not, and I will have my souls. Youll find peace when youre finally mine. Such is a reapers tale, and so it will be for you.

The sheets were damp with sweat and twisted when I woke, the pillows on the floor, and the dog relegated to his own bed because of my thrashing.

If Death spoke true, the time I owe will never pass, and I will walk the souls to the after for the rest of my life.

So long as I do not look, I will not join them. But the urge grows.

And everyone walks the dead road sooner or later. I will see your shoes as they pass me, when it is your time. Follow the beacon, and pass quietly. [I have no wish to join you yet.](https://www.facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Haunted Fridge for Sale </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-18 14:24:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [I knew better than to buy a used fridge.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted/) Used things hardly ever work, ya know? But I was a bit desperate. Buying the house itself was so last minute, but my lease was coming up and my dog deserved a fenced yard and God knows interest rates are only going up, so I did it.

The other appliances came with the house, and the seller didnt say why the fridge was missing, and after the price I got, I didnt really care.

But moving broke me and I grabbed a deal of a used fridge off C.List. $85 and it was stainless steel? Hell yeah.

Never again.

I set up a house camera after moving in, because Im a woman living alone. The footage off of it comes free with the fridge purchase. Maybe youll get famous, or maybe Fridge Freddy will eat you. Who knows? Hope your okay with either option. Free ghost with fridge.

One big draw of this house other than the half acre of land was the already installed doggy door leading into a privacy fenced back yard. Id suggest easy yard access if you take my fridge.

I showed the pup how to work the doggy door once and he spent the next three hours bounding in and out. Fridge Freddy must have been listening too, because he got the hang of it rather quickly.

Three days later I came home from work and the dog had peed in the hallway. It took a leash and going out the front door to get him to to leave the hallway at all. His hair stood up along his spine and his head hung low as we neared the living room. He hugged the wall and darted out of the house once I opened the door. Across the space, the kitchen seemed ominous.

After the pup had done his business and was tucked safely under my bed, I investigated the doggy door.

It wasnt stuck or broken and I saw no indication the pup had gotten caught in it, which would have been a legitimate explanation for his fear, as one time a baby gate had fallen on him as hed tried to get past it and for the rest of his days he was terrified of those gates.

The only thing out of whack was the black mud along the tiles and on the porch. I assumed doggo had dragged the mess in with him, but the sludge ended very close to the door and no paw prints led away into the house.

Great, I thought, the home inspector missed something. But dragging the ladder out and investigating the doorway and vents near it turned up nothing. Even crawling into the attic and onto the roof gave me no answers or leaks. Wherever the mess came from, it was outside.

I cleaned the sludge up and had to throw out the towels I used due to horrible stains. Not that I mind stained towels as scrap rags, but the black mud looked uncomfortably like faces howling.

Upon that realization, I cleared the house with sage and incense and double checked the Nest cam. Again, nothing.

A week went by of me having to leash walk the dog out the front door (defeating the purpose of buying a house with a backyard) before I got angry. The sludge turned up three more times and I had to buy more towels.  The dog curled up in the hallway as I cooked dinner each night and whined every time I touched the fridge. Finally, Id had enough.

Retraining the pup was tough. It took boiled chicken bits and bacon fat to get him comfy with being near the kitchen. I even moved his food to the kitchen, but hed rush to take huge mouthfuls of kibble and carry it to the hallway, where hed drop it and then eat it slowly. I got tired of the mess and moved his food back to the living room.

I kept an eye on the Nest cam but the camera blinked anytime the sludge appeared and  I started to think I had an extreme haunting on my house. I was right.

Oh, hey, by the way, Id just bought groceries before I stopped using the fridge so you get all that food when you pick up it up. I mean, technically, the fridge still works, theres just a sludge making monster trapped in it, so I cant really say its fully operational, ya know?

Fridge Freddy seemed to sense when I realized his presence was a haunt. Long hours on the camera were blacked out, and when the camera did work, Freddy would pick the best times to pop his howling stretched face into view suddenly, guaranteeing I jumped, screeched, and threw my phone in terror. (The Nest app works great, though. You can check in anytime.)

Freddy was a fright, His face was paper white with a grey tint and his mouth and eyes were black holes. I spent a long time getting scared by it, so I have his features memorized. If your ghostly presence requires a nose, Freddys not for you.

After he started haunting the camera, the instances of sludge increased, but I never saw where Freddy came from nor where he went in the house.

He oozed back in, spreading his mess around, and then hed jump to the camera frame, face stretched in a scream. I was kinda glad the camera muted sound.

Banishing didnt work. Freddy didnt answer to the priest, pastor, minister, or rabbi I brought in. He ignored both the High Priestess and the twelve sisters she had help her.

But he also didnt leave the kitchen unless it was through the doggy door. At my wits end and out of towels, I sprayed the door down with a mix of Windex and holy water. It worked, sort of.

Freddy woke me up that night screeching by the side of my bed. The dog and I slept in the bathtub after that, holy water spray bottle held close, and the door locked.

Freddy stopped screeching and trying to get into the bathroom somewhere around four AM. From the sludge under my bedroom window, and down the hallway, I could guess where he went. I briefly considered burning the house down, but then I just got mad.

You come into my home?!

After the bathroom incident, my dog refused to leave my side when I was home. As I cooked dinner, two days later (after cleaning up the largest sludge mess yet) the pup stood between the fridge and me. Leaning against my leg with his great bulk, he sniffed the air and then without real reason started licking the stainless steel of the fridge.

I ignored it at first, but five minutes later, he was still trying to eat the fridge. It took chasing him from the kitchen and blocking entry with the aforementioned baby gate to keep him out.

Anytime in the next few days that he managed to sneak into the kitchen, he was back to the fridge, lapping away. I started to wonder.

This whole haunting had taken over my life. I mean other than the mess, the fright night, and the camera blocking, Freddy wasnt really a problem, until my groceries began to vanish. That was like Fridge Freddy declaring war. The holy water Windex kept him out, and it also proved able to keep him in.

I douse the appliance daily now. It rocks constantly, Freddy bouncing around the shelves inside. The tie-downs keep the fridge shut tight and the holy water keeps him from seeping out the seems. I can only imagine the mess hes left inside. Maybe you wont want those groceries after all. Hes probably ate them all anyway.

So...you have the story: Haunted Fridge for Sale! Kinda nonworking, good for parts. [Ghost included for free.](http://facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Mother was Mischievous </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-15 15:00:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [My mother was mischievous](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted) and the oldest of four. In a different time, her mother, Mary, thought nothing of leaving the eldest, at five years old, home alone to babysit the others.

Kids are perceptible to many things. When my maternal great-grandmother passed away, the kids quickly spotted her trailing along behind her husband. I doubt anyone believed my mother and her siblings, but it didnt change the fact that Granny haunted her husband until he too passed. At the funeral, the two dead lovebirds strolled hand-in-hand from the cemetery, winging their way in the great hereafter. 

The gift of seeing the Other passes easily down the line and comes at me from both sides of the family. It is a sense Ive spent many hours meditating on to make stronger.

My mother needed no such practice. At a young age, she could see much and it was while babysitting both siblings and cousins that her sixth sense proved life saving.

...

Why was Susie so annoying? All day shed been prodding and aggravating the other kids, and itd taken all of my mothers patience not to rear back and smack Susie. Now the girl was baiting one of the toddlers, dangling a pacifier just out of reach and making the kid squall.

Fed up, my mother slapped the binky from from Susies hand.

Ow! Youre mean! Susie cried out, before fleeing into the kitchen. My mother followed.

Why cant you just behave? my mother asked.

Im behaving just fine! Youre the bad one, Susie taunted back. She reached out and knocked a glass from the counter.

In front of my mother, time slowed as the cup shattered on the floor.

Thats it! my mother yelled, as she jerked open a kitchen drawer and took out the large butcher knife. If you dont stop, Ill make you!

Susie stuck out her tongue and darted down the basement steps. In the other room, all the babies began to bawl. It only took a second for my mother to decide to follow Susie.

The basement was dark, only a little sun making its way through the tiny high up windows. Susie was crouched behind the single pillar, doing a poor job of hiding. My mother came toward her with the knife raised. She wouldnt hurt Susie, just scare her into minding.

High above Susie, my mom chopped at the wooden support, burying and blunting the butcher knife. Susie shrieked and darted up as my mom pulled the blade back and scraped Susies hand in the recoil. Three drops of blood fell crimson on the dark floor. My mother dropped the knife. 

From the shadows, black smoke billowed up from the concrete. It took the form of my grandmother Mary dressed in funeral clothes, and loomed over the naughty children.

My mother and Susie shrieked, knowing they were in trouble, caught literally red-handed in Susies case. She darted up the stairs and my mother followed, knife forgotten. The shape did not give chase.

As they rushed from the kitchen, the front door opened and my grandmother Mary came in with groceries. Im not sure what she made of the girls claims, but the knife made its way into the tallest cabinet, safely out of reach of any five year old babysitter, and Susie received a bandage for her cut. If I had to guess, the whippings were swift, and the story of the basement ghost ignored.

But maybe thats only because Mary had long forgotten her own ability to see. [Have you?](https://www.facebook.com/subject3600writing) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My grandmother tells stories </TITLE>

	<TEXT> [My Grandmother Tells Stories.](https://m.reddit.com/u/subject3600/activity?sort=hot activity=submitted)

My grandmother was a witch, of that I am certain. But I am much less sure of what happened to me in my seventh year. My grandmother tells stories, and my memory is gilded with time. What follows is the most true telling of the time I visited the Other, the In-Between.

I remember her washing dishes in the kitchen sink, suds and hot water everywhere. The sun was bright through the kitchen window, illuminating the lines on her face.

She looked at me as I dried plates. Joy-lee, she said in that frustrating way the paternal side of my family pronounces my first and middle names. (I divested of it quickly in fourth grade after my parents divorced. Joie, Id say. Just Joey.)

Joy-lee, she said, snapping me back to the past. Im gon show you what it is to work your own kinda magic.

Her husband was out in the field. The kitchen was safe for now.

I attended church with them every Sunday, and coming out of the chapel, she had seen me stumble. But I didnt fall. Instead, I floated momentarily off balance, before righting myself and replanting my feet firmly on the sidewalk. To her, it looked as if someone invisible had caught me mid-tumble. I had the magic of the family and it was time to learn how to wield it. No one else noticed, least of all her husband.

Untrained magic leads to disaster, and theres always something out there hungry for a power source. Especially for my family.

As she showed me how to charm the water to get the dishes extra clean, or how to heat the air around me to show my temper, or the simple shield we use to keep out intrusive thoughts, she also told me of the familys own Witch Eater.

One of my great-to-power-of-umph-grandmothers cursed a man, ages ago, so the story went. Maybe he deserved it, maybe he didnt. Trapped in the form of a shadowy dog-like beast, he couldnt tell us his side of the story. What he could do was consume souls and magic power to remain alive. And he had a hankerin for the women of my family. As long as we lived, so would he.

And I had to protect myself from him.

My grandmother, the one standing next to me in the kitchen, lost her dog to him years ago, and it may have been the only reason she lived through the encounter.

I keep a German Shepherd around now. It seems memory is strong in the WitchEater, because he doesnt bother me when my dog is near. Its also not a constant haunting, but the shadow is there most days, at the corner of my vision. A shaggy black dog beast, ready to feed.

It disappeared for a month once, and only returned after I got word that my cousin Samantha died in a house fire. All that was left of her and anything else had been ash, which, conveniently, is what you turn into when your magic is sucked dry.

After I mastered my shield, my grandmother seemed more comfortable with me running around alone with my magic.

Stay away from strange things, was the warning she gave me, anytime I wanted to dart off into the cornfield, or run around the catfish pond.

Im sure at no less than twenty different occasions she forbade me from petting stray dogs. But a child doesnt listen all the time, and to be honest, PUPPY! is still the first thought in my head at the sight of a dog.

Let me get to the meat of this story.

I was fishing alone on the bank of the pond, safely in sight of the kitchen window, when the grass rustled behind me. I had been teasing catfish onto my line with little shimmers under the water, and had a small bushel of fish already.

I didnt think much of whatever was behind me, since birds and squirrels and rabbits were a thing here in the country. But when its shadow fell across me, darkening the water and bringing with it a chill, I quickly turned.

The ferocious beast stood as tall as a man, its giant muzzle housing long fangs. More wolf than dog, and more monster than wolf, I blinked for a moment, before saying, Puppy! It seemed a little taken back by my response.

Across the pond, my grandmother was shouting. Time slowed down as I stood to greet the dog. He pressed forward and together we fell from the bank.

The pond shouldve been warm, it being mid-July and near 95 in Alabama. But as the frigid water engulfed me, I knew something was wrong.

On the bank all my grandmother found was a pile of ash.

Under the water, the pond was alive. I floated just above the sandy bottom. Sunlight dappled the ground, the water distorting it. I could breathe or maybe I didnt need to. There was no pressing weight on my chest.

Near me, the great shaggy dog sat, waiting patiently. I was in his grip now, and he had all the time in the world. My feet touched down on the grit and I made my way towards him.

From a long way off, I heard my grandmother cursing. When I got back, my hide was in for a tanning. If I got back

Where are we? I tried to ask, but only a large bubble left my mouth and floated slowly up.

The dog huffed and a bubble formed before his snout, before seeking its freedom far above.

As young as I was, I still knew enough about where I probably happened to be. the inbetween is just that, a place between life and the after. If thats where Id fallen, I wasnt dead yet. But the way you come in isnt the way you leave. As the dog turned and walked away from me, I followed.

Under the water, the land sloped down and grew darker. We werent alone. Many spirits trailed alongside us, in varying stages of decay. Souls dont rot as a body does, but those trapped in purgatory will fall to pieces if they never seek their next adventure. Faces leered at me, eyes too bright, mouths a gaping hole. Like hooks with bait and fish, I gleamed like bait to these poor things. The dog growled and most moved on. I had been claimed, and would be no ones ride back to the Living Realm.

The dog started walking and I followed. The land sloped into darker depths, and still we walked. Lost souls kept their distance, but they were following us. They couldnt help themselves.

The scenery grew more horrid, terrifyingly so. Large shapes swam along just out of focus, and always there was the grin of the dead, waiting on my guardian to leave me, before they pounced.

We came finally to two pedestals, with giant gemstones on top of both. One held an amethyst, cracked through with gold, and the other an onyx, silky black and perfect.

The dog spoke then, low and gravelly. Choose, lucky number thirteen. Choose power or choose to stay here. Either way, I feed.

What do you mean? I asked the puppy.

You are the strongest witch I will have ever devoured, the thirteenth witch of your line. Choose a stone, and accept your fate.

I want to go home.

Then choose power, and receive borrowed time. It all ends the same way, but mayhap youll do some good in your life first, with the gifted strength.

No! I want to go home! I yelled at the beast, and waves crashed with my voice. We were engulfed in water, and as he spoke again, a bubble formed from his muzzle. I threw myself into the words, and floated away from the pond floor.

My grandmother was waiting on the bank, too wise to think me really gone. She lifted me from the water and in one motion spanked my bottom and drew my soaking self in for a hug.

We didnt talk much of what happened. That was not her way. Instead, I strengthened my shield, and learned from her all I could, until I surpassed her in ability. We kept the thirteenth a secret. No one in the family needed a new reason to bother us for help.

But the abilities I carry are nothing to what waits upon my death.

	<TITLE> New Year's Resolutions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-03 20:01:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> God, I hate [resolutioners.](https://www.reddit.com/user/subject3600/submitted)

You know the type. (You may even be one of them.) They flock to bars on New Years Eve, shove down tons of drinks and potato skins by the pound, and then the next day, theyre a gym rat with kale smoothies. Inevitably, two weeks later, theyre back at the bar, resolutions forgotten.

And thats how the shadows feed. You cant see them, but youre the host anyway.

I was a resolutioner two years ago. I joined friends at a dive bar and we toasted our goals. I resolved to be nicer, my friends to join a gym. But when we clinked the glasses together, the shadows appeared.

I thought at first that a stray cat had slipped in. The creeping thing was the right size. But when the shadows came skittering through closed windows and from under the tables en masse, I knew they werent strays. They had too many legs.

My beer sloshed out as I jumped back, barely keeping a grip on the mug, but no one else reacted to the invasion.

An inky black form eyed me from the puddle of my drink. It was like a spider, sort of, with fangs bared, and ghostly blue pupils in each of the many eyes. It didnt hold its shape well. The legs kept blinking in and out of existence.

I wondered if my beer was spiked. How drunk was I? The other women around me werent reacting to the shadow tarantulas on and around our table.

My friends didnt notice when the creatures crept up and settled along the womens backs and between their shoulder blades, like evil arachnid scarves or backpacks.

The one in front of me hissed and when I slammed my beer mug down on it, the conversation around the table ceased.

What the hell? Mandy asked at my freak out. I mean, party foul at the spill, but whatd the table ever do to you?

The rest of the gals laughed. Under my mug, the spider dissipated.

From each of my friends backs, many eyes watched me.

So, workout buddies? Jess said to Mandy, returning to their previous conversation. Mandy turned back, one final look at me clearly showing she thought me too drunk to function.

As they planned out their new year, each of the spiders slowly sunk their fangs into the necks they hung around. The many legs tightened around their mounts. I felt panic rise.

Did my friends not feel the weight or the bite? Maybe I was drunk. I excused myself to the bathroom and called a cab. I missed the countdown and fell asleep that night with a can of Raid next to me.

Over the next few weeks, I saw more and more of thethings. And they were growing, getting bigger and more noticeable. Some dwarfed the human they rode on.  But then slowly, they began to vanish. People I saw regularly whod sported the spider riders no longer had their parasite. In mid-March, there was nearly no trace of the creatures any longer. Their disappearance gave me little peace. The beady eyes and long legs haunted my dreams. I developed arachnophobia with a fierceness.

Only Mandy and Jesss spiders didnt grow. Instead they shrank, limbs and bodies diminishing. In April they invited me to join them for an open gym day (a half-hearted effort to re-recruit drop off resolutioners and their friends.)

On the treadmill, as I lagged behind Jesss seven minute mile, the two women gushed about their new gym rat lifestyle and howd theyd definitely be sticking to it. At that moment, with their determination, the New Years spiders loosened their fangs and fell away, dispersing as they hit the ground.

And thats when I knew.

Not many people have seen my messages, posts, or speculations. No one else has seen the spiders, that Ive found.

It took two years to be sure, absolutely sure. Two years watching people make and break promises, and being a host to the parasites. Do you feel heavier after making a New Years resolution? Its because theres a literal weight on your back, your very own resolution parasite. The spider seems to feed on your hopes, fangs deep in the base of your neck. If you looked over your shoulder--really looked--youd see the eyes, the fangs, the furry body.

Did you make a resolution this year? Keep it. Hang onto that dedication, and eventually the spider will starve and fall away. Break your resolution, and feed that parasite. It will suck you dry of hope and faith. And next year, make no resolutions. I can still the scars of the fangs of previous years. They dont heal.
