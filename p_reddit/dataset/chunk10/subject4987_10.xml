 "The Tooth Worm as Hell's Demon" - 18th century. Carved from ivory and standing only 4 inches tall, the two halves open up to reveal a scene about the infernal torments of a toothache which people believed caused cavities in the past. Complete with mini skulls, hellfire, and naked people wielding clubs. Tooth worms have a long history, first appearing in a Sumerian text around 5,000 BC. References to tooth worms can be found in China, Egypt and India long before the belief finally takes root (pun intended) into Western Europe in the 8th century.

	<TEXT> Yep, 10 is the cap for collecting. I get being a couple over, maybe 15, for insurance, but anything over that and you're just preventing others from collecting as well. Again though, if you got the high level mons to throw on there and you're the one beating the opposing teams gyms and/or leveling up your own it's hard to say don't throw yours on there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, which is why it's frustrating for me. The dude works like a beast at the game, is constantly taking down high level gyms and building them up with open spots for others to take. I just don't see the point, other than personal pride, of being in more than 15 or so gyms as insurance. He's obviously good at what he does though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get what you're saying, but I think resetting the gyms isn't the right way. Capping how many some folks can be in gyms will help, maybe even minimizing how much a gym can grow to, from 10 to 7, will help because it wont be such a process to take down. Don't get me wrong, I'm not in a crazy ton of gyms, I average maybe 3-5 and it's a real struggle in my area because all three teams are fairly even. </TEXT>
