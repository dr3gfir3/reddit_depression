	<TEXT> In Hero league I just cannot get out of the lower rankings. I am not an amazing player by any stretch but I am usually the one trying to carry the team. So may people at this level play for themselves and not the team and the bitching becomes tiresome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I purchased my base game from www.cdkeys.com when C:S was first released and it was 13.75. I have used them and CJS-CDkeys before and both work. CDkeys is probably the quickest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have only been playing for a few months and I haven't paid for any expansions or cards. 2 questions:

1) Is it possible to do well in Ranked without paying for cards/expansions etc?

2) Can anyone recommend (or link to) good decks for noobs who don't have money to spare (yet)?

Level 18 is the highest I have made it to in ranked. In Arena I usually go 1 - 3 or 2 - 3. Highest wins is a 4 streak.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love and hate these kind of threads. They show me how beautiful this game can be and remind me how bad I am and how much my cities suck balls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use some from the Workshop but I am yet to find any that really fit in with well with level 3 offices or level commercial. I am getting a bit bored of seeing the same parks in 40 places across my maps! </TEXT>
