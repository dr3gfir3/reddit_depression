	<TEXT> Very sad, my thoughts are with those who have been affected by this. 

One small thing I want to point out if, god forbid, anyone comes across something like this:

"my next-door neighbor was the first one to try to pull the driver out. He could not do it. By that time, the fire department had arrived."

While the intentions are good, unless the car is on fire, please don't try to pull someone out of a car after an accident unless you are a medical professional. Spinal injuries can be severely worsened by improper movements. It's very likely the firefighters that responded had to use the jaws of life to take the passengers out to avoid causing more damage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gotta be honest here, I've seen a lot of comments tonight from Fire flairs talking about how we're still the same shit team from last year and Pauno cost us the game. I feel like some of those comments are from people who only started watching us this season. Most of us can agree we're a different team from last season. Not perfect, but we're quite literally still a mostly brand new squad still working things out. We'll get there. 

I don't agree that the Accam substitution was right, would have liked him to stay in, but he wasn't why we gave up two goals tonight. We have to get better at defending set pieces. We're finally able to score goals, but holding a lead is hard when you let in two goals from two corners. 

That being said, we should have had 3 points but I'll settle for 1 over zero from that game.   </TEXT>

Slimani is also 28 and incredibly injury prone. He's a liability at this point and not very reliable. Just my two cents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At least they're reimbursing the police forces that work ridiculous overtime. But jesus this bit is nearly criminal:

Around half would go to the Secret Service which provides round the clock protection for the US President, including the weekend trips to his Mar a Lago beach resort in Florida.

Agents also guard his wifeMelaniaand their son Barron at New York's Trump Tower, where they have chosen to remain until he completes his school year. 

Edit:

Not to mention this

Around $23m (17.8m) of the extra $120m(93m) would also go towards outfitting Trump Tower with necessary equipment and personnel to protect Ms Trump, as well as renting space in the building for the extra staff.

I would say most people here are not anti semitic. However, I have seen people use this sub to push their hatred against Jews. Some of these people frequently post in other subs that are purely hatred based, so it's sad to see that type of content upvoted here.

	<TEXT> I can get behind more responsibility resting on the journalists to remain truthful.

But then this is the largest issue - what is determined as the truth? Will facts and sources be easily cast off as "fake"? At what point will something be concrete enough evidence to be considered the truth? 

I think as long as the masses will consume their daily nightly news without question, no one will truly strive to be entirely honest in their reporting. </TEXT>
