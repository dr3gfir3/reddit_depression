	<TEXT> I was installing a water heater for a customer and saw this hanging up in the corner. After I finished the job I asked him what he was doing with it and he told me he was trying to clean his basement out anyway so I could have it. One of my best finds ever! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for all the responses! Went to Hockey Giant yesterday and got a new helmet and ended up getting what the guy working there said was "their house brand of a visor" I figured I'd spend more money on the helmet and upgrade the visor later. After playing with the visor I will never go back to a cage. It was probably because my cage and helmet were so poorly fitted before but I don't lose sight of the puck anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the info! I buy a lot of stuff from Oakley but if they're basically the same thing I'll save my $20. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bauer VS Oakley Visor </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've had a cage on my helmet for 10 years and wanna make the switch to a visor. Do any of you guys have experience with Bauer and Oakley visors? The Oakley is $10-$20 more but Bauer claims to use the same HDO optics that Oakley uses in their visors. Is there a distinct difference between the two? Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
