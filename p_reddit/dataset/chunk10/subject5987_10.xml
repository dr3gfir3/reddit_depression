	<TEXT> I made a smoothie with half a cup of plain Greek yogurt, half a cup of blueberries, and half of a banana in a blender. It tasted delicious, but had a thin watery consistency after blending. Was it just because of the blueberries, or did it have something to do with blending the yogurt? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're acting like it's inevitable. They're two entirely separate organizations and they'd have to make a whole new organization to combine them.

	<TEXT> I wet the bed until I was 14, it wasn't caused by anything psychological (and it's actually pretty common), I guess the muscles/ neural connections that stop you from peeing yourself while asleep just didn't develop fully until then. When I was 10 a quack psychologist told my parents it was because of "Oppositional Defiant Disorder" despite me being a goody-two-shoes who did everything adults told me to. The whole "diagnosis" was literally based off of me wetting the bed and my mom writing in a journal one day that I wouldn't brush my hair that morning. Poop-related stuff would definitely be a sign of something going on psychologically though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in Girl Scouts from kindergarten up through high school. At the younger levels it was pretty boring and I was jealous of my brother who I thought got to do more fun things, but at the older level we got to do a lot more fun stuff than the Boy Scouts and we went on a lot of trips. 

Also, Girl Scouts (at least in my experience) is much more progressive than Boy Scouts overall. My brother's Boy Scouts group was a bit backwards and had a lot of religious crazies. I wouldn't want to join Boy Scouts just because of the personalities of many of the people there/ running it and the much more religiously-oriented, conservative nature of it. Although granted there were two Boy Scouts groups in my town and my brother accidentally joined the super religious one and just ended up staying in it. </TEXT>
