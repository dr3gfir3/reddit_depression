	<TEXT> I find the Fermi Paradox kind of amusing. It is based on hypothetical musings and with numbers that could be wildly off. I do believe there is life out there somewhere, but am not near convinced that it is as abundant as theorized and may very well not have advanced to life to the capability of higher conscious thought. Think about how abundant life would be on earth if the human evolutionary tree had died out. Massive life, but none that will ever even think about, let alone try and contact, other life forms off their home planet. </TEXT>

Still, painters who studied under DiVinci or let's say psychologists who studied under Freud, these individuals learned a style or way of doing what they do, but no one would say that these individuals were copying or stealing from their teachers.

	<TEXT> I can only assume you are not an artist. How can you "steal" a style. One can use a style, but each work, unless a copy, is in and of itself an individual piece that is part of the artist making it. I mean, just because they both rap, no one would say Eminem is stealing Grand Master Flash's style.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The electrical current will continue to increase trying to force the motor to move and you will hopefully blow a fuse or pop a breaker before burning up a motor. What is actually happening is that the spools of wire inside the motor, although they look like bare wire, are insulated and too much current causes the wires to heat up and the insulation melts and shorts the wires together. The smell of a bad motor is the plastic insulation having melted and one or more if the "legs" has grounded out. </TEXT>
