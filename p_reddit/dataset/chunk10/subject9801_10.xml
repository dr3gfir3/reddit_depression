**EDIT:** Just so we're clear, yes, although **he is a murdering fucking maniac,** Duterte is the leader of a major nation. Trump should definitely keep an open line of communication. However, that doesn't mean he has to invite a murderer to the damn white house.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know what it is with theists and not using words properly. Words have definitions for a reason, and they're pretty damn important. 

First, if your entire religion is based on FAITH, then you can't have a perfect knowledge of God's existence. You need not have faith for things that you know. 

Then, and this is my favorite, if you can only "prove" God's existence to those who already share belief in your delusion, then you can't, by definition, prove shit. 

Also, she brought up the "I can feel God just like I can feel the wind so that DEFINITELY proves he's real."

No, honey, there is a huge goddamn difference between feeling the physical sensation of  wind hitting your face and having some warm fuzzy emotions after you've gotten down on your little bitty knees and said an incantation to your fake God. 

I get warm and fuzzy feelings when I listen to certain music, does that mean that the front man of Tool fucking died for my sins? No. 

Fucking hell, ya'll. The delusions are extreme in the south.  </TEXT>

If we allow murder to become an acceptable remedy when we disagree with a persons choices, lifestyle, beliefs, etc., we are all less safe and less free. 

Killing a gay person for being gay is no different than killing a Catholic for being Catholic. 

We cannot tolerate this shit.  </TEXT>

The crime? He had posted blasphemous and offensive content on FB.

	<TITLE> The TBM narrative is that the BOM is superior to the Bible due to it being divinely revealed and interpreted by JS. If the BOM is superior to the Bible, then why the hell are there errors - WORD FOR WORD - unique to a specific 1769 KJV edition of the Bible in the BOM? The BOM is an obvious fraud. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I recently found myself sitting in sacrament meeting (a friend was giving a talk so I was there solely to support a friend) and one of the speakers said something I've heard a million times before --- but it really stuck with me this time. 

He went on and on about how the BOM was divinely translated by JS and that the Bible is riddled with errors and only correct as far as it is translated correctly -- and the BOM is obviously superior to the Bible because JS had divine guidance protecting him from erring when he translated the BOM. 

Well, that's nice and all, but if the BOM was divinely translated --- and is free from error --- unlike the Bible --- then why the hell are there errors specific to a 1769 KJV edition of the Bible -- an edition that JS would have been familiar with -- in the Book of Mormon? 

If it is so perfect and free from error regarding translation, why are the very same errors present in the Bible found in the BOM? 

TBM's love the say that the Bible is riddled with errors and mistranslations ---- and that the BOM is perfect and without error --- without even realizing that many of the errors found in 1700's versions of the Bible are also in the BOM. 

This should be a huge shelf breaker for everyone. The BOM is a fraud and there is no escaping that fact.  


I know I'm preaching to the choir here, but I'm just baffled by TBM's who can't see that their very same criticisms of the Bible can be directly applied to their precious BOM as well.  </TEXT>

However, Christians seem to forget that fact the moment their beliefs are challenged or criticized. 

"How dare you insult my religion!" they say. "Hate speech!!" they say. 

Do they not realize that the very same amendment that gives them the right to freely practice their religion also gives anyone else the right to verbally mock their religion? 

The two go hand in hand. 

Not being able to handle criticism of your religion demonstrates weakness and immaturity. 

Christians love that the first amendment provides them with freedom of religion, but they absolutely hate the freedom of speech part. </TEXT>

No amount of reason or words can reach a person like this, it's up to that individual to let go of their blind belief on their own.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Today, Good Friday, a billion otherwise sane humans will celebrate a man, who they also believe was God, getting brutally murdered and then coming back to life three days later.

	<TEXT> Christians literally believe that a man, who was also God, was brutally murdered and then magically resurrected three days (apparently to Christians Friday thru Sunday somehow equals three days) later.

To top it all off, they claim that man/God/thing lives to this day.

The sheer insanity of that belief never fails to baffle me to my core.

And today, a billion people will celebrate Good Friday....and then on Sunday...Easter.

Yet atheists are the true crazies. /s </TEXT>
