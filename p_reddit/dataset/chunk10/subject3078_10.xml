	<TEXT> the UK need to realise that Brexit means no influence over future pollicy, but that they still have to follow EU rule, if they want to be able to trade freely with the rest of the EU countries.

And the EU needs to realise that the level of free trade that the UK wants will very likely stop short of anything that requires EU rules to apply domestically in the UK. Of course the UK will have to abide by EU rules on exports to the EU and on activities in the EU, as it does when trading with any other country, that's essentially normal behaviour (and EU countries will have to abide by UK rules in their dealings in the UK..). 

The issue in the article is an obvious one, if the EU insists that citizens living in the U.K. are protected by EU law under the ECJ then there is no reasonable way to come to an agreement.  The UK isn't going to be subject to EU law domestically and the UK is not going to give EU citizens additional recourse to a court outside of the UK, and agree to give it jurisdiction in the UK. AS someone else pointed out, it's not like the EU, or EU member states are going to agree to protections under UK law, enforced by UK courts in their own countries for UK citizens.

So yeah, getting rid of tariffs will likely be a UK aim. That makes sense for the UK, less so for some other EU countries.

I'd be willing to bet that the answer to that is the obvious one, being part of a group that is internally free, but considerably less free in it's external dealings isn't the same as dealing as freely as possible with the rest of the world (and the UK's trade is pretty global..).

	<TEXT> Indeed, and in my view they are right. The complaint from the EU side is quite similar to the complaints against Microsoft way back when, essentially Google has about 75% of the market share with Android in the top 5 European markets, and they are abusing that position to push search and browser technology (by requiring manufacturers to bundle). 

It goes a bit beyond that too, they are also apparently using licensing agreements to push google as the default search, and to prevent alternate OS's being shipped, as well as offering financial incentives to networks.  All in that sounds pretty anti-comparative, from a dominant force in the market, and seems a lot like someone is using the area where they have dominance to enter into and dominate new areas.

I don't think the same arguments would apply to the likes of chromebooks though, because google don't dominate anything laptop or desktop related (bar search..) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on Debian for a long time now, and as a result my other half, kids and so on are too. In terms of usability, I use KDE on the desktop and have a preference for quite a few of the KDE apps, so it broadly works very well and has done for a long time.  There have been some patchy transitions between major versions (although.. waiting generally solves that).

No I have managed Windows machines going back to XP and I'd say that over the last decade or so, the difference in terms of ease between managing a single Windows box and a single Debian box *on well supported hardware* is about the same, if you ignore how comfortable you are with one or the other.

In some areas Debian is a massive improvement too, updates tend to be less painful, are central and don't take forever.  Software installation is obviously easier and, since I broadly don't need to use non-debian sourced software, it's nicely centralised and safe.

That said, there are still the usual issues of lack of equivalent software in some areas (gaming to a certain extent is one), that's mostly not an issue for me, but for someone coming to Debian from a different platform and wanting a specific app, the change in approach can be problematic, some programs are not available, others available in ways that are not easy to install or manage.

In terms of UI, Debian and KDE have been great, you have a consistent visual style, common user interface between applications, an understandable and common way of managing things etc.. It essentially works well and is intuitive enough that my kids can generally just get on with stuff.

I also still very much enjoy the fact that I can approach any admin (say, sorting photos) task either via a specific application, a file manager, or via the command-line and scripting something. It has been a very long time since I've felt I *had* to use a particular approach or didn't have the right tools available.

Of course, I've essentially had a slowly evolving set up, that has been largely under my control for a long time, so you could argue I'm just used to things working the way that they do and potentially that isn't the best way. That may be true, but at the same time I like the fact that my OS and DE essentially get out of the way when I need to get on.  The opposite seems true regularly with Windows.

Lastly, half the reason I have been able to have a fairly evolutionary experience is that it's trivial to move data and configurations between devices. I think for the last few years at least, a hardware upgrade has essentially involved moving my disk from one machine to another, replacing a disk involved simply restoring a backup. Even where I have done fresh install's Debian (which these days really is a quick and pain free process), the amount of time required has been incredibly small between having a new device and a running machine, complete with OS, applications and data.

Oh, and one last thing. I moved an elderly (as in 90) relative across to Debian + KDE a few years ago, from Windoes (I think Vista..) essentially to make it easier to support her.  It was something that wen't remarkably well. The customisable nature of the DE and the stability of the OS meant I could set up and be reasonably sure it would continue to work, whilst removing complications from the DE and making everything nice and simple (to the point of removing menu items etc..).  Essentially there is flexibility there that far exceeds what you have in other environments.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I doubt it. The issue isn't the bundling but the use of a monopoly in one area (desktop operating systems) to dominate other areas (browsers and media players). Google doesn't have a monopoly on desktop operating systems so bundling would seem to be fine. I suppose if google search required chrome that'd be an issue though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Liberals didn't show the signs of a turnaround on Thursday

There weren't locals in Sheffield on Thursday so we don't really have much to gauge it on except possibly the almost 8% gain they had in the locals in 2016. Essentially their 2010 coalition entry cost them a run of second places in Sheffield, they were within 150 votes of Labour in 2010, then fourth, behind the Tories and the Greens, with a swing of 31% in 2015, with the Greens getting nowhere close. It won't take a lot to push them back up above the greens at that point if there is movement, of if the 2016 locals are even a mild indicator.

 I can see the Greens capitalising on that in their better seats, such as Norwich South and Sheffield Central. But without the student vote its much harder.

The student vote in Sheffield is massive, possibly the largest in the country, and I'd argue it was a factor in 2015 (and I assume contributed significantly to the Lib Dem support in the past). I'd query how sticky it is in terms of green support though..

That said, there are some local issues that might help, the whole street trees thing has been handled badly by the Labour council for example.  Then again you also have the mild issue around things like EU support, arguably Paul Blomfield has a decent advantage there, he campaigned heavily for leave, has been visible on the issues and is now on the Shadow brexit team making it clear that he wants the UK to leave on good terms... All in it's not a clear picture, but I don't think the Greens in Sheffield will see significant improvements as it stands, I think they'd have done better if they had managed to keep hold of Jillian Creasy as a candidate in terms of credibility and presence, and I sort of wonder if this election is going to make it harder for the Greens to really campaign on their issues.

But I suppose we'll see soon enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They'll also be much closer in Norwich South and Sheffield Central, I think Norwich South is in reach.

I doubt that they will be much closer in Sheffield, Jillian Creasy had a fairly large personal following, parachuting Natalie Bennett in may sound good, but I'm not sure it'll do what the Greens want it to (although I may be a bit biased, I thought Jillian Creasy was pretty good, and I've seen her outside of election periods, I've only seen Natalie Bennett on TV and she hasn't really impressed..). 

Obviously the local party seems pretty enamoured with the notion and quite positive, but I doubt that they'll be able to go from being a little over 17,000 votes short to anything that anyone would count as close. I'd imagine some of the 3k UKIP voters will end up voting Labour and some of the Lib Dem collapse will reverse pulling votes from the Greens.. All in, unless something really major changes, I don't think Sheffield will be close for the Greens, and I wouldn't be surprised if it weren't even closer. </TEXT>

I like the bulk of Green party policy, but I wouldn't vote green because of the outliers (well that and that I don't particularly think the candidate they are standing where I am is really who I'd want as an MP compared to the incumbent..).  Small parties can and often do have some really good policy ideas, go and look at a few.. what they don't seem to be able to present is any way of getting those policies into law, and they often mix some real shite in with the good ideas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Well I hope it evolves because it isn't working very well now.

I do too, but I don't think it will (I voted leave in the UK referendum at least in part because I didn't think the EU could become what I would want it to be, and instead was workign toward something I dind't like...). 

 I just think there isn't an alternative model for the EU waiting to take its place.

There isn't a comprehensive model, but there are lots of structures that have existed and continue to work. Things like ESA show that cooperation outside of the context of the EU works, NATO is effective in bringing together European countries in the context of defence (and there are a slew of bilateral agreements in Europe too). If rather than looking for one model that sits on top of Europe and touches everything, you look at a looser framework, then we do have several models to choose from and lots of potential to drive forward where there is consensus amongst fewer states, rather than trying to drive everything forward as a group of 27.

Its a false hope of some EU-skeptics to suggest that starting again with a looser arrangement is going to work.

I suppose the point isn't so much starting again, as it is looking pragmatically  for solutions to problems. If the EU isn't in a position to solve an issue, there is no reason why a different approach can't be taken.

I don't pretend to have all the answers to resolve the tensions in the EU but for now I'm staying against much deeper integration, because the biggest mistakes can often be made in reaction to big failures like Brexit. It could be further integration or a two speed approach actually makes things worse.

Yeah, I don't disagree. Pushing reform in a crisis, or something quite close to one, doesn't mean you get the best reform, usually it means you get a kludge that just about addresses the visible issues..

One thing I'm pretty sure of, the EU needs some big wins to capture the imagination of the citizenry again. Single issue consensus projects that move fast and deliver benefits to people. A few of those and things will quickly look more positive all around.

Indeed, an EU driven by its citizens would be quite an interesting beast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  European cooperation isn't available in different flavours though. 

Yes.. It is. The EU cooperates with non-EU European countries, and even within the EU there are differing levels of opt out in terms of cooperation and integration.  The idea that the EU is the be all and end all for every EU country, or that there isn't a better way, whether evolutionary or otherwise (i.e. starting from scratch..) isn't accurate.

Many (perhaps most) of us staying in the eu are also not convinced about deeper integration.

The problem is that to support a lot of what the EU has started, it's actually needed. You can't have deeper common defence cooperation without deeper integration, the Euro arguably needs deeper integration and the shifting of some core fiscal responsibilities to the EU level, the same goes for things like immigration, and that's only the really contentious issues currently.

Either the EU frameworks have to change quite a lot for things to work, or there need to be more competing frameworks that allow countries to find the best mechanism for cooperation in different areas.  The attempt to create a monolithic approach with everything being in the context of the EU might not be the best one. </TEXT>

Or that the EU isn't the last word on cooperation   unity.  Cooperation and unity are possible without the EU, with a different EU and within the current EU, the question really is about what you are willing to accept and what your idea of European unity and cooperation is. Brexit didn't show that people are cowards, it's an expression that the EU in its current form isn't right for everyone. Most people on the leave side, including the current government are entirely in favour of cooperation, they draw the line at deep integration, and that's not unreasonable at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it? The risk of terrorism has been higher in the past when there were larger ideological differences, indeed between the hard left, hard right and armed separatist groups it seems terrorism in Europe and elsewhere isn't reliant on Muslims.  It is the focus at the moment, and rightly so given the threat currently, but I'm not sure that religion alone (as opposed to the more radical ideologies promoted by terrorist groups) is the driving factor. 

That said issues around integration mean you have different interactions between the police and intelligence services and the Muslim communities in various European countries, not to mention that there is a massive variation between established communities.. Take the Yemeni community in the North of England, it has been around for almost a century and doesn't seem to have many issues with terrorism, the same isn't true for other groups in other parts of the country.

The problem is extremism, whether imported or already extant. That needs to be dealt with. </TEXT>

Indeed, but the risk exists. I've lived in larger and smaller cities and haven't experienced one, but experienced the impact in terms of security measures taken to deter terrorism. My other half lived in a reasonably sized city and saw one terrorist attack.. The point is the threat is there, terrorist attacks are part and parcel of living in a big city, you can't avoid them entirely, you can be luckier than others, but you can't get away from the threat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This switch has been really weird in terms of impact.. I've got a spark and my other half has one too and they've both come through reasonably well. In fact apart from having to switch back to the launcher I had before, and the slight changes with the Android assistant it hasn't been that noticeable apart from breaking the version of Apollo I had on mine (And I need to sort that out, but google play works too..).  I did have one moment of drama when my phone kept dropping the bluetooth connection and partially rebooting in the car but I realised I hadn't done a cold start since the upgrade and doing one seems to have gotten rid of that issue entirely.

However one of the other guys I know with one has been saying that essentially it has caused no end of issues with reboots and problems with battery saving stuff just not working.. This is the same hardware, now running the same OS, the only differences can be in terms of apps and some config options.. Which doesn't seem like it'd be enough to create such wildly different experiences..

I think there is an update due fairly soon to address some of the reported problems, I really hope it does because I really like my phone and it has worked well so far. It'd be really shite to end up in a position where that changes, or where half the userbase is pissed off because of hard to track down problems. </TEXT>

To be fair, it's not a long time ago and life hasn't changed that much (if anything, between the prevalence of kids having mobile phones and the reductions in crime) risks are much lower. What I'm saying is that there has been and continues to be a societal change where we treat people as adults later and later, that has been accelerating recently.  There also seem to be bigger divisions in terms of where we are talking about, rather than just how long ago.. I mean, I'm not suggesting kids should be working in mines, I'm bemoaning the fact that people (both parents and kids) seem less happy with the idea of their kids working in shops, restaurants and cinemas for a few hours a week and that we are entering a world where those jobs aren't just supporting some 16 year olds dvd habit, but instead supposed to be full time work for adults..

	<TEXT> At 16 you aren't a child but you aren't really fully an adult either, but at that point you do have a lot of decisions that you have to make and I'd argue that you need to be able to make them independently of your parents at least to some degree. 

I'd also argue that the current trend of pushing off adulthood isn't great, it used to be far more common for people to get part time jobs from 14 and on, essentially so you had some money to spend and I'd argue it was quite beneficial. Working 6-12 hours a week, even whilst still in school is perfectly manageable at that point without having an impact on education (Whether after school or at the weekend..). The problem now seems to be that the jobs that kids used to get, especially in shops and so on, are now being done by older people as their primary employment, rather than by young people temporarily.

I'd add that this is a relatively recent change, when I left school most of my friends had jobs, those that didn't got jobs between school and whatever they were doing next too.  There does seem to be a bit of a split between people living in towns and larger cities (no idea about rural areas...). 

Where I am in a moderately sized city, when I speak to parents of kids at around 16, it seems both the parents and the kids are far more concerned and indeed reticent about work for reasons like stress, travel, whether they can do it, social interaction and so on. It's really quite depressing. My in laws live in a town though, and my brother in law owns a shop and does employ people under 16 and seems to always have a few people who are interested, the view seems quite different, it is seen as positive and the kids doing it enjoy having money to spend.  Same goes for my kids, my eldest is really pleased that he can get a few hours work at a weekend if he wants them (and organises it in advance..) even if it means spending 10 to get there and back by train..

Personally I think work at that age is useful in developmental terms, you work with people who are older than you, understand that you get paid, get to make choices about money you have earned etc..  As long as it doesn't interfere with school and kids still have a reasonable amount of free time I really don't see a problem. It's far better than some of the alternatives parents seem to like (I've had people say that they really like that their kid is essentially in the house all the time playing on the play-station, because that means they know they aren't getting into trouble...). It also seems to build confidence, again to the point that my eldest is happy to take public transport, decide he wants to go to the climbing club or do whatever else, whilst some of his mates really don't seem to be able to do much independently.  </TEXT>

Absolutely, although the actual impact will still largely be conjecture.  Essentially you can argue that the UK would have done better in the EU even if the UK does very well over the next decade, and you can argue that the UK has done better that it would have in the EU even if it does badly.  You can also argue that UK government policy has a much bigger impact on the UK economy, employment and pretty much everything else, than the EU membership does. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think I ever had to give one out to someone who had ran out of money spending it on things like Sky TV, people just don't tend to take out expensive contracts when they have a small, unsteady source of income because they know it'll lead to the stress of debt collection as well.

The really problematic issue that you can throw in here is that they often can't take out  cheaper contracts, can't buy in bulk, don't have access to cheaper services, can't buy expensive stuff that lasts and so pay more for things that aren't as good, as someone who is a bit better off. Being poor can make a lot of things more expensive rather than less.

	<TEXT> It's a valid concern though, surely? I mean, we've seen a lot of discussion about that across a number of areas including national rail funding, throw in things like the shift that Academy schools create from local authority to a strange mix of national, private and local control and it becomes far more complex than just a positive shift to local control. 

What's more, if you have an issue with the general public not being well informed enough to make a choice on devolution, why on earth would you support more local control where local populations will arguably have more of a say? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think the issue of local devolution needs putting to a referendum anyway. I think it's a good idea, and the public are generally too ill-informed to make a decision.

What if people felt that the local devolution wasn't giving them a bigger say, or their local governments more control, but rather a way of shifting the blame for service cuts, provision failures and so on, on to underfunded city governments from central government?

	<TEXT> Northern Ireland went 56% remain, but support for leaving the UK is lower.  I'd assume that there would be more important issues for Northern Irish voters on both sides of the union debate than EU membership to base their position on too. 

Obviously there is an element of sectarianism in politics in Northern Ireland, but it goes beyond that to a certain extent, I think I am right in saying that the smaller of the two big unionist parties in Northern Ireland, the UUP supported remain in the EU referendum.  I think the polling showed that about 10% of republican voters wen't for leave and almost 20% of unionist voters went remain, and 80% of alliance/green voters opting for remain..

	<TEXT> Interesting nonetheless, but your point, that there is no appetite in Ireland to leave the EU is really quite important. That belief in the project is a large part of what makes EU membership attractive to people, I'd argue that it's more important than the economic benefits. When people talk about people in the UK having made a 'stupid' decision, because they didn't prioritise the economic impact, they miss the point that much of the support for the EU is also for 'stupid' reasons, it is about the political aspects, the idea of the union and so on.  It'd have been much less likely for the UK to leave the EU if it had bought more into the political project something that I think people in Ireland have done to a much larger extent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah fair play. I think there is a difference here in a sense in that the EU has in the past played with the timing of decisions and announcements to boost support, or reduce opposition around elections. In the past that hasn't really been an issue, now though the timed release of statements (say on Euro clearing which was apparently rushed, or the push to present the 'largest' number on the leaving bill) it does seem like political manoeuvring by the EU during an election, and in a manner intended to interfere, rather than simply the existence of one causing a particular view etc..

That said, I get the impression that a lot of what the EU is talking about is for internal EU consumption, or rather I hope it is, because nothing that has come out so far really looks to help the EU position, but instead seems to be causing more of a rift (that May is exploiting rather than suffering from).

I think this whole affair should be handled with infinitely more tact and decorum.


Absolutely, in fact the whole come back thing from May on the dinner leaks was, in my view, incredibly silly. She could have ignored it and it might have diffused things a bit, and left her looking like the bigger person. Instead she tried to channel Margaret Thatcher... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not much of an article, but I hadn't seen it anywhere else:

*Three U.S. Republican House lawmakers threw their support behind their party's healthcare overhaul plan on Wednesday after crafting changes to provide $8 billion over five years to shore up coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.*

*Representatives Fred Upton and Billy Long, who had rejected an earlier bill to roll back the 2010 Affordable Care Act, told reporters after a meeting with Trump at the White House that they could now vote for the plan with their proposed changes.*

*Upton said the revised bill could come up for a vote on Thursday, although both he and Long said they did not know whether there were enough votes to pass it. Representative Michael Burgess also said he could back the legislation.*

So a vote as early as tomorrow, with some Republicans formerly opposed switching their support.  Someone with more of an overview of the current state of the votes in the house could probably shed light on how much that changes things, although I assume if they are calling a vote on the revised bill for tomorrow that someone is confident..

Oh and since people are suggesting contacting people - you can find details on your representative [here](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/)  </TEXT>

If you were planning, or carried out an attack the former would absolutely count as information useful to a person committing or preparing an act of terrorism, contrary to s.58(1) of the Terrorism Act 2000, the bleach and train ticket too probably.

I suppose the breach there would be around the reporting of donations (which is the responsibility of the party, not the donor), unless there was collusion to hide the source from the party, or collusion to hide the source from the EC.

In either case, there doesn't seem to be enough there for that yet. Be interesting to see if anything else comes out.

	<TEXT> Honestly, do you think people from whatever side actually know what Brexit really means right now?

They know it means leaving the EU.. The question was whether the UK should be in the EU or out of it, everything beyond is up for debate and negotiation... It's a bit like suggesting that no-one really knows the implications of voting Labour or Tory in a general election, because you don't know whether they will have an absolute majority, or end up in a coalition, whether they will drop a pledge, or do something unexpected etc..

The referendum set a direction, that was to leave the EU, everything else about that is essentially up for grabs.

A new referendum isn't going to solve that either, because frankly even at the end of the negotiations there are going to be disputes about the impact of the resultant agreement, questions about future trade deals etc.. I think /u/aoide12's point is that we've had a referendum, the government and much of parliament has resolved to take the UK out of the EU, so that should happen at this point, rather than asking the country if they are really sure.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd be surprised how many have admitted they were looking at leaving, pr at least divverting a significant amount of work to Europe. Remember the UK is not just walking away from the EU..it's walking away from around 60 linked trade deals.

I would be, most of the manufacturing firms I've spoken to or worked with aren't looking at moving, although they tend to be small and specialised. The largest has a lot of US contracts so I suppose they'd be relatively well insulated, unless the US does something daft, which seems more likely these days..

It basically does. But you are right, there is give and take..but in negotiations, the US gives less and takes more.

Except it doesn't. It's been trying to do something rather interesting over the past few decades with the TT* agreements, in that it has been trying to impose a framework on essentially the global economy (to the exclusion of China..) and hasn't really done that well even if you discount the current Trump lunacy. There has been push back from individual countries that have significantly moderated the approach and, the approach could well be argued (bar a few bits at least) as generally beneficial to all parties.

In short, if the US can't muscle it's way into trade dominance through treaties (rather than simply sheer capacity) the EU, which has not been very good at leveraging soft power at the best of times isn't going to be able to force the issue with what will be a fairly major regional power..

Look at the China/Swiss deal as an example..you open your market to us for ten years, before you sell into ours.

Thats a pretty gross misrepresentation of the treaty, not to mention that Switzerland essentially managed to open up a very large market for its services in the process. A similar deal for the UK would be incredibly beneficial to the UK, but it isn't going to get it via the EU given the current EU/China positions. Switzerland even managed to get concessions on IP and investment...

The EU has the advantage also because of the size and diversity of markets. 

It's an advantage, it doesn't confer 'the advantage'. Looking at trade deals from the perspective of one party winning and one losing is simply not terribly appropriate.

For example, if Brexit makes delivery of UK goods to a German company unreliable or too expensive, an Italian company that was making widgets for the UK, but was too expensive for the German company suddenly has the incentive to make up the UK losses. 

Absolutely. But that's the case with any country that has agreements with other countries and access to a large market. Hell, it applies even where there is no FTA in place, UK companies are competing with china on sales to other EU countries now, even though China doesn't have a comprehensive FTA..

Or the UK company starts producing on the continent. 

That only works if the UK company's market is largely in the EU, otherwise it cuts itself off from the UK domestic market to the same extent that any other EU company is. And again, the UK has a very large domestic market (much larger than the value of its exports).

Either way, the EU wins. The UK generally doesn't have the huge OEMs to sustain a domestic supply chain.

The EU doesn't win, because it loses access to the UK market to the same degree, it's a smaller loss, but it is still a loss. Throw in areas where the UK is very good, and indeed the likelihood that the UK will pursue a fairly liberal trade policy and you are back to the old protectionism vs free trade argument. The latter generally wins.. On that point too the EU has an issue, it has far more that it has to protect, and currently does so (look at CETA for example). The UK (who is Canada's largest trading partner by far in the EU) will likely benefit from a UK/Canada agreement with fewer barriers because it can do so where the EU can't. 

Now you are right that the EU is going to use whatever leverage it can in the talks and it is going to protect its members interest, but it isn't as skewed as you suggest and a mutually beneficial arrangement, where both sides 'win' is entirely possible and, given it's the usual aim of trade negotiations, fairly likely.

I don't think there will be an agreement because I don't think the UK government is being realistic. They are focussing on a UKIP wishlist instead of something that is achievable. 

The information we have so far about negotiating positions, as slim as it is on both sides, doesn't suggest that the UK government is being unrealistic, or that they are focusing on a UKIP wishlist at all.. Where do you see that in what we know about the initial positions?

They are being dishonest with the population in leading them to believe that it is possible. Then when it becomes apparent that it was pie in the sky all along..the big bad EU will be punishing us.

Again, this doesn't seem to fit with the reality of the situation. The government has said the negations will be hard, and complex.  They have said that they want the freest possible trade terms within the context of being outside of the EU single market. That's entirely realistic, largely because it is pretty vague.  The point to note though is that barrier (tariff and NTB) free trade for goods is very likely. It's harder for services (although MIFID II will make it easier for finance..) but then the EU's services market is a mess anyway.  What exactly do you feel is dishonest in the current non-tabloid presentation?

I don't really get your argument about the euro clearing.. 

Reserve currencies are cleared globally. If you want your currency to be viable in a global context, you can't apply protectionist measures.  

I'm guessing the EU countries will just decide to make a centre to deal with their own clearing. I'm sure they can't completely stop London clearing..but they can make a conscious decision not to use London, which will then probably force banks to relocate resources as it's too profitable to miss out on.

Clearing doesn't happen in isolation or just in London, you need large markets to make it efficient. If the Euro forces clearing into the Eurozone it doesn't just lock out London, but every other global financial centre (the second largest in Europe is also outside of the EU by the way) including those in the US and Asia.  There are also usually lots of currencies involved (essentially.. it's complicated). The reason that London handles almost two thirds of Euro clearing isn't because it's in the EU (and not in the Eurozone..), it's because it also has a huge share of the clearing business for other currencies. Nowhere in the EU does either.. In short it'd undermine the Euro, it wouldn't come close to being offset by banks opening branches in the EU either, it'd severely undermine confidence in the Euro, which you can't really afford at the moment. It's also not a new push by the EU.

	<TEXT> The problem you and others have here is that negotiations and agreements between countries don't just rely on size, both sides have to find the agreement as positive, or they simply don't sign.  If that weren't the case, then the US would dominate every trading relationship, the EU, without the UK would be dominated by China and the US too.. Small countries would all be screwed.. Yet that isn't the case.

As to Euro clearing - if the EU were insane enough to try and move it, it would kill the Euro. The EU wants the Euro to be a credible reserve currency, protectionism of the sort you are suggesting would kill that, it'd be abnormal globally... The EU could do it, but it'd harm itself far more than it would harm the UK.

As tot he rest, the UK is a huge manufacturing country, with a very large domestic market. Manufacturers aren't going to leave because they rely on the UK domestic market (which is much larger than what the UK has in exports..), not to mention that they produce for a global market, and, even if the UK were to have no deal with the EU, they'd still be able to export there too..

The point is that the UK and EU have to find a mutually beneficial agreement, or there won't be one. The EU has a lot of things that the UK wants, and the UK has a lot of things the EU wants, if no agreement is reached then yes, both sides get hurt, the UK a bit more, but the EU is nowhere close to being in a position to dictate terms, it doesn't have all the cards, it has some, and the question really is how much harm the EU is willing to inflict on itself on the basis of ideology, if it acts in that manner rather than on the basis practical self interest.

But hey, you can go with the 'they are so much bigger than us' argument if you prefer.

	<TEXT> So..

A quick look at the electoral commission site shows cash donations of 3,688,720.39 and 512,088.61 in non cash donations from IPGL Ltd to the conservative party between 14/04/2005 and 24/02/2017.  There are no loans recorded to the conservative party from IPGL.

HSBC has loaned 897,250.00 to a selection of UK political parties over the last few years though, not just the Tories of course.

I also just listened to what I assume are the relevant portions of the AGM (because, you know, it's Tuesday..). The points made were that IPGL were over-leveraged, and that HSBC made loans anyway, and that those loans (200m) were used to make donations to the Tories.  The argument goes that HSBC, as IPGL's lender must have known about the loans and so may have breached HSBC's own policies..

I had a quick look at IPGLs accounts [here](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/document-api-images-prod/docs/0APe2ufqv8DxDj4edbT0eZMQRq_3ZDXgaFa5FRsB4FI/application-pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=ASIAIFFJONWK2YG5HFMA Expires=1493763895 Signature=cypj%2F%2BOY0TIJcK28ZYlSAoCWzwo%3D x-amz-security-token=FQoDYXdzEKz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDDvve33oT2Va7KVyQSK3A8d0TP5WvoVYl97QDESKbN0pvB%2BddhGLgWImoxLbFsSxf2v%2BLANUEYbLBKXoK%2FVnHIAMOPAeGuVm0udGt6u2AKVOCstiG8xGpHG0jRCQVuZFEOJ1XNL0fuF2%2FUyMA6sQ69%2Bf0tNuKp3U6gW9Q%2B1PGZISc%2BH1Oxo1yGYrsZMw1gjBrLYdVBSxs3mcQCcdrKIZdJueZoe4drmzOq41RHA43UyiSm1lk9Rd%2B2s3%2BUv8YXqP5AQ0Y7JwSPFD7RTPuH7091n2Nh5ayjUI8LtkomQDkOLdVbCfMPMWSoULM8sq4rVIhQm0Zy%2F0xlWmxZfIDgeTRtkr5UBvy52x7SV6tmKbC82RzT9AHR%2FqB39SX1BjPTgTbOp6qd8iKLUMqd5PF196BSnbWbxD%2FUoPgxTB4rXhLiwgZql%2F9fZv0NnV0SwR1nnlLaP2TtN1ZuQAYqRkZBbbyrr15wXkR87Ox3ZxMCndg5%2FGsn6Hme9p%2FI9b8HrbOD0J7CIGv7k2wNYDw4lv0x8u5kv%2FS36V5gib7XgRQQKJYFT7qSSUCzQn6eRzjnQfHnezv4bRDtkUVEnUdk0tQTX%2FOmMoZOdvzSQo26SjyAU%3D), which suggest it does make money and can afford the loans though,

The statement from the HSBC board at the AGM was obviously very neutral, and so arguably they didn't refute the points, they mostly seemed to brush them off. In fact they refused to talk about individual companies at all.

It's interesting, and certainly troubling, but I'm not sure if 'laundering' is an appropriate term at that point.  

From the letter, I'm also not sure whether you can construe a loan, or a series of loans, to a company that is a going concern, that then donates to a political party as essentially a proxy loan either. Or at least not without quite a lot more information. I'm also not sure how the electoral commission could, even in conjunction with companies house and HMRC make that call. At the end of the day, the liability would sit with the borrower, not the Conservatives.

All in, unless there is unreported money in here somewhere, or evidence of collusion between HSBC and the conservatives, via IPGL, it just looks like the usual large business donations to the Tories.  You can draw your own conclusions as to why of course..

Now I'm not saying there isn't an issue here, but it's horribly easy to string these things together. I just took the first large corporate Labour party donor from the electoral commission site, the company made a large (although not Tory large..) donation in 2010.  In the same year it got a 100 million credit facility even though it showed only a very small profit (and in 2009 showed a fairly large operating loss)... I then looked at the people related to the company and it turns turns out that the chairman was a prominent labour member and donor at the time. I doubt that the credit facility was set up to channel money to the party though.. And like I said, that was a random first stab, go grab one yourself and have a go.. It's almost fun.

I guess what I'm saying (beyond that we need to find a way to keep big money away from politics..) is that asking about this is right, but it's not as damning in my view (at least yet) as the letter seems to suggest, there are a few dots missing before the lines join up.

Edit: As a side not the whole Mr Ethical and moveyourmoney stuff that is out there is well worth reading, there are a few holes, but it does cast a light on some pretty dodgy looking moves in relation to finance and corruption..

Under the worst case scenarios, there will be additional costs for UK exporters (and EU exporters..), currency changes might offset that to a certain degree, as would government policy in terms of customs...
