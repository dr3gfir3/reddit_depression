	<TEXT> 1st things 1st

I am down 14lbs since December 

Started at 323

Last weigh in I am 309

Next goal: 50lb loss so I can go horseback riding!

This has genuinely been a new year, new me in a lot of ways. I started a new job, in a completely new field as a paraeducator  (read teachers aide) and have used it as a springboard to make changes.

I am walking a lot more. My campus is small, but an open, outdoor Southwest campus that I walk across several times a day. I also monitor meal times and recess. I make sure my time "standing" is spent pacing or doing step-touch to keep moving. According to my Fitbit I have 8000 steps in before I leave work at 2:30pm.

I also am stuck on campus for lunch. No running to McDonald's or Culvers as was my usual. I am in a small town, no fast food, and I don't really have time to go off campus anyway. I pack a light lunch of yogurt, berries, fruit, and maybe a granola bar. I also don't take soda to work, so it water only. I nurse a 12oz  Pepsi with dinner instead of drinking 2 giant gas station sodas or more daily. I generally eat the same as before for dinner, but control my portions. I track every calorie on my Fitbit app and even on "cheat" days stay under my weekly calories.

It feels like life change, not a diet. Especially since I have not really made the really big, sweeping changes like big calorie restrictions or overly ambitious workout goals like I would usually do, then burn out and fail. I am amazed that these small, relatively painless changes have let to such dramatic progress!

I feel super excited to be off to such a great start. I am more excited to have just as much good news to report in the months to come.

	<TEXT> This is the same principle that makes small dog bites dangerous. A tiny toy poodle bit me once during grooming. I went right to the Doctor, got it scrubbed up and antibiotics started. 
Woke up the next morning with puss pouring out of my hand. I was rushed to the hospital and had emergency surgery to open my hand and clean out all the infection. The 1st 24hrs I had the wound flushed every few hours while they pumped in pain meds and I vomited.
 This was followed by 7 days in isolation in the hospital with the CDC monitoring me because of all the crazy bacteria that had sprouted in my hand.
18 yeats later my right index  finger is more scar tissue than anything.
TL;DR don't fuck around with bites from small animals. </TEXT>
