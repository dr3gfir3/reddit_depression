	<TEXT> That is a great point. But under another provision in the bill, anytime police seize cash under $10K, they have to file charges (looks like within 60 days) or else they have to return the cash. And according to a report the article cited, "half of all cash forfeitures were under $1,324."

So while Utah's law is definitely messier than the conviction requirements in other states, it still should help end a lot of abuses.  </TEXT>
