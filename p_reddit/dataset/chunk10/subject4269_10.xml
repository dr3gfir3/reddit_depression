	<TEXT> From a listia.com post about the game:

New, shrinkwrapped game of "Panty Raid".  Some of the spots on the game board; Take a drink, kiss a player, pinch a player's buns, undo a button or zipper, make an animal sound, imitate an *****, tickle a navel, make a sexual sound, kiss a body part below waist, lick your favorite thigh, nibble an earlobe....this gives you an idea of how the game goes. There are panties and shorts, some rule about the Dean's shorts, it looks a bit complicated, but then again I never went to college.

This is new, still in the shrinkwrap. We bought out a recently defunct joke shop to stock our website ThatRestlessMouse.com - Posting some of the onesie-twosie items here for your enjoyment.  </TEXT>
