Officials said Comey was fired because senior Justice Department officials concluded he had violated Justice Department principles and procedures by publicly discussing the investigation of Hillary Clintons use of private email. Just last week, President Trump publicly accused Comey of giving Clinton a free pass for many bad deeds when he decided not to recommend criminal charges in the case.   

That's about as clear as it gets. DOJ believes that Comey affected election results.   

The DOJ really gave him a hard "fuck you." It's fairly evident that he improperly tampered with an election. 

The FBIs reputation and credibility have suffered substantial damage, and it has affected the entire Department of Justice, Rosenstein wrote. I cannot defend the directors handling of the conclusion of the investigation of Secretary Clintons emails, and I do not understand his refusal to accept the nearly universal judgment that he was mistaken. Almost everyone agrees that the director made serious mistakes; it is one of the few issues that unites people of diverse perspectives.

In a letter to Trump, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that he agreed.

I have concluded that a fresh start is needed at the leadership of the FBI, Sessions wrote. I must recommend that you remove Director James B. Comey, Jr. and identify an experienced and qualified individual to lead the great men and women of the FBI.

Shortly before the announcement, the FBI notified Congress by letter that Comey had misstated key findings involving the Hillary Clinton email investigation during testimony last week, but nothing about that issue seemed to suggest it might imperil Comeys job.  

Also definitely possible this is a scapegoat or a way to distract from Russian interference. Comey being incompetent and unlawfully interfering with an election *and* a foreign actor interfering *and* Comey being scapegoated can be true.    

Edit: Apparently he found out while giving a speech and TVs behind him broadcast the news he was fired. Damn, at least tell the guy first.  </TEXT>

Eight Democratic Senators on Tuesday asked U.S. regulators to launch an investigation into billionaire Carl Icahns activities in the U.S. biofuels blending credit market, **saying the activist investor may have violated securities trading laws since becoming an adviser to President Donald Trump.**

	<TEXT> Testifying for the first time about her discussions in January with Trump administration officials, Yates gave her first public accounting of a conversation with White House counsel Donald McGahn that ultimately led to Flynns firing.

We began our meeting telling him that there had been press accounts of statements from the Vice President and others that related to conduct that General Flynn had been involved in that we knew not to be the truth, said Yates. The vice president was knowingly making false statements to the American public, and General Flynn was compromised by the Russians.

She's currently defending her decision not to enforce Trump's immigration EO. This doesn't seem relevant to the proceedings at hand, but leave it to Republicans to bring up something irrelevant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, and I'm not faulting my colleagues for it. It's a legitimate concern and since we're often talking to clients soon after the assault, it's important to not set off any negative triggers early on during representation.

	<TEXT> Honestly, I agree on a personal standpoint, but the word victim is still worse. It's a little awkward referring to the client as a survivor and it sometimes leads to questions that get far deeper into the psych realm than I have the knowledge or capability to deal with. Regardless, it does help in terms of results, so I'm not gonna knock it. 

The terms are effectively interchangeable in this context so the main reason we use survivor is, as you point out, for empowerment. People like to believe they made it through something. When you survive, the implication is that there was something that occurred that you made it through due to something you did and maybe some luck and maybe some other factors. When you're a victim, a bad thing happened to you and you had no control. Survival is active, being a victim is passive (at least in terms of perception). Even as an attorney, I need to focus on making sure the client feels like s/he has control over their life, not only because it helps them recover, but also because it makes my life easier in getting testimony out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hah. Addressed in another comment. Short answer: no. I had both male and female clients. All had legitimate claims. If they ever went to something that seemed dubious, I could usually get a good idea of what actually happened. I screened one where there was an issue of both parties possibly committing abuse, but the issue the client wanted solved couldn't be fixed by us as it was unrelated to domestic violence or assault. Ultimately, if someone doesn't want a protection order, not much I can do for them except offer sympathy. I'm an attorney, not a therapist. 

A couple sources I found list the false/unsubstantiated reporting number at about 5-7%. The studies seem to deal with low sample sizes, so I'm not sure how good that number is. The false accusation rate is far lower than most people seem to believe, though. There's a huge underreporting problem as well as certain police departments convincing survivors to change their story or file a lesser offense so that rape/sexual assault numbers will be down for that precinct.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tl;dr: Yeah, it's still a good guideline with the caveat that modern understanding of psychology, trauma, sociology, and crime will probably inform how you conduct the interview. Also, the terminology has changed a little. 

Umm, regularly about 3 years ago. Off and on since then, so I'm not really out of it. I was a student attorney back when I worked domestic violence cases regularly so it was a lot of training on everything from client interactions to gender studies, critical race theory, poverty studies, etc. A lot of it, particularly the gender studies work, was new to me. Oh, also a bit of psychology thrown in too, especially trauma psychology. 

So, yes, there are differences in the way you approach these interviews now simply by nature of how our understanding of sociology has changed. Terminology is different too (say survivor instead of victim, as it's more empowering and rape trauma can lead to feelings of lack of control over one's own life). But the general guidelines for the interaction itself track. The goal is for the client to feel safe. Also, obviously watch out for problems with the testimony that could signal a fake claim, though those are not as common as you'd think being on this site. 

Frankly, despite the Reddit hate on for false accusations and the like, it's still a highly underreported crime. Yes, being falsely accused of a sex crime can ruin your life. So can getting raped. Both are bad. But we'd like to encourage reporting of criminal activity so that, you know, people don't think it's okay to rape someone. 

So to sum up, some of the psychology understanding and terminology has changed. Procedure is largely the same. Also, it's normal to deal with a client who gets irrationally (or rationally based on what you're asking) angry at you or cries uncontrollably or whatever. We were trained to deal with hostile/combative witnesses as well. Also male clients since, obviously, it happens to both. We also focused on how two individuals in a relationship can have vastly different stories and the importance of treating both as clients. 

I had some experience as a student attorney with minors who were adjacent to the abuse and possibly suffered some (some direct representation), though you typically don't want to get them involved unless they're the direct victim of whatever assault. None of my clients who were kids had sexual abuse claims, though I've since done some stuff with anti-child sex trafficking advocacy. With kids, what you say depends on age but at some point, you're probably going to need to call a specialist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This actually tracks with what I did when I worked on domestic violence/sexual assault cases a while back. There's a couple minor differences, but it's pretty spot on in terms of interviews with survivors. The key is to always be professional and be compassionate while clinical. Also, accept that sometimes you're the wrong person to do the interview if there's particularly severe trauma and the individual isn't reacting well to you. Although, I will say, as a dude working in the field, my colleagues were more likely to recommend I not do the interview so I don't trigger anything than the actual client ever was (no client ever had an issue with me and could clearly separate me from her attacker).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. I dunno, seems like a common sense thing. If it's about a film that's still in production/hasn't been released it's probably a spoiler. If it's about the very existence of a film (Untitled Avengers 4), it's probably not. 

Something like "Rocket is in Avengers 8" easily leads you to the logical conclusion that Rocket is still relevant in Avengers 8, hasn't died at that point, and Bradley Cooper is actually Thanos (or something, I don't know how Avengers 7 ends). 

So something like this post is a pretty bright line spoiler since you know that something from Avengers 2 is going to have some role in Avengers 3. Speculation based on existing Canon and trailers and such seems fair game since it's what makes us fans so rabid and lovable. But production stills, even if the production team wants them out there, is probably closer to spoilers.

There's definitely a fanbase that loves that stuff and wants to discuss its implications, I totally respect that, and believe they should be allowed to do so. But there's also people that want to be part of the community but don't want every detail about the making of a movie or show before it comes out. Both types of fan deserve to be able to talk in their respective realms of knowledge, but the more spoiler friendly crowd has a slight upper hand here since they don't care as much about the titles of posts. 

Would having a rule just on titles, where it can say "Spoilers A:IW" or something work? Like you can expand on the type of spoiler, like "Spotted on the set of [MCU]" without saying what's been spotted or anything like that?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you brown the onions and garlic, little bits stick to the bottom of the pan these little bits are quite tasty, but stuck. To make them unstuck and make them a part of the pasta experience, you use liquid while the pot is still hot. Basically like cleaning off the bottom with stock or water or wine or whatever. When you pour the liquid in, use a wooden spoon to gently scrape the stuck bits of the bottom so the bottom has few to no stuck bits left and they're all incorporated into whatever you're making. 

The pouring of the liquid and scraping of the brown bits off the bottom is called deglazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No? Luke Skywalker is Leia Organa Solo's twin brother. Leia Organa Solo is/was married to Han Solo. Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo have a natural born son named Ben Solo. Sometime later, Leia Organa Solo and Han Solo separate and/or divorce. Han Solo is Luke Skywalker's brother-in-law by marriage to Luke Skywalker's twin sister, Leia Organa Solo. Han Solo is Aldo arguably Luke Skywalker's best friend. Ben Solo is also Kylo Ren. Ben Solo/Kylo Ren is thus Luke Skywalker's nephew by blood, being Luke Skywalker's sister's natural born son. Ben Solo/Kylo Ren kills Han Solo, his blood-related father. When one kills one's father, it is called patricide. 

Therefore, Luke feels the ripples in the Force of the killing of his best friend and brother-in-law, Han Solo, by his nephew, Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, who was committing patricide. He has a blood connection to Ben Solo/Kylo Ren, arguably meaning he has a stronger connection to him and any Dark Side actions, like patricide, would be felt more strongly.  

Not gonna lie, that was kinda fun to write out.  </TEXT>

Goes back to a proposed title of Star Wars, "Adventures of the Starkiller as taken from the Journal of the Whills, Saga I: The Star Wars." That also included the first mention of the Kyber Crystals featured in Rogue One. The concept of the Whills has since been incorporated into the current canon through the books and such. In particular, Qui-Gon Jinn, studied the from the Whills to become a Force ghost (possibly) in Clone Wars TAS and Chirrut Imwe is part of the Guardians of the Whills in Rogue One. It's a quick expository line by Cassian when they're on Jedha.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The case was widely discussed throughout the political sphere while the debate was ongoing on the initial version of the AHCA. It was commented on by the White House and Congressional Republicans as a textbook example of illegal immigration hurting Americans. As such it was used to push anti-immigration and nationalist messaging at the time of Trump's first healthcare push with the AHCA (in fact, covered on Fox more than the the-failing GOP healthcare bill. Those fears appear to now be, as they were then, unwarranted. 

That case became explosive as political factions seized on its volatile mix of crime and illegal immigration.

Montano came to the U.S. from El Salvador, and Sanchez Milian from Guatemala. They were stopped at the border, detained, then allowed to continue on to relatives before they enrolled in Rockville at a ninth grade level.

White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the case during a daily briefing and said the idea that this occurred is shocking, disturbing, horrific, Spicer said.

Part of the reason that the president has made illegal immigration and crackdown such a big deal is because of tragedies like this  Immigration pays its toll on our people if its not done legally, and this is another example, Spicer said.

Demonstrators converged on county government offices and hundreds of calls, emails and texts went to the school system bashing undocumented immigrant students, assailing school policies and demanding the ouster of the superintendent. Police provided protection at the school after the threats.

In Annapolis, politicians referred to the case in denouncing legislation that would have limited cooperation between local police and immigration authorities; the legislation was defeated weeks later.

Immigration advocates and the county schools superintendent publicly spoke out about the charges, voicing horror and regret and also saying politicians should not judge immigrant children seeking a better life for themselves by the disturbing case. We are a public school system, and we serve all of our students when they come to us, Schools Superintendent Jack Smith said.

Sanchez Milians father, Adolfo Sanchez-Reyes, was drawn into the rippling effects of the investigation when immigration agents looking into the suspects backgrounds concluded the father was in the country illegally and placed him in custody. His immigration case is pending, said his attorney, Himedes V. Chicas.

It was not immediately clear what immigration consequences may await the two teens.

According to the defense lawyers, the day before the incident, the girl and Montano, exchanged explicit text messages and images about planning to have sex in the school. Video from school cameras showed Montano and the girl walked together into the bathroom at the time of the incident, according to the attorneys, who also said the girls account of events was not consistent as the investigation progressed.

At no point did the girl express any reluctance with any sex acts, said Jezic. From the night before, she actively planned a sexual encounter.

The dragon burns its prey before consuming it. The sheep writhes in pain, its offspring looking on. Too young to continue without their mother and with the rest of the flock corralled by fire, a grim fate is certain for these sheep. 

The shepherd will not long survive without the sheep to sell at market. King Aegon will not compensate for the cruel fate he has endured. The hunt for a new life must emerge from the ashes of his trade. So does the cycle continue under the Targaryen rein in the Seven Kingdoms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI r/news mods are deleting anything related to the passage of this bill as "politics" even if it's news. 

From the [NYTimes article](https://nyti.ms/2pLo7He), relevant bits if paywalled:

WASHINGTON  The House on Thursday narrowly approved a bill to repeal and replace major parts of the Affordable Care Act, as Republicans recovered from their earlier failures and moved a step closer to delivering their promise to reshape American health care without mandated insurance coverage.

The vote, 217-213, on President Trumps 105th day in office, keeps alive the Republican dream to unwind the signature legislative achievement of former President Barack Obama. The House measure faces profound uncertainty in the Senate, where the legislations steep spending cuts will almost certainly be moderated. Any legislation that can get through the Senate will again have to clear the House and its conservative majority.

/break

We are all breathing a sigh of relief, Representative Chris Collins, Republican of New York, said. Were living up to a campaign promise we made, the Senate made, the president made.

Democrats vowed to make Republicans pay a high political price for pushing such unpopular legislation. I have never seen political suicide in my life like Im seeing today, Representative Louise M. Slaughter, Democrat of New York, said.

The House bill would eliminate tax penalties for people who go withouthealth insurance. It would roll back state-by-state expansions ofMedicaid, which covered millions of low-income Americans.

In place of government-subsidized insurance policies offered exclusively on the Affordable Care Acts marketplaces, the bill would offer tax credits of $2,000 to $4,000 a year, depending mainly on age. A family could receive up to $14,000 a year in credits. The credits would be reduced for individuals making over $75,000 a year and families making over $150,000.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the first version of the bill would trim thefederal budgetdeficit considerably but would also leave 24 million more Americans without health insurance after a decade. Insurance premiums would spike next year before settling lower after a decade.

/break 

In truth, Republicans argued, with so many problems afflicting the Affordable Care Act, the status quo is unsustainable, regardless of what Congress does. Mr. Trump pointed to Aetnas announcement this week that it would no longer offer policies on Virginias Affordable Care Act exchange.

Death spiral! the president wrote on Twitter.

People with pre-existing conditions will be affected and many will likely die if this bill passes the Senate and gets signed into law. 

Congratulations GOP: You created a death panel and voted to kill Americans.       </TEXT>

The British also had many many scandals, the affair between Princess Di and Dodi Fayed arguably being the worst for the royal family as it culminated in their deaths.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well according to the movie Reavers are just people driven to extremes by a chemical designed to make them more passive. For the majority, it made them stop caring about everything until they stopped autonomic functions and died. For others, it made them go extreme and experience all emotions simultaneously at their highest level and therefore exist in a perpetual frenzy. 

Actually one of the most fascinating things about the series excluding the movie is the scariest moments involve a person who has only been adjacent to the horrors that Reavers did to his companions. Now imagine what the real thing is like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Word on Twitter is Prince Philip died. Sad if true. He was quite the character, but seemed like a decent guy. 

There is nothing like it for morale to be reminded that the years are passingever more quicklyand that bits are dropping off the ancient frame. But it is nice to be remembered at all.
