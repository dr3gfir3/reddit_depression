You should also double check and make sure there are no underlying DNS issues, and quite possible have to recreate the DFS root. Like I said though, I just completely did away with DFS b/c it wasnt needed. That may not look to be plausible for you. </TEXT>

I was going through firewall logs yesterday and noticed that traffic was still passing on a firewall entry I had disabled. I opened up the live log and it says its passing with a NAT rule. I was under the impression that you have to have the NAT rule plus firewall rule in place for traffic to pass. Is this not the case with Sophos?

edit1- So there has to be something somewhere other than the firewall rules allowing these NAT rules, as i've tested other rules and they look to be blocking fine when the rule is turned off. Any idea as to what else could allow traffic for https/http other than the firewall rule? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> forwarders may be the same, but what about your forward lookup zones in DNS? Have you made sure that there is not a static zone for that website above that is pointing it to a certain IP? It's a reach, especially if this is all on the same domain...but worth looking at nonetheless.

Also, does this mean you cannot even resolve an IP whatsoever in your main location when using nslookup to these sites? The only other thing is maybe your public IP was blacklisted for some reason? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly with your server being down and no clear resolution, i'd cut my losses and call Microsoft support.

If i had to guess, its related to log files based on just a quick search of the error (MapiExceptionDatabaseError: Unable to mount database. (hr=0x80004005, ec=1108)

this article is for 2013 but has the same error https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/lync/en-US/6a30ff6d-9f7f-41c0-936b-6ac332cb9f8e/database-offline-unable-to-remount-exchange-2013?forum=exchangesvrgeneral

But as others have said, we wont be able to help without having access to the system, etc like Microsoft would do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. One thing though, I'm not tagging any traffic the switch ports are untagged on both the fortigate interface and my pc. 
I already have a policy for internal4(the interface that's not working)-wan. That is why this is so strange to me that the implicit deny is blocking something even though I have the policy in place.  </TEXT>
