	<TEXT> Good point but that doesn't make your point more valid. Plus they did act weird in this season as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several of the revealed titans did not seem to be hiding any secrets prior to their reveal

They were though, just watch the first season again. As for their motivations on why they joined the Scouts, it becomes more clear why they'd do that when you learn their backstories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm liking it so far. As a manga reader, I think it's far better than the manga (I felt the same about S1) though I did have some problems with the early episodes, especially that rewind thing in the first one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're shy kids who have trouble verbalizing their feelings to others. They get anxious easily. Koutarou is normally reserved but with people he's close with like his friends he can be pretty lively, whereas Akane is shy around her friends as well. I could write more but that's the basic of it. I don't understand your assumption that they have 'no personality,' seems like you're either not paying attention or you have some weird idea of what constitutes a personality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might be a little hard to understand at first but you'll pick up on the slang pretty quick. There's only 3-4 words that I couldn't figure out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read it recently and watched the movie after that. What do you think of it? Do you think it's better with or without the final chapter?

For me, the most interesting aspect was probably the slang, if you guys know of any books that do something similar, feel free to recommend them to me. Also, I feel like this is probably controversial but personally I disagree with the view that a person should be given free will when they're clearly exercising that free will to ruin other people's lives. Though, I guess this leads to the slippery slope that everyone causes some level of harm to others, but the level of harm is far apart.

Also, I don't know if Burgess intended this or maybe I'm just misinterpreting something, but the last chapter made me think about something. The whole book is about Alex being controlled by others, but at the end, he's controlled by his own subconscious desires. He wants a baby because his subconscious mind desires it and he can't find pleasure in ultraviolence anymore. Isn't that a bit similar to what the government was doing to him with the Ludovico Technique, except, instead of pain and sickness, it's a more deeper unhappiness. We're controlled by our subconscious whether we like it or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you might like Kaiba. It's pretty different from the Divergent type dystopias you see in YA. It's about a world where memories can be stored in chips and transferred from body to body.  </TEXT>
