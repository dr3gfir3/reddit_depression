	<TEXT> I run a Jewellery company and its really tough. We did a market at the weekend and we sell fun rings for kids. A little boy bought a mario  ring and his dad bought him a pikachu one. He put one on each middle finger and ran around having adventures and making them talk to each other. It was so sweet and he was so happy it made me remember why I love what I do.  </TEXT>

"So are we all in agreement?"

"Are you serious? This is a joke. She doesn't even own a car. Have you seen her bank balance? No way. Count me out" said Wealth. He slammed his fist on the table. 

Charity snorted. "Look how the last few winners turned out. It's time for a change around here. Your Ferrari club is over."

"You two stop it. This is serious." They looked at the floor.

"But just look at her daughter's face... She raised her, she adores her" cried Family, holding back tears. "Alone." Said Tradition with a disapproving cough. Faith shook her head, "through no fault of her own, she was abandoned. She is a wonderful mother and deserves to win. Look at all the good she's done, the children she has inspired, the lives she has changed".

Logic pulled out his spreadsheet. "She's directly impacted 2172 people positively. 716 by a life changing degree. Indirectly, we're talking tens of thousands. And her negative metrics are the lowest we've seen in decades." 

Love smiled, "she has a wonderful heart and she's shown love to so many." Fame frowned "I understand, I do, but she's barely more than a well known community figure. Is her impact global? I don't think so".

Truth looked at the others, "the clock's ticking folks".

They looked around the table, shuffling papers, photographs, newspaper cuttings. 

Wisdom cleared her throat. "Though she is only one person, if everyone was like her, the world be a better place". "She's basically carbon neutral!" Nature interjected. "As I was saying, her kindness, gentleness and encouragement have had a life changing impact on those around her. Her work with children and vulnerable people have reduced reoffending, increased education levels, improved wellbeing and brought about a much higher level of hope. In one of the poorest and most dangerous areas in her country. She is brave, determined and she has stood up for justice. In my humble opinion, she's won."

"Well that's that then." 

Three of them left the room. </TEXT>
