	<TEXT> Male here. Is he on any type of medication? If not, maybe he's losing interest and just can not bear telling you. I have never stopped hardcore fucking an SO, unless I lost interest; but at least I explained it to her. Maybe to him, you're a sex addict that is never sated. the best thing to do is ask him.
