	<TEXT> Ugh, I'm sorry Jina... We also got bad news regarding an SA recently but all we got was the lab results, with 1% normal morphology and a "comment" that read: teratozoospermia. So now we're waiting for my SO to meet his GP to see what he says next Tuesday, then we have our first appointment at a fertility clinic on May 23rd, and like you, I have no idea what to expect between " It's not so bad and can be fixed with vitamins etc" or "IVF with ICSI is your only option"... :(
I hope you get better news next time..

u/HermesHippie I'm still new to MFI stuff, what do you mean when you say morphology is trickier than other metrics? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aww I totally get you... I also held off on running and signing up for races thinking I'd be pregnant, but that just made it doubly worse when race day swung around, I was out of shape and NOT pregnant... so I started doing the opposite haha, started up again and signed up for 4 races of varying lengths this season (so far), the last one being my second half-marathon at the end of August. This way I have a goal that makes me feel good when TTC ain't going so well, and "worst-case" scenario, I get pregnant and have to sell my bib! I try to see it as a win-win...

I wish you the best of luck and honestly, running feels so good for clearing your head, I encourage you to pick it up again :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ahhh crap that sucks... we're in a similar boat, my SO's first Sa came back with just 1% normal morphology, which equates with pregnancy being possible only with IVF and ICSI... however, all the ladies on here have said not to panic before getting more answers, and a 2nd SA, as numbers can vary quite a bit between 2 different SA's... SO has a follow-up with his GP next week which will hopefully give us some info, and then we meet an RE on May 23rd, which is when I'm expecting real answers and a game plan... which will hopefully not be straight to IVF. Add to that my shitty cycles and we're a fertility nightmare!

I wish you the best of luck and hopefully some positive answers with a 2nd SA!! Keep us posted </TEXT>

I'm 10DPO today and since getting the results from SO's SA last week (that weren't great), I just know that even though I managed to ovulate on CD50, there's like zero chance we can conceive without help, so I'm just waiting on my 16-day LP to finish :(

Nothing else happening this week, we start getting answers May 9th when SO has a follow-up with his GP regarding the SA result, then RE appointment on the 23rd. It seems like so far away. </TEXT>

How many IUI tries are you doing before moving to IVF? And how is this decided? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We got a kick in the gut yesterday... my SO got his SA results.... 1% normal morphology. I've just skimmed the surface of what that means, but it seems that we're definitely going to need intervention, and most likely IVF... he was so crushed, I didn't even have room to be crushed for myself yet because I feel so bad for him. All along my cycles seemed to be the problem and they're far from ideal, but I never would have thought that we'd be dealing with MFI as well. For now, all we can do is wait for the RE appointment on May 23rd, but I don't know what to think, what to feel... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for this. I'm also getting tired of bearing this alone and having found out yesterday SO's sperm is 99% abnormal, seems like we're far from out of the woods. TTC is hard, infertility is just plain inhuman and shitty. I refuse to stay silent in order not to make others uncomfortable. It's our reality now, and the more people are educated, the more they can be comprehensive and keep their shitty comments to themselves...

	<TEXT> Ugh, if I had a dollar for each time I've been told that fucking sentence....

I've taken to launching into a fertility crash course to educate all these well-meaning but ignorant people. You can't get pregnant if you don't ovulate. You can't get pregnant if the sperm ain't good. The sperm needs to meet the fucking egg, which only appears for a few hours every MONTH (if you're lucky enough to have a regular cycle, not my case). Then I explain how temping and OPKs is not obsessing, it's giving me valuable information that so far has shown me I have ovulated exactly 3 times in 9 months. It usually shuts them up for a while lol </TEXT>

From what I know they're supposed to start treating at 4.5-5, and suggestion for TTC and 1st trimester are ever lower, at 2.5-3 as a maximum.

I so get you not being able to open your dang mouth in the doctor's office, been there done that and now I'm learning to better advocate for myself when I feel strongly about something. Good luck, I hope things get fixed for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awww *hugs*

I feel you on the baby shower thing... My best friend, who started TTC at the same time as me, is now 36 weeks pregnant. I absolutely did not feel up to the task of organizing a baby shower and it was months before I could be around her without wanting to curl up in a ball andd cry my eyes out. She's just the reminder of exactly how long we've been trying, and also the reflection of where I could be right now....

Anyway, nobody else stepped up for the shower so I ended up organizing the whole thing... And at the actual event, there were 3 babies under 3 months... That shit was hard, but I got through it despite how hard it was for me...

I think patience and forgiveness is a great mantra and I might be borrowing it from you :)
Hang in there and good luck </TEXT>

Did you go a whole year without a period since coming off BC? If so, I tip my hat to you, been off BC since August and cycles have been shit, but at least I've had 3 periods since then :/

I'm glad for you that your body seems to be getting it's shit together! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... Stilllllll fucking WTO on CD42, so I've made myself a hell of a to-do list in anticipation of the Easter long weekend. I got a few small things done, mostly cleaning and putting away winter coats and boots (yay spring!), and now I have to motivate myself to work on my Master's...

Seeing my doctor on Tuesday and as always, stressed about it because I don't feel like she listens to me that much, I feel like she judges me because I'd like to know what the fuck is going on with my body, AND I want to ask for an extension of my work leave.... I'm going to practice hard advocating for myself this weekend, wish me luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awww man that really sucks, I'm sorry he doesn't understand :(

My SO was a little bit like that in the first few months, telling me we should try to not take it too stressfully at first, saying it's normal it takes time... Fast forward to 8 months trying, only 2 ovulations, and his recent SA for which he has a follow-up appointment on May 9th (which might be because it wasn't great), he is starting to feel the discouragement and the sadness, and is now more understanding of how this whole TTC thing really is stressful no matter how hard you try to relax.

I hope you feel better today and that next cycle is your lucky one! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I've had 2 different rounds of bloodowrk done with nothing really abnormal, except my TSH which is too high for TTC and 1st trimester from what I hear, but my doctor won't medicate for the level I have... And I had 2 ultrasounds which were normal... Same here I have to wait but I'm asking my GP to refer me to a gyno or an RE so that I can get better answers soon.

My SO had an SA done recently and has a follow-up with his doctor about that on May 9th, which is too fucking far away, expecially since I'm afraid it wasn't great if he needs a follow-up appointment...

So it's all in the waiting, and I am not a patient person haha so it sucks real bad.. </TEXT>

Exactly, I don't get why they don't work to get it under control before pregnancy, especially as it's super important right at the beginning... It's not logical, sometimes it feels like all they want to do is push meds, and other times they won't fix something that is easily fixed... </TEXT>

Anyway, I'll try again next week to get some sort of answer for what I should do next, because I can't continue sitting like this not doing anything, when obviously it's not working! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you... Yes it sucks because I feel like an obsessive maniac hypochondriac every time I mention anything to my doctor!
My TSH has been at 3.7-3.9 since October and she insists that it's not cause for meds or a referral to an endocrinologist despite my Mom having Hashimoto's, my grandma having thyroid problems as well, me being extra-tired all the time and my cycles staying long and irregular, with 2 ovulations in 8 months... I'm getting pissed but feel pretty helpless as I don't know who to turn to next for medical advice... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I get it, it sucks.. Your temps are really nice haha I don't know if it's normal to be that steady, but a temp shift will be super obvious for you!

As for OPKs, me too, I do have a second line but it's always lighter than the control and it seems to just darken, then lighten, then darken again... I don't know what time is best to take it either so I usually do it between 12 and 4 p.m...

Anyway, hang in there and good luck!

Edited to add: have you seen a doctor about your cycles? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They said it wasn't urgent... Ugh..

I'll keep pushing for him to at least get a copy of the results this week... But I mean, if the results weren't great, don't they sometimes do a second test? If he needs to go back for a 2nd SA, shouldn't he go sooner rather than later? Or is it better to wait 2-3 months for the sperm to have time to generate a new batch?

Anyway, this whole thing sucks as I know you know, Coog. Thanks for the support </TEXT>

I don't know why the wait is so long, it's killing me... He went in for the SA on March 22, got the call for a follow-up yesterday and they give him an appointment in a month... I just hope that the results aren't catastrophic, I would hope they'd see him quicker if they were THAT bad... :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sitting here on CD41 of cycle 4 still waiting to ovulate. 8 months in, that's not where I'd imagined I'd be. My doctor is so nonchalant, so I feel like I always have to push to get things to move... I'm going to have to beg for a referral to someone that will help me, because all my doctor does is say "we'll see how things go and if it's not regulating in a few months we'll do more testing".

SO went for an SA a few weeks ago and his doctor called for him to go see him to discuss the results... on May 9th. It's so far away, and I feel like if everything was perfect with his SA he wouldn't need to go back, right?

I'm feeling pretty bummed, because I know that my body is being an ass and I've expected that I'd need some intervention of some sort to ovulate properly, but I didn't think that he would have problems too, I sent him for an SA just to be sure that things were fine on his end.... Now I have to wait almost a month to find out what's going on with him :(

On my first cycle I wanted to just stop completely just to be sure.... well I can tell you that 8 months later I am firmly in the "drink til it's pink" club, because you can't just stop living while TtC or you'll go crazy... of course with moderation, but today I wouldn't give up my glass of wine easily! :)
And exercise is so good for feeling better and destressing :) </TEXT>

I don't have Hashimoto's (my mom does but was diagnosed after she had kids so I don't think it affected her when TtC), but my TsH has been running high for a long while, last number I got was 3.9 in February. But my doctor won't do anything about it despite my asking, even though I have only ovulated twice in 8 months... I'm going to ask for a referral to a gyno or an RE or an endocrinologist because it worries me, what if my TsH is part of the reason why my cycles aren't regulating?  Anyway sorry for hijacking your post, I guess I'm just worried and felt the need to let it out with people who'd understand. </TEXT>
