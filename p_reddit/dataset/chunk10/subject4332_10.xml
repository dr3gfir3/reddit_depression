	<TEXT> I believe that is correct. The trick will be for the senate which will require a bill that is more moderate to somehow weave it together with the very conservative bill the house passed. If the senate gives them something that the Freedom Caucus won't sign off on then I'm not sure what will happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have repeatedly used tomato sauce and cut tomato in my ovens with no issues. Just be sure to touch up your seasoning when you get home if necessary. I'm a big proponent of this method:

I've used it for Boy Scout dutch ovens and even with the abuse they take the seasoning is in decent shape. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would think based on the rough texture of the interior that it is not enameled. My wife has a Le Creuset for her cooktop and the interior is enameled and super smooth.

To me I think the only part that is enameled on yours is the bottom - but I'm not holding it in my hands... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Each briquette is 25F so you would be applying 400F to the bottom of that oven. Typically I try to cook from the top down so yes I would think that would cause you issues.

However, of the oven on top is a smaller size then perhaps the coals outside of the 'directly underneath' the oven won't have the full impact.

Here is a link where someone stacks 3 and tells you how they do the coals:
