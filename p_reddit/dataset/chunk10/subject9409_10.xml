	<TEXT> I don't think millennials are reluctant to go into a trade - the job market, overall, is tighter and labor regulations are looser. Wage growth has stalled and Canada lost 35,000 full-time jobs, adding 31,000 part-time jobs. Full-time jobs are going away.

	<TITLE> Instagram's top competitors in 2017 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-11 01:58:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just wrote an overview of competitors for Instagram that I found in 2017, and thought you guys might be interested. Did I miss any? Who would you consider a threat to Instagram in 2017? Snapchat aside (their marketshare is declining). 

Sorted the competitors into two areas - ones threatening its monopoly on young people, and the other threatening its unique value proposition (photo sharing). Here's the full post: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/who-are-instagrams-biggest-competitors-in-2017/

**Instagram Competitors: What Are the Kids Using?**

According to market research data from 2016, Generation Z is branching out to new social platforms. Teenagers still use Instagram and Instagram messengers to stay in touch with friends, but theyre branching out to new platforms as well.

Kik: This messaging platform allows users to text for free, with no limits. As more teens move to the platform, Instagram messaging might lose its appeal. Kik also allows in-app photo taking and sharing, for group messages that centre around snapshots and dank memes.

Musical.ly: Why share videos on Instagram when you can build a fanbase on Musical.ly? For the approximate 1 in 3 middle schoolers who view themselves as the next Beyonce, Musical.ly is the perfect social network. The platform allows users to assemble not just followers, but dedicated fans. As of December 2016, 70 million people had registered as Musical.ly users. Thats a lot of Beyonce covers.

**Instagram Competitors: Start-Ups**

Snapchat and Periscope didnt exist 5 years ago. Instagrams next big competitor could come out of nowhere, too.

Kuaishou: You may not have heard of this photo sharing app out of China, but we will all learn how to pronounce it soon (koo-ay-shoo? kwa-i-shoo? Send help). The app just secured a 350 million injection of funding from Tencent, after an initial round that drew investments from Sequoia and Baidu. You will want to translate this page, as the app looks poised to reach North American users soon.

Path: Is it fair to call Path a startup? Path was founded in 2010. Promising a more personal web experience, Path is one of the most-followed photo sharing startups on AngelList. Path has raised more than $55 million, but has struggled this year to gain market share. Largely due to

Camarilla: Not to be confused with caramilla, which is complimentary slang for someone cute with tan skin. Camarilla allows messaging and photo sharing with just 15 people. The app takes Instagrams private account feature a step further  you cant publish publicly, or have a long follower list. The network allows for intimate, conversational sharing, which just might be the future of social media marketing. </TEXT>

I have a lot of problems with that, but your values aside, the birth rate in Africa is the issue, not the death rate. Birth control and family planning foreign aid helped deal with the birth rate problem, particularly in countries where women have few rights and can't choose the number of children they have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of influencers artificially inflate their audience numbers - and their influence. Sitting down with them before you sign them and running their follower list through an auditing service can be a good step to add to your process. 

Do you audit your influencers now? How do you ensure their audience is real? Interested in hearing different methods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the premise of the book, as summarized in the Semley review: "Simply: Boomers are sociopaths. Theyre antisocial and unburdened by conscience. They squander prosperity, ravage the land of wealth and salt the earth so that the seeds of some future fortune may never again find purchase. As Gibney  a prominent venture capitalist and sometimes-writer  lays it out, his books driving thesis is that Americas present dilemma resulted substantially and directly from choices made by the baby boomers."

The review looks at the quality of the analysis in the book, weighing the evidence it presents against some of its more provocative statements (like the whole sociopath thing).  </TEXT>

"The amendments would make unpaid positions in federal sectors illegal unless theyre part of a formal educational program.

I think its a good first and I think it reflects a really egregious gap in federal labour laws, where unpaid interns working did not have any real protections under the Canada Labour Code, Cash told the Star.

The devil is always in the details with these things and well see what it looks like when they table legislation, but for everyone who has been working on this issue for many years I think this is a good day." </TEXT>

In your list, you want to look at a few key metrics to identify bots and ghost followers: 

 * Ratio of followers/following
 * Latest tweet time
 * Location
 * Bio

Crowdbabble offers follower lists for any Twitter account (we are compiling one on Donald Trump) - link here: https://www.crowdbabble.com/download-all-twitter-followers/ A few other social media analytics companies do as well.

	<TEXT> TL;DR: Before you sign a deal, make sure your influencer's followers are real. 

Crowdbabble has developed a new tool to detect and list the bot/ghost followers of an Instagram account. Once you've found an Instagram influencer that you'd like to work with, you can use the tool to audit their audience. You don't want to pay for access to 2 million Instagram followers when only 500,000 of them are real. Here's a write up of why you might consider an audience audit before signing an influencer: https://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/influencer-marketing-on-instagram-how-influential-is-your-influencer-really/

Found this quote, and I love the rhythm. It just rolls: "We were hockey gypsies, heading down another gravel road every weekend, plowing into the heart of that magnificent northern landscape. We never gave a thought to being deprived as we travelled, to being shut out of the regular league system. We never gave a thought to being Indian. Different. We only thought of the game and the brotherhood that bound us together off the ice, in the van, on the plank floors of reservation houses, in the truck stop diners where if we'd won we had a little to splurge on a burger and soup before we hit the road again. Small joys. All of them tied together, entwined to form an experience we would not have traded for any other. We were a league of nomads, mad for the game, mad for the road, mad for ice and snow, an Arctic wind on our faces and a frozen puck on the blade of our sticks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to being an author, he was also an advocate against Canada's residential school system. He wrote a very powerful letter on the subject, excerpt below:

"I am a victim of Canadas residential school system. When I say victim, I
mean something substantially different than Survivor. I never attended a
residential school, so I cannot say that I survived one. However, my parents
and my extended family members did. The pain they endured became my
pain, and I became a victim.
When I was born, my family still lived the seasonal nomadic life of traditional
Ojibwa people. In the great rolling territories surrounding the Winnipeg
River in Northwestern Ontario, they fished, hunted, and trapped. Their years
were marked by the peregrinations of a people guided by the motions and
turns of the land. I came into the world and lived in a canvas army tent hung
from a spruce bough frame as my first home. The first sounds I heard were the
calls of loon, the snap and crackle of a fire, and the low, rolling undulation of Ojibwa talk..."

	<TEXT> It's from StatsCan: https://betterdwelling.com/city/toronto/toronto-has-over-99000-unoccupied-homes-heres-where-they-are-interactive/#_

The worst areas are downtown, where almost 9% of apartments are vacant. That's not to say that they are available to rent and aren't currently being rented, but they're not on the rental market at all and are just unoccupied.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why build new ones when so many sit vacant, I guess? Entire condo towers in Vancouver and Toronto are mostly empty. Toronto has 100,000 unoccupied homes. 

There's also nowhere to build houses but on farmland, which is like destroying a working factory and replacing it with houses. Destroys a lot of full-time jobs.  </TEXT>
