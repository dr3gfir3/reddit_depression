	<TEXT> First generation is my childhood so I approve.

I'm sorry for the mixed responses, but I hope all family interactions go well. Do you lean towards one sex or the other currently? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard to say there's one thing that defines me, but I can try to give a few...

My love of sports is in everything I do and I'm extremely knowledgable on the subject. I follow many sports closely and spend a huge amount of time on them. 

My skills with speaking and working with others has been a huge part of my life. I've always been a natural leader and I'm able to connect with peers at levels that others cannot. I can empathize better than most and I'm a great listener and problem solver as well.

My relationship right now means a ton to me. I can't say that it's everything (I am young, after all), but she plays probably the largest role in my life out of any of my personal connections.

Sorry I couldn't provide that one killer answer, but I feel those are the traits that really make me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's definitely not a cause, although I feel it does add pressure to succeed and fit this "ideal" that people have been expecting of me for years now. Fitting that role can be at times taxing and it's difficult when I feel I am not living up to it despite knowing (when thinking rationally, at least) that I should not live by other's expectations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem, that's what I'm here for! I'll take these one by one...

1. I think I developed depression as a combination of biological predisposition and environmental factors. Both my father and grandfather have gone through it to varying degrees. Also, low self esteem and a childhood with some problems brought it out more, although at the same time I cannot definitively say if the environmental factors were normal and just interpreted as worse due to my biological disposition.

2. I wouldn't necessarily say so. I am proud of where I am in my life and the steps I have taken. There are days when I feel unhappy about it all and feel like I'm a disappointment/failure, but I can rationalize through that much better lately.

3. Yes, I've had close relations all my life. I'm the type of person that people always say they'd "never guess I was the one who'd have this." Close friends all my life and good relationships with girls as well. Family has recently become much more complicated, but I am close to my sister and also my mother to varying degrees.

4. There are some days where classes feel pointless and that they're doing nothing for my life, but in general this isn't the case. In high school, this sentiment was much greater. But since university began and I actually got to specialize my learning to what I enjoy I take much greater meaning from class. I learn classes I enjoy and tend to memorize in those I don't.

5. I make sure I balance my social and academic life. It was a priority going into college as I feel it helps me maintain my mental health much better. I study less than others and have fun, but still study enough to get good marks. There's always instances of "why the hell am I not studying right now?", but I feel all college students have been there.

6. It can help improve your mental health I believe, but I don't think this is a strategy that can just help you "get over" depression. I've come to accept that I'm never going to "get over" it, rather I'm going to live with it my whole life. However, focusing your efforts towards something definitely helps manage it better. I didn't really have anything like that in high school besides sports. Now in college, with class, relationship, and sports, I feel I live a balanced life and a busy one, so my focus stays off depression. It comes back often, but it doesn't linger as strong as it used to.

7. I wouldn't say I'm overcoming my inner-self. Instead, I'd say I'm learning to live with who I am and accepting it. However, at the same time, I work to improve myself always. Rationalization is key to this and has helped me control it immensely.

8. I would never tell someone they must see a doctor if they're not comfortable with the idea. If you go to therapy and don't want to be there, you won't gain anything from it- ever. Instead, I'd encourage them to find someone or some means of communicating how they are feeling to others, and go from there. I resisted medication and therapy for a long time, so I can empathize with not wanting to turn to that first.

Hopefully I answered these adequately. If there's anything I missed/you want me to expand on though, just let me know! I appreciate the kind words and support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stay strong. It's going to be tough, but look back on the progress you've made already. From realizing you needed help, to getting help through medication, to returning to work- these are all huge steps that show you have fight in you. So go into work tomorrow realizing how far you've already come and how each day is taking another step further. And if you can't deal with that tomorrow, try again the next day. Either way, I'm proud of the progress you've made since I know all too well how easy it is to give up. Good luck tomorrow and PM me if you ever need to talk/some encouragement :) </TEXT>
