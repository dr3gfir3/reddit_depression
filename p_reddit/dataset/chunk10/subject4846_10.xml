	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> so here i am re building my happy birthday trap at midnight, when i hear a soft song from a female cannibal. not the usual AH AH! into the night calling for reinforcements but instead something that actually sounded like a song. i dare not follow her, as my main concern was rebuilding the happy birthday. the next morning i found 2 effigies added around my base. just curious if anyone has heard her before. i have been wearing red paint for 2 nights now and my sanity is still at 74%. </TEXT>
