	<TEXT> Reddit is unique because of it numerous aspects. But one thing that I love about it is its anonymity and its community. 

But if in the foreseeable future people start promoting their profiles to make them look impressive, than there won't be any contribution to the actual discussion.

 Plus the activity feature for me is quite unsettling, because I don't want anyone to know what I'm doing on the sight...
