	<TEXT> I'm in a longterm, live-in relationship with my boyfriend. He and I are in a DD/LG relationship, and it's my first real experience in any kind of definite D/S relationship. I feel so comfortable and happy as a sub, but sometimes letting Daddy fuck my face as a special treat gets very...monotonous. I love it, and I'm great at it, but I just wish there were more things I could do to surprise him and serve him. I'd love to be able to keep him guessing. Any advice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just held it as if I was going to purchase it, shopped around until I got to my blind spot, then ducked to look at stuff on the bottom shelf, quickly detagged it and slid it in my purse while "digging in my purse for my phone". I stood up, strolled around looking at other items, and walked out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The food aisle. But I mostly just do push outs, so I guess a blind spot doesn't matter that much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I didn't buy anything. I've been lifting at target for over a year and never got caught. It could still happen, but I've learned a lot and I'm much more careful than when I started. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes!! Ask for items they don't have if employees bug you. I usually ask where their Kat Von D makeup is.  if a palette has a sensor, it's usually an RFID sticker and you can see it on the outside. Just peel it off. Be careful about ditching packages because they'll eventually catch onto you. But I have a big purse, so I just take the de-tagged palettes to my blind spot and I look at items on a low shelf and slide the palettes into my purse.

Ulta LP is regional and is only in certain stores a few times a year. But look out for the manager. Ulta managers usually leave kinda early so I'd advise hitting them later in the day, like after 7:00. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah, I have both boxes. I just peeled off the RFID tags. And there is AP for Sephora but AP for Ulta is regional so they are only there a few times a year. Managers are the only people you really have to look out for but they typically get done with their work early in the evening. I usually go to Ulta after 7:00. </TEXT>
