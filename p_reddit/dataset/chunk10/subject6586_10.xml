	<TEXT> No you shouldn't have to create a Facebook account if you don't have one already, but you'll need one if you want to use the Facebook reminders for videos. 

Otherwise if you don't want to watch live you can wait for the edited videos to go on YouTube, we'll post a link in here if that's ok with the mods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Thursday 11 May we will be welcoming a number of renowned linguistics to the University of Reading for a workshop on 'Generative Linguistics in the 21st Century: The Evidence and the Rhetoric', hosted by the School of Psychology and Clinical Language Sciences. 

The workshop features a keynote talk by Professor Chomsky and plenaries from 9 other renowned linguists, including Professor Adriana Belleti, Professor Hagit Borer, Professor Stephen Crain, Professor Tanja Kupisch, Professor Terje Lohndal, Professor Luigi Rizzi, Professor Ian Roberts, Professor Ianthi Tsimpli, and Professor Charles Yang. All working on formal linguistic theory and its application to acquisition and processing in children and adult learners. The day culminates in a moderated panel discussion with all our invited speakers, where audience members can ask questions.
	
The purpose of this workshop is to present and consider the evidence that still points in this direction, while at the same time sifting through and seriously considering the rhetoric that in recent years has rejected the general tenets of generative linguistics. In doing so, we will examine the role of generative linguistics at present and consider where it will be going as the 21st century unfolds. 

The entire workshop will be filmed and made available online, but **Professor Chomsky's presentation and the final panel discussion will be streamed live on the University of Reading's Facebook page** from 1530 BST: http://rdg.ac/2pOokcB  </TEXT>
