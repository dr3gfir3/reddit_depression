	<TITLE> Does anyone know where to buy a Mermaid Frappuccino? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Does anyone know where to buy a Mermaid Frappuccino in Baltimore that isnt a lake infested with bloodthirsty dead people? I tried to go buy one after I found an ad for it online, but I ended up having to fucking fight for my life against a bunch of reanimated corpses that bobbed up from the bottom of a lake.

Hey everybody. Its me again. I finally got my shower fixed. Thanks for the lack of good plumber recommendations. Yall suck.

Anywaymy main man Roscoe got out of prison about a week ago. Ever since he got out and got clean, Roscoe has been trying to live life to the fullest and that means doing stuff like yoga, reading and cutting back on crack and heroin. *BORINGGGGG*.

So when Roscoe heard about the Unicorn Frappuccino, he went nuts. I swear to god, hes a little girl in the body of a 300-pound Asian dude with an eye patch.

The problem is, Starbucks stopped selling them on Sunday.

Call me a softy, but it really killed me when I realized Id have to break the news to him. I assumed there must be some other kind of mystical creature overpriced coffee drink out there so one night, after a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 (Blue Raspberry, of course), I dove into the world wide webs.

Thats where I found the website for the Mermaid Frappuccino.

It didnt really *look* like the Starbucks website. It featured this gnarly blue drink topped with puke-green whipped cream. It looked like crystal meth in a cup. Im talking cleaning-solution blue, with big chunks of who-the-hell-knows-what floating in it. I think I saw an eyeball in there, maybe.

Right below it were some words in really small print:

*SINK BELOW*
*PEEL THE FLESH FROM YOUR BONES*
*LET YOUR LUNGS COLLAPSE*
*CONSUMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEE*
*LOCH RAVEN RESERVOIR*
*MIDNIGHT*

I assumed those were trendy hashtags Starbucks was using to promote its brand, but #peelthefreshfromyourbones just wasnt doing it for me. Loch Raven Reservoir was a big-ass lake in Baltimore County, so I thought they were cashing in locally on the caffeinated creature craze.

As for the drink I guess if you turned your head and squinted and were colorblind, it kind of looked good.

Luckily, Roscoe *is* colorblind, farsighted and a little cockeyed, so when I showed him the drink, he was PUMPED. I thought it looked sketchy as hell, but when Roscoe gave me those bloodshot, twitchy puppy eyes, I just couldnt resist.

Anyway, Roscoe couldnt drive because right before he went to prison he gunned his car into a 7/11 because he was coked up and wanted a Hot Pocket, so I had to take the wheel.

We jumped into Lupe Fiasco, my Ford Pinto, and were off. I wanted to get there on time for Roscoe.

I was pretty sure they didnt sell Frappuccinos at Loch Raven Reservoir, but Roscoe said his prison therapist always told him to expect the unexpected. I think he was referring to prison murder attempts, but I appreciated the sentiment anyway.

We rolled into the reservoir parking lot a few minutes after midnight. The place was dead silent and dead empty.

Roscoe jumped out of the car, running up to the edge of the water. It was pitch black on the beach and the water was still as glass. I looked around. No Starbucks in sight. Roscoes face fell. It hurt my heart to see him so disappointed.

Suddenly, a high-pitched screech ripped the air like a loud fart.

Roscoe and I both shrieked. The air was filled with a hellish mix of our screams. All of the noise really aggravated my chronic tinnitus, which I developed after DJing at Baltimores premiere strip club, *Bitches R Us*.

I slammed my hands over my ears. The lake started to violently bubble and churn, frothing white. A stench like the worst fart youve ever smelled filled the air. Im sorry I keep using these fart metaphors, but Im just trying to set the scene in a realistic way.

I realized maybe it wasnt the best idea to visit a lake at midnight because something on the Internet said theyd be a Frappuccino there.

The screaming suddenly stopped. The water stopped churning, the smell disappeared. Everything went quiet.

Something bobbed up a few feet away from the shore. Roscoe and I exchanged looks and then inched towards the edge of the water.

It was a bloated, nasty-ass looking corpse. Its tongue poked from its mouth and one of its eyes was hanging loose.

Baltimore County had really gone to the fucking dogs. I was not completely shocked that there was a corpse in the source of our drinking water.

I was hoping this was all a really imaginative marketing ploy, and the corpse would have the Frappuccino in its hand.

Instead, it slowly turned its head towards us with a series of sharp cracks. I heard Roscoe whimper.

*Saaaacccrrriiifffiiicccceeeee*, it hissed.

More corpses bobbed to the surface of the lake, all of their heads splintering around to stare at us.

And then they started flailing towards shore.

Roscoe and I finally realized there was no Mermaid Frappuccino here.

We bolted towards the lights of the parking lot. I made the mistake of looking behind my shoulder to see the corpses *sprinting* at us, going full on Usain Bolt.

I turned back around and suddenly realized Roscoe was gone. It was pitch black and hard to see anything, but I couldnt even hear his chains rattling as he ran. My heart slammed against my chest. I was terrified, zombies were chasing me, I didnt know where my best friend was, and I was totally out of shape.

My foot snagged on a branch and I sprawled over, getting a face full of sand. The fall ripped a sob out of me as I crawled behind a big rock, trying to hide from the zombies.

At that point, covered in snot and sand and about to be killed by zombies, I considered my life.

I thought I had it all figured out I laid off the Patron, quit Tinder and had my best friend back in my life. Didnt matter. I was still sitting behind a rock, crying like a baby. I didnt know what else I could do, but it still felt like there was this hole in my heart that I couldnt drown with MadDog 20/20 or plug up with McGangbangs, a delicious McDonalds secret menu item that involves a McChicken stuffed between a Double Cheeseburger.

What the hell was wrong with me, besides my alcohol dependency, lack of proper diet and exercise, and occasional hard drug habit? Why was I even in this crazy situation, just for one goddamn Frappucino?

Roscoe flashed through my mind again. I hoped he was okay. Suddenly, I realized I didnt care if I got out of this alive but I sure as hell cared if Roscoe did.

A very confusing light bulb went off in my head.

And then a shrieking corpse lunged at me.

I screamed. Another flash of movement behind the corpse. A sudden crunch as a prison shank went directly through the back of the zombies head.

Roscoe tossed the corpse aside and grabbed my hand to pull me up. I was suddenly overcome with emotion. I realized what meant the most to me in life.

The answer was standing right in front of me 67, eye patch, twitchy.

Roscoe.

In the heat of passion I latched onto Roscoes face with my mouth. I kiss like a lamprey. He looked surprised for a hot minute before he pried me off of him and then turned around to face the twenty other corpses running at us.

I picked up a rock. Roscoe wiped off his prison shank on his cargo shorts. We gave each other a knowing look. 

It was time to say fuck this and get out of there.

We sprinted back to the parking lot and peeled out. Lupe went 0 to 60 in 45.8.

The car ride back was quiet, and not just because we were both mentally scarred by what had happened and would probably need years of therapy to cope with it.

I was a little scared that Roscoe didnt return my feelings, but halfway through the drive he grabbed my hand and grinned at me.

I grinned back.

Ever since then, life has been good except for one thing. Roscoe is still fixed on that goddamn mermaid diabetes drink.

So if anyone knows where to get a Mermaid Frappuccino thats not an infested reservoir filled with dead people, Id really appreciate it. Also dont suggest me DIY shit because Im terrible at it.

Thanks. </TEXT>

Do you know how many of these messages we get a month? At least two. And they are just as arrogant. You could be ALooc or Bloodworth and I would still disagree with you. Nosleep is growing, and more people means more varied content. In fact, I've seen some spectacularly creative stories. Some stories will be bad, but who are you to be the ultimate judge?


Every time I see a "bad" nosleep story, I'm going to upvote it and comment, in the hopes that it will be you.

But why hide your identity? </TEXT>
