	<TEXT> There's no issue with PayPal. The last 2 shoes I specifically asked for qc and he responded with things like "of course" and "as usual" which gave me the impression that he will always qc. I guess this is my bad but he shipped ems instead of dhl which is kinda douche. Just wanna know if I'm at any risk with these payment methods. Will from sneakerforward btw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently saw a post about how you shouldn't put up with the bullshit some of these sellers pull. Had a seller ship v2 blade triple whites without qc pics and through ems (just received the tracking number about 5 hours ago and the package apparently doesn't exist. Checked in ems.com and 17tracking. Please let me know if this is normal) when I payed $2 more for dhl (more of a principle thing than money, don't really give a fuck about the  $2). I emailed him about it because that's how we've been communicating. Depending on how he responds I may tear him a new asshole and call him out here so you guys know not to buy from him. Just want to know if he can financially fuck me with when I payed with PayPal and a privacy burner card if I decide to call him out. Thanks. </TEXT>
