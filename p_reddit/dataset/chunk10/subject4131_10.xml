	<TEXT> I'm shocked but I think I understand. Thank god you were here to help. You are saying that the man may not be a ghost at all. This man may be a living, normal human who purchased my home after me and my wife died, and we are the ghosts. I'm not sure how it happened, I can't remember when we transitioned to the afterlife. Now that it's dawned on me my world has definitely changed into a darker, shadowy realm. Thank you for your guidance, I must make the rest of my journey alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a victim of workplace bullying and the only film that can help me relax was this movie that they showed on VHS in the common room when I was in the ward. I watched it 100s of times but the beginning with the title was cut off and we weren't allowed to see the cassette. I'm out now and trying to find it. There were these little flying robots in an old apartment building, one of them got cooked on the grill like a hamburger! They cut the title off because one of the other patients would become enraged if the saw the name Hume, so one of the people in it was called that, if it helps. Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a producer and I'm thinking about making a movie about workplace bullying about my experiences. I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Is this a movie you think you would enjoy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in a crowded train station and I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. As usual, I decided to pass the time in the bathroom by playing games on my mobile device. That's when I let my guard down. Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>
