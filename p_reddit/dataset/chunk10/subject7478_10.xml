	<TEXT> I broke my nose working as a computer technician.

The company had built a second floor into their office and, rather than build a proper set of stairs, they took a set of stairs on wheels and attached them to the upper floor. They then cut the top rail off, leaving the bottom rail for stability.

On my first week on the job, I was very carefully carrying a customer's computer up the stairs for repair. And I forgot about the bar. Tripped over it. Computer landed upright on the ground. I landed on the computer. Face went completely numb.

Ended up in the bathroom, face still numb from shock, and had the foresight to put my nose back in place while I still couldn't feel it. At which point my coworker almost threw up, and asked me to take the rest of the day off.

Still have a little dent, right in the middle of the bridge, to this day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could probably do it using a steam streaming box. You could also buy a wireless HDMI transmitter and gut a wireless USB controller to power your controls. Would mean they could be up to thirty feet apart.

	<TEXT> I think the part that's often not spoken about is how hard it is to get over being overweight in your mind. I spent a lot of years at near 400, and people would often say "Its not that bad" or flat out "You're not fat, stop saying that about yourself"

From people I've spoken to, I think the getting over "being ugly in your mind" is the hardest thing to do. I question if I will ever feel as if I look fantastic. But I'll hopefully have many extra years to work on that, thanks to the changes I've made now. </TEXT>
