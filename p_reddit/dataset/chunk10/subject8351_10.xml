	<TEXT>  The Democrats have said some of the worst things about James Comey, including the fact that he should be fired, but now they play so sad! Mr. Trump wrote in an early morning post on Twitter.

 Comey lost the confidence of almost everyone in Washington, Republican and Democrat alike, he added in another post shortly afterward. When things calm down, they will be thanking me!

 The tweets followed a similar one posted late Tuesday night specifically targeting Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Senate Democratic leader. Cryin Chuck Schumer stated recently, I do not have confidence in him (James Comey) any longer. Then acts so indignant. #drainthe swamp.

	<TEXT>  The choice of DeVos sparked immediate backlash last week among many students and alumni of the Florida university, who signed a petition asking the school to rescind her invitation. The petition referenced an "unsettling" remark made in February by DeVos, who praised historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs) as "pioneers" of the school choice movement, even though they were founded to provide educational opportunities to black students who were shut out of other institutions.

 "Secretary DeVos has no understanding of the importance, contributions, and significance of HBCUs," the petition said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The decision to invite DeVos to speak at the school last Tuesday caused public outcry because of comments that she previously made calling historically black colleges and universities "real pioneers" of school choice.

 DeVos later backtracked, saying that the schools weren't established to give black students more choices, but because black students were forbidden from attending white schools because of racial segregation.

 "Multiple allegations have surfaced, including faculty intimidation demanding their silence or (risking) termination," Nweze said. "And (there were accusations of) threats to students by potentially withholding earned degrees and fines for freedom of expression."

 Several attorneys have already agreed to represent faculty and students who peacefully protested DeVos' speech and who might face retaliation from the university, Nweze said.

 "Our partners have reviewed the university student code of conduct, and it does not contain any prohibition on peaceful protests and freedom of expression," Nweze said. "The NAACP Volusia County Daytona Beach Branch and several attorneys will be on the ground monitoring this situation." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A former political director to President George W. Bush said Wednesday she found the news of James Comey's firing "dumbfounding."

 "Even if you assume that their intentions were pure, and they fired him because of competence reasons, this just stinks to high heaven," Sara Fagen, a CNBC contributor, said on "Squawk Box."

 Also on the show, former CIA agent John Sipher said Comey's firing likely won't end the FBI's investigation into possible links between Russia and President Donald Trump's campaign.

 The Trump administration "tends to look at intelligence officers, law enforcement, judiciary and assume they're part of the partisan process and treat them as such," Sipher said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  White House press secretary Sean Spicer wrapped up his brief interview with Fox Business from the White House grounds late Tuesday night and then disappeared into the shadows, huddling with his staff behind a tall hedge. To get back to his office, Spicer would have to pass a swarm of reporters wanting to know why President Trump suddenly decided to fire the FBI director.

 For more than three hours, Spicer and his staff had been scrambling to answer that question. Spicer had wanted to drop the bombshell news in an emailed statement but it was not transmitting quickly enough, so he ended up standing in the doorway of the press office around 5:40 p.m. and shouting a statement to reporters who happened to be nearby. He then vanished, with his staff locking the door leading to his office. The press staff said that Spicer might do a briefing, then announced that he definitely wouldn't say anything more that night. But as Democrats and Republicans began to criticize and question the firing with increasing levels of alarm, Spicer and two prominent spokeswomen were suddenly speed-walking up the White House drive to defend the president on CNN, Fox News and Fox Business. </TEXT>

Ivanka Trump also was supposed to meet with Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt earlier on Tuesday, but the White House did not confirm if that meeting ever took place. Discussions on the climate deal were canceled without much explanation, but when White House press secretary Sean Spicer was asked about the progress Tuesday, he replied that the president "wants to make sure he has an opportunity to meet with his team." Trump has now decided he won't decide on Paris until after G-7 meetings later this month in Italy, once more because he wants to "meet with his team." </TEXT>

 Sessions was citing the recommendation of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was appointed to his position two weeks earlier and on Tuesday criticized Comey in a three-page memo over his handling of the email investigation. </TEXT>

Nixon ordered the Attorney General to abolish the office of special prosecutor. Refusing to do so and in protest, the Attorney General Elliot Richardson and the Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned.  Nixon then turned to the U.S. Solicitor General Robert Bork, to carry out the firing of the special prosecutor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield said late Monday that the Federal Communications Commission has updated its systems to a cloud service that should be more resilient against attacks. He affirmed that there had been a cyberattack on the agency's site Sunday, and said that the agency also suffered an attack in 2014 after Oliver's previous segment.

 But the agency's statement has raised skepticism from consumer advocacy group Fight for the Future. The group said in a statement that it finds the timing of the attack too coincidental. The group raised questions about whether the FCC was diagnosing the slowdown correctly, or whether an outside attack could have been launched specifically to keep Oliver's viewers from commenting.

 The FCC should immediately release its logs to an independent security analyst or major news outlet to verify exactly what happened last night, said the group's campaign director, Evan Greer.

	<TEXT>  A super PAC aligned with the House Republican leadership and Speaker Paul Ryan (Wisc.) released a new ad Tuesday attacking Democrat Jon Ossoff for raising most of his campaign cash from out-of-state donors in the runoff to fill an open U.S. House seat in Georgia.

 The CLF ad features an array of young liberals thanking Georgians for supporting Ossoff.

 Hi Georgia, Nancy Pelosi just wanted to say thank you, says one woman wearing an Ossoff-Pelosi t-shirt.

 We already have Nancy Pelosi as our congresswoman, now youre going to give us Jon Ossoff as our congressman, says a man with pigtail braids.

 Were proud that California is the leading funder of the Jon Ossoff campaign, says another. Were really excited that Jon Ossoff likes paying higher taxes.

 They go on to accuse Ossoff and Pelosi of seeking to weaken the military and failing to take ISIS seriously. 

 "ISIS?" says a woman wearing a floppy hat and a "Cut the military now!" button. "They're overrated."

	<TEXT>  Former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates testified Monday that she told the White House that then-National Security Adviser Mike Flynn could be blackmailed by the Russians, because he misled the vice president about his problematic conduct.

 We were concerned that the American people had been misled about the underlying conduct and what General Flynn had done, Yates told a Senate Judiciary subcommittee.

 That reference to the underlying conduct is frustratingly vague, but of critical importance. Much of the focus in recent months has been on Mike Flynn lying about his communications with Russia, but Yates took this a step further: Flynns false claims were problematic, but so is the conduct he was lying about.

 We dont know what that conduct is  the information is classified  but it raises the seriousness of the controversy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How do you sell a health care bill that cuts insurance for the poor, allows states to waive essential health benefits like maternity care, and allows insurers to charge impossible sums to people with pre-existing conditions, all to cut taxes for the richest 2 percent of Americans?

 You lie about it.

 Leaders have opted to talk up the virtues of a plan that looks nothing like the one they just voted for. The American Health Care Act cuts $880 billion from Medicaid over a 10-year period. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that as a result, 14 million fewer people would have Medicaid coverage by 2026.

 Price, unfazed, denied that the cuts even existed. Remember that there are no cuts to the Medicaid program. There are increases in spending, said the secretary. When an incredulous Tapper pressed againAre you actually saying that $880 billion in cuts  is actually not going to result in millions of Americans not getting Medicaid?Price went further, insisting that the Medicaid population will be cared for in a better way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please watch the video before you comment because the headline was not the basis for the question.

 The interview started out friendly enough. Josh Scheinblum of the ABC affiliate KCRG pointed out to Blum that the people attending his recent town hall meeting needed to provide identification to prove that they were residents of the his district. After Blum replied that he only wanted people from his district to attend, Scheinblum pointed out that some would make the case that you represent all Iowans. The decisions that you make impact all Iowans. So shouldnt all Iowans have a voice at the table, or at least have the option to?

 Blum laughed and replied, I dont represent all Iowans. I represent only the first district of Iowa. That would be like saying, Shouldnt I be able to, even though I live in Dubuque, go vote in Iowa City during the election, because Id like to vote in that district instead?

 Would you still take donations from a Republican in Iowa City? Scheinblum then asked, causing lum to walk out after only two minutes.

 As Blum stood up and unclipped his microphone, Scheinblum seemed genuinely surprised that the interview was being cut off. Blum, on the other hand, denounced the line of questioning as ridiculous and accused Scheinblum of wanting to badger him with his questions.

	<TEXT>  The bill as it stands would have the potential to alter insurance coverage in two major areas  by nixing coverage requirements for employees at larger companies, and by  theoretically  making it possible for employees at larger companies to have to pay an unlimited amount for so-called "essential" health care benefits out of pocket. 

 On the first point, employees would no longer be guaranteed health insurance because their companies would no longer be required to provide it. The ACHA rolls back a key Affordable Care Act provision that required businesses with 50 or more employees to provide health insurance to employees working 30 hours or more a week. 

 The slightly-more-complex implication of the House GOP bill on employer-based coverage means employees at large companies could theoretically pay an unlimited amount for health care on an annual or lifetime basis. </TEXT>

Then he moved onto Yates, quoting the statute that basically said as President, Trump can decide to deny anyone entry to the country if he thinks they'd be "detrimental to the interest of the United States."

 Without pausing, Yates said she was familiar with that statute, and busted out her own, which said "no person shall receive preference or be discriminated against in issuance of a visa because of race, nationality or place of birth." Then, without waiting for Cruz to try another jab, she said she wasn't focused on either statute, so much as "whether or not the executive order here violated the Constitution specifically with the establishment clause and equal protection and due process." </TEXT>

 Yates told the panel that she had a meeting with White House Counsel Donald McGahn on January 26 to tell him that she had information that statements by Vice President Mike Pence, based on his conversations with Flynn, were false. She was joined in the meeting by a senior career official in the Justice Department.

 "We weren't the only ones that knew all of this, that the Russians also knew about what General Flynn had done and the Russians also knew that General Flynn had misled the vice president and others," Yates said, relating the contents of her conversation with McGahn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Lately, the GOP has been attacking the idea of states setting up retirement plans for small business, most of which offer no retirement options. The Senate majority recently voted against a plan to provide state-sponsored small-business retirement programs. President Trump is expected to sign this giant leap backward of a bill.

 The U.S. is the only modern, industrialized country without a uniform national pension system. Although there are dozens of retirement vehicles -- IRAs, 401ks, 403bs, SEP-IRAs, etc. -- employers are not required by law to offer any of them, nor are they required to fund them. It's such a scattershot approach that it should be a national embarrassment.

 Wall Street and insurers have also been working hard to snuff a Department of Labor "fiduciary rule" that would force broker-advisers to work in the best interest of their clients when offering retirement advice.

 That would have prevented financial product peddlers from selling high-commission, junk products. It also would've protected millions of retirees who are facing rollovers from their 401(k)s into other products such as annuities and IRAs.

 The highly anticipated hearing  it is Yatess first appearance on Capitol Hill since her firing in January  is expected to fill in key details in the chain of events that led to the ouster of Michael Flynn, President Donald Trumps first national security adviser, in the early weeks of the administration.

 Yates is likely to testify Monday that she warned White House counsel Don McGahn on Jan. 26 that Flynns contacts  and the discrepancies between what the White House said happened on the calls and what actually occurred  had left him in a compromised position, according to a person familiar with her expected statements. The person was not authorized to discuss the testimony by name and requested anonymity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt has chosen to replace half of the members on one of its key scientific review boards, the first step in a broader effort by Republicans to change the way the agency evaluates the scientific basis for its regulations.

 The move could significantly change the makeup of the 18-member Board of Scientific Counselors, which advises EPAs key scientific arm on whether the research it does has sufficient rigor and integrity. All of the members being dismissed were at the end of serving at least one three-year term, although these terms are often renewed instead of terminated.

 Pruitt is planning a much broader overhaul of how the agency conducts its scientific analysis, said a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The administration has been meeting with academics to talk about the matter and putting thought into which areas of investigation warrant attention from the agencys scientific advisers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Lawmakers and congressional staff are unlikely to face higher premiums or fewer health-care benefits as a direct result of the House Republicans health-care plan for one big reason: they work in the District of Columbia.

 Members of Congress and their aides are unlikely to feel the impact of these changes, however, because they generally obtain health insurance through the small-group exchange operated by the Affordable Care Act-friendly District of Columbia. If the D.C. government continues to enforce the ACAs protections, which most experts believe it will, lawmakers and staff could end up with more robust and less expensive coverage than constituents in states that are not as friendly to Obamacare.

 Republicans in the House and Senate are trying to revise the ACA using the budget reconciliation process, which imposes special rules about what can and cannot be included in legislation while allowing bills to pass the Senate by a simple-majority vote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Every group working to unseat Republicans in 2018 is seeing an explosive growth in fundraising, Ben Wikler, Washington director for MoveOn, said in a phone interview with The Daily Beast on Thursday. The electoral blowback has already begun.

 The AHCA, whose passage in the House was heralded as a victory by President Donald Trump, essentially limped to the finish line after a failure to get to a vote in March.

 Twenty Republicans voted against the bill, with many not knowing what exactly was in it or how much it would cost. The bill itself does not repeal Obamacare but rather gets rid of the mandate that requires people to carry insurance.

 Instead a new amendment to the legislation, offered by Rep. Tom MacArthur, would allow some states to charge higher premiums for people with pre-existing conditions (including but not limited to diabetes, pregnancy, and cancer) and the option to opt out of essential health benefit requirements from the Affordable Care Act. </TEXT>
