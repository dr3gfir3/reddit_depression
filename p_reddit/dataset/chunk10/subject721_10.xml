	<TEXT> It pisses me off you can even name bills like that. They're designed to frame you in a negative light simply for speaking out against it.

"I don't support the Patriot Act" what are you, a terrorist!? But that's a lot easier than referring to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act.

A controversial one in NY is the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, or "Safe Act". Because again, if you come out and say "I don't support the Safe Act" you immediately sound like a crazy gun nut and people will discredit you. (Not saying I'm for or against it, simply using its name as an example).

I don't know what the word is for doing this, but honestly this shit bugs me and I think it's *really* bad for democracy in general. The names are designed to immediately sway your opinion before you know what is. </TEXT>

I used to work a job which required Business Casual four days per week, with Friday being "Casual Friday".

	<TEXT> **EDIT** I am literally the dumbest person on the earth. Apparently this venue has 2 stages and I was at the wrong one. Better luck next year :(

Last week I found out TYS was playing at a small venue this weekend. I'm not familiar with their stuff, I couldn't name you a single song or album but I know I've liked what I've heard on this subreddit so I decided to check them out.

Wikipedia lists 7 individuals as active band members, but there were only 4 or 5 people on stage.

When they tour, do they not have the 'jazz ensemble' with them? Because I definitely didn't see anyone with a violin, saxophone, or trumpet.

In either case it was a pretty good show. Only like 15 people showed up, which I think was the smallest concert I've ever been to, with a close second to Epica back in 2007 -- their first US tour -- which had about 30 or 40 people. But yea, despite the small crowd and lack of live jazz it was still a pretty good show. I was just curious if that was a typical thing for them or what. </TEXT>

Then, despite damn near everyone he's surrounded himself with being investigated for Russian compromises, he's trying to play it cool and say it's the Dems that are in Russian pockets?

But if it's no big deal for half your associates to be tied to Russia, why is it a big deal for the Dems to suddenly, allegedly, be tied to Russia? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm all for legalizing prostitution, but:

Police say they also found pills, a stamp bag of heroin and other drug paraphernalia in her dresser drawer. Police say Chalmers' 15-year-old son was in a back bedroom during the entire incident.

 Police say they found her in a second-floor, locked bathroom with drug paraphernalia. Vareha's 4-year-old son was in the living room. The boy was handed over to his grandmother and CYF was notified.

These women absolutely should be in trouble. No child should have to go to a home where his or her parent is fucking complete strangers for money.

It's simply dangerous for everyone involved. The kids, the "sellers", and even the "buyer" are all at risk here.

If you want to open up a business and have the workers and clients be tested, great. All the power to you. But fucking strangers for money with young children home isn't a good idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure I understand:

 The original bill claimed drivers who rolled coal intended to harass other peoplelanguage that concerned some senate Republicans.

 However, in order to successfully roll coal in a diesel truck, an illegal device called a smoke switch has to be installed, which is what allows the engine to suck in more diesel fuel and produce the thick clouds of black smoke from the exhaust. Original supporters of the bill argued that installation of such a device was evidence of intent, but the bill wasnt budging until that part was taken out.

I thought "rolling coal" was simply an ECU tune so it burns rich? Not really a "switch" at all.

Additionally, if the switch is *already* illegal then why did the supporters want that removed from the bill? </TEXT>

'The American Dream' has become "I hope I can pay off my student loans" rather than, "I hope to buy a house".

Many people are, to some degree, wage slaves. Don't get me wrong, I live pretty comfortably for my age, especially considering that I pay $1K/mo in student loans... But I can't do anything. I can't afford to live alone. I can't afford to travel (like I even have the time off to travel if I *could* afford it). I can't afford to spend much on hobbies.

If I lose my job, I'm fucked. My debts would clean out my savings in no time. When I pay off these existing debts, **then** I can start saving up to get started on that 30-year mortgage for a house.

Meanwhile companies give salaries to CEOs so big one would have to try *real fucking hard* to spend all of it. Don't get me wrong, my boss' boss works 24/7 and I think he deserves to make whatever he makes. But I work for a small 60-person company. But then you look at the huge banking industry, ISP/Telecom companies and all these other huge industries and it just disgusts me. Morally bankrupt businesses which will shaft every single person who works there if it'll get the shareholders more money. "We can't afford to pay our IT department overtime" they say while giving multi-million dollar bonuses to all the bigwigs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look into knocking out your Gen Ed courses at a cheap community college, then transfer to a different school to get your actual degree. There's no reason to pay State University Money for things like writing or math (unless that's your actual degree, I suppose).

It can be tricky though, lots of schools are very particular about what can and cannot be transferred.

Also, in my opinion, if you don't know what you want to major in... Don't go to college. Wracking up tens of thousands of dollars of debt with no "end game" is a crazy idea.

I might even go as far as to say consider the field's employment before you get a degree. A buddy of mine has his PhD in some sort of marine biology field and can't find any work because it's such a specialized degree. So he's stuck teaching part time at a college while repaying these massive loans.

Of course, certain individuals can make any degree work for them, if they're smart/skilled enough and networked well. But for the most part, if you earn a degree in a field that is not in demand... Good luck. </TEXT>

I disagree. I grew up in MA, lived in RI for 3 or 4 years and now I've been in NY for almost 4 years. RI is definitely the shittiest by far. NY is actually pretty decent.

	<TEXT> I was supposed to go away for a weekend, so my brother and I drove to the airport and he was going to drive my 350Z home / for the weekend.

I told him I'd reimburse him for gas and that he should put 93 in it (very easy to find where I live), and that he is not to eat in it.

So he drops me off at the airport, and I find out my flight was cancelled. He turns around and comes to pick me up... And he's eating fucking Dunkin Donuts in the car.

We get home and I go out for a drive, get out and just went to brush my pants off and I got something on my hands. A bit of cream fell between his legs and onto the leather seats, got nice and smooshed into the pores... And all over my suit pants.

Next day I had my dad take me to the airport and I *forgot* to leave my keys with him, for my brother.

Sorry not sorry. Not 30 minutes and he already broke 1 of the 2 rules.

So yea... I'd be apprehensive of loaning my car to anyone.

The OT laws in the US haven't been updated in over 20 years for IT workers. And back in '96 when they were updated, they changed it from [6.5 Min Wage] to be a flat [6.5 Min Wage in 1996].

So if you make more than $27.63/hr, you are exempt from overtime eligibility.

Forget the snacks and the cool break room or the massages or that other crap. Fucking pay me when you tell me I need to work until 2AM on a Friday.

And yea, I went from the Z to the Fit. My logic was, "If I'm going from almost 300HP and RWD to *something practical* it's just going to feel like a tease so I may as well jump into the deep end of the Practicality side."

At the time, no dealers had a Fiesta ST for me to test drive and I did not like a regular Fiesta so I just said fuck it and went with the Fit. Fortunately I have good credit, so it was doable... Definitely a very stupid decision from a Financial perspective. But hey, it's a lower interest rate **and** a lower principal than any of my student loans. So I got that going for me? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  have a great MT

Have you driven a 2016 or newer?

I bought one and got rid of it 6 months later. One of the major reasons was the 6MT.

Say you're cruising around in any manual. You rev it high, let off the pedal and they drop, then harshly get on the pedal again. The car kind of jerks, as you would expect it to.

The 2016 Fit I had would do this... Except it would do this without me ever changing the throttle. It would just chug **as if** I were repeatedly taking my foot off the gas, then floor it.

It would only happen in first gear, and if I immediately shifted into second it was fine. But yea sometimes I'd shift into first at a red light, give it a little gas and keep my foot steady and then it just starts going nuts.


Other than that, overall a great car for what it is. I just wasn't the demographic for it and thought I could convince myself I'd be OK with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, why do Italian cars always seem to self-immolate? 

This is all largely speculation as I'm not super knowledgeable about Italian or German cars.

I assume it's a combination of 2 things:

* Mid/Rear engine
* Is it a track car or a GT car?

Point number one seems obvious. You've got the engine and the exhaust all bundled together in one spot. That's a lot of heat, which simply invites the chance for things to catch on fire. I saw one video of a Lamborghini, I think it was, catching fire when the Valet revved it hard too close to a fucking shrub in their parking lot.

As for number two, I'd like to again point out this is purely a guess. But I would say that Porsche, for the most part, is more of a GT manufacturer. As such, they're probably more "willing" to spend the engineering time, money, and weight, to ensure their vehicles are going to be problem-free in that domain. Plenty of cooling for long drives and such. I suppose Ferrari has plenty of GT cars rather than "track focused" cars but even still they've always stuck me as being on a higher level and as such would still have more issues with heat/fire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently paying off my Fiesta ST.

Both the FiST and my student loans will be paid off in 2022. That's $1300 I *won't* be throwing at banks every month.

Who knows what the market will be like in 5 years. And hopefully I'll be making a good bit more than I do now.

Right now I'd like a 370Z Nismo, Focus RS, or a used Exige/Elise. All of which would be obtainable today if not for my student loans (although /r/personalfinance would kill me for spending such a large percent of my income on something guaranteed to depreciate).

I do plan on saving to buy a house when my current debt is taken care of, so who knows how that might effect my car budget too. Maybe I'll keep the FiST as a daily and buy something cheap for an autocross project. Who knows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UA was within their right to call the police.

I think the cops handled it piss poorly, but given America's attitude towards airport security I don't think he'd have had much of a case for excessive force or anything like that in the courts -- even with the dozens of people who recorded the incident on their cellphones, sadly.

I don't think he'd have won. Or at least, not without some very expensive legal expertise.

Edit: Alternative theory is that maybe the dude simply didn't care all that much? I'm not greedy. I'd settle for $5M and get everything behind me rather than fight in the court for however long a case like this would take even if I might get $20M or something. </TEXT>

I have a much harder time taking things in just listening -- especially if I'm doing other stuff. Or if I need to pause and rewind it's a pain in the ass because a chapter might be 30 minutes or longer. Trying to back up 30 seconds is difficult on touch devices, or even a lower-resolution monitor with a mouse.

Also, I can pull up Google Play Books on my work computer and read when it's slow at work. Much harder to pretend like I'm busy with headphones on while listening to an audio book.  </TEXT>

Even with Google's vast sums of wealth, you greatly underestimate how much time it would take to do this. Getting the fiber set up. Complying with any individual state laws. Hiring techs, customer service reps, offices for customers to go in and pay bills.

Not to mention being inundated with legal battles filled against them from every ISP in the area. Even if they're shit cases that don't have much to stand on, it still needs to be dealt with.

Yes, allowing ISPs to behave in such a poor manner should create a demand for a more 'ethical' service provider... But it's just not that simple.  </TEXT>

I'm a single male with a steady job who does the same things on the same days each week, and my parents don't get my hobbies/interests.

Then I feel bad for *not* talking with my dad if I talk with my mom. He is an alcoholic and he wasn't physically abusive to me as a kid but he was definitely a real fucking asshole. So we don't get along great. He's working on sobriety after seriously fucking up his life due to alcohol last year. I don't think he's particularly happy with life and has a shit job then works around the house when he's not at his actual job, so he rarely has stuff to talk about -- and again, no common interests so I can't talk much about my interests because he doesn't understand. </TEXT>

I was 18 or 19, we had my dog since he was a puppy. He was about 9 years old when we had to put him down.

He was **very** protective and would bark at everyone and anyone when he heard the door to the house open. Hell, usually as soon as he hears a car pull into the driveway he'd be barking. Anyways, I came home from work one day to a quiet house. That's weird. My mom was sitting on the couch and I immediately ask where the dog is, and that's when she told me he had to be put down.

She said she had the option to wait before the vet did it but she didn't want us 'to go through that'.

We had 90 drivers at my region's first event this Sunday. In the 'Street Touring' class, a Miata took first with the fastest lap time of 34.443 seconds. Second place went to an M3 whose best lap was 34.665.

And even the PAX adjusted time the Miata was faster. </TEXT>
