	<TEXT> Unfortunately, some coaches are super young and/or inexperienced and don't recall (or understand the intricacies of) being new to fitness. They don't go to sensitivity training. And most of them learn "on the job", so to speak. 

I'd tell them that you're trying to work through an injury and even ask them if they know of another exercise you can do in place of the hang clean bc it bothers your shoulder (if they're new to coaching or not very well-versed with the movements, they probably will stutter through something and not give you a satisfactory modification. If they know their stuff, they'll probably say something like "do THIS" and maybe they'd demo it and watch you to make sure you're doing it correctly and maybe they'd throw some anatomy terms in there as well!). 

And just to play devil's advocate, sometimes new people are doing the movement really well and it's super obvious they can add weight. So if you're beating everyone during the workout and have great form .... then the coach might be unaware of your injury and is just trying to push you out of your comfort zone. 

But, again, sometimes you get some lughead coaches that only care about quantity and not quality. </TEXT>

I was a serious reader during high school and middle school but boy oh boy did my reading tastes change between 17 years old to 25/26 years old! I was kind of at a lost at what type of reader I was. It took a lot of hits and misses to find my "grown up" genre.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's just straight from the romwod website 

Because of how it is designed to work with your body, ROMWOD can be done just about any time. Athletes can do it first thing in the morning, an hour before training, 5 minutes before training, after work, or right before bed. Regardless of when it is done, the benefits of ROMWOD come from doing it consistently over time. That said, most begin to feel improvement in their range of motion as soon as they start the program.

We do not recommend doing ROMWOD right after training when you are extremely warm. This system is meant to be done when the body is cool.

https://romwod.com/faqs/

But it seems like RIGHT before isn't ideal either.

	<TEXT> Regarding donating books to the library ... as far as i know, they cant add books that people donate to their collection. So the library will just re-sell them. And then the library can use the money from selling donated books/comics to buy new books. But my library sells donated books anywhere from $0.50-$2, so that kind of pushes me to just donating them to goodwill or reselling my better books back to amazon or ebay.

but an audio only yoga class is probably going to talk even MORE than most other versions bc they assume the practitioner will need even more instruction bc the visual isnt there.

	<TEXT> What towel do you have? I prefer YogiToes ... they run about $60 (you can find them cheaper on ebay ...) but I have okay luck with them during a hot yoga class. My Gaiam ones or the $20 ones from Target have all basically useless. For hot yoga, I cheap out on my mat ... I'm using the towel in all my classes so I dont need $50+ yoga mat ... 

I prefer to have more clothes on sometime during a hot yoga class. When we have to hold onto another body part (like an ankle during bow pose), I think it's easier to grip onto legging than sweaty ankle, but that's me. 

I also bring a hand towel (like a dish one) to blot myself. But if my towel happens to get slick (which this has really only happened once that I can remember during down dog), I have used that on TOP of my yoga towel. 

And, at the end of the day, it's a hot yoga class. It's okay to sweat. Sometimes it was just me getting used to sweating. Hydrate well before. 

Also, they have all shades of hot classes. I know places like Corepower have about 85 degree rooms. That's just a barely hot day. It's not that bad. Then there's the 97 degree places, that's where I mainly hang out, preferably just 45 minutes. I've done a few 100+ ones ... and I honestly just hate those. I accidentally took one that was an hour long and I spent half the class in child's pose!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing that will help is to make sure you're not stopping at the rib space when you inhale. So fill the BELLY with breath, have it travel up the spine (into the rib/chest area) and then fill up the rest of the clavicle. 

What makes this tough is when you're in a forward fold (and you're tight in the legs and rounding the back a lot), you're probably shortening the front of the body ... which makes taking deep breaths difficult. If this is the case, you need to watch your ego and use props or come OUT of the pose a little bit so you can keep the front of the spine longer and you can take those deeper breaths. 

And then, if that still doesnt work, it's okay to breath normally for a bit and then get back into it. Or adjust the count with something similar that works for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love that you randomly bought a book after a night of drinking! I find myself doing super responsible things when I get home drunk, but not sleepy, including but not limited to - hiding money in my room so I dont spend it later, showering, painting my nails, putting up my socks. 

Secondly, I listened to H is for Hawk on audiobook and it was one of those books that really surprised me. The author narrated her own book (and that's always fun with audiobooks bc you get the intonation and stresses that they wanted on the words). The book was well written and great to read, I just really loved it! I guess it helped that I wasnt expecting much. 

And to answer your actual question, I always find books referenced in other books that I'll write down to check out later. I'm reading Buffering by Hannah Hart (she's the My Drunk Kitchen youtuber) and she references a book her psychiatrist talked to her about called Driven to Distraction ... about ADD.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read some "heavy" nonfiction and I think some of them just get too far in the weeds for me to find enjoyment from reading them. So these suggestions are what I view nonfiction-lite. I think they're enjoyable and accessible for most people 

Laura Hillenbrand's books read like fiction! She is great at making the book feel like it has a beginning, middle, and end. (thats my main gripe with Erik Larson ... he just doesnt tie everything up for me. I feel like there should be MORE, I never get the *So what?* from him). 

I like Bill Bryson. A Short History of Nearly Everything. Some of the stuff he writes seems like it didnt happen bc it's so outlandish. I also really liked One Summer, America 1927 - baseball, planes, and sensationalist journalism. Bill Bryson is a very light-hearted funny writer. 

Mary Roach writes a lot of light-hearted science-y things - Like Gulp (about the digestive tract) and Stiff (about dead bodies). 

I want to read Endurance by Alfred Lansing bc I've heard great things. It's about a ship that gets frozen and stuck in Antarctica for, like, a month. 

There are some things you just can't make up. And they're fascinating to read about! </TEXT>

**Creativity, by Ed Catmull** - this is the story of Pixar and it is fantastic. He talks a lot about managing Pixar, Steve Jobs, and all that jazz. Great for managers! 

**The Wanderers, by Meg Howrey** - man, I didnt like this book mainly bc it got compared to The Martian. But on The Martian, THINGS happened. I felt like nothing happened in this book. It's just a character study within the structure of astronauts and people in tight spaces. If you go in with that understanding, it'll probably ground your expectations on this book a bit. 

So now I'm in between books. 

I have Handmaid's Tale (narrated by Claire Danes) and American Gods (narrated by full cast) on audiobook .... 

But I'm leaning towards **American War, by Omar El Akkad**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had back issues (mri and neurologist and chiro, the whole deal). When it would get aggravated again, the easiest thing I would do was go to CVS or Walgreens and they have those pads that you stick on your back that make it really hot. That helped me the most after I aggravated it. I would switch it up with ice. I'm sure your not supposed to do that or just do one or the other, but it was the easiest fix for me. The pads are like $1-5 and single use. 

Then when I went back to the gym, I would scale. Scale weights, scale reps ... sometimes I would pull from the blocks instead of the ground or I would completely do another movement that didnt re-aggravate my back. 

There's that ONE time you push beyond your limits coming back from an injury and you end up not going back to the gym for weeks instead of something that could have been a few days of backing off. So just be mindful of your body!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not fiction but I really did like Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand. She really gets down to the state of airplane flight during the 40s, the POW life in Japan. 

I loved All Quite on the Western Front, but it made me feel sad. Unbroken is a little more uplifting and makes you impressed with the human spirit. So that is a really stark contrast between the books. 

I've also read Redeployment by Phil Klay. And it's short stories about soldiers coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan. It might be closer to what you're looking for since it's modern and it's got a super sad twinge to most of the stories! Pretty sure this was fiction but it read like nonfiction.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently reading The Wanderers by Meg Howrey. And it was compared to The Martian. Annnd it's not like The Martian, imho. I didnt know it was based on a simulation of going to Mars, so I start it off expecting them to go to Mars. And I just cant get past this fact that I think the characters should be on Mars and not simulating in Utah.

	<TEXT> I dont see anything wrong with it. Some people don't wear makeup to the gym and some people do. To each their own. People who exercise and wear makeup do have distinct concerns - how do I not look like a bawling beauty queen with my mascara? fuck did my foundation just ruin this white tank (bc that shit does NOT come off). So I think it's somewhat relevant to people who exercise and wear makeup. I'm not hating on those people who "put on their face" before they workout. And this article might help them out. 

Since no one is asking me for selfies after workouts, it's not such a huge concern for me tho.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Buffering, by Hannah Hart**

This is from the My Drunk Kitchen girl. Her mom was a bit of an odd bird (ie. schizophrenic?) and she got big on youtube before they had all the "how to get big on youtube" tutorials. I heard about it more through the audiobook world (bc I think she narrates it, well). But I saw it at the library and picked up the actual book. 

**The Utterly Uninteresting and Unadventurous Tales of Fred, the Vampire Accountant, by Drew Hayes**

Death and TAXES. I dont know this is just a fun book to listen to. The narrator is really good. And the protagonist, Fred, is a "wimp" by vampire standards but he's got a really good attitude and methodically will help out his friends when they're in need. Just an all around good dead dude. Not from the library, I paid for this ha! 

Edit: ok Hannah harts mom in buffering is not schizophrenic. I'm confused with the mom in hillbilly elegy  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Lincoln in the Bardo, by George Saunders**

Just finished. Ghosts in Purgatory (aka the Bardo) hang out with Abraham Lincolns son in the after life. I can tell it's well-written but a little too avant garde for my taste. 

**The Wanderers, by Meg Howrey**

I was told this was like The Martian but I'm about 25% of the way through and no one is on Mars yet. The book description on amazon says it's about the simulation that is preparing them for their trip to mars. Knowing that would have probably settled my expectations a little bit. Jumps between the three astronauts, their kids and wives, and a psychologists viewpoint 

**Hillbilly Elegy, by JD Vance**

I'm about 3 chapters in. It's less than 300 pages so I can envision this one going fast. A lot of memoir with some facts strewn in so far. But I'm sure you already knew that bc this was a fairly buzzy book. I'm not quite sure why though! It doesnt seem SUPER mind blowing. I'm not sure what I'm missing. Maybe it was just a TIMELY book with the whole Trump thing ... idk </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the minority here but I thought the movie wasnt very good. I think people are shocked by the subject matter and not the actual merits of the movie (which, again, the subject matter is horrific). They had SEVEN YEARS to get this movie released and it looks like they put it together in 3 months. The kid actors werent good. There was this dumb instagram filter over the whole movie (Lofi? Sepia?). 

I don't think this movie brought across anything additional or meaningful or symbolic to the matter of child abuse and molestation aside from displaying it on the screen. 

One of the hilights was Aunt Ruth - great acting. But, ugh, even in the last scene, everyone was mumbling. The cop's reaction was implausible. 

This movie was based off true events and that is the real horror. Aside from the subject matter, I don't see what the movie added to the story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to stick it out with your gym and you like your coaches, try another class time. I know different times have different "vibes". 

I left Crossfit for about 3 years and I ended up paying maybe $30 for a gym membership, but I never went. So instead of using all $145 of my crossfit membership, I was using $0 out of $30 of my regular gym membership. I wasnt really motivated to go bc I didnt want to come up with a program, I didnt like their group fitness classes, and I ended up ditzing around the weight room floor for an hour.  I work a lot and make decisions all day. So I found I liked to go to a gym where they just tell me what to do. 

I also had signed up for bootcamp classes. Those I really liked. You make friends. But they end up being about the same price, if not more expensive, than Crossfit! 

But if you take a break from crossfit,  you can always come back when your funds allow.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I read 13 Reasons Why but havent seen the netflix series. 

I *personally* did not like the book. I felt like the main guy (it's been awhile, I forgot his name) was obnoxiously, almost unrealistically nice. And then I found Hannah unlikeable. I didnt "buy" her depression. This book probably gives the general middle school populace the idea to not be dicks to each other, but I dont know if it would reach out to someone who is going through a real depression bc Hannah is not the best spokesperson for that group. 

The subject matter is very serious. I thought the book was a 2 or 3 out of 5 stars but that doesnt mean I think suicide is a 2 or 3 out of 5 issue.

	<TEXT> Most gyms are going to make you take some type of elements class, so that will probably last a week or two. Then they're going to try to get you into a contract. Explain that you're a student, you want to try out a gym over the summer, and see which gym is the most reasonable. You can learn basics! It really depends on what your true knowledge base is with fitness. With my experience ... most high school kids graduating have little to zero body awareness unless they were in some type of sport. Most of the 17-20 year olds at our gym seem to really enjoy crossfit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know some people are giving you a hard time but you definitely have a point! I think this is why some people surprise themselves during the Open workouts ... bc they have a judge counting their reps and the athlete can turn their brain off. 

I am fine with counting reps during the exercise, my problem is I cant count ROUNDS. If we have more than 3 rounds in a workout, I'm going to forget what round I'm on. My old gym had poker chips, and I would move a poker chip after each round so I didnt lose track. I can also use my notebook but I never have it on me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Core Power is pricy. They offer like a Hot Fusion class and Core Power Yoga I class and Core Power Yoga 2. I think they do a lot of abs. And most of the classes are heated. They use weights in one of their classes (maybe the yoga sculpt?). Core Power is geared to more, I know I'll get shit here but whatever, "aggressive" yogis. Yogis who might like bootcamp. The classes are good though! It's just a specific brand and I think most of the Core Power teachers have to go through the core power training. My friend goes to this chain out in TX and she LOVES it. She is a 200 hour instructor herself. 

24 hour fitness places are going to vary a lot in their quality and content. I call this "gym yoga". It's probably not going to have "om"s and probably not going to have 1.5 hour long classes that you'd find at a studio. Youll probably do sun salutations, do planks, and maybe do a yoga trick or two. 

I have a pass to Core Power, I was going to try it out! You can get a free week pass to CorePower straight off their website if Im not mistaken. https://www.corepoweryoga.com/free-week

	<TEXT> I went to the Haramara Retreat in Sayulita Mexico. I went with a studio already going. We went during an off season and it was really hot. Because youre in a cabana facing the ocean, there's no AC obviously! A lot of crabs and scorpions (you slept in a mosquito netting). But it was honestly an unforgettable experience! We had some day trips for surfing, riding horses on the beach, local shopping, went to puerto vallarta for a yacht trip, you can get massages on site. And there's a chef on site who makes you great, natural food. 

Maybe check out [their retreats](https://haramararetreat.com/upcoming-retreats/) and join in on another group already going? 

edit: I should say that we saw one scorpion and heard about another one in another cabana, this was over 6 days.... so it's not like an every day swarm occurence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a herniated disc and I did body weight workouts. They included hinging though. 

But I did box step ups. pushups. airdyne. farmer carries ....

later on, I added light kettlebell swings, squats holding a slam ball, single leg deadlifts (with kettlebells)

The programmer at my gym gave me 3 sets of "wods" to do on one day. Then the next day I would do another set of 3 other workouts. I just alternated those for about a month. And then next month, I did another set of workouts that he came up with. Because I was pretty limited with what I could do, I came during my regular class time and then just did my workouts on the side. It got me moving again! 

I also did some restorative yoga at a yoga studio about 1x a week.

My neurosurgeon told me he didnt want me hinging then twisting ... so my injury seems to be different than yours. Good luck with everything!

	<TEXT> If you're not flexible, I would buy yoga blocks. You gotta put your ego aside and actually use them. But part of that is finding an instructor that knows when to conveniently cue them.

Personally, I'd try out YogaGlo for a month. They have a ton of videos, better organized, for beginners. The instructors cue well. 

The blocks will range anywhere from $3-15. I'd buy two. You can use a towel for a blanket. And then use a towel or belt as a yoga strap. After the free week, yogaglo is maybe $18/month, less than one yoga class at must studios. Or it's like 3-4 lattes at Starbucks. And you basically get unlimited yoga. 

The free route? Take whatever yoga class you like on YouTube. Then I would pick one pose and YouTube "[insert yoga pose] modifications" and see if you can pick up cues that make sense to you as you build your yoga base.  </TEXT>

You can look at the reps and your weight and get an idea if you need to go heavier or lighter or stay the same. I felt like my first few months of Crossfit was me not knowing what weight to grab.

	<TEXT> Most Crossfit is a community ... and no one is going to be more possessive of that than an owner and their box. Their coaching needs differ; their clientele differs. Some boxes might be desperate for coaching and more classes, others are probably just fine where they're at but might want a sub. 

I'd definitely do more listening and hear what the owner wants out of you first. You might have to invest a few hours of work for not a lot of payoff. But I think going about this the right way would be keeping  your goals for his gym in the background at first. But if he says something that opens up the discussion towards weightlifting and your ideas, definitely speak up! </TEXT>

Plus, i use the What are you reading this week thread to ask people how they liked the book. But if they're reading it, they cant really give me a good, conclusive answer. 

I feel like a what you finished reading thread might spark more fangirling and discussion.

	<TEXT> If it's nagging back pain, there's a reason why. Agree with other people to go see medical community and see if they can pinpoint what is going on. My only other advice would be to look into body weight options and stay away from back squat, deadlift, etc with weights until the discomfort goes away. Because the last thing you want to do is to have an injury or mechanical issue and add weight to it.

	<TEXT> Sheesh, I know a lot of people like this book but The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time ... hated it. The format wore thin on me after the first few chapters. I think a book needs more than just a unique narrative style to be GREAT. This book had a boring plot and no great insights.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only read the first two, but I think, in general, the Peculiar Children books didnt live up to the concept. Nothing really felt important and the peculiar children were peculiar for peculiar's sake ... like the author was trying too hard to be like SEE THIS PECULIARNESS?!  </TEXT>

The things that are important to the characters seem believable and relevant to the time period. And the concept is so unique, I havent really heard or read of anything else like it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always seem to suggest The Troop by Nick Cutter. It's horror (like body horror/gore). About boy scouts and their scoutmaster going to an island for camping and then a very very ill man walks onto their camp and the fun begins. It's a light read, the kid characters are fairly fleshed out and easy to differentiate. 

Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi (? not sure on the name) is a completely different mode. It follows the lives of two African families throughout the generations. I had to write a little tree to keep track of every body bc the book switches POV every chapter. But the stories are SUPER interesting and tragic! I was riveted. I think that would be an interesting departure from the GoT series. You still have some of the family/lineage strife but from a different perspective.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She might like Rainbow Rowell, Attachments. That's more of a Bridget Jones lite. 

I liked an Astronaut's Guide to Life by Chris Hatfield. And I also liked Billy Crystal's memoir. The first was interesting and science-y. The Billy Crystal one (and I have never really found him that funny) was actually hilarious! He does his impressions and it's a really great experience on audiobook!

	<TEXT> I would suggest the following ... 

1. [Bend your knees A LOT](http://cf.ltkcdn.net/yoga/images/std/154742-325x218-beginner-downdog.jpg), then think about pushing your hands forward to the front of the room. Just feel a stretch in the back of the hamstrings. 

2. Or you can just do cow pose (of cat/cow) to start gently stretching the hamstrings!  </TEXT>
