	<TEXT> When I was younger we used to live across from a park. There used to be this kid who lived in a government house, the most foul person you would ever meet. 

One day he decides to go to the park with this sling shot trying to shoot anything that moves. He focuses on a tree full of crows, but lucky his shitty homemade slingshot had no power and couldn't hit anything. 

Everytime I see him I tell him to fuck off or I'll call that cops. He never listens and the cops do jack shit,  anyways I look out my window one day and there he is walking to the park with this sling shot. 

I get the phone ready to call the cops again, and watch him. I yell I'm calling the cops, he ignores it and loads his slingshot. Out of nowhere rocks and other objects fall from the tree, pelting this little shit and drawing blood. 

He cries in pain, and is covering his eye with  blood streaming from his face. It turns out the crows had armed themselves with rocks and ball bearings from the local mechanic shop, and gave this guy some bird justice. 

Didn't see the little shit after that, guess they moved to a new government house. 

Crows are smart birds, but murderous in a flock.

	<TITLE> How do tow truck operators bypass the law? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 10:00:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I watched a small segment about tow truck rackets operating in city suburbs. 

How it works is, the victim parks there car in an area monitored by the tow truck operator.  They haul your car off to there private impound lot, and charge you $100's of dollars to release the car. 

More information can be found here 
http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/queensland/brisbane-tow-truck-ripoff-trapping-motorists-raking-in-thousands/news-story/fafbc5bd35590ab89f1a34d05c2e6856 

The scam seems illegal, but there must be some legal ground that these operaters stand on. It just seems as if these guys operate above the law somehow. 

My question is how do business that operate in such a shoddy manner and get away with it was from a legal prescriptive?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a legal sense is there any positives or negatives from continuing a de facto relationship to actually getting married.

I recently found out that my uncle and auntie aren't actually legally married. They have lived together for 20 years plus, have had kids together, bought assets and so on. 

Just out of curiosity what are the downsides or upsides of actually getting paper married to just continuing as a de facto relationship.
