	<TEXT> From my knowledge the burning at the bottom of the pan is due to having too little liquid. Tho it could be that the Garlic burnt and made a sour taste too, But this is unlikely since you said the pork was resting on it. In my opinion you should have added water with the white wine so you would have a decent amount of liquid at the bottom of the pan, if you have too much liquid at the end you could always reduce it to intensify the flavor to your liking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds Great! The only difference is that I cooked the Salmon skin side down until 3/4 done, This gives the skin more time to crisp up. It's also very important to have medium heat because if its's too hot the skin will scorch and not caramelize. 

Instead of butter I used olive oil and seasoned with salt and Dill.

In your method of cooking, does the skin turn out extremely crispy ? Because I am thinking that it will remain slightly soft and that is not pleasant to eat in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not exactly sure which type of salmon it was, The fish monger did not specify. But I am sure that you can do this with Norwegian Salmon as the restaurant I work in has Norwegian Salmon and that is how we serve it.

How did the Chef prepare the salmon ?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you let it rest before slicing it up ? It looks like it lost way too much of it's tasty juices to the plate. Great Job though! love the Farm to table aspect and the plating is nice :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cooked the Salmon skin side down until 3/4 ready on medium heat (Important that the pan is not too hot when you place the salmon). Brushed the salmon with olive oil before cooking and added some more to the pan. Don't know about the timing, but its easy to tell when salmon is 3/4 cooked because you can tell by the colour change. </TEXT>
