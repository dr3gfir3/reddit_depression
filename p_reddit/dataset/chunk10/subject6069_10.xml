	<TEXT> Thank you. This is an actual link. However, it does not back up the assertion that "there is no Russian connection". It backs up the idea that there is not evidence of collusion at this time. "No Russian connection" would mean they have concluded their investigation and that they found no link. No evidence at this time, during an ongoing investigation, is not that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami. A lot of what I've read from reviews is that this book was a disappointment to some of his fans, because it's in many ways a rehash of a lot of the same character traits, plot points, and themes from his previous books - I even noticed it even though this is only the third book of his that I've read. I really connected to the sense of isolation while living in a major city, the feeling that your friends and people you know are all unique and interesting but that you aren't, and the transition between post-college life and actual adult life. It was sort of the exact right book for me to read at this stage in my life. I hated the ending but the rest of the book was "right" enough that I could deal with it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The bitter-sweetness of seeing a book you just read back on the shelf at the library </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 04:33:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just finished reading a library book that I connected with on a deep, emotional level. I had this book for a week - in my hands, in my bed, and in my mind. I felt something for it, looked at it affectionately when it was sitting on my desk. And then I finished it and dropped it at the library.

The next day I was looking for another book. I passed by the M shelf in the fiction section and there it was - the book I'd just returned the day before. Somehow, seeing it sitting there on the shelf made me feel both happy and sad, the way you eventually come to feel about your partner after a good relationship comes to an end. You see the book sitting there and you want to pick it up again and take it home - there is a longing for it that makes you sad. At the same time you know it will bring happiness to someone else, and it makes you feel happy, in a way. I was very conflicted.

So I went ahead and bought a copy at the bookstore. That's the nice thing about books, I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you already forget that less than 4 months ago, one of the largest protests in American history took place all across the country (organized online)? Did you miss the spontaneous protests at airports after the travel ban (spread through social media)? How about the tax marches? The march for science? Both organized online. Americans are taking to the streets in great numbers my friend. You can join them or look the other way, coddling yourself with the false premise that no one is marching and that the internet isn't a powerful organizing force that has aided tons of on-the-street activism as of late.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mygale by Thierry Jonquet. The less you know going in, the better. It's dark - creepy - unsettling - thought-provoking - and a quick read. The film "The Skin I Live In" was based on it, so there's an excellent movie to watch after you read it, as well. In fact, this is a rare case where I'd recommend watching the movie *before* reading the book - the movie is structured more like a mystery than the book, and I think going into the film without the knowledge of what you're watching is the best way to do it. The book reveals the secret earlier on than the movie does, and it's different enough that it's worth reading even if you know the general outline of the story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel that there is a legitimate grievance to be had regarding the lack of discourse in places like college campuses, where those with opposing viewpoints have their speeches shut down. The flip side of the coin is that, when they're given a platform and a place to speak, you sometimes get situations like the donald, where it quickly devolves into hate speech and validation of, ya know, genocide advocacy. For this reason I'm torn. I think it's critical for all views to be heard, and disagree when speakers are shouted down by college students. But some views and ideologies are so detestable that they really don't deserve a platform, and giving them one is dangerous. Perhaps the solution is to encourage debates rather than speeches, so that both views can be heard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After two weeks of reading books I did not enjoy, I was happy to find **Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage** by Haruki Murakami this week. This is the third book I've read by Murakami, and I strongly related to the main character in the book. That's likely part of the reason that I enjoyed it as much as a I did. The sense of isolation while living in a major city - the sense of purposelessness - the feeling that you are not unique in the way that people you know are unique and special - all of that hit home with me. The ending was infuriating, though. [With this being the third Murakami book I've read, I now expect to be left hanging a bit by the endings, but this was a particularly egregious case which put a major damper on my overall enjoyment of the book. Things build perfectly to a conversation that we never get to read. It was a major letdown.](/spoiler) If anyone else has read this book - did you feel the same way about the ending?

Next week I'll be reading Rebecca by Daphne DuMaurier. Looking forward to it!

 - Introduce subject of invasion, demonstrate the "quirk" meant to differentiate this movie from all the other home invasion movies
 - Hints of incoming invasion
 - Night falls
 - Invasion begins
 - Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Neighbor shows up
 - Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Neighbor gets killed
 - Running around the house being invaded
 - Police show up
 - Police get killed
 - Eventually it either ends in the death of the invader or the invaded

Don't get me wrong, if my house was actually being invaded it would be fucking horrible. But I feel like once you've seen 2 or 3 home invasion movies you've seen them all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Much of the time I feel it comes from people being unfamiliar with films that don't hew closely to the traditional "hero's journey". Almost every single piece of writing or film-making makes it very easy for the audience to follow the trajectory of this storytelling formula. Movies like The Witch have more of an "inward" journey, and the main character doesn't wind up back in the same place (as a character) having undergone a change after their journey. In The Witch, [she becomes a witch after her family is dead - she changes but doesn't return to the starting point.](#spoiler) This is why things like "it was all a dream after all" are so evident in movies - they provide an end cap, some kind of closure that makes a movie *feel* finished. In the Witch you don't get that - you're left in a new place. If it had ended with her [saving her family or casting a spell that resurrected them instead of joining the witches](#spoiler) I guarantee there would be fewer complaints about how nothing happened, because it would have been a more traditionally "complete" story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And yet they make a claim in the headline that's not backed up by anything in the article - that's exactly the problem with not only this story but MANY shareblue articles. They make an inflammatory extrapolation from the information at hand and state it as fact. Pence led the transition team - that doesn't mean he knew every single thing that happened. If he didn't know about it, he didn't lie about knowing about it. But in shareblue world he definitely knew so he definitely lied. It's still an open question that should be investigated - shareblue has already made a ruling. It's too early for that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished **Pines by Blake Crouch**. I've been burned twice now by this author - this book and Dark Matter both had interesting premises that I felt wound up being squandered. I wound up skim-reading the middle third of this book - towards the end things got a bit more interesting, but any chapters involving cliff climbing or chases through the woods were uninteresting filler. Oh well - I am just really hopeful that the book I go with this coming week is a winner, as the past 2 weeks have been struggles, and that is a momentum killer. I still haven't chosen what to read yet, but I'm thinking of going with The Hound of the Baskervilles! </TEXT>

 - Obama

Now, I see where you're confused here bub... but Obama *won* in 2008 (when this trade dispute started) but didn't take office until 2009. Kinda like how, only a few months ago, Trump won in 2016 and didn't take office til 2017.

Quick google woulda helped there bub. </TEXT>
