	<TEXT> For a good research study you have have to follow the data, and have a strong study outline. Im sorry to hear that your cells died between semesters and that you had a limited model organism supply. 

Regardless it sounds like you have the groundwork for building up your CV and should help if you are continuing your education. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Melanoma is a highly metastatic cancer and there is plenty of patient data in the cancer genome atlas that we can use to identify potential targets. These mechanisms identified can often be translated to different tissue models so studying them in an easily obtained model is greatly beneficial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To further expand upon this there is a subset of cancers that are specific to children due to mutations that are acquired during development. That being said most mutations are from mutations acquired throughout ones lifetime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im going to respond to the second half of your question:

Generally people are living longer, and our methods of detecting cancer have greatly improved leading to a rise in reported cancer diagnostics. Most cancer events arise from an accumulation of mutations in somatic cells and typically when people tend to live longer they are more likely to accumulate more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great explanation of the biggest challenges of applying cancer studies to therapeutic development! 

Im sorry that your project didn't work out though that sounded like a great study.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First author here. Next steps are to fully characterize the transcriptional coactivation of KDM3A in prostate cancer and then transition to a melanoma model and study its impact upon regulating metabolic genes  in these two highly metastatic cancers. 

Interestingly enough KDM3A is also involved in mediating estrogen receptor hormone signaling in breast cancer. The question continues if such a cooperation exists in melanoma as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really enjoyed Cancer genetics and Tumor Biology so much that I decided to pursue that topic in graduate school. I also really enjoyed Immunology, Histology, and Physiology as it allowed me to better understand the complexity/beauty of the human body.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd make the allusion that cancer biology is similar to being a watchmaker. You have to understand how the watch functions before you are able to fix it. 

Most cancer therapies are similar to burning down a whole forest when you want to get rid of a couple of trees that are blighted. This study identifies a potential therapeutic target, but much more work is needed to characterize its role in cancer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keep at it! Upper division biology is where you learn some really neat stuff. Its also where i started making connections that helped me get into graduate school! Its where all the fundamentals you learned in the first two years pays off too so keep at it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Forensics is a very human biology centered route and this AP Bio and Introductory biology course is basically the appetizer plate when you go out to eat: you get a little bit of everything. 

If anything this test will either give you extra credits that allows you to register for classes early and it introduces the material to you so it will make that first semester of biology easier for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Essentially in prostate cancer cells signaling by Androgen Hormones drives the cancer to the point where treatment is cutting off the supply of androgen hormones. However in resistant prostate cancer cells they reactivate this hormone signaling pathway.

This study shows that another protein is able to regulate or turn on the production of proteins essential to androgen signaling. </TEXT>
