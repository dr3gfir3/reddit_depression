Finn is worrying me. Hes a good guy and all, but hes a little perverted. I mean, sure, hes fifteen and thats how fifteen year old boys act, but I still dont get why hes so immature. 

Maybe hes just trying to use humor to quell his fear, I dont know.

I keep waking up in the middle of the night, with him standing in the corner of the hotel room (we had to move again) just staring either at me or out the window. Ill shout his name and get no response until the third time when hell say hes just keeping watch. The funny thing is, I remember his eyes being brown but recently theyve seemed to be a bright blue.

Maybe its the stress getting to me.

Honestly, guys, Im not feeling so hot right now. Ive thrown up twice in the past two days, but Im afraid if I go to the hospital or something the Dremploys (which is what Ill call Dryston Employees from now on. Actually, no, thats stupid) will find me through the records.

Our toilet is stained blue now.

Im only typing this up right now because Finn has gone grocery shopping. Weve only been having the continental breakfasts for the past week, so its nice to actually get some food. But to be honest, its even better to just have him away.

I thought I could make this work, have somebody else to be on the run with. Ill try to ditch him tonight, I suppose.

This has been a huge downer, I know. The only reason I even agreed to take Finn with me was because besides Cass Id never really had any friends. Isabelle doesnt count. Not for me, anyway. 

We were gonna be married, Isabelle and I. We had a whole plan. And then she was taken away from me.

Im not gonna get back into that, though. I could go on and on about how beautiful her hair was, or how her laugh sent tingles up and down my spine until I was downright tickling. I know its a lot to hope for, but I *need* her to still be alive.

---

Okay. What I said earlier was completely wrong. Finns not perverted. Hes downright *polluted*. Im sure its not entirely him, his eyes are all fucked, but I needed to get the fuck away from him. Oh my god, Im still shaking.

Well, not aggressive. I guess *forward* might be a better word for it. I woke up last night to find him standing in the corner staring at me. Naked.

I know Ive said this quite a few times before; Im gay. I do not like penis. So seeing him watching me while I slept with that fucking corrupted smile on his face was the last straw for me. I kicked my sheets off of myself and snagged the bat from next to the bed. He made a leap for me over the bed and I swung the bat at his head but I missed. He scrambled on all fours toward me as I held my bat out protectively.

He stood up and wrestled the bat out of my hands. He cracked me in the head, and even though I held my hands out to defend myself, he still knocked me out.

Being knocked out isnt like in the movies. You arent out for hours, and then you wake up with water splashed over your face; voices echoing and a bright light in your eyes.

Its a matter of seconds. Crippling, soul breaking seconds.

After my vision faded back in and my hearing returned, came my feeling. I felt an absence around myself. I looked down and saw that he had torn my pants off of me. This is when the crying started. I realized I needed to use all of my strength to fight back.

So I still dont know why I just let him do that to me. I couldnt move. I kept begging myself to move, to fight back, but my body wouldnt listen to me.

He finished and rolled onto his back, playing with my hair. Told me that we could only trust each other.

I just fucking nodded.

Choking back a sob, I pulled my pants back up. Told him I was going for a walk. He just smiled at me and told me that was fine.

I debated calling the police as I walked out. I was going to, but then I realized that the Dryston Employs might figure out where I am because of that. Wiping my tears from my face, I got into my car.

Fuck.

---

I drove all morning. I turned on the radio as soon as I pulled out of the parking lot, ignoring the angry texts from Finn. Tuned the station until I lost interest in continuing, and left it.

*...you used to get it in your fishnets, now you only get it in your nightdress*

I shut off the radio.

I guess thats really all I can update on at the moment.

---

I bought a sandwich from the rest stop while entering Kentucky. It was alright. I got a few weird looks from the cashier though, so thats nice.

I just dont feel like anything right now.

I feel like I should be sad, or feel devalued or some shit like that. But honestly, Im having trouble feeling anything. I mean, most of the time Im sorta just drifting. Every once in awhile itll hit me like a truck, and Ill break down in the middle of a field wondering why Im even here.

I havent had a single relationship that didnt end in disaster. Cass, dead. Isabelle, gone. Finn no longer a viable source of friendship. 

Fuck. 

I know what he did to me. I know the word. Its one syllable, four letters. Ive spent more energy trying not to write it down than it would take to just type it.

If he had been a stranger, I think Id be more receptive to the idea of just writing it down. But I knew Finn for a *long* time. I trusted him. I still think of him as a friend.

You dont need to tell me thats not rational. I know it isnt. But when its somebody you trust

I know I shouldnt be blaming myself. I know that he did it, it was his fault.

But I still *do* blame myself. I still *think* that the fault is mine.

Its hard to describe, I guess.

I feel like Isabelle would know what to do.

I feel sick.

---

Hi again. Well, I guess youre reading this all at once; not over the course of weeks like I have. Its been about three weeks since, you know, the incident. I know I shouldnt be calling it that. Ill get there. Its such a *blunt* word. 

Anyway

Im currently in Illinois. Doing okay, surprisingly. Staying in a little hotel right now. I think, though, after this Im going back to Dryston. I guess this has been a sorta hectic update. Im sorry for that, and I wish I had more to offer, but I really dont.

---

FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK

Okay, they found me. Oh shit oh shit. Ill try to get this written down.

THERES NO FUCKING TIME THEYRE RIGHT OUTSIDE.

Pretending to be cops.

*Fuck, they are cops*

What do I do what do I do what do I do what do I do?

---

Its okay, guys. Im okay. I ended up breaking a fucking window and fucking right out of there.

Broke a few driving laws.

Ended up somewhere else.

Not saying the location because I realized theyre probably getting my location updates from google drive.

For a town with nearly no internet, theyre pretty adept with computers.

---

Ended up sleeping under a bridge. Off the grid and shit. Well, I guess except for this laptop. Whatever.

Im fine.

---

Im sick.

	<TEXT> Hello, Dr. Tyson. I have a question that has plagued me since about three hours ago while playing GTA V. Don't worry, my question has nothing to do with GTA.

I was wondering... 

Imagine, in front of me, was a well of water. And because of some magical miracle, this well went downward forever and thus had no bottom to it. The water of the well is entirely still, and the room I am in is void of all air (imagine, also, that I can survive in these conditions). The water of the well is exactly at the brim. 

I was wondering, due to water displacement, what would happen if I put my hand into the water? Would the water rise and overflow, or would the fact that there is infinite water, and infinite space for my hand, cause the water to stay at the same height? Would the water even ripple?

Looking forward to your answer, I'm quite curious.

-Rainer, 15, IN. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The story is still flawed, however, because it doesn't even understand the source material it's working from. NZT is effective not because it improves brain power, but instead raises the efficiency of the neurological pathways *in the brain*. I would give the story a pass if it was following the established rules of the material it's half-assedly ripping off, but it can't even do that correctly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am aware of countable and uncountable infinities. I get that that's not up for debate.

There are an uncountably infinite number of universes. Meaning that there is no specific number of universes with dick shakes. 

There are an infinite number of even numbers, right? And an infinite number of odd ones. Half of all numbers are odd.

Same with universes. Any way you divide it up, it will always come down to infinity. 3/4 of infinity, for example, will still be infinity. So 3/4 is also 1/2. Maybe I am completely wrong, but this is honestly the only way I can explain my thought process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Infinity +1 is still infinity. Since both cases are infinite, there's no way to say that one is infinitely more than the next, thus both are exactly equal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My point is that, if both instances are infinite, then half of all instances are infinite as well. 

Because of this, both instances are exactly equal to one another (as there is no reason to count above the pre-defined "infinity" we already have). 

By that logic, exactly (the term "exactly" being used loosely, as with our current understanding of it there is no way to quantify a *half-infinity*) half of all multiversal instances will contain dick shakes. </TEXT>

...No, you couldn't argue that. Let's Players add a (generally comedic) voice, using the games they play as a backboard to bounce their ideas off of.

"Reactionists", as they call themselves, steal entire videos and then say something along the lines of "that was nice". Video over.

As much hate as they got, at least the Fine Bros had an educational aspect to their videos! </TEXT>
