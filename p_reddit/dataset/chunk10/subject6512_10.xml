If you choose [the detailed comparison chart](https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/) you can sort by jurisdiction (the country they're based in). It's an easy way to get an overview of VPN providers based in the EU. You can use the contents of the other fields to make an informed decision about which provider is best suited to your needs.  
  
If you want to use it for multiple devices and family use, consider configuring your home network router to connect to the VPN. That way any device on your home network will connect to the internet through your VPN.  
  
r/VPN is a good resource for more detailed advice.   </TEXT>

In 1927, the Supreme Court ruled that illegally earned income was subject to income tax; Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. rejected the argument that the Fifth Amendment protected criminals from reporting illegal income.[55] The IRS special investigation unit chose Frank J. Wilson to investigate Capone, with the focus on his spending. The key to Capone's conviction on tax charges was proving his income, and the most valuable evidence in that regard originated in his offer to pay tax.  
  
Who knows what new trick or mistake will be Trump's undoing? So far, conventional or easy-to-spot rule-breaking hasn't done the job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with the first paragraph of your comment, but the second one is problematic.  
  
Privacy and anonymity aren't synonyms. Anonymity is a tool that is sometimes used to protect one's privacy with. Privacy is a right without which there'd be no freedom or safety.  
  
Journalism would be impossible if sources' identities can't be protected. If you could lose your job for talking to a journalist, and you had no means to protect your identity, you would not speak to a journalist, even if you felt some of what you know should be known to the public.  
Dissenters living under repressive regimes would be silenced before they could even hope to effect change.  
You, personally, have a certain degree of freedom because you're fairly anonymous in public. (Of course, that's all changing thanks to facial recognition and other identification through biometrics, and the ~~trackers~~ smartphones in our pocket.)  
  
As for privacy, deciding who you let know what about you when gives you control over your own life. Technology is taking that away and handing the control to others. The GDPR is an imperfect attempt at restoring some of your control over your own life. </TEXT>

We are not on the same page: You believe limiting speech is a risk-free exercise.

And as I've tried to show, we all would suffer, because we don't know who's going to be in charge tomorrow, nor do we know if the people in charge right now will change their minds tomorrow.

	<TEXT>  You should not be allowed to [...] propose the removal of basic rights from other people.  
  
Ironically, you are proposing to limit one of their basic rights ;) But* putting that aside for a moment:
  
One of the weird upsides to someone challenging basic rights is that other people are forced to think about and defend these rights. It forces people to ask why we have those rights, what life would be like without them, and if there's room for improvement.  
  
Why would you want to force silence on others? The ideas would still exist and fester in an echo chamber  and darkness. Speaking about them openly creates the opportunity to challenge their ideas and, eventually, to change their minds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who gets to decide which ideas are legitimate? Many ideas we now consider as good or even vital were deemed illegitimate in the past. (The idea - and now fact - that the earth revolves around the sun instead of the sun around the earth comes to mind.)  
  
There's not an easy answer, and I'm not necessarily against outlawing racist speech, but outlawing any speech means that you create a degree of acceptability for it, and an infrastructure to ban or prosecute said speech. That infrastructure can then be used to ban other speech, speech that should be legitimate. That is, if there are such things as legitimate and illegitimate speech. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is how the attack works:  
  
To break into a victims account, the attackers first acquire the username and password  possibly gathered from previous data breaches that revealed millions of account credentials. Because people often recycle passwords or use variations on the same password, prior leaks can put seemingly unrelated accounts at jeopardy.  
  
Once the attackers entered the username and password, they would have to gain access to a two-factor authentication code  a secondary protection that sends a temporary login code to a device associated with a user. It often comes in the form of a text message sent to the users primary phone number.  
  
This type of protection typically ensures a login attempt is from the purported user, as it requires physical access to the device itself to receive the code. However, using an exploit in SS7, the attackers were able to intercept that message containing the two-factor login code before it arrived on the users device.  
  
With access to that code, the attackers could then enter the victims bank account and drain it of money by transferring the funds to another account. [(source)](https://www.yahoo.com/tech/criminals-exploit-flaw-mobile-networks-232559308.html)  
  
In the article of the German paper that first reported it, it says that the attackers tended to operate at night, hoping that it would reduce the chance of the victim noticing that the phone had connected to a foreign network.  
So a basic understanding of the system will not help you if you're not able to notice the attack.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ik ontken de bezwaren die je maakt niet, en deel je zorgen. Ik denk alleen dat onder druk alles vloeibaar wordt, dus ook deze bezwaren. Als je moet kiezen tussen verarming van Nederland en geen pensioen, of een buurman met een andere culturele achtergrond, zal de keuze snel gemaakt zijn, denk ik.  
In mijn achterhoofd heb ik ook de klimaatproblemen die de komende decennia een ongekend grote vluchtelingenstroom op gang zal brengen. De vluchtelingen uit Syrie - een conflict dat mede-veroorzaakt is door klimaatverandering - is slechts een klein voorproefje. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remaining part of the EU would be good for privacy. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will go into effect soon, well before Brexit becomes a reality, so UK businesses will still need to comply. The GDPR gives users/citizens more ownership and control over their data and the data they generate by using (digital) goods and services. The EU will likely continue on this path to protect privacy, while the UK seems hellbent on doing the opposite (the Investigatory Powers Act aka Snoopers' Charter, and the Digital Economy Bill come to mind).
  
Then there's the Court of Justice of the European Union which has been helpful at times: https://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/dec/21/eus-highest-court-delivers-blow-to-uk-snoopers-charter

	<TEXT> The security offered by banks or governments isn't flawless and absolute. It can get hacked, and individuals and organizations *will* try to gain unauthorized access. They only have to succeed once.  
  
And there are many possible points of interception: The place it is stored, the place where the backups are stored, the data in transit, and the point of collection (your lenses).  
  
Then there's humans. Humans create and maintain the technology that makes this possible. Humans are flawed, so the technology is inherently flawed too. On top of that they are corruptible, they are curious, they have their own goals. There's a practice known as [LOVEINT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOVEINT). That will tell you how reliable humans are when you give them access to personal data.  
  
But **the biggest privacy violation of all**: You are recording your interactions with other people. And it will be impossible to get consent from all of them. You may be free from the consequences after you die, but they are still alive. Whoever gains access to your data, now has access to information about these individuals, which means they now have some degree of power over them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a) can they tell who it is (what house, person, etc.  

If they wanted to, yes. They could identify the traffic from a certain subscriber. Which person would be harder, because they would have to guess which person in the household is looking at what.  
  
b) could they see pages I visit, posts I make, and emails/imessages I send or just the overall site url?  
  
Unless the site you visit uses SSL to encrypt traffic between you and their server, they ISP is able to see the content of your traffic if they wanted to. Sites you visit that start with http:// are an open book. Sites you visit that start with http**s**:// encrypt your traffic. This means that your ISP can only see that you are connecting to that site, but not the information that is being exchanged, like which pages you're visiting.  
  
If your e-mail traffic is encrypted, your ISP won't be able to see it. Unless they host your e-mail. iMessage is encrypted end-to-end, so they won't be able to see the contents of your messages.  
  
If you wish to shield your traffic from your ISP, you should consider using a paid VPN. A VPN is an encrypted connection between you and a server of your VPN provider. Your ISP will see nothing but gibberish.  
  
Go to r/VPN and r/privacytoolsIO for advice, and read their sidebars.  
  
In the meantime, when you want to watch porn, make sure you only use sites that support SSL, like Pornhub, xVideos, and XHamster, and that you're using that SSL connection by making sure the URL is prefixed with http**s**://
Again, they will be able to see that you're visiting that site, but they won't be able to see which video you're looking at. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marvel's Daredevil on Netflix. First episode, toward the end. A registered nurse helped the hero to torture a man more effectively.  
  
Torture in fiction isn't harmless. The Fox show "24" prepared the American minds for the torture that was to follow in Abu Graib in Iraq and in Camp X-Ray / Guantanamo Bay.  
I'm not going to support a show that features torturers as heroes by watching it.

The same goes for the show Chicago P.D. The whole 'it takes a bad guy to catch a bad guy' bullshit doesn't work for me.

	<TEXT> The original of the strings sampled in the track you posted is:

[Millie Jackson - We Got To Hit It Off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BW8GHPCGaA)  
  
Edit: Some of the stuff at the beginning is sampled from Roy Ayers - Sweet Tears, which has great strings too:  
  
- [Roy Ayers - Sweet Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1NHSPo_-W8)
 - [Nuyorican Soul - Sweet Tears](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6NdR6BOQx8)  
  
If you dig strings, these two are the tunes for you:  
  
- [Sister Sledge - Reach Your Peak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrsEGEfwfs0) (Strings @ 2:11)  
- [Quincy Jones - Tell Me A Bedtime Story](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-63w7ZnKy5c) (Strings @ 2:18)   
 - Bonus: [Quincy Jones - Tell Me A Bedtime Story (Opolopo Cut'n'Paste Edit)](https://soundcloud.com/soulbowl/quincy-jones-tell-me-a-bedtime) (The fun starts at 2:20)  
  
A lot of stuff by Salsoul Records features The Salsoul Orchestra, which had a killer string section, so be sure to look into that.  
  
This record has a great set of strings as well: [Double Exposure - My Love Is Free (Tom Moulton Mix)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KM693cb903U), and here it is without the strings and the vocals, for contrast: [Double Exposure - My Love Is Free (Demo Acetate Instrumental)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXFpPqFRKXM) </TEXT>
