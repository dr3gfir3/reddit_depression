	<TEXT> I don't agree that its the same path, though there are parallels. 

Firstly, receivers can already transition to T2 with no change to any other system, since T2 devices will work on T networks. Secondly, when DVB-T is switched off, dongles to adapt existing hardware can be very cheaply bought and painlessly installed.

As far as the technology to transition to, I expect FTA to be around for at least the next decade, especially with the state of NBN mismanagement. We currently have enough spare spectrum capacity to do the parallel transition, but if we move to higher definitions before doing so, we may not have that luxury. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not all existing DVB-T cards/hardware support H.264. DVB-T2 is about 30% more efficient, supports more streams = more channels, is much more resilient, so better reception for fixed antennas and will enable portable/mobile TV. All of this will start mattering more as we transition to 4 and 8HD, which will require new hardware anyway.

DVB-T2 receivers are backwards compatible with DVB-T, so to transition, announce the change and get vendors to stop selling DVB-T hardware. Run DVB-T and T2 in parallel for a fixed transition period, then switch off DVB-T. Some existing hardware can be upgraded, others can use a cheap dongle to support the new standard.

	<TEXT> The networks insisted on staying with DVB T and shoehorning MPEG 4 onto it instead of switching to DVB T2. That way they can fill the spectrum with quasi HD channels so no new stations can be added.

Basically, it's a way of making sure Australia won't ever get more channels. The only way we'll get more FTA content is by retiring old channels and replacing them.

Hard to imagine why the Gov't would agree to such a mess, but they did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's pretty unfair to McMahon, and arguably Abbott.

McMahon was hated by his own party and others for being a liar, a leaker, a plotter, and for having no vision for his team or country, but he didn't actually do much damage while he was PM. In fact, Whitlam inherited a country that had a surplus and very good schools, infrastructure etc.

Likewise Abbott was certainly one of the more malevolent PMs, but despite his intentions, he didn't really do much damage while PM. True, there was the carbon "tax" repeal, but that had arguably alread been gutted even before Abbott took power and put it out of its misery. And Abbott at least was a man who acted on his convictions.

Turnbull though, has done enormous damage to the nation, from gutting NBN, wrecking ABS and CSIRO, wasting everybody's time and goodwill with marriage equality, to abandoning the reef to coalies and more. 

And worse, Turnbull has done it with full knowledge of the harm he's choosing to do. Before his Faustian ascension he spoke against almost all of the policy he's since enacted. He's skewered this country and its people for his own personal gain, and for that he deserves to be remembered as our worst PM ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What we need to do instead is gut and/or nationalise the insurance industry in Australia, starting with the parasitic health insurers.

Having a national domestic insurance system that's designed to protect and benefit the people of Australia would go a long way to standardising the motor vehicle, household and other personal liability insurances that are currently designed to be so wordy and impenetrable that it's hard to tell what's actually covered. 


Leave the business insurance to the existing companies. They can scavenge on each other.

Marketing campaigns promote a product through different media, including television, radio, print and online platforms. **Campaigns don't have to rely solely on advertising** and can also include demonstrations, word of mouth and other interactive techniques. Businesses operating in highly competitive markets may initiate frequent marketing campaigns and devote significant resources to generating brand awareness and sales. </TEXT>

From 2015:

Five leading global banks - Citibank, Deutsche Bank, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays - had declined to fund the project citing decline in coal mining in Australia, coal prices falling by 50 per cent and environmental issues, he said. 


http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/state-bank-of-indias-loan-to-adani-group-questioned-in-rajya-sabha/articleshow/45294506.cms

Eleven major international lenders have now publicly stated that they will not finance the $16.5 billion project, and at least one analyst says more delays could see the Indian company behind it ultimately scrap the development.

It is supposed to be the biggest thermal coal (used in power stations) project in Australian history, but the challenges facing Indian company Adani's coal project in the Galilee Basin keep mounting.

Three major French investment banks - BNP Paribas, Credit Agricole and Societe General - have sent letters ruling out funding the development.

These three banks play a very significant role in financing the fossil fuel industry in Australia, particularly coal mining.

Westpac didn't withdraw support because of environmental lobbying. They just joined the rapidly growing list of financial institutions that have assessed the economics of the project and decided it wasn't viable.

Ok? Even established coal financiers don't want to touch it. Westpac was already joining the exit queue, and trying to spin up a bit of positive PR on its way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As for it being a defeat it's commemorated rather than celebrated and serves to remind people not only about the tenacity of the Anzacs but also what a terrible thing war is. 

Actually, it's celebrated because Keith Murdoch, an Australian journo with strong political connections, agreed to do a favour for a British journo and carry a letter that was intensely critical of the British military commanders in Gallipoli to the British Prime Minister. He was waylaid by military agents before he got to Britain, and the letter was taken from him.

That pissed him off, so he rewrote the letter from memory with a lot of embellishments praising the Aussie and Kiwi soldiers, and completely bagging the Brit generals. He gave the letter to the British PM, who was a mate of his, the Aussie PM, who was also a mate, and also one of the major newspaper empire owners, who was his boss.

When the story got out, and people realised what a fuckup the campaign was, the pollies decided it was better to run with the "Glorious ANZACs" story than the "Holy shit we're bad at this" story.

The rest, as they say, is history.
