	<TEXT> This reminds me of a story about [Mother Teresa](https://valerietarico.com/2013/04/29/self-flagellation-and-the-kiss-of-jesus-mother-teresas-attraction-to-pain/)

 One day I met a lady who was dying of cancer in a most terrible condition. And I told her, I say, You know, this terrible pain is only the kiss of Jesus  a sign that you have come so close to Jesus on the cross that he can kiss you. And she joined her hands together and said, Mother Teresa, please tell Jesus to stop kissing me.

I've heard Catholics say "Jesus is testing me" while they are in a difficult part of life. That one has always made my skin crawl. I've never understood this logic. What is the test? How does one even pass it? My best guess is that people think some horrible problem, such as a loved one dying, is actually a secret test by Jesus to ensure the person being tested actually keeps on believing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Single payer can work in America, and it can work without screwing the healthcare industry by expecting them to all take a big pay cut or shareholders in healthcare companies getting a huge decrease in stock value.

It also doesn't need to be some socialistic government takeover of a trillion dollar industry.

It's a math problem.

Currently, those of us with health care pay a lot of money for that insurance in premiums, co-pays, etc. A family of four can expect to pay over $1000 a month just to have insurance. We need to spread that cost around to everyone. That's why the Affordable Care Act has a provision where people must get insurance or pay a fine.

Some people get better rates if they work for a large company. The company has the leverage to negotiate better rates and they can also spread the cost across their many healthy employees defraying the cost of their few sick employees.

At its core, single payer means a single pool of people. Instead of one person buying insurance directly, another person in a small business getting insurance with a few other employees, and some giant company getting plans for all their employees, instead we all pay into the same place.

Where is becomes a math problem, and a solvable math problem, is how we spread the cost around. Let's use the $1000/month for a family of four, for $250 per person. Let's say that's what it really costs for a big healthcare provider to cover four people, so they can pay their doctors and staff what they are paying now, and their shareholders make some money. Instead of each family paying in based on separately negotiated rates, we all pay into a common pool via taxes. This could be by expanding Medicare, or creating a new pool. There would be some difference in what each family pays based on their income level. What's important is the math. Using the $250 per person * 321 million Americans, that's the amount of money we need in the pool each year. If you work at a minimum wage job, you pay less than $250. If you are a Fortune 500 CEO, you pay more. The $250 number might go down once we are all in the same pool, and all spreading the cost around. No more having people who pay for insurance having to pick up some of the cost for people who show up at the ER with no insurance.

Again, it's math. The percentages can be sliced and diced and endlessly debated in Congress, but at the end of the day, if you have enough money in the single payer pool, both the minimum wage person and the 1% person can walk into their local United Healthcare, Blue Cross, or other provider and sign up for coverage. The company bills the single payer pool $250 per person. That amount should provide for at least basic healthcare. What defines basic healthcare would also be an endless debate, co-pays, deductibles, etc. There could still be supplemental healthcare on top of the basic single payer. Employers could still offer that as a benefits. It could lower co-pays and deductibles and cover more medical issues.

Keeping our society health does benefit everyone. CEOs have a healthier workforce, and healthy consumers who can stay employees and buy more stuff. It could also cut down on expensive medical procedures if people could go to the doctor at minimal cost when they first get sick.

This single payer system isn't all that different from how Social Security works, or Medicare for old people, or unemployment insurance. We all pay into those programs out of our paychecks, and at a percentage based on our income level. The reason people keep saying Social Security is running out of money is again, a math problem, we collectively pay in less money that we collectively take out. Sure, I'm ignoring the political reality of voters getting upset with they have to pay more and/or receive less, but as they say "money doesn't grow on trees". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't read JPII "theology of the body" but I have gotten into a number of debates with Catholics around the topic of sexuality and "natural law" which is another underpinning of Catholic philosophy. I'm no expert in all this, but what it seems to come down to is that sex is used to make babies, and that keeps our species going. Any other use of sex is therefor bad/less pure/less holy, especially if it goes against the idea of making babies. This is where they derive the Catholic opposition to birth control, sex acts that can't lead to babies, same sex relationships, etc.

There are people who can go on and on about this natural law argument and see it as a pretty iron clad "logical" argument.

While I certainly wouldn't argue that sex can be used for making babies, it's also not the only reason to have sex or enjoy sex. There is plenty of medical evidence showing other benefits of sex, either with someone else or by yourself. Just because a baby doesn't come out of it doesn't seem particularly relevant to me.

I really don't get why something needs to have one and only one use or primary purpose, as natural law arguments would make. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Not so fast](http://www.archindy.org/holyyearofmercy/indulgence.html)

 The Holy See has designated four ways that Catholics may receive a plenary indulgence during the Holy Year of Mercy, which will begin on Dec. 8 and conclude on Nov. 20, 2016.

 Only one plenary indulgence may be received per day. A single participation in the sacrament of penance can apply to any reception of a plenary indulgence 20 days before or after going to confession. However, reception of Communion and praying for the intentions of the pope and the pope himself are required for each plenary indulgence.

I guess we missed out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope someone in the US military would risk being Court marshaled and tried for treason, and stand up to President Trump should he give the order to launch a nuke.

[This recent Radio Lab episode](http://www.radiolab.org/story/nukes/) offers a sobering look at just how little legal ability any would have to stop the President should he decide to launch a nuke.

Part of the conventional Republican wisdom about: when doing poorly in the polls, bomb someone, I don't think that logic would hold up with nukes. Launching some cruise missiles into Syria or dropping some mega conventional bomb on ISIS in Afganistan, those have limited short term blow back. They aren't out of the ordinary, even with the Mother of All Bombs.

I just don't see how the same could be said for using a nuke. How could we possibly drop even one anywhere in the world and not get sucked into a huge international crisis? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's so hard to know how to calibrate the needle on the "how crazy is our President" scale. I didn't find Monday to be extra crazy when grading on the Trump curve. The whole Civil War thing was bad but I would imagine most Americans couldn't tell you if Andrew Jackson was alive during the Civil War. Worse was his general lack of knowledge over why the war was fought and why it is significant in American history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can relate to this PTRS with some family stuff but I was fortunate not to have much fallout with friends. While I did go to Mass weekly, I wasn't involved socially at the Church and generally kept to myself when at Church. At the time many of my friends were in various stages of being ex Catholic and they were a great help and sounding board. Over the years I have connected with others over our shared former Catholicism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Here's a question to you - if some (ill-informed) Catholic actually told a ex-Catholic relative that they were "going to hell," it would be painful to the ex? This is where it falls apart for me because if I don't believe in hell why is it painful if someone tells me I'm going there?

Would it be painful? Absolutely, why wouldn't it be? Sure, I don't think I am going to hell, but that fact that someone I love thinks I am screwed for all eternity, yeah, that does hurt. The hurt is tied into the idea of not being fully accepted and loved by your family.

	<TEXT>  They become a mess when people enter the church as well.

I could see how that would be a difficult process too.

 And I don't understand what this means "and Catechism for what part the Church actually teaches, and what parts are just picked up along the way and not proper Catholic behavior." If you're willing to explain I'm willing to listen.

Basically, what I mean is, when people say stuff like: "ex Catholics are going to Hell" or "your marriage isn't a real marriage because it occurred outside the Church". Maybe those statements can be traced back to a section in the Catechism, or maybe those statements are just ideas that get propagated by other Catholics and not officially endorsed by the Church. The answer to that question isn't all that important to most ex Catholics. It just that it hurts to hear statements like that from people who you love and who are still a part of the Catholic Church.

	<TEXT>  Do any of you understand the pain you cause your families?

I have gained a greater appreciation for that question as I have gotten older. I know my decision to leave the Church has caused a lot of pain in my family, and created a certain amount of distance between my mother and I. I do think we have healed much of that over time and over a number of conversations, but I doubt it will ever be fully healed.

As you say:

 I took it because I had to follow my conscience. My decision, my consequences.

I agree, I said much the same when it was my time to leave the Church. I needed to be true to myself. If I could have chosen otherwise, it would have saved me a lot of grief. I don't regret my decision to leave. I do regret some of the ways I initially handled it and have done what I can to resolve that.

I take most of my frustration with Catholics and Catholicism here to /r/excatholic and avoid posting the stuff I post here on Facebook where it will upset or offend Catholic family and friends. I've had enough of those arguments to know there really isn't much point to starting more. Earlier on I made some attempts to convert people to ex-Catholic status who just weren't interested. I regret that and no longer bring up those kinds of conversations. I think I am mostly fine with the religious choices other people make, as long as they aren't trying to force it on me.

Ultimately, I think these types of problems stem from the Church, and many religions, insistence on knowing **The Truth**. I get that for people who are followers of whichever religion, that does bring a certain amount of comfort, and a framework for how to live ones life. I felt some of the comfort when I was growing up and still very much a Catholic, and also a certain amount of condescension towards non-Catholics and ex-Catholics. It's all fine when you are in it, but it sure makes for a big mess when people decide to leave.

We can debate all you want, and parse the Bible and Catechism for what part the Church actually teaches, and what parts are just picked up along the way and not proper Catholic behavior. I don't think you will find much interest in those theological arguments here on /r/excatholic

	<TEXT> I wonder what Trump voters are thinking and how they can still justify voting for him. I heard plenty of "he will blow it all up and start fresh", whatever the hell that means.

It is pretty crazy that a GOP Congress and President can't agree on hot button issues that get Republicans excited. I am convinced that Republicans don't want to repeal the Affordable Care Act. They don't want to be held responsible for all the problems that would create. The have been complaining about Social Security for decades or overturning Roe. Obamacare is just another Republican dog whistle to get people to vote or donate money.

As much as I would like to see President Trump pushed out, I just don't see it happening with a Republican Congress. It's not like they don't already have enough reasons. If the midterms could sweep in enough Democrats... </TEXT>

Different strokes for different folks. I know people all across the spectrum, conservative Catholics, liberal Catholics who disagree with the Church on just about every hot-button social issue, and ex Catholics.

 20 years is a long time to be angry.

You should have seen me 20 years ago. I'm much better now.

 If it's flat out wrong, I'm going to say something.
