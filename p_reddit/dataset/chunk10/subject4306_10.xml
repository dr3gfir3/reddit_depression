	<TEXT> Things will get better! Healing isn't linear; there will be moments when it feels fresh and raw all over again, but as time goes on those will happen less and less, and eventually you'll look back and realize it's been months since you last cried. I actually have a tag on tumblr for posts/quotes that make me feel better, if you want I can pm you the link. I'd like to share one of my favourite quotes that helped me through some things, as well.
Your body is not a temple. Temples can be destroyed and desecrated. Your body is a forest, thick canopies of maple trees and sweet scented wild flowers sprouting in the underwood. You will grow back, over and over again, no matter how badly you are devastated.

You got this. If you ever need to chat, I'm just a PM away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is absolutely, 100% possible to get over your first love. The first few sentences of your post could have been written by me. I'm 20 and was also in a relationship from age 17 that ended last summer. In my case, he treated me horribly toward the end (and during), and that was what I tried to remember. Any time I missed him I would mentally go over the list of things that were bad about him. Are there any things your ex did that hurt you, any negative qualities that he had? It's sort of like when somebody dies, you get love goggles and you only remember the good things about them.

It also sounds like your depression isn't being managed very well. What's your support system like? If you don't feel like your meds are working the way that they should be, it might be worth a quick visit to your doctor. It took me a long time to find the right "cocktail" for me, but once I did, things became a lot easier. Having depression is like being stuck at the bottom of a deep hole, but the right medication could be a ladder for you. You still have to do the work and climb your way out of the hole, but you have that base there that makes it just a little bit easier. 

For me, the biggest key to getting over a relationship is distract, distract distract. Remembering that nice Christmas you had together? Oh look, here's a tutorial on how to build a homemade kite. See something that reminds you of him? Here's an article about something you're interested in. I'm not sure if you can make kites at home actually, so maybe don't try that. Even if you don't feel like doing anything, you could watch something interesting on your phone or download a new game to try out. I'm sure if you googled around you could find billions of things to occupy your time. I can also recommend a really awesome breakup playlist.

This has gotten way too long but I feel like I'm talking to my past self. I am much happier now, but it was SUCH a long road to get here. But it is absolutely worth it. My wish for you is that in 5 years you look back on this and remind yourself that you can get through *anything* that comes your way. I'm rooting for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I know which comment you're referring to and I apologize for the poor wording. What I meant was, on the first day of them working for me, I showed them around the apartment and told them which rooms/areas I wanted clean. For the last 3 months, they've just cleaned those same areas, which are basically everything but my office. What I think (hope) happened was they saw my cluttered office and thought that they would tidy up in there. But they threw out my very important notebook so I can't say that for sure.

I'm going to be talking with them soon about this, and if their explanation is something normal, which I'm sure it will be, I'll just make it clear to please not touch my office under any circumstances unless my cat is on fire and rolling around on my desk. My initial reaction was to fire them because I was so mad, but they are *really* good at their jobs normally and they are family friends so I don't want to make things uncomfortable. Also, the part about actually cleaning things rather than just wetting the surface made me laugh so hard. That is too real. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The apartment doesn't get super messy because there are two people living there and one is a broke student. Ramen noodle packages and tears don't create a lot of garbage. Plus I am in school full time and work on top of that - I'm barely home to make a mess. The only things the cleaning ladies have to do are the floors and dusting plus the kitchen appliances etc.

when I lived in an apartment I cleaned every day for hours

??? I feel like this is either hyperbolic or you have 14 children.

	<TEXT> Did you even read my post or a single comment reply? My office is not, nor has it ever been, a dump. One of the items thrown out was my notebook/planner - on what planet does that sound like trash? I'm not upset that they threw out my half eaten Twix bar that was smushed into the carpet. I'm upset that my schoolwork and documents vital to my job were moved or thrown away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few people have suggested it and I totally understand the thought but knowing my parents, there is absolutely no way they could have done this. My mom is the one that knows Karena and Amanda so she would have set it up. Having my house cleaned without my knowledge is maybe something that she would do - but it's unlikely, and at the *very least* she would consult my boyfriend on it - it's his house too. 

Even if that were the case, my mom is the most selfless woman I have ever met. I just got off the phone with her about an hour ago and I explained in detail what was changed (something I didn't do earlier) and she was completely shocked and is now more upset than I am about this. If she had had anything at all to do with it, she absolutely would have owned up to it. My mom is my best friend in the world and I trust her with everything. I know that she didn't do this.

	<TEXT> They are paid $25/hour and it varies from $50-$100 a week, depending on how long they clean for. Since they come weekly there isn't a ton to do. Relax. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It didn't come across very well in my post, but these ladies are wonderful and I do really like them as people. That's why I wanted to cool down and figure out what the next step is before I speak to them. I have no suspicion whatsoever that they did this to hurt me, but that's what ended up happening so I'm just trying to find the easiest way for everyone to come out of this feeling understood and respected.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They've been cleaning my apartment every week **for three months.** Day one, I tell them to clean x x and x. Basically everywhere except my office is mentioned. Every single week, they clean the exact same areas that I told them I wanted cleaned. This week, they did not. Am I expected to go over the specific areas with them every time they show up? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is exactly how I feel. To me, it's like the equivalent of having a babysitter that comes to watch my children every day, and then one day I come home to find out that they took the dog to the groomer. Yes, it was a semi-helpful thing to do, but it was done incorrectly and *without my permission*. That's really the biggest thing here.

I can't imagine my parents having anything to do with this. We have a really good relationship and they're very much sane people. I think the reason they aren't as upset as I am is because when I was a teenager, my bedroom was a DISASTER so they probably figure that my office was the same and all Karena and Amanda did was tidy things up for me. I didn't mention how they threw out my notes for school but I think once I do they'll be a lot more angry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When they started working for me I showed them around the apartment and told them which areas to focus on, which didn't include my office. As far as communication, I usually text or call them to tell them what time works, and if I'm not home when they're there they leave a note with the amount of hours they were there so I know how much to pay them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What does my age and status have to do with anything at all? Because I can afford $50 a week I'm not allowed to be upset that my personal items were moved around? Maybe if you focused less energy being bitter on the internet, you could afford your own cleaning ladies to wipe the attitude out of your comments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, and it's pretty sad to see the other commenters telling OP that this is a red flag and that she's crazy and trying to control him. Crazy is setting your boyfriend's clothes on fire because he didn't text you back, not saying "hey can you remove this person you used to date that you don't even talk to or care about anymore?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Leave them both alone and get yourself into some intensive therapy. Neither of these relationships are healthy. Also, stop describing your girlfriend as annoying and then saying you love her but could beat her and she would stay. Do you think that's a thought that comes from the mind of an emotionally stable person? I'm going to guess no. </TEXT>
