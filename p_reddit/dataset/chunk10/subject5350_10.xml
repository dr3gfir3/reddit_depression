	<TEXT> I started with VBA, turns out it lacks the strict structure of C# and other languages, but it's easy to learn and you can do some pretty bad ass things with it. Just imagine what you want to do with your program and google the shit out of your idea. I'm pretty sure you'll find someone who's laid it out for you. Look at their examples, study what it's doing and apply it to your program. That's how I learned. Overtime you remember these techniques and they become second nature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's convenient, kids love it, and cheap. I have places I love much more, but my favorite when I'm too tired to cook breakfast (my fav meal to cook) is McD's. I can't even remember the last time we went out for breakfast. Before kids I loved checking out new places, but life changes. </TEXT>
