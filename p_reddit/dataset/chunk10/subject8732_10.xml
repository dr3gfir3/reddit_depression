	<TEXT> Probably will end up more than what he got in the popular vote.
No, it wont.

It will get, 100k, maybe 150k. With population of US 321,4 million. So, less then 1%. Not to mention, that there is no proof that these votes are legitimate and from different users.

And yeah, voting on reddit wont impeach anybody.

So, congrats with reddit gold. The only profit of these post. =) </TEXT>
