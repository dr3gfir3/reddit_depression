	<TEXT> Bought an 80% lower because I've always wanted an AR and decided I'd rather build my own. 
Paid about $70 for the lower, then bought a complete upper kit from Palmetto arms for $419, then another $25 for flip up sights and $60 for an acog clone. Sub-$600 sounded pretty good to me for something like this, now all that's left to do is shoot it </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I've noticed it 5 times today with 5 different YouTube channels I'm subscribed to, but their new videos aren't showing up in my subscription feed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-28 02:57:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I look through my subs feed every hour or so to see if there's anything good, and today it's seemed pretty quiet. I accidentally opened YouTube on the home tab and saw a new video from someone I'm subbed to that was posted a couple hours ago. Weird, must've missed it.

Repeat that a couple more times throughout the day, and now I realize something's up. I scroll through my subs feed, and the videos I missed just aren't there. The only way I can find them is by going to the channel itself and looking at their new uploads.

There's nothing linking the channels at all, they're anywhere from 10k to 5m subs,  comedy, gaming, news, science, it just seems random. 

I've found a fix, if I unsub and resub, they show up in my feed like normal, but I've got over 200 channels I'm subbed to and I really don't want to go through all of them. 

Is this happening to anyone else? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a geeetech I3, it's been fine lately, I'm just trying to calibrate everything to work accurately and smooth, so I've been doing small prints all day. 
I went to print, it starts heating up, then after about a minute it just stops heating and I can't get the heater to turn back on unless I shut everything off and turn it back on. I tried again, same thing. 

I turned it off and back on again, then just go to the preheat menu instead of just printing, I set it to 200, it gets to about 100 and quits again. I've done it several times and it won't heat to temperature, and it shuts off anywhere from 40 to 180. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> .3mm nozzle, printed pla at 180, 20% infill. 

The infill is extremely soft and stringy, more like pillow fluff than anything. And I'm guessing because of that, the walls cave in and have almost no give to them. I printed a smaller object earlier in the day with no major problems, but this is quite a bit bigger, that might have something to do with it. 

Also the printer kept going through the whole night but filament stopped coming out about 1/4 of the way through, where the picture is </TEXT>
