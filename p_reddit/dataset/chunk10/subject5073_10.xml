	<TEXT> I think everyone is forgetting about... *laughs* Taserface. His presence allowed both Rocket and Yondu to develop and find purpose. TF is clearly a top tier villain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a teacher and randomly picked up a few trade paperbacks, 2 of them being "Spider-man fights substance abuse" and "Avengers: No More Bullying."  Are there any other collections or single issues dealing with PSAs? I ask because I know other teachers who "want to use comics more in the classroom (i.e. make them more legit)" and because they'd like to have some more student engagement. </TEXT>
