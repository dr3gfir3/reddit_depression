	<TEXT>  What can a non-theist replace "god(s)" with to still get the benefits of his message?

The Stoics (and the Epicureans) were the materialists of their time and therefore one really should not mistaken the Stoic god with the Christian one. The Stoic god is very similar to Spinoza's god: the Stoics were basically pantheists. According to Diogenes Laertius, *The substance of God is declared by Zeno to be the whole world and the heaven, as well as by Chrysippus in his first book Of the Gods, and by Posidonius in his first book with the same title.* The Stoics also identified god with the inherent rationality of the cosmos, which they called *logos*. You may also read the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_do_stoics_believe_in_god.2C_or_gods.3F).

*Living according to nature* may be the shortest summary of Stoicism. However, the word 'nature' has to be explained to understand what that means. Others have summarized that far better than I am able to do, you may read again the [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_does_it_mean_to_live_in_accordance_with_nature.3F) or Gregory B.

**Bullying and Being Bullied in Childhood Are Associated With Different Psychosocial Risk Factors for Poor Physical Health in Men**

Karen A. Matthews, J. Richard Jennings, Laisze Lee, Dustin A. Pardini

*Psychological Science*

First published date: April-28-2017

[10.1177/0956797617697700](http://dx.doi.org/10.1177%2F0956797617697700)

 **Abstract**

 Bullying and being bullied in childhood are both linked with later adjustment problems. The impact of childhood bullying on risk for poor physical health in adulthood is understudied. Black and White men (*n* = 305; mean age = 32.3 years) enrolled in the Pittsburgh Youth Study since the first grade underwent a comprehensive assessment of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological risk factors for poor health. Indices of bullying and being bullied were created by averaging annual ratings collected from participants and their caregivers when the participants were 10 to 12 years old. Results showed that being a bully in childhood was associated with greater stress and aggression and poorer health behaviors in adulthood, whereas being a victim of bullies in childhood was associated with lower socioeconomic resources, less optimism, and greater unfair treatment in adulthood. Unexpectedly, neither bullying nor being bullied in childhood was related to inflammation or metabolic syndrome. Bullying and being bullied in childhood were associated with distinct domains of psychosocial risk in adulthood that may later lead to poor physical health. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am no hedonist and think that hedonism is wrong because I don't regard pleasure as the highest good, not because shame follows pleasure (which is not necessarily true in a more general sense). But that was not my point.

I think that *hedonism without virtue* is wrong even *to the standards of hedonism*. Epicureanism, for example, is right in that it says that virtue is necessary for a happy life. If you act viciously or shamefully in pursuit of pleasure, this won't contribute to a happy life (because you will feel the shame and guilt or because you cannot be sure of not being caught).  </TEXT>

I am not so sure that a formal and complicated debate would work anyway. There are not a lot of participants to be expected (/u/B260 doesn't even want to be in the pyramid themselves) and it is doubtful that the few participants' breath is long enough. And who should decide at the end whose arguments are better (that is: who wins the debate)? Who would organize such a complicated debate? </TEXT>

I know from discussions in both subreddits, that such people exist here and there, but also that there are people who don't know much, don't want to argue rationally, don't want to learn, and disturb such debates up to the point of destruction of any constructive debate. In most cases these destructive people are those who do not even know their own philosophy well.

I am not against these debates (I even participated in one some weeks ago in this great subreddit and enjoyed it), I just want to say what may happen to be prepared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's certainly situational like everything else. I think that mutual openness and respect is best for both parties. Being able to talk openly about one's religion within a family certainly is very desirable in that regard. I don't think that one's religion is comparable to one's movie preferences, religion goes much deeper and has major consequences on daily life.

If coming out is no option, for example, because one is an adolescent depending on particularly difficult parents in religious regards, one may eventually be forced to lie and simulate for quite a long time. Some parents inflict a lot of stress and suffering on their children up to withdrawal of their parental responsibilities in such cases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  SVF I, 214

For those who want to know what /u/Chrysippean is writing about:

SVF I, 214 is a passage from *M. Tullius Cicero, For Lucius Murena*:

 [61] And since we are not to address this speech either to an ignorant multitude, or to any assembly of rustics, I will speak a little boldly about the pursuits of educated men, which are both well known and agreeable to you, O judges, and to me. Learn then, O judges, that all these good qualities, divine and splendid as they are, which we behold in Marcus Cato, are his own peculiar attributes. The qualities which we sometimes wish for in him, are not all those which are implanted in a man by nature, but some of them are such as are derived from education. For there was once a man of the greatest genius, whose name was Zeno, the imitators of whose example are called Stoics. His opinions and precepts are of this sort: that a wise man is never influenced by interest; never pardons any man's fault; that no one is merciful except a fool and a trifler; that it is not the part of a man to be moved or pacified by entreaties; that wise men, let them be ever so deformed, are the only beautiful men; if they be ever such beggars, they are the only rich men; if they be in slavery, they are kings. And as for all of us who are not wise men, they call away slaves, exiles, enemies, lunatics. They say that all offenses are equal; that every sin is an unpardonable crime; and that he does not commit a less crime who kills a cock if there was no need to do so, than the man who strangles his father. They say that a wise man never feels uncertain on any point never repents of anything, is never deceived in anything, and never alters his opinion.

    "Conduct me, Jove, and you, O Destiny,
    Wherever your decrees have fixed my station."
    Cleanthes

    "I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
    Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
    Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed
    Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven."
    Euripides, Frag. 965

	<TEXT> You are not the only one. The Stoics saw Stoicism as a unity and it's wise to keep that in mind. All parts fit together and need each other, even though some parts may be more important than others. One may choose whatever one likes from a buffet, but not from a philosophy.

That being said, there is a history of philosophy and science of about 2000 years between the ancient Stoics and us. So some changes here and there may be necessary indeed, but that has to be done in a reasonable way. If Chrysippus lived today, he certainly would not write exactly the same word for word either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All things are interdependent, absolutely nothing exists alone for itself. Compare different human beings with parts of the same body. One cannot awaken without compassion.

 From my current understanding it is not a necessity and someone who is a psychopath for example could just as well become awakened, as long as he realizes his flow of karma and puts an end to rebirth.

The path to the end of suffering does not consist of realizing the flow of karma alone. The path to the liberation from samsara is the [Noble Eightfold Path](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/waytoend.html). The path includes eliminating ignorance, craving and the like and cultivating a certain practice and state of mind which, of course, includes compassion (*karuna*) being a basic part of *right intentions*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  By the way, there was a disciple of Zeno of Citium (the founder of Stoicism), called Dionysus of Heraclea also called Dionysus the Renegade, that had a terrible illness in the eyes. He was not sure that the pain was indifferent and after years of Stoicism learning he determined to leave Stoicism and converted to Epicureanism.

Thanks for the opportunity for me to learn something new! However, [according to Diogenes Lartius](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Lives_of_the_Eminent_Philosophers/Book_VII#Dionysius) he did not convert to the Epicureans:

 When he fell away from Zeno, he went over to the Cyrenaics, and used to frequent houses of ill fame and indulge in all other excesses without disguise. After living till he was nearly eighty years of age, he committed suicide by starving himself.

Although both schools are regarded as hedonists, the Cyrenaics were quite different to the Epicureans in that they did not define pleasure as the absence of pain and distress as the Epicureans did, but as something reaching beyond that. They valued all pleasures as good, but classified bodily pleasures as somehow superior, while it's tranquility the Epicureans were after. Epicureans typically live modestly and limit their desires, which is not exactly what Cyrenaics are famous for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generalization like yours are most often wrong. Different people are different and behave differently and deal with strong pain differently. What you are writing is not true for everyone on the planet.

It is also an invalid generalization to say, that not liking pain is the whole reason for people to kill themselves, just because some commit suicide because of that. But people simply do not kill themselves only because of that. For example, some are sacrificing themselves to save the lives of their offsprings, family members, friends or even strangers. And there are a lot of more reasons as well.

That's not what I wrote - or at least not what I meant. These particular distortions are not evolvements, they are not even interpretations. Some of these distortions are even defamations of opponents.

That does not mean that valid modern interpretations cannot exist (I even think it would be stupid to say so). However, at a given point an evolvement becomes something new, but that does not concern these particular distortions either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Philosophy evolves and should evolve indeed. However, in this case it's not about official vs. evolvements, because these distortions simply are not evolvements of the original philosophies. They are not even similar to each other. Epicureans are neither uncontrolled hedonists nor gluttons and Stoics are neither statues nor wannabe entrepreneurs doing videos for other wannabe entrepreneurs.

Moreover, the ancient philosophies cannot change anymore, because they ceased to exist long ago. They are part of history now. We can (and should) study them thoroughly and our knowledge certainly will improve by doing that, but the objects of our study just stay what they were. There is also so much lost, such that we cannot even be sure about what they really taught in detail.

When we study them today we are doing best to learn most precisely what they were alike within their context. Then we may apply that knowledge to our own time, but it's highly questionable to call the result the same as the ancient philosophies, since human knowledge has changed so much. Epicurean and Stoic ethics were based on certain understandings of physics. Both Epicurean and Stoic physics are necessarily completely different to modern science, which has consequences on ethics, too.

There is an additional problem which is easy to forget: philosophies and religions consist of more than a literary tradition, which is the only thing we have from Epicureanism and Stoicism. There is also the cultural tradition, which we have lost completely. These can be quite different to each other. Reading Joseph Ratzinger's "Introduction to Christianity", for example, does not give one much clue of what children are taught in Catholic religion classes or what popular devotion is alike. </TEXT>

I think, we all should be aware of the fact that Epicureanism is misunderstood by a lot of people and that the same is true for Stoicism. Both ancient philosophies have virtually nothing to do with their distortions. Either ancient philosophy is a lot more nuanced than the distortion of the other philosophy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for engaging with me, too, I enjoy our conversation a lot.

I am interested in both philosophies and I agree that these different philosophies can complement each other to some degree what practical living is concerned. I am not as much convinced that this is true in a more general sense. Providence, for example, was an essential part of Stoicism and providence certainly is not anything Epicureans can agree to. The Stoics divided philosophy in ethics, logic and physics, but saw their philosophy as a unity nevertheless. Not everything of Stoic ethics makes sense without assuming providence, for example.

Providence is something I am not sure I can agree to. But then, I think it is better to [keep one's identity small](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html) anyway. I have been studying Stoicism quite a bit for a while now and have benefitting from it a lot, but I may have gone to far by stating that I have found my way to Stoicism or that I switched to Stoicism in one of my previous comments in the sense I'd call myself a Stoic now. It's more correct to say that I am an eclectic^* who is most attracted to Stoicism, Epicureanism and (much more loosely) to Buddhist philosophy.

Hellenism may be similar to our time in that there was quite a bit of uncertainty people felt. Both Stoicism and Epicureanism grew on that ground. Pulling oneself back from society to live a solitary life together with good friends certainly helps dealing with uncertain times. Stoicism offers a more active way within society. The teachings of Epicureanism and Stoicism are quite different and they saw themselves as opponent schools with good reasons. But both were what we call a philosophy of life today.

^* Eclecticism is not about believing whatever one likes, but about doing one's best to believe what is true using one's own best judgement. </TEXT>

It was even christianized by rewriting some parts concerning sexuality, exchanging 'Socrates' with 'St. Paul' and the like.

 Even after the end of the philosophical schools, a lot of people undertook the project of integrating Stoicism with their Christian belief.

You may be refering to the so-called Neo-Stoicism which some great people like Lipsius are known for. At the end they failed. Stoicism is by far not as compatible with Christianity as it may seem at first glance.

And it's really a pity that there are not more original sources of Epicureanism left. This is also true for the early and middle Stoa, but at least there are a lot of texts of the late Stoa. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But pleasure is not the highest good in Epicureanism.

Epicurus used two words: *hedone* and *ataraxia*. That is, there are passages where he used *hedone* and others where he used *ataraxia*. The word *hedone* is usually translated as *pleasure*.

However, I agree that *Hedonism* as it is commonly understood today is quite misleading. If we use words like *pleasure* while discussing Epicureanism, we may keep in mind that we are using technical terms whose meanings are much more nuanced than (and often quite different to) those in ordinary language.

 Existing in a state free of pain is not the same thing as "pleasure being the highest good".

I fully agree with you, because I am no Epicurean, but unfortunately that's what Epicurus wrote. He even wrote that freedom of pain is the highest pleasure. One may vary the quality of pleasure, but freedom of pain is the limit and pleasure doesn't get higher than that.

The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy offers a good [article about Epicurus](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/) and there we read:

 Because of this, Epicurus denies that there is any intermediate state between pleasure and pain. When one has unfulfilled desires, this is painful, and when one no longer has unfulfilled desires, this steady state is the most pleasurable of all, not merely some intermediate state between pleasure and pain. ([Source](http://www.iep.utm.edu/epicur/#SH5b))

You may also have a look at the original sources like Principal Doctrines No. III, for example.

 I don't need the extremism of [Apatheia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apatheia), which Stoics seem to strive for.

Although I don't consider Wikipedia a good source for anything, even this article gets it right enough to wonder why you call *apatheia* an extremism. Its meaning is very different to the meaning of the English word *apathy*. You may also read the article ["Apatheia vs Ataraxia: whats the difference?"](https://howtobeastoic.wordpress.com/2015/12/26/apatheia-vs-ataraxia-whats-the-difference/) by Massimo Pigliucci, a well respected philosopher.

  I'm fine with some healthy equanimity, mindfulness, and moderation. Works for me. :)

Now I am wondering even more, because *equanimity* is the best translation of *apatheia*, according to the article you linked. Equanimity (*apatheia*), mindfulness (*prosoche*) and moderation are fully compatible with Stoicism and even belong to the core concepts. Works for me, too. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both philosophies have much in common, but they differ a lot, too. One has to look at what characterizes a philosophy in comparison to others and then they differ a lot. For example, virtue being the highest good and pleasure being the highest good is a huge difference, no matter how similar they are in other regards. I have always been an eclectic to some degree and still value Epicureanism highly, but I don't agree to some basics anymore and it's not a matter of taste as far I am concerned.

I like your approach about extroverts and introverts. If that's true, I am an exception, since I am an introvert and have been one my whole life. Stoic principles have helped me a lot until now and I have begun applying them when I still was an Epicurean. That's no surprise, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, for example, is based on Stoicism as its founder states and belongs to the most effective therapies regarding anxiety, depression and the like.

	<TEXT> We certainly don't know for sure indeed, but I am going to take that with much more grain of salt hereafter.

At first sight their birth and death dates are not really suspicious:

[Antisthenes (c. 446366 B.C.E.)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/antisthe/)

[Diogenes of Sinope (c. 404323 B.C.E.)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/diogsino/)

However, the article about Diogenes is interesting and supports your version:

 Diogenes Laertius reports that Diogenes of Sinope fell in with Antisthenes who, though not in the habit of taking students, was worn out by Diogenes persistence (*Lives of Eminent Philosophers*, Book 6, Chapter 22). Although this account has been met with suspicion, especially given the likely dates of Diogenes arrival in Athens and Antisthenes death, it supports the perception that the foundation of Diogenes philosophical practice rests with Antisthenes.

So thanks for your answer, this was interesting to learn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't interpret 'god' as a personal or transcendental god or the like which the god the Stoics are talking about isn't. The Stoic god is similar to the god of Spinoza, we are talking about a completely different concept than what we know from Christianity. The Stoic god is an immanent one, a god which may be described best as the active physical principle governing the cosmos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's doubtful that Diogenes and Antisthenes ever actually met.

Are you sure? As far as I know, Antisthenes was the teacher of Diogenes and this [article](http://www.iep.utm.edu/antisthe/) seems to confirm this:

 Known in antiquity as an accomplished orator, a companion of Socrates, and a philosopher, Antisthenes presently gains renown from his status as either a founder or a forerunner of Cynicism. He was the teacher to Diogenes of Sinope, and he is regarded by Diogenes Laertius as the first Cynic philosopher. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Stoic (with capitalized 'S') acts as a rational and social animal in a socially responsible manner to the benefit of society, or at least aims to act that way. That is, a Stoic is not (or at least should not be) egoistical. *What is good for the hive, is also good for the bee* (loosely based on Marcus Aurelius).

However, this may not be true for a stoic (lower case), which Stoicism is being confused with quite often and maybe also not typical for at least some blogs and videos of certain wannabe entrepreneurs for other wannabe entrepreneurs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seneca cites some verses being attributed to Cleanthes in his [107^th letter to Lucilius](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_107):

    Lead me, O Master of the lofty heavens,
    My Father, whithersoever thou shalt wish.
    I shall not falter, but obey with speed.
    And though I would not, I shall go, and suffer,
    In sin and sorrow what I might have done
    In noble virtue. Aye, the willing soul
    Fate leads, but the unwilling drags along.

One also reads *"Fate leads the willing and drags along the reluctant."* being attributed to Seneca quite often, which appears to be a very free version of the quote from the 107^th letter to Lucilius. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cannot offer a comprehensive explanation, but as someone who has been interested in Epicureism (and still is), but basically found his way to Stoicism I may not ignore your question.

It was not obvious for me that I may eventually switch to Stoicism some years ago. Today I am sorry that I have found to Stoicism so late. I still value Epicureanism very highly and won't stop reading papers on it, although I disagree with it in very important questions.

I don't agree, for example, that pleasure is the highest good and virtue is just a means to increase pleasure. I think that virtue is the only good. It is necessary and sufficient for *eudaimonia*. I prefer pleasure to distress, of course, but at the end pleasure is an indifferent. The more I learn about Stoicism and the more consequently I follow it, the more freedom from externals I gain. I feel much more content than before. Stoicism works.

What is virtue? After so many years of Christianity being dominant we necessarily understand virtue differently to the ancient Greek. The Greek word is *arete* and means *excellence*. That means, as far as human beings are concerned, I am basically talking about *excellence of character*.

This leads to the question what Stoicism is about. [A while ago I wrote](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/5jxl1v/how_would_you_describe_stoicism_to_someone_new_to/dbjstxx/):

 As a Stoic your goal is excellence of character, living up to your full potential as rational and social animal. Be a good person and make your decisions based on wisdom, justice, courage and moderation as a socially responsible member of society. This is basically what we Stoics mean by being virtuous.

 Don't fight your emotions, but don't let them corrupt your judgement either. Let your decisions and judgements be consistent with your goal, virtue is the only good after all.

 Accept whatever happens to you, unless it is your character flaw. Being a good person is what counts. Although prosperity is preferred to hardships, both are opportunities for personal heroism, albeit no one may know it.

In my opinion, it is not self-evident that the cosmos can be explained rationally and that working mathematical models of the cosmos can be developed. It's like there is an inherent rationality of the cosmos, which is something the ancients called *logos*. That's a reason for why I accept reason as the main characteristic of human beings, which gets one on the eudaimonic track.

I agree to the Stoic teachings on the fundamental interconnectedness of all things. And that all human beings are of equal value and meant to be born free. Cosmopolitanism, which was an important part of Stoicism from the beginning, is based on that ideas, too. The influence Stoicism has been having in regards to that cannot be underestimated. It is really fascinating who in the history of philosophy, literature and culture has been lead by their study of Stoicism. Petrarca, Lipsius, Grotius, Montaigne, Spinoza, Kant, Goethe, the authors of the first declaration of human rights in the age of enlightenment - just to name a few.

Since you mention self-help books and blogs, many of them are more about stoicism than about the ancient philosophy Stoicism, although they are refering to some ancient Stoics. I am not interested in those blogs and videos of wannabe entrepreneurs for wannabe entrepreneurs. Moreover, I doubt that just taking some Stoic principles is sufficient to call oneself a Stoic. The ancient Stoics saw Stoicism as a unity and as such it is to be understood, as far as I am concerned.

There are more reasons than that, I am talking just about myself here, but it may be sufficient to give you some idea.

	<TEXT> I agree. The Stoics divided Stoicism into physics, logic and ethics, but certainly saw their philosophy as a unity and I think that Stoic ethics does not make much sense otherwise.

* Why accept reason as the main characteristic of human beings, which gets us on the eudaimonic track, if the  universe isn't organized according to rational principles?

* How can one reject providence and willingly and joyfully accept fate and wherever it leads to?

* The fundamental interconnectedness of all things has important consequences on Stoic ethics. Marcus Aurelius, for example, writes a lot about that in his *Meditations* and concluded what to do from that. Cosmopolitanism, which was an important part of Stoicism from the beginning, is based on that, too.

I think, by ignoring physics and logic, one basically looses the justification of ethics and the ability to know right and wrong. Picking and choosing from Stoic ethics may eventually be helpful indeed, but it certainly can cause serious problems, too, because Stoic ethics can be misunderstood so easily then. </TEXT>

There is no reason why housing costs, for example, need to be that high, such that mostly rich people can afford studying at university. Hannah's admirable solution to the problem should not lead to the impression that there is no problem at all and the recognition that a problem exists should not make Hannah's solution less admirable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Assuming that your intention is sincere, the answer to your question can be found in the major misrepresentation of Epicureanism by its enemies who try to make Epicureanism look like basically uncontrolled hedonism.

However, given the common understanding of hedonism, Epicureism is quite far away from it. In Epicureanism it's not about maximizing one's pleasures, but about happiness resulting from absence of physical pain and mental disturbance.

Eating good meals certainly is a good thing to do, but that's not what Epicureanism is about. </TEXT>

    Gutta, devote yourself to the goal
    for which you went forth,
    having discarded [hope]
    for a dear son of your own.
        Don't fall under the sway
        of the mind.

    Hoodwinked by mind,
    beings in love with Mara's realm,
        roam
    through the many-birth wandering-on,
         unknowing.

    Abandoning these lower fetters, nun 
        sensual desire, ill will,
        self-identity views,
        grasping at precepts   practices,
        and uncertainty as the fifth 
            you won't come
            to this again.

    Forsaking   passion, conceit,
        ignorance,   restlessness
        cutting through [all] the fetters 
        you will make an end
        of suffering   stress.

    Discarding birth   wandering-on,
    comprehending further becoming,
        free from hunger
    in the right-here- -now
    you will go about
        totally calmed. </TEXT>

Seneca is the least popular Stoic philosopher to some modern Stoics, but maybe the Roman Stoic with the biggest influence on later generations.

Removing oneself from society does not make sense. A Stoic socializes with women, drinks cocktails, enjoys nice meals and the like, but in a socially responsible manner. And a Stoic may not be as attached to these things as some other people.

Stoicism certainly does not imply that one has to bear everything and always shut up. It is completely fine to make one's opinions abundantly clear, if necessary, it just has to be done virtuously. Giving assent to anger arising after an insult isn't very virtuous.

That being said, I am quite sure that my first reaction to an insult like that would be anger and similar in its wording, if put in words. However, I think, if I gave assent to that, my judgement would be misguided. Putting the same content in less aggressive words may certainly work much better, for them and for me. </TEXT>

Sure, it is a question, but a very helpful one.

Epictetus himself writes in chapter 52 of [The Enchiridion](http://classics.mit.edu/Epictetus/epicench.html):

    Upon all occasions we ought to have these maxims ready at hand:

    "Conduct me, Jove, and you, O Destiny,
    Wherever your decrees have fixed my station."
    Cleanthes

    "I follow cheerfully; and, did I not,
    Wicked and wretched, I must follow still
    Whoever yields properly to Fate, is deemed
    Wise among men, and knows the laws of heaven."
    Euripides, Frag. 965

    And this third:

    "O Crito, if it thus pleases the gods, thus let it be.
    Anytus and Melitus may kill me indeed, but hurt me they cannot."

Getting drunk, however, has high potential to affect virtue in a negative way, which makes it a problem indeed.

A lot of people underestimate the dangers of regular alcohol consumation, because drinking alcohol is a very accepted and often expected behavior in society. Loosing one's control is easy and the consequences can be disastrous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  pleasure is a vice so it cannot be subordinated

Pleasure is an indifferent. According to [Donald Robertson's article](http://donaldrobertson.name/what-seneca-really-said-about-epicureanism/), the Stoics subordinated pleasure to reason. The Epicureans reversed that by making reason subordinate to pleasure.

 All equally indifferent, simple classification preferred and dispreferred.

Because of the classification it cannot be the case that everything is equally indifferent.

 Virtue can only be achieved through adversity.

Why?

 So anyone can tell me, if they found Any similarities between Epicureanism and Stoicism?

For example, both Epicureans and Stoics were materialists. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is an interesting lecture on Epictetus, Boethius and Admiral James Stockdale by Professor Tamar Szab Gendler from Yale: [Flourishing and Detachment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EN8gs7D4tY)

 Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature ([PHIL 181](http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-181))

 Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who argued that once we recognize that some things are up to us and other things are not up to us, we can see that happiness requires detaching ourselves from our desires and focusing instead on our attitudes and interpretations. Three pieces of advice from Epictetus about how to cultivate such detachment are provided, along with contemporary examples. A similar theme from Boethius is discussed, followed by a practical example of the benefits of detachment from Admiral James Stockdale's experiences as a prisoner of war.

	<TEXT> In ancient times a philosopher was expected to live as a philosopher to be acknowledged as philosopher. Living philosophically is the hard part, theory is the easy part and makes practice easier. Epictetus taught theory as well, because it is necessary to know theory to live according to one's philosophy. I think it's no surprise that Marcus Aurelius contemplates over theory in his *Meditations* a lot.

There are many authors indeed, but no one is expected to read all of them. Reading is not futile though. It's better to concentrate on fewer, but good authors and to study them well than reading many authors only superficially. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are certainly right that there are features Leica M shares with other camera, but the rangefinder is its unique feature. This is not the same as the viewfinders of Fujifilm (which are certainly excellent viewfinders, but no rangefinders). Not everybody needs a rangefinder and it's certainly not the best option for all applications, but it is the best option for what Leica M is particularly good at.

And yes, Leica is expensive. But the lenses hold their value or get even more expensive, such that you may be able to sell them for more than you've paid for. This is certainly not always the case, but it happens. There is some luxury, too, like all those special editions, but apart from that you mostly get what you pay for. The manufactoring process is more expensive in Germany than in China and each lens is tested and much less lenses can be produced. Lenses of other brands of the same quality cost about the same (Zeiss Otus, for example), by the way.

More quality costs money and the price growth is not linear. The best Nikon, Canon, Olympus, Fuji... lenses are excellent tools, too, but further improvement can be very expensive. You need more expensive materials, improved precision, a better quality control and the like. The last 10% of quality may account for 90% of the price you have to pay.

Do you really need a Leica to take excellent photographs? Certainly not. But shooting with a Leica can be tremendously joyful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Both *Enchiridion* and *Meditations* are collections of brief advice.

Your answer is really good, I just want to add that it helped me to know that *Meditations* are Marcus Aurelius' private notebook and all its advices are directed to himself. It's the result of his personal spiritual practice as it is described by Epictetus, whose teachings had a huge impact on Marcus Aurelius.

When reading the *Enchiridion* it may also help to keep in mind that it was meant to have the basics at hand. Several tough passages which may be irritating to some at first are much easier to understand after reading Epictetus' discourses.

While starting with these two books is excellent advice, I'd like to add that it makes much sense to read a good introduction in addition to the sources. Our FAQ certainly is a very good starting point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this article is wrong from the beginning what Stoicism is concerned and that in a remarkable way. It starts with a straw man and it goes on like that. For example, the Stoic metapher about the dog following the cart which the dog is being tied to is actually being described the other way round in the article as it is originally intended according to Stoicism.

Although I have not read Ryan Holiday's article she is quoting, I assume she gets him wrong, too. But even if she understands him correctly, how can an opinion of a single person, any person, expressed in a short internet article refute a philosophy which was one of the major philosophies for about 500 years 2000 years ago? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that indecisiveness comes from worrying too much about what is outside our control. For example, other people's opinions, the outcomes of our actions and the like are outside our control. Within our control are our opinions, judgements and the like. This is what we should direct our attention to.

As rational and social animals we should try to be the best person we can be and act to our best knowledge as socially responsible humans without caring too much about what we cannot control anyway. Failure should not bother us much, unless it relates to weaknesses of our character.

It certainly takes time to internalize that, but at least I have become much more decisive because of insights like that. </TEXT>
