	<TEXT> My cousin is severally autistic, and on a side note my aunt loves him to death. He's just about the nicest guy you'll meet.

I remember when I was younger I was hanging out with his brother, my other cousin, playing PS2 and Raymond (my autistic cousin) got in an argument with my uncle. He stormed out, when he returned about half an hour later he brought back Jack In The Box and insisted on giving me one of the burgers he bought and sat down to play PS2 with us.

I'll always remember that day because my uncle was always such an asshole to him but even after a fight with his dad where he went out to get some food to feel better he insisted on sharing some of his feel good food with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to take some time to carefully plan out my next story, thanks for the tips. I actually LOVE the Search and Rescue series, which isn't too relevant but I thought I'd throw that out there since it was mentioned.

Like I said I've done quite a bit of fan fiction, but never any horror and especially no original nosleep stories. I'll do some experimenting with writing styles, thanks especially for the feedback with that. I do enjoy the first person self narration style so I may mainly try to improve on it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Smiling Woman </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-09 09:17:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I grew up in a small desert town, it was hot, dry, and not a whole lot to do for a kid. Explore a whole bunch of nothing out in the heat, or stay in doors with the air conditioning and play video games, were about the two main choices. Many of the teens, once entering high school, I'm sure  did a lot of damage to their livers considering it had become tradition to substitute the boredom of not having much around with excessive partying.

My grandpa was a kind old man who made the best of our dreary little town. Hed often skip the local bar to head up to the Native reservation and drink at their bar. Ive heard stories in my adult life of Natives, when on their reservations, not being too kind to outsiders. Here it was different. I presume it may have had a lot to do with the fact we knew to respect them, if people from our town went up to one of the watering holes on the reservation we knew to be nice and if got a bit crowded we needed to be the first to leave. If any of the adults, like my grandpa, decided to go have a few beers up on the reservation they knew to not be rude, dont start any fights, and just enjoy the company.

But anyway, he always brought back odd tales and folklore to tell me on nights Id spend a night over at his house . See from a young age I had a fascination with the creepy and bizarre, dont get me wrong it ended up giving me more nightmares than I can count but it was worth it at the end of the day. One night when I was about 10 years old I was staying the night with him, we did the usual tradition. He drove me about 20 miles to another rag of a town that was lucky enough to have a McDonald's, got me my usual and himself something to eat, we enjoyed our meal, then headed back to his place.

By the time we got back it was night, which meant it was time for him to tell me some piece of creepy Native folklore, or some odd first hand account he was told by a Native during his weekly visit to the bar. To the best of my memory the story went like this:

When the White man first started settling around these parts the Natives protested, much to no avail, and they soon had almost no land to call their own. After going through every avenue they had to try and stop all of this, a local shaman laid a curse on them. That one day a child of the White man would bleed onto the sacrificial stone sealing their fate. An ancient spirit would be summoned to chase the White man off their land. It would be a shapeshifter that would steal away all their children, any new child brought onto the land or born on it would be stolen until only the Natives remained.


I know, I know. Not very scary to an adult, or hell even a teen. But at 10 years old it gave me goosebumps anyway. I proceeded to ask him an onslaught of questions, all of which he didnt really have an answer for. I mean he only knew what he was told after all.

Fast forward a couple months and it was summer time! No more school for almost three months, just video games and the odd trip to a watering hole to get some swimming in. The day it all started just happened to be one of those days. My mom and my friends mom (who happened to be friends with my mom, again small town) decided to take us up for a trip to swim. Happy as could be I got ready, swimming trunks on, goggles ready, sun screen forced onto me, and we were ready to go.

After several hours of swimming I decided I wanted to go exploring considering the fact the watering hole allowed for fairly dense brush and trees to grow for someways, maybe several football fields or so, and that was rare for where we lived. I ran off without a second thought besides yelling to my mom, Ill be back! to which my mom responded Only 30 minutes! And be careful! Giving no response to that as I looked behind me to see our parents talking and my friend enjoying the water, I disappeared into the brush.

I was having a grand 'ole time pretending I was The Crocodile Hunter off to catch me a croc our two. Yes this was before he died, I always loved Steve Erwin. I ended up slipping on a muddy patch of dirt and cutting my hand on a rock. I inspected it closely, there was a bit of blood but not too bad. Giving myself the thumbs up that I wasn't too hurt I continued on my journey. I came into a clearing where there was a fairly big rock and a little less vegetation than everywhere else, it didnt seem too odd to me as I figured the fauna were simply starting to thin out as I got further away. I climbed up onto the rock, one hand after another, until I stood on top.

Im king of the world, I yelled pretending to hold a sword up, much like He-Man, and staring into the sky. I sat down on the rock while holding the sides, letting me catch my breathe again. After all that exploring I was starting to get quite winded. Finally I stood up, deciding to head back so I could get I just a bit more swimming before we had to go home.

We stopped at the Natives bar (and grill) on the way home where our parents picked us up delicious (if you ever had a burger from a decent bar and grill youll know no other fast food quite matches it), but very greasy, burgers and fries for dinner tonight. Once home it was business as usual, little bit of TV, then bed, I didnt know at the time my life would never be the same after I woke up the next morning.

I normally would have slept in until about 10 AM on a summers day, but my mom woke me up at a way too early 8 O'clock.

Son, did Billy come by last night? I yawned and rubbed my eyes, wondering why my mom would be asking that.

No, why would he have? I thought they went home too after swimming, I replied starting to get worried as my brain slowly booted up.

Well, they did sweetie. But Billys parents woke up to find he wasn't in bed, they wanted to check to make sure he didnt sneak out to come over here. They only have to assume he ran away now.

What? Billy would never do that, there was no way Billy would run away, he had no reason to and he just wasnt the type, he would never want his parents and friends to be worried over him. The next several hours consisted of the Sheriff coming by to ask me questions that I had no answer to, my mom sitting by the phone worried sick and hoping for a call letting us know my friend was okay. Nothing ever came.

The sheriff claimed there was no evidence of forced entry, no finger prints that shouldnt of been there, no sign of a struggle or violence. The odd thing was Billys windows were closed and locked from the inside, all the doors remained locked and not one key missing. There was almost no way for Billy to run off but leave everything in the state it was. A key needed to be gone, or a window unlocked, but nothing.

A couple weeks went by and I was still heartbroken over my missing friend, but to make matters worse another kid had disappeared. A girl this time, a couple years older than me though so I didnt really know her. She on the other had had disappeared during broad daylight while walking home from a nearby friends house. Needless to say the town went on high alert, kidnappings just didnt happen where I lived. The sheriff promised to get to the bottom of things though and neighborhood watch went on steroids. The adults of the community set it up to where once an hour, after 8 PM, someone would drive the streets of the town at night to make sure everything was okay. They had agreed upon who would take what nights for the first two weeks, and if this wasnt solved by then theyd decide what to do after that. Everyone agreed to keep an extra eye out and pay extra attention at all times too.
The sheriff, who was actually rarely in town, could be seen driving the streets often now sometimes even later into the night. A curfew had been set, for anyone under 18, of 7 PM. 

My parents tried to keep me from hearing too much, to not scare me, but I heard bits and pieces of the gossip surrounding her disappearance. The most noteworthy thing was about a week before she went missing she had started talking about how  The Smiling Woman kept trying to get her to play. Of course her parents, at the time, chalked it up to an active imagination and, in hindsight,  I think they werent too worried about a woman. Now if it had been The Smiling Man they probably would have been a bit more alert.

It was a few days after the girls disappearance when I was lying down for sleep, my parents double and triple checking every window and lock in the house, when I heard a tapping at the window. Like I mentioned before even back at this age I had a fascination with the weird and bizarre which gave me a bit more bravery, or maybe stupidity, than I really deserved. So instead of running to get my parents, I went to the window.

Outside was the oddest thing I think I may have ever seen, a woman wearing some type of skin tight purple suit, oddly red hair that wasn't any shade Ive ever seen naturally on a person, and a huge smile that was too big for her face. Thinking about it as an adult I figure it was this thing trying to fit into a world it didnt quite understand. Choosing odd accessories and a smile that caused more fear than it did soothe.

Come play with me, she said in an unnerving childlike voice. I was a bit shell shocked at the moment so instead of running or screaming I just kept staring at her.

Come play with me, I promise youll have tons of fun. I have toys and candy. Your friends are here too!

Something about it mentioning my friends knocked me out of the state I was in and I let out a blood curdling scream and ran for my parents room. They were already half way to my room when I ran into them. The Smiling Woman, shes here!

My dad grabbed his gun before running outside ready to empty his clip into whoever he ran into. But as you would expect, no one was there. The sheriff was called, I told him my story and they checked around the house. No evidence of anyone being there was found, no foot prints, no finger prints on my window seal, nothing. Thankfully in light of recent events the sheriff and my parents took me much more seriously than they normally would have. Once the sheriff was gone my parents let me sleep with them.

The next day I was outside playing in our backyard, my parents wouldnt let me more than 20 feet from the house, when I saw her, it, again. She was across the empty lot behind our house, probably 40 feet away or so, but I could recognize her even from that far. I knew I should run back to the safety of the house but it was like something supernatural forced me to stay in place. She slowly got closer, her walking was weird, way too fluid is the best way to describe it. Like movements so precise and so perfect no human could do it. As she got closer I noticed her hair seemed a more natural red color, but everything else was still the same. Once she reached me I was still unable to move, I knew in this moment I would die.

Come play with us, she said while holding her hand out to me, your friends are here! And I promise to bring more, youll be able to have fun forever. It was odd, despite being scared shitless I had the urge to agree and take her hand, and this time there was something oddly soothing about her despite her disjointed appearance and smile that was still too big for her face.

When I noticed my hand had involuntarily made it half way to her is when I finally managed to snap out of the trance and ran screaming back to my house. Only my mom was home as my dad was at work, but it was a rinse and repeat of last time. Sheriff came out, my testimony documented, search of the place to turn up no proof anyone else was there, and then nothing. Thankfully I heard my parents that night talking about moving, they considered several options including my mom and I staying at my aunts in Oregon while my dad got the house ready for sale and continued to work while looking for a job in Oregon. Of us all staying here while they found us a house somewhere else, and a few other similar ideas. Ultimately they decided to look, with my aunts help, for housing and jobs in Oregon while we all stayed here waiting, and if another incident happened my mom and I would head for Oregon early. 

A couple days actually went by incident free and I was starting to hope I had seen the last of The Smiling Woman when talks about a kid going missing in the town I mentioned with the McDonalds in it. I almost expected this to put my parents over the edge and for us to leave but I think the fact it didnt happen quite so close to home this time prevented that. The day after that news spread through the town both my parents had to be at work, my mom had been staying home a lot lately but they warned her if she didnt go in today shed be fired, and my dad couldnt get the day off in such short notice. They made sure to have an hour long talk with me about stranger danger, staying inside, keeping the doors locked, etc.

I had been playing my PlayStation for several hours when I heard a knock at the door, immediately I went on high alert. I walked to the door and looked through our peephole to see nothing, so I tried to ignore it and went back to my video games. Another knock at the door, checked the peephole and no one. Before I could sit back down again ANOTHER knock, so this time I turned around and threw open the door ready to punch and kick whoever was there. No one. My nerves on edge I turned off my game and put on TV hoping to get lost into some cartoons when I heard it.

Come play with me, I looked towards the hallway to see her standing maybe 5 feet from me. She had changed again, her smile now fit her face correctly and looked more sweet than sinister, her tight purple body suit was now a purple dress. I felt fear rise up in me, but not nearly was much as before. Now stronger than the fear was a feeling to trust her, she only wanted to play after all.

I got up and started walking towards her, not really realizing what I was doing. Youll have so much fun, Billy has been talking about how he misses you, the mentioning of Billy set off a few panic alarms but the feeling of trust and kindness just radiating off of her stopped it from bringing me to my senses. 

Ill bring more of your friends too, youll never be lonely and everyone will always be happy, I was standing in front of her now but thankfully the bit of fear in me kept me from taking her hand. What about my parents? I asked not wanting to leave them behind.

They cant come, but dont worry I promise Ill love you more than they ever could, something about this finally snapped me out of it and I screamed. This seemed to upset her and, no longer in a soothing voice but a raspy deep one, she said Stop! Just take my hand and come play, theres room in my stomach for all you children! I ran past her, it, through the door and just ran and ran until I reached my grandpas house.

After calming me down and getting water in me so I didnt keel over from heat stroke I told him what happened. He called my parents who both left work, no longer caring about their jobs. It took them a long time to get here since both had about a 40 minute drive to work, the sheriff arrived before they did. He also got my statement and checked our house. Of course there wasnt anything really to be found except an open door and monsterless house.

What my parents never told anyone was they had setup video cameras around the house just in case. They wouldnt let me view them but whatever was on them convinced them to say fuck the house and we all noped out to Oregon.

I never saw the smiling woman again after that, weve never been back to the town I grew up in either. My grandpa moved to Oregon to be closer to us and I tried my best to not think about those events. Though the story doesnt quite end here, a few years after that after I was in high school and had become a normal functioning teenager I found a VHS tape that was just marked with tape over it. What was written on the tape made my stomach drop, The Smiling Woman. I knew I had found whatever had been recorded that day, and curiosity got the best of me, despite always doing my best not to think about her, I popped the tape into our still functioning VCR.

It showed me standing in front of nothing, but what was important wasnt what it showed but the audio.  It was the conversation I had with her that day, but the entire time her voice was this low raspy beastial sound. Like halfway between a beast and a person, she never had a soothing voice at all. I'm not sure why she didn't show up on video. Last I heard about where I grew up was that a huge chunk of land was returned to the Native reservation, but until then a steady string of child disappearances continued. Oddly enough they stopped after land was returned, this made people suspicious that someone from the reservation took on a vendetta against "the White Man" but no suspects were ever brought forward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of the older folk had a lot of weird stories, mainly about lights in the sky, this is no joke, thanks to those lights we had quite a bit of people convinced of aliens and UFOs around.

Occasionally I heard someone, here and there, tell tales about things they saw on the ground though nothing matching what I saw.

Lots of weird shit happens in the desert though, or maybe the heat just got to us all eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry it took so long to reply, sleep and then work.

I live in WA state now, I don't really go back home often and I'd rather not ask either of my parents to ask around as that'd require some sort of explanation to them.

Old Native American tales would trickle down to us though, I don't really remember them very well nowadays to be honest. Next time I do go back home I may try and do some asking around though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Desert camping </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 06:36:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I grew up in a small little Arizona desert town, were talking no rain some years, dirt as far as the eye could see, as hot as 120 degree summer highs, 90+ degree summer nights. So yeah, not a place a whole lot of people would want to live. Which always made me wonder why my parents moved us there when I was an infant of only 2. Sure crime was next to non existent, though I personally felt the rattle snakes made up for that. 

Anyway, I didnt come here to bore you with the woes of growing up in the desert. No, I came here to share what happened to me when I was about fifteen years old or so. My friends and I loved to explore the desert, there were lots of canal ditches for water run off (when it did happen to rain it could end up raining hard, causing flash flooding and all that), abandoned buildings/houses (often in the absolute middle of fucking no where), annnnnd a whole lotta nothing. Though it was cool when you found the occasional coyote skeleton, or donkey skull, or stuff of the likes.

Some of the abandoned buildings could really have a creepy vibe too, though I chalk that up to a fifteen year olds mind and the fact anything abandoned can be creepy. If youve ever lived in a rural area youll know how much of the sky you can see, I live in a bigger city in Washington state now and you can still see a lot of stars but my god it doesnt even come close to the desert. But youd also see a lot of strange lights in the sky, I still to this day am almost positive my friends, myself, and some older people of the town, saw experimental aircraft being used by the government. I mean testing in the middle of absolutely fucking no where would make a lot of sense. I mean UFO alienish (though I am in no way claiming aliens) type shit Lights that would hover like a helicopter could, but then shoot off moving much faster than any airliner jet could. Though I have to digress, Ive gotten quite a bit off track of my story before even really starting it.

So one hot and dry summer night my friends and I decided wed go camping. No tent really needed, when we went camping wed pretty much go to a random site in the desert, bringing wood and etc for a fire (only you can prevent brush fires, when you make a camp fire in the desert you have to make sure that shit is out because what bushes and few trees are out there are dry as hell), with sleeping bags and supplies for food and water.

I was pretty excited for it but my friends ended up canceling, oh well not a whole lot I can do there. I still decided fuck it and ended up going on my own. So leaving my house just after the sun went down with my backpack full of everything Id need for the night. My parents still thought my friends were coming along, I didnt want to tell them the truth in case theyd refuse to let me go without anyone else. I mean they trusted me, they knew I know how to respond if I ran into a rattlesnake, not that there is too much worry of that after dark, not to play with scorpions and all that fun stuff.

I hiked maybe about 2 miles into the middle of no where before I decided where I was at was as good as any other spot. Now this was 2005, cell phones existed and even more towards town you could get coverage. But kids didnt really have phones in these days and where I was wouldnt get coverage anyway. Back then (like it was so long ago, haha) you had to rely on your own sense of direction and landmarks to not get lost, not that no one does that nowadays but yeah with GPS+Google Maps+ coverage just about everywhere now theres not a whole lotta reason too. I had headed north towards the mountains far off in the distance and knew how to get back by heading in the opposite direct. If I accidentally headed too south west or east I would still eventually run into train tracks, all I had to do then was turn north to orientate myself and head and then head east or west. From there it could get a bit more complicated, if lost, of which way to head but I knew plenty of landmarks both in the east and west so I should be able to orientate myself pretty well fairly quickly.  

Anyway, another huge digression and I apologize. So I set up my little camp, roasted some hot dogs and drank some water. I eventually ended up lying on the ground and starring up at the Milky Way, I used to love to be able to stare at the stars and get lost in them. I was also listening to music on my MP3 player (were talking 2005 here, Ipods and MP3 players were thankfully a thing even if modern cell phones hadnt obsoleted them yet). After enough time and several play lists, I found myself getting tired so I turned off my MP3 player and got myself ready for some sleep under the stars.

I woke up with a start, absolutely no clue why, I brought my wrist with my watch on it up to my face before hitting the button that caused a faint green glow to read the time, 1 AM. I pulled out my water to get a drink wondering what had caused me to wake up. Then I heard it, it was faint but definitely the sounds of foot steps off in the distance. I was alert now, I was 2 or so miles away from town in the middle of no where, my fire had been put out before bed but I wasnt worried by much. Coyotes did their best to avoid humans like a plague, there were no scorpions that were a real danger to humans were I lived, and donkeys werent going to mess with some guy sleeping. But the fact that something had bothered to get this close to me had me on edge. For me to be able to actually hear the footsteps it wasnt a rabbit or mouse. 

So I got up and pulled my flash light out of my pack, turning it on I shined the beam off into the distance. Some shrubbery, but that was about all I could see. I stood up turning around trying to check every direction as good as I could to see if someone was fucking with me. Nothing. I knew I had heard it though, through my head ran some stories that trickled down to our community through the nearby Native American reservations and tribes. I shook my head, I shouldnt be thinking of any of that right now, I didnt need to be any more wound up than I was already.

So I lied down on top of my sleep bag again and closed my eyes, if I could just fall asleep and wake up after dawn everything would be okay. But I heard it again, closer this time, off to my right. I grabbed my flashlight which I had laid down right next to me and jumped off turning it on all in one swift and fluid motion and shined the light in the direction I had heard it from. What I saw made my heart race, the silhouette of something human shaped, and eyes glowing green with the reflection of my light. I tried to scream, I mean I felt it build up in my throat and by all means I should have, but nothing came out.

And then it was gone, it got down on all fours like some type of canine, well more like a human trying (and doing a good job) imitating a canine, and ran off. My flashlight was pretty decent, I mean I could clearly see a good 30 feet in front of me before the beam got so weak that things became fuzzy with weakening light, but it was out of my beam of light so fast Im not even truly sure I had seen it at all. I was shaken up pretty badly now, I didnt even lie back down. I just sat. I opened up my second backpack that I had brought solely for firewood and ended up using the rest to build another fire. I mean someone HAD to be fucking with me right? Or maybe it was some demented serial killer? I shook my head. Not much crime happened where I lived, and when it did happen it was assault from drunkards fighting at the one bar in town that got enough people over 40 in it every night drinking the night away to stay in business. Even more rarely was a break in with a few things stolen while someone isnt home. But murders? They were unheard of.

So what was happening? Did my friends find out I was going camping anyway and decide to follow me and fuck with me? I wasnt sure but one thing I knew, I didnt want to attempt to walk home until it was daylight out. More time passed, I took a look at my watch again, 2:30. There hadnt been any more incidents yet and it should be light enough for me to feel safe walking home by 5:30 or 6, so 3 more hours of nothing happening and I was good. Of course, I wouldnt be so lucky.

Around 3 or so I heard the foot steps again. They were more constant this time, starting off in the distance and slowly getting closer. Fuck, fuck fuck fuck. That was all I could think as I held my breathe, they stopped, maybe 10 feet, 15 if I was lucky, from where I sat. I looked in the direction I had heard them, and just outside of where my fires light ended was a pair of glowing green eyes standing at about 5 foot 9 or so, about my height. They didnt move, just starring directly at me. Then it slowly inched closer letting the light just barely illuminate its form.

The closest way I could think to describe it is like a werewolf, Hollywood monster movie type. But that is just the closest, it had many differences. A lot less fur for sure, you could actually see scarred human skin underneath the fur, its head, while also hairy, was much more human that wolf. Its mouth was pulled back revealing very long and pointed teeth, those resembled a werewolfs more than a humans. It didnt howl or anything of the sort, and I was pretty sure this thing had no wolf of dog in it. It was something else. It did let out a low very inhuman growl before stepping back into the darkness and disappearing. 

What the hell? All I could think was it wanted me to see it, wanted me to know how fucked I was. Remember when I mentioned all the weird things you would see in the sky out here? Youd also hear weird shit at night, I think everyone chalked it up to coyotes and such things but I think I now knew what it was. I mean I had walked to friends houses, camped, etc before at night and never actually saw anything until now so it being much more mundane things like a coyote making very unique noises just made sense.

I sat there terrified now, like almost pissing myself scared. 4 AM rolled around though with no more incidents and I was starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Then I started hearing the foot steps again, it wouldnt come into the light this time but I could tell it was circling my little camp. Like a predator planning its attack on its prey. I had nothing to use as a weapon, no gun, no knife (if such things could even hurt it), so I knew if it attacked I was fucked. I mean, Id fight back the best I could but lets face it I would have been dead in seconds.

Then on all fours it ran through my camp, right pass me so close if I stuck my elbow out I would have touched it, and into the darkness on the other side. It was fucking with me now. I had heard of predators playing with its food, much like cats with mice. I wondered if itd wait until right before dawn to make its move. I wondered if it even really NEEDED to eat or just killed because it was something dark and evil.

4:30 now, it had been circling my camp non stop for the last half hour, sometimes stepping into the light to let me get a look at it before disappearing back into the darkness. 5 AM and I could actually see the sun starting to come up, another 30 minutes or so and there should be enough light to illuminate everything in a faint, but seeable way, if you ever stayed up to watch the sunrise youll know what I mean. I wasnt sure why I was still alive, it was still circling my camp, but just maybe I would actually survive this ordeal.

As that thought ran through my mind it stepped into the light again, straight across from me. It approached my fire, stare never wavering from me. It lifted its foot and used it to put my fire out. I smelt no burning flesh, no stench of burnt hair. Even with no flashlight on or fire I could see the green reflective eyes still, it hadnt moved an inch. I picked my flash light back up and turned it on shining it on whatever the hell this thing was.

It looked like it was thinking, always looking right at me. I stood up which made it tilt its head, but I didnt move to run. I didnt move at all, not an inch. I just starred it down, if I was going to die then I was going to die with a bit of dignity. Then, it backed away walking backwards much more fluidly than a person ever could. And it disappeared again. Between now and dawn I heard no more noises, no foot steps, nothing. When it was light enough I checked around my camp and saw so many foot prints, foot prints that were three quarters human and one quarter something else.

I made it home and never mentioned what happened, not to a soul before now. I figured no one would believe me anyway. Just some kid making up stories or too active of an imagination and got a bit spooked while camping. I never saw the thing again, I also never went camping again, not once to this very day.

I still wonder what the thing was, some government experiment that escaped a facility somewhere hidden in the desert? A real life werewolf? Or something dark and evil left over from some earlier time, when humans wrote of dragons, unicorns and krakens, or something even older than that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My experience, both suck. They both go down a lot too. I don't keep track of which is out more, though I'm sure there are 100000x websites that do. They both go down enough for me to just say they both suck in that area too. Speeds on both are pretty bad, somedays my PS4 downloads faster/more stable, somedays it's my XBone. It's very rare, no matter which one has ran better lately, for either to actually run well though.

Basically this (which one is worse/better) seems to have been a pissing contest for fanboys since the conception of online console play when in reality they just both really suck.

Like comparing rotten milk to rotten eggs. They both are really bad so to try to argue which is better of the two just always confused me

I can say in the free days of PS3, PSN was down noticably more than XBL, for me at least, downloading was still equally bad on both of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never considered myself on the fence, though over the last few months maybe I could be considered it now. I had a clear idea of what I wanted us, as a country, to do here at home in the US and on the world stage. Quite a few of those things have been shaken up though. So in  this period where I'm reevaluating what I think is good for us, again as a country, to do I guess it would be a good phrase for me. </TEXT>
