	<TEXT> What is up Reddit. For my literature class we had to read a classic book and do what my teacher called an "Outside Reading Datasheet" on said book. I am currently making one on Moby Dick and have an edition which is 492 pages. (ISBN 978--1-85326-008-7). I didn't read a page of it but was surprised when talking to my friends as they thought it had 800ish pages. Sure enough,when I looked up the page count on google, page counts were all close to the 800 mark. Why is this? The text doesn't appear super small nor do I think that this edition omitted large amounts of material. I thought you guys could help. :) </TEXT>
