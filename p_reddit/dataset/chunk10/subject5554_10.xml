	<TEXT> It's a tricky subject of course, but I think there's a way to do it tastefully. Perhaps you see the cameraman and crew enter the house, calling out for Joanie and see just an arm or a leg of hers on the couch or something and fade to a black titlecard that says "Joanie was found in her home unresponsive."

I'm not saying you linger on a shot of her dead body, but the sad discovery of finding someone you loved tragically OD'd is kind of what the movie is about no? It's the worst case scenario for any downward spiral story.

Now that I actually watched the trailer it looks like they may have handled it very similarly to how I described. To scrap the movie entirely would be a disservice.  </TEXT>
