	<TEXT> Wouldn't argue it with me.  I'd think too it's a mark of a good coach who can get his team to do that.  Not sure they melted down in 2015 as much as Romo made that much of a difference to the team.  He'd pretty much done that throughout his career.  Shame he may never be recognized for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know what--I was basing my opinion on everything up to 2016.  No other team at all was interested in him after 2014, when they went 12-4.  Back then I seemed to be a lone voice in the woods saying that Garrett was the Cowboys' last best chance at relevance in my lifetime, because he's the only person Jerry listened to, and Jerry would drive off anyone who was competent.

But I wonder if, now that Garrett's won NFL Coach of the Year, opinions are changing.  

I fear that his reputation may never actually cement as a good one until he overachieves; that may be what it takes to pull him out from Jerry's shadow--heck, to pull the whole team out from Jerry's shadow.

In any event, as we both agree that Jerry won't fire him anytime soon, what other teams think is all academic.

I do think the team's better now that Jerry's not making personnel decisions.  That seems like a no-brainer.  But until we actually see sustained success, well, the jury's still out.  Of course maybe the jury's out on every coach until he does something like Landry, or Belichick, or Noll.  Anyhow, cheers, bud, and points well made.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What will it take to for us to retain him? 

No other team in the NFL would hire him.  This is not to say that he's a bad coach, but that, until he actually demonstrates sustained achievement in the W-L column, he'll continue to be viewed as Jones's puppet.  Only people who've been following this team closely recognize the extent to which he's professionalized football operations.

Also no indication that Jones will fire him.  Jones has said for years--since Garrett was paid the big bucks as an assistant--that he wants Garrett to be his Landry.  Times were different, but it took Landry a while to start winning consistently too.  So short of a complete meltdown, which, frankly, isn't conceivable right now, Garrett will be here for a while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The NFL is probably the most reactive (as opposed to proactive) major sports league there is.  It does not lead in *any* social policy.  Accordingly, it won't change its stance toward marijuana use until the entire country does.  The U.S. is headed in that direction, but until it arrives, the NFL will continue to view marijuana as a harm.  Which is a shame, because among all major sports marijuana use would seem to be most useful to the NFL.

Still, as long as it's banned, every player has a choice.  It's a shame what its use has done to Gregory's career (destroyed it). </TEXT>

Also, though, I absolutely misread what OP had said: I thought he said the car *hit* his house.  So yep you're right as far as that goes: homeowner's insurance won't do anything for that.  Thanks for clarifying that!

	<TEXT> No dispute.  My impression is that everyone's high on Watt due to his genetics.  Maybe they'll both turn out to be Hall of Famers, but I think both the Cowboys and Steelers reached on those two.

Remember, though, people characterized Frederick as a reach.  We have to be careful when we evaluate drafts based on so-called *value*.  In my view, the value of a pick is based almost entirely on unprovables, such as what a different team might have done, and on retrospect.  Generally (again, in my view), the true value of a pick can't be determined until possibly years later.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally I'm hoping for the best, just like you, bud.  But remember: his "production" was based on one year as a starter.  His 2-year numbers are not nearly as impressive--e.g., he had more sacks in 2016 than in his prior 3 years combined.  And he wasn't a starter before 2016.

Probably no one will disagree that Charlton, at least at this moment, appears to have been a reach--a necessary one, but still a reach.  But he's got the best DC in the NFL coaching him, so if he's ever to fulfill his potential it'll be with the Cowboys.

In drafting him, almost certainly the FO was making the best of a bad hand and relying on Marinelli. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think he meant T.J. Watt?

And for what it's worth a couple of things: not sure anyone's arguing with your opinion about the applicability of 40 time to chasing down plays; it's your opinion that he isn't athletic and is just big that's causing disagreement.  

For example, I haven't read any scouting report that describes him as *nonathletic and just big*.  To the contrary, the reports I've read say generally that while he lacks certain elite tools and polish, he *is* athletic and has an upside.  (E.g., your own link describes him as athletic.)

Also, your observation about burst and quickness may be valid, but you have to realize that subbies generally don't like negatives mentioned about Cowboys' players.  So while you may be right, and definitely you should explain it, probably better just to realize you're not going to succeed in an argument and let it go.  Doesn't mean your observations aren't appreciated, as others do like to consider all sides to a situation. 

Generally, though, it's hard to change someone's mind when he says he trusts the FO.  That's a fan simply saying he's a fan.

Bottom line is subbies rarely (not never, just rarely) convince each other of anything, from what I can tell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but I think it's right.  You have to remember that this site has grown into something far more than what it was originally; originally it was a place just to centralize news.  The community came afterward.

And as dumb as what the mod here is doing, the idea that community consensus would result in the removal of a mod isn't that great a solution either.  Anyone on reddit any length of time is familiar with dozens of stories in which witch hunts led to unfortunate outcomes.  

Luckily this kind of thing hasn't happened that much.  But the solution doesn't seem to be available on reddit.  When a community of any significant size encounters a mod who's doing something unreasonable, the only solution the community has is the same as a community of 6: start a new sub.  Which of course isn't a solution at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't say anything about your family's financial status, but my guess is that to your parents $800 is a lot of money, and your parents don't want you to waste it.  They may not appreciate that you might understand how to do something that they don't; they may not appreciate that intellectually you're ready to try this; they may not understand that by trying to protect you they're actually wasting money they don't have to spend.  But they certainly appear to be more than willing to waste *their* money for the sake of helping you.

Being a teenager is difficult, both for the teen, who feels (and sometimes, not always, is right) that he's capable of thinking for himself, but also for the parent, who's not always sure when to expand limits and when to keep a tight hold.  Realize: to them it was only yesterday that you were in diapers learning how to eat with a spoon.  (Heck some teenagers still haven't mastered that trick (ha)).

You have many options, but my suggestion is that you (1) take a deep breath; (2) realize they're not trying to strangle you, but to help you; and (3) maybe do as /u/Snorkle25 says, ask them to watch something with you, and show them one of the clearer, more reputable videos about how to build a system.  

Maybe you even could ask them to help you consider parts--use pcpartspicker, show them a couple of builds, educate them, ask them what they think, spend time sharing your love of computers with them; let them *see* what you are capable of.  You might be surprised how much most concerned parents would love to be included in your life.

This is what adults do, you know, at least when we're at our best: we behave rationally.  Show them you can.

Sometimes as an adult you get more accomplished by being patient and softspoken, and considering your opponent's views than by trying to ramrod through what you want.

Handled correctly, this may actually be an opportunity for you and your parents to learn quite a bit about each other.  And about yourselves.

Not everything has to be confrontational.

	<TEXT> Of course.  Duane Thomas, Thomas Henderson, a whole host of bad draft choices that led to the Cowboys' collapse in the late 80s, including most notoriously Rod Hill, who may be the only player in competition with Claiborne as the worst draft choice in Cowboys' history.

Among other gems, Thomas once asked, "If the Super Bowl is the ultimate game, why do they play another one next year?"

And Henderson (in)famously once said, "Terry Bradshaw is so dumb he couldn't spell 'cat' if you spotted him the c and the a."  Unfortunately for him, he said this right before Bradshaw's Steelers  beat the Cowboys in a Super Bowl.

And Hill's selection was the one that started the whispers that the NFL had passed Schramm by. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's kind of faint praise, though; in the 15 years before Jerry was notoriously awful at drafting.  Heck, a monkey and a dart board would do better than he did.

Still you bring up an interesting point: I'd love to see a comparison of how teams have done over the years at drafting.  Seems like fans would be crying out for something like this.  Let's get some numbers to compare so we don't just have to huff and puff with nothing to back us up!  

Yeah I'll get right to it after I retire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My children are 10 and 7.  Every day with them has been better than the last.  They are the center of my life, the culmination of all that's gone before.

They're bright, sassy kids, filled with confidence.  Also, I think to a significant extent because we've spent so much time with them, they're somewhat advanced academically.

My 10 year old is in a k-12 school; in addition to his regular 5th-grade classes he's taking Algebra I and has perfect 100s in everything.  He's going to be the first 10 year old in state history to be allowed to sit for a state high-school level exam (to get credit for having taken the course). 

His school has said they'll let him take Geometry/Algebra II next year simultaneously, and his principal has said he probably should take other high school classes.  She's suggested that we should consider helping him graduate early, but I'm not so interested in rushing him through childhood.  As long as he's interested/challenged in school work and learning, that's good enough for me.  In any event, I've been in touch with a local university about allowing him to take Calculus there in 8th grade.

Because of what he's doing, he gained a lot of notoriety this year the first time a 9th-grade girl said hi to him.  So he's also learned a lot about how to handle social visibility.  Another cool thing he's learned already is that, while other kids may start off viewing him as kind of a circus monkey, over time, simply by being who he is, he can transform their views through his kind and gentle spirit.  He describes himself as happy, and he's serene and thoughtful.  Every teacher seems to know him, and most students, too, apparently, as they're often asking him to help with their math.

My 7 year old is following in his footsteps, as she'll be completing 4th grade math this year.  She'd grown up watching him do extra math, so before she even started school she'd wanted to start studying it.  In contrast to him, she's emotional, dramatic, generous.  Everywhere she goes her teachers--whether in school, dance, tae kwon do, softball--adults describe her as a leader, and children do seem to flock to her.  The two of them describe each other as their best friends.  I don't know how long that will last--we do emphasize it a lot--but the longer it lasts I figure the better the chance they'll be friends as adults.

I'm an older parent, and these two have given me a goal: live to see who they become.  

I genuinely feel blessed every day to be their dad. </TEXT>

But if there's anything I've seen in my 40+ years watching politics in the U.S., it's that events have a way of spiraling out of control, and when it comes to partisan loyalties and threats to one's own position, ultimately it's every man for himself.

In other words, if/when the GOP starts to realize their own seats are at risk, they'll turn on him in a heartbeat. </TEXT>

Park attitude at the door, follow the rules, message mods privately instead of publicly criticizing them (which is usually off-topic anyway), pursuant to the concept of *praise publicly, critique privately*, and you almost never will have any trouble.  At least I never have--as a user, anyway.  I mean *never*.

*Praise publicly, critique privately* is a great rule to follow in life, too.

Maybe you're a little more vociferous than me though.

	<TEXT> Agreed.  But I don't think this has anything to do with religion.  Instead, we allow faith to be politicized when politics confirm our biases.  We also often use our interpretation of faith to confirm our biases.

There was a study not too long ago which showed that one's ideas about authority actually was the strongest correlation found so far as to whether a person was to lean conservative or liberal.  Christians in particular are susceptible to confusing beliefs as to authority (God almighty vs. all-loving/forgiving God) with political biases.

There are *many* applications of the verse describing Satan as a roaring lion seeking whom it may devour.  Politics is just one more path on which Satan can feed. </TEXT>

I expect the Cowboys to keep working the FA market to make up the losses.  Then it'll be a question of how the draft shakes out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bob Lilly for me.  Most of today's fans don't realize.  But Bob Lilly was the best defensive lineman I've ever seen.  Important to realize he played before sacks were a thing.  But he was dominant on the line in a way that no one has been since.  He was better than Randy White.  That's how good he was.

He was triple-teamed most of his career.  But it simply didn't matter. 

All-NFL (the equivalent of All-Pro) 6 straight years--and 7 out of 8.  And second-team All-Pro for 2 additional years.  All-Decade team for *two* decades.

11-time Pro Bowler.

 *He was the best*.

He instantly would make the defense fearsome.  He was that good. </TEXT>

That said, there's no way in heck he'd be appointed, as the last thing the GOP wants is to disturb its golden goose.  Right now it's playing the line between not disturbing the status quo so it can enact its agenda and fearing the effect of its lack of enforcement on 2018. </TEXT>

I was heartbroken last year when Easton refused to recertify its SCN-3s.  I had 2, a 30 and a 28, that I'd used for years.  They were incredible.  But so now I'm looking for new ones.

So far I've narrowed the search to the 2016 Demarini Flipper Aftermath OG (28), the 2017 Demarini Raw Steel (30), and the 2017 Miken DC-41 (30).  Would you be able to rank those in terms of quality?

Also, a question I haven't been able to find answered anywhere, what would you say is the best one-piece balanced bat?

I realize it's all subject to opinion, but that's why I'm asking yours!  Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The GOP supports Trump because it doesn't want anything to interfere with its long-sought-after opportunity to enact its agenda. This is why Trump is naming all the old cronies to head the various agencies.  The GOP has wanted at least since the days of Reagan to enact a pro-business anti-working-person agenda.  And now it's finally gotten the chance.

No one wants to stand up against Trump because (1) s/he would be attacked by Trump's goons; and (2) the GOP routinely has marched in lockstep since the days of Clinton.

Like its agenda or not, the GOP has learned how to function as a party.  Generally to the detriment of the nation, but the Dems would improve their strategy if they simply started doing what the GOP does in terms of gerrymandering, propaganda, and solidarity.

Instead, it's clear the Dems still haven't learned their lesson, as seen by the fact that a number of them voted to affirm Perry as head of the EPA.

If we're lucky, Dems may have to learn, as the Town Halls do seem to represent a grassroots uprising which is long overdue.

	<TEXT> Concur.  If Trump colluded with the Russians to win the election, he would have committed treason. As would any U.S. citizen who knowingly helped him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> GOP's conduct won't resolve overnight; after all it's been aiming toward a one-party system since Goldwater.  But at least the Dems are awakening to the problem of gerrymandering, which has allowed the GOP to control so many statehouses and the House.  So far the GOP has totally outplayed the Dems.  Be ironic if an outsider (Trump) the GOP was too craven to resist finally brought it down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same thing that happened after Watergate.  It continued.

That's the strength of democracy.

The question is whether the GOP-controlled Congress finally will recognize that its loyalty to nation should triumph over its loyalty to party.  So far it hasn't.  But if it appears that Trump actually will fall, you'll see the GOP desert him like rats from a sinking ship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 54 is definitely a significant number in Cowboys history.  Heck in NFL history, as White was probably among the top-5 all-time greatest defensive linemen (if not *the* greatest). </TEXT>
