So were they going to be roles at one point and scrapped, or why are they in the game's files? </TEXT>

See my grandmother hated my mother and this was her last act of fuck you to her.

	<TITLE> Got releasedfrom the hospital an hour ago. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-27 06:49:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So today started out as any other day, i woke up and vaccumed the house. 

I then went off to my friends house and played some games and fell asleep. 
Then after the mid afternoon nap I went for a walk with her to play pokemon go. 

I found a gym and was battling it, when I ran out of heals and went to a nearby poke stop to get more. 

Well i saw a group of people smoking weed and they offered for me to join them and i did because I thought it would help my depression a bit. 

After a few hits from a pipe and a bong rip or two I said goodbye and went back to my friend and left to go home for dinner. 

Well i guess I had taken too much weed and ended up going numb in my whole body and couldnt stop shaking. I tried walking and i just couldnt move. 

So i lay down on a couch and texted someone to take me to the hospital. 

As I was laying there with the thought of death on my mind, I was eerily calm. As if i had accepted that I was going to die. 

I went to the hospital and got in right away, thankfully after 3 hours i was sent home and told that i was fine. 

So thankfully i didnt overdose on anything and am haply to be here. 

Sorry if this doesnt fit the theme of the subreddit.  </TEXT>
