 [This is part of the first article of impeachment drawn up during Watergate... - @RyanLizza](https://twitter.com/RyanLizza/status/862097856076947458)

	<TEXT> Good find.  

TLDR 3 key tweets (7-9):

 "But one thing Rosenstein's letter doesn't do -- and it took me a second read to note this -- is expressly recommend Comey be fired.  Sure, it comes very, very close to doing so.  The title is "Restoring Public Confidence in the FBI" and it has language like this: "FBI is unlikely 2 regain public/congressional trust until has Director who understands gravity of mistakes   pledges never 2 repeat."

Comey could have made that pledge, I'm sure.  I hope the press notices this, too, because it raises interesting questions. </TEXT>

Also, Nunes did say Trump himself had his communications 'possibly' swept up in [incidental surveillance](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-surveillance-idUSKBN16T2GQ). </TEXT>

Comey in his testimony has come across like a man just trying to do his job, and every Republican knows how his Clinton letter boosted Trump to victory.

	<TEXT>  During last years presidential campaign, Jared Kushner [reportedly made a deal](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-campaign-sinclair-broadcasting-jared-kushner-232764) with Sinclair Broadcast Group: The Trump campaign would provide Sinclairs local news stations with intimate access to the candidate, in exchange for fair coverage of the GOP nominee.

 Sinclair-owned stations and its Washington bureau scored 15 exclusive interviews with Trump over the past year, including 11 during the final three months of the campaign in critical states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. They did 10 more with Trumps running mate, Mike Pence, from August through October, as well as 10 with Trump surrogates, primarily Ben Carson. Sinclair stations aired five such interviews with Clinton running mate Tim Kaine and two with Chelsea Clinton but none with Clinton or another top surrogate.

  Mark Hyman  a Sinclair executive and conservative commentator who appears on Sinclair stations  regularly criticized Clinton or highlighted positions favorable to Trump in his on-air commentaries. Most Americans know very little about the leaked Clinton emails, [he said in one, which aired on Oct. 27.](http://behindtheheadlines.net/102716-clinton-emails/) Major news organizations buried the most damaging. So were sharing some with you. 

 ....

 Even if Kushner hadnt held out the promise of access, Sinclair might have offered such fairness, nonetheless. The companys longtime chairman David Smith is a big-dollar GOP donor, whose family helped fund one of Trumps super-PACs. When Sinclair purchased Washington, D.C.s ABC affiliate in 2014, the networks editorial bent took a sharp right turn. And the aforementioned Mark Hyman routinely delivers conservative commentary on the local news broadcasts of Sinclair stations around the country.

 This week, Sinclair capitalized on the FCCs new laissez-faire attitude, [purchasing Tribune Media](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/business/media/sinclair-tribune-media-sale.html?_r=0) for $3.9 billion  and, thereby, claiming ownership of enough local television stations to reach 70 percent of American households. 

 Sinclair also secured the Tribunes crown jewel, WGN America, a cable network that reaches 80 million homes, just 10 million fewer than Fox News. 

This seems possibly somewhat alarming. </TEXT>

Alternatively, he is willing to donate his entire salary as President for one year to you.  Whatever works best for both parties.  Sincerely, definitely a real lawyer Don McGahn" </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Senate Intelligence Committee sent letters on April 28 to Page and several other former Trump campaign allies requesting records of their meetings, emails and phone calls with Russian operatives, as well as any business holdings there. Page first responded Thursday, saying that he was unfairly subjected to surveillance by Obama officials and that the evidence proving it would induce severe vomiting once the facts were made public, according to a letter obtained by CNN.

 Sundays letter went even further. Page alleged that the Obama administration committed two preliminary felonies by leaking information about his ties to Russian officials. He charged that the Obama administration unlawfully disclosed his identity in a court filing documenting his 2013 meeting with a Russian spy, where he handed over documents related to the energy business. He also accused the Obama administration of illegally leaking classified information stemming from a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrant against him after he left the Trump campaign last summer.

 Page called these alleged leaks abuse and said they contributed to his feeling that he should be able to come before the Senate and testify in open session, rather than do the forced labor of turning over all of the requested documents.

	<TEXT> Frankly the only narrative being pushed here is by you.  You seem to take it as personal affront that some governments worldwide at least attempt to take care of the needs of their female citizens.

All three of those bullet points are so vague as to not be policy suggestions.  The third bullet point is exactly what I am asking you: what male-centric health programs tailored to men should our government try to implement?  

The foundation of your argument is that women live longer than men and you combine that with the fact that some governments have made attempts to take care of the unique problems that arise in the health of their female citizens to create a narrative that women are more 'advantaged' than men.  That you think women outpacing men in Australia "completing tertiary qualifications" is relevant to this discussion is further evidence of this. 

The fact is women live longer than men because of reasons biological.  If you think otherwise, some evidence would be help your cause.

Have you ever considered girls feel disadvantaged because, depending on where they were born through no fault of their own, the chances of them having full and equitable access to affordable healthcare that is specific to women, such as cancer screenings, birth control, family planning, and abortion services, varies wildly? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the solutions are clear, what are they?

Did you look into what those three countries, Brazil, Ireland, and Australia, have specifically done, and if it has affected the longevity of males?

Because [here's a chart](http://www.prb.org/DataFinder/Topic/Rankings.aspx?ind=6) of those countries, with some others for comparison, and I'm not seeing any real benefits.

	<TEXT> In that Harvard article, there are zero things in there that answer the question I asked.  The conclusion section is 10 points about how men individually can maximize their longevity.  There are zero policy suggestions

As for women living longer than men (per your quoted text, and general assertion), the conclusion halfway through the Harvard article sort of contravenes your arguments:

 The gender gap is not unique to America. In fact, every country with reliable health statistics reports that women live longer than men. The longevity gap is present both in industrialized societies and in developing countries (see Table 2). It's a universal observation that suggests a basic difference between the health of men and women. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In it's current practice I agree.  But if the EC did the job it was created to do, that is to prevent "an interested and overbearing majority" and the "mischiefs of faction" from choosing someone with ["talents for low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity"](http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp), I'm all for it.

As an aside, the word 'leader' appears in the Federalist papers 11 times - 10 times derisively - with an intent at warning the public of demagogues who would ["try to use political office to rouse the country"](http://news.usc.edu/29924/george-will-shares-his-perspective-on-politics/?view=full) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we are definitely getting way too deep into this, but I'm not even talking about vetting at the door.  So just to clarify..

Paul Ryan has paid aides who could have noticed this trick happening, for one thing.  

If though he was somehow totally on his own, Paul Ryan has peripheral vision and functioning ears connected presumably to a functioning brain, and so unless this guy is just really deft I'm nearly certain Ryan would unconsciously register him unzipping and zipping it up immediately after.  Depending on his intelligence, he might subconsciously realize that's not a super common thing to happen compared to what happens at most photo ops, and I guess I afforded him the intelligence to meet that threshold.

If the guy had it unzipped the whole time, or left it unzipped after the photo, Paul Ryan or his aides again could simply have read the big bold text printed on the t-shirt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  U.S. EPA fired members of a scientific advisory board yesterday.

 The agency quietly forced out some members of the Board of Scientific Counselors just weeks after leaders told them their tenure would be renewed, said Robert Richardson, an ecological economist at Michigan State University and one of those dismissed.

 The board is tasked with reviewing the work of EPA scientists and provides feedback that can be a powerful voice in shaping the agency's future research.

 ...

 The board had 18 members, including Richardson, who said he knew of at least one other member fired. Departures could reach a dozen, he said.


I'm not familiar with E E News, but looking into who they are and the author of this piece, they check out -- as does this story.

Robert Richardson is the source for this and here he is on the [EPA BOSC website](https://www.epa.gov/bosc/bosc-executive-committee-membership), although I guess not for long anymore.

	<TEXT>  Senior officials at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services received an email in late January from a House Ways and Means Committee staffer informing them that communication between the two government entities belongs to the committee  and are therefore not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, BuzzFeed News has learned.

 This is the second such letter that has come to light. On Thursday, BuzzFeed News exclusively reported that the chairman of the House Committee on Financial services sent a [similar letter](https://www.buzzfeed.com/maryanngeorgantopoulos/house-committee-wants-records-with-treasury-secret?utm_term=.mjRK0GL8D#.bv1MRNZmJ) last month to the head of the Treasury Department.

Should probably start a rolling tally as this will most likely continue to spread to other committees. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's all perfectly rational and I agree with pretty much everything you just wrote there to one degree or another.

My argument was just that in the general situation where government workers have a TV in the workplace and wish it to be tuned to a 24-hour major news network, there is no alternative to CNN that is more neutral.  

If Obama mandated that every agency watch CNN and only CNN, I agree that would be wrong.  But as far as I read in the article, before this the TVs were not mandated to this or that station:

 The spokesperson explained that a variety of news stations run on the monitors in the common areas on campus, including CNN, MSNBC and FOX News, and that the email referenced had been sent by a customer service representative from the FDA's Office of Facilities in response to a group of employees.     </TEXT>
