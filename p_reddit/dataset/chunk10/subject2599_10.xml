	<TEXT> I agree about the limited number of literate people not having enough critical mass to birth a god. And second-order audiences, such as a congregation listening to a priest reading a Bible, wouldn't count either. So that would leave monks and a tiny sliver of aristocrat families. China's larger populations may have let this happen earlier, but of course we're talking about Media, not . ;)

Tangent: even if a larger absolute number of worshippers might justify a deification event, wouldn't it also require a certain percentage as well? Otherwise, a proto-Media would be drowned out by other fledgling gods elbowing their way into that culture. I mean, *something's* got to exist to keep all the riffraff out! *Harumph!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I allude to that  smaller sacrifices per worshipper but vastly more worshippers to make up for it. Thus, Media requires *Mass* Media to incorporate. 

The earlier media revolutions either lacked the degree or the scale. Gutenberg Bibles didn't result in blood sacrifice, unless you count things like The Inquisition but even then, arguably the gods involved would have to share in the mana. Thus, no *oomph*. While attention and time were sacrificed, but the audience of literate people of the era was far too small to matter. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> When did Media anthropomorphize into a sentient god? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-09 20:22:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, it's **New** Gods, yet media has been around since Babylonian times, even earlier if you count oral history.

I interpret Media as being the stuff that's communicated, with Technical Boy being the means of communication (and other things tech), so let's assume that is how our new gods divide their labor. That is, your iPhone is a Tech Boy altar, your listening to Beyonc a sacrifice (but *so* worth it!) to Media.

Mr Wednesday cited the telegraph as the beginning of the Information Age (he's not happy  at all!), so did Media incorporate the first time there was electronic communication: the dots   dashes?

Or was it later, with Victorolas and Edison's wax cylinders? Or later, with the motion pictures of the silent era  the Clair Bows and Rudolph Valentinos?

I think Media came into being slightly before this, when there were mass audiences capable of being enough in the aggregate to support a deity. The earlier periods (Mediaeval manuscripts, say, or even a Gutenberg Bible) had media. But they didn't reach a critical mass to make up for the fact that smaller sacrifices were made per worshiper. It didn't scale, to use a tech concept common today.

There had to be enough critical mass birth my favorite New Goddess, Media. But when?

So I boldly place Media's birthday around [the rise of the Victrola](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Talking_Machine_Company), or around 1900. [Edison's Phonograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Talking_Machine_Company) happened around the same time. [Auguste and Louis Lumire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auguste_and_Louis_Lumire) were also debuting their [Cinematograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinematograph), which gave birth to Nickelodeons around 1895, so this era seems apt.

	<TEXT> First, most travelers aren't searched. So, odds are tremendously good if you're not interesting, they won't even ask about your digital devices.

And like the Sith, there are always two border control checkpoints per transit. Never fewer, never more. Don't focus just on one since the other may be just as pushy.

What's your nationality and what's your threat profile? Who are you worried might target you (US or the Philippines) and are you in a higher-risk category (sadly, this includes journalists or anyone joining with a group to help others)?

Are you only worried about a phone, or a laptop too? Flash drives?

Do not lie to US Customs agents. That's a felony and you'll have all kinds of fun even if they don't prosecute and "only" put you on the heightened security watch list. You'll never get off, or at best, you'll be on the list for years.

Make it so you when you cross the border, you can truthfully say, "I got nothing." Or, "I got something generic and useless, wanna see?"

If you're a US citizen and US Customs asks you to hand them your unlocked phone, plan ahead. If you plan on saying No, it's your right. It's also within their power to say, Great, we'll hang on to your phone! Think about what happens if they threaten to hang on to your devices if they're unsatisfied. Can you live without them for a week or a month?

Social media accounts are *supposedly* safer from being searched, especially if you're a US citizen (assuming US Customs is part of your concern), but this may vary. Likewise passwords. Especially delete any Social Apps on your phone. That way if you say you don't have an account, you won't have counter-evidence on your phone.

Three techniques I recall offhand:

* Broadly, having a minimal travel phone   laptop is best, but expensive.

* Having wiped devices with no traces of Apps you use on them, then installing them then accessing your Cloud when safe is another option. Then doing the same as you re-enter. But then you've got to worry whether your threat profile includes foes being able to get warrants, etc. from these providers.

* Wiping then saving to a Flash drive can work, but only if the contents are encrypted and "your boss" (etc) has the encryption key that you've (securely) emailed them.

To be fair, this isn't a cheap, easy solution w/o trash contractors having a role. That's probably why Oakland's made it part of the contract. It's a bit more up front, but much less than having a fleet of city trucks roaming around looking for trash.

Short answer: call your local pols and if things are messed up, let them know. Don't (only) vent here. :)

Maybe your city has a site mention or a phone number to report trash/junk? Each city is different, so I can't help you on specifics. Sorry! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, damn. My bad  I thought I was in /r/Oakland.

Uhh, okay. Modest revision. Check with your local refuse company. And if they don't have special carting days, talk to your city council  ours didn't originally until our city council folks made sure it was part of the contract.

I'd also like to see local area dumping areas so folks don't have to drive to the main dump, of assorted kinds. 

Concord seems an anomaly, though. Oakland has various options. San Leandro has at least electronic waste days where you can carry your toxic (but so shiny!) junk to various places and they'll dispose of it for you safely. I see signs for these all the time.

I recall for Da Town, some items like a mattress you can call ahead, and you get a couple of these per year. Other mixed-bag (bundle) are anything goes, so long as they fit within dimensions  I recall 3x4 feet bundles not weighing more than I forget pounds. Lined in a row, and 3 or 4 bundles per trip. No construction materials. Electronic waste for other days.

There are places like Goodwill that might take them if they're in good shape.

But yeah, for some things, you'll need to take things to the dump. A refrigerator or a sofa, I'd think. Which is fair.

So from what you're saying, it changes from city to city, and Concord needs a lot more work. I'd push for that, or even, organize online (via Reddit?) to get 20 folks to sign a petition or show up at a council meeting. If you don't squawk, they won't hear. I know we have a rep in Oakland for being uhh active, but we're also active in ways like this. You can be, too. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In its draft technical capability notices paper [PDF], all communications companies  including phone networks and ISPs  will be obliged to provide real-time access to the full content of any named individual within one working day, as well as any "secondary data" relating to that person.

That includes encrypted content  which means that UK organizations will not be allowed to introduce true end-to-end encryption of their users' data but will be legally required to introduce a backdoor to their systems so the authorities can read any and all communications.

So it's limited to telecom companies and ISPs. Not third parties like software developers or OS developers? That seems a glaring (and welcome) gaping hole. Or am I reading it wrong?

Obviously, for people using real encryption not offered by their ISP: good luck with that!

But just that they're trying to, and the scope of their surveilling innocents is alarming and worth pointing to. </TEXT>

Kill the Plates of Food (no one cares, especially past a week), duplicate shots, flawed photos, etc. Even better, if you have a computer, backing up to that (encrypted, of course!) via iTunes/Photos so in case there's that one kitten photo you're unsure if you'll miss, there's a reprieve.

Besides, it goes without saying that Google only wants your photos so they can do advanced algorithmic identifying/categorizing things with them, linked to your Google account, which is probably linked to your phone number? Not even for boudoir photos, that's enough to earn a "Meh" for me. Apple's great with privacy (for most civilians), Google not so much, Facebook awful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was over $3m raised in the first day  grassroots, small donor, the kinds that show there's vote-casting momentum  after the Rep AHCA vote, [more than $1m to a Daily Kos fund for whoever wins the Dem nomination in races where a Republican Congressman won in a Blue district.](http://www.dailykos.com/stories/2017/5/6/1659591/-Trumpcare-vote-spurs-Daily-Kos-donors-to-raise-more-than-1-25-million-for-24-House-races-in-2018)

$3 million for a hypothetical opponent, without anyone to rally behind. It's *unheard* of.

This of course, makes it more likely further funding will follow this seed money, as well as make it more likely a fence-sitting but viable person will declare they're in to crush the Red incumbent.

It's going to hurt them. Hurt them bad. And that's not even taking into account the Senate, where gerrymandering stunts can't tilt the odds to favor the incumbent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, when most think about digital personal assistants, they think of something that can handle queries like this, with certainly a text UI but usually with a voice-driven one:

* What's the weather going to be for next week?

* What movies are playing around here?

* Play Station to Station (Bowie song)

* Who is the King of Scotland (movie, Wikipedia for Scottish royalty It should ask)?

* Get me tickets for the Yankees game.

* Call Marsha (which Marsha since everyone has 5 Marshas and every Marsha has 3 voice lines)

* What are the Yelp reviews for Mi Tacos Carbon? (third-party App   data sets, location services, it knowing you're asking about food, not a book or film). Bonus for follow-up telling you how to get (walk, transit, drive?) there.

* Read my texts.

* Read my Messages (that is, a specific App)

* Text Marsha that I'll be running 15 minutes late (several of above challenges rolled into one. Yay!)

Bonus points for "Who's on first?" riffing off Abbott   Costello routine or other culturally significant and/or funny implementations.

The number of different datasets  some internal, some external, some 3rd party  are dizzying. And it has to respond in under 5 secs w/ a 98% accuracy rate else folks won't use it.

Oh yeah. Plus it has to account for fact that everyone speaks differently (if voice-driven), has different slang and has different background noise. Even if text-based, it has to account for all these differences, plus typos.

It. Is. **Hard.**

And again, it has to work quickly and accurately before it's released to public or folks will try it once, snicker, then delete it. So all those (significant) costs have to be paid for long before there's any hope of a dime of revenue (however that will happen, which is also very hard). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's reasonable to look at the challenges of having a digital personal assistant that's worth using, while respecting privacy. I don't see a FLOSS solution to this since it requires a ton of data, quickly accessible yet secure  /or anonymized, as well as a Cloud infrastructure (same challenges) and server farms (ditto) to pull it off. What's the revenue model  one is required since these items are *very* expensive and the costs front-loaded before general release.

There are great FLOSS solutions for tasks out there, but Personal Assistants probably aren't one of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By definition, Google   Microsoft assistants work against user's privacy. Apple [has a section on how it protects privacy for customers using Siri](https://www.apple.com/privacy/approach-to-privacy/). 

The longer you use Siri and Dictation, the better they understand you and the better they work. To help them recognize your pronunciation and provide better responses, certain information such as your name, contacts, and songs in your music library is sent to Apple servers using encrypted protocols. That said, **Siri and Dictation do not associate this information with your Apple ID, but rather with your device through a random identifier**. Apple Watch uses the Siri identifier from your iPhone. You can reset that identifier at any time by turning Siri and Dictation off and back on, effectively restarting your relationship with Siri and Dictation. When you turn Siri and Dictation off, Apple will delete the User Data associated with your Siri identifier, and the learning process will start all over again 

You can also receive helpful suggestions before you even ask, based on the things you use often and when you typically use them. **These predictions are kept on your device, not in the cloud, so the information is protected by all the safeguards that are built in.** Which means private information like your email, contacts, app usage, and calendar can stay private. Suggested events from Mail do not leave your device until they are confirmed by you, and only then are they added to your calendar 

So basically, since their revenue model doesn't rely on selling *you* to others, Apple uses a combination of tokens, keeping PII on your device (which is encrypted, right?) or only allowing access only after users have explicitly granted it. Versus Google, Facebook or Microsoft, who use their Personal Assistant promises as a honeypot to entice you into revealing more personal information about yourself so they can then distribute and sell it to others.

I'd guess FLOSS alternatives won't have personal assistants worth much of anything since it requires a *lot* of data then very clever algorithms parsing everything to an AI to give personal suggestions. </TEXT>

They would add that there is some justification for that. Matt Zarb-Cousin, who recently stepped down as Corbyns spokesman, [told the US magazine Jacobin this week](https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/04/jeremy-corbyn-theresa-may-media-general-election-labour/)  just as the election campaign cranks into gear  that Labour party staff habitually handed sensitive information to the press to destabilise the leadership.

There were endless leaks from Southside, which makes it incredibly difficult to function in a professional way, he said. I dont think anyone would be able to under those conditions.

	<TEXT> Teaching kids is really simple, if you aren't motivated to screw them and their parents over.

* Smaller class sizes, somewhere around 30.

* Prep in the form of Head Start before the kids embark on their educational career.


* Ensuring kids needs are taken care of so they're not hungry, distracted or abused (thus lunches for all, less sugar available and counseling/social services)

* Job stability at a single location by qualified professionals who've devoted many years of their lives in both the subject matter and in pedagogy, at good wages and benefits. And, yup, unions, because while there are a few really crappy teachers protected by unions, there are also some really crappy administrators overseeing all teachers. Our teachers  and your kids  need to be protected from them.

* Up-To-Date books and all the school supplies students need.

* Some way of communicating with parents to teach them how to create better studying environments in their homes (yeah, this one is tougher)

* Reliable spending so students   teachers aren't wondering if their classes will exist the next year.

This requires money. Money that for ideological or self-interested reasons, some Pols don't want to see passed through. This also requires states (or even the Federal government) don't use local taxes to fund schools, since this results in richer districts lavishing their kids with resources while poorer districts starve.

But the single biggest thing is parents. If you have parents who know how to motivate their kids to do well in school, they'll do well in school. That's the big con for Charter schools and private schools: their Killer App is that they're able to cull these "easier" students who'd do well regardless, leaving the public system with all the educationally more challenging ones. It's not that they're better at pedagogy, it's that they take the best performers, move them to their own racetrack, then yell at the other racetrack administrators, "Do more with less!"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every so often, we like hyping other Subs. This one is /r/POTUSWatch, which aims to have less hyperbolic coverage of the current President.

Check it out!

/r/POTUSWatch aims to observe and host civil discourse regarding the actions and statements of the President of the United States (POTUS) and the other machinations of the Federal Executive Branch. To call Donald J. Trump, the current President, a controversial figure is putting it mildly, and it can prove easy to find oneself lost in the constant stream of scandal-claims and allegations. This is why it's more important than ever to facilitate civil and critical discussion centered around facts and observations, as opposed to rumor and newsroom hyperbole.

In terms of content, one of the great concerns at the heart of the sub is the idea that a community should not be an echo chamber. This community thrives on diverse opinions and source material from both sides of the fence. One can expect myriad [articles and reports](http://www.dw.com/en/us-to-tighten-sanctions-on-north-korea/a-38604778?maca=en-rss-en-top-1022-rdf), [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vqy4nqqFe_0 feature=youtu.be), the ever-crucial [fact-checks](http://www.snopes.com/trump-considering-resignation/), [provocative questions](https://www.reddit.com/r/POTUSWatch/comments/61tnol/question_about_trumps_vacation_time/?st=j1zr6mgw sh=809105a1) from the community and, of course, a neverending supply of [Tweets](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/848857910297980928) from the man himself.

As one could expect from a subreddit that prides itself on neutrality and evidence-based discussion, the community aims to be neutral and level-headed in their interactions. While this isn't always feasible, especially considering the divisive nature of the times, the sub is actively and fairly moderated. Free speech is present, of course, for better or for worse, but there is no denying that the existing community and its moderation team are moving forward with a firm grasp on the intended character of the forum; that is, to be unbiased, critical, and observant in all things Presidential. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf released her proposed 2017-2019 budget late last Friday. She's projecting a $32.5 million gap over the two years that will have to be bridged with spending cuts and new revenue.

To those saying, "We need to spend more on police!!", note the largest single budget item?

Police: 20.98%

That's twice the next-largest item. *Twice* what we spend for our fire department. *Twice* our public works (roads   such). *Ten times* what we spend on libraries (America's engine for equality and self-improvement) and Parks   Recreation (America's engine for Sunday Drum Circles and places for teenagers to make out). *Hundreds* over things like our commissions, auditors and clerks.

And I'll bet these don't include pensions, lawsuits (defending cases *and* settlements) and other charges.

Plus they're adding:

50 more cops: $1.5 million would pay for a third police academy in 2018-2019, adding fifty more officers to the department. This would bring the total number of sworn officers to 792 from the current 754. Schaaf's budget does **not** include the cost of these new officers' salaries in future years. That will cost millions extra. 

This comes on top of $9.4 million approved last year, outside of the budget process, for the hiring of more police officers. 

Another $9.3 million was similarly allocated for the hiring of more police officers in 2015, outside of the normal budget process. </TEXT>

Worth the read, but some snips:

The difference between building a tool to serve ads to young people when they're feeling crappy and telling companies to craft ads that target young people who are feeling crappy seems minor.

Regardless, the whole thing fits a familiar pattern for Facebook: [some new horror from the bowels of the company emerges,](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/facebook-is-making-us-all-live-inside-emotional-filter-bubbles) and [Facebook apologizes like it somehow doesn't reflect the company's entire business strategy](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jul/02/facebook-apologises-psychological-experiments-on-users). That is, leveraging detailed insights about people's lives and state of mind (to the extent that can be divined by their Facebook activities)), for a profit motive.

Also note *cough* Facebook is a multi-billion-dollar social media company and it'd be incredible if they didn't have PR efforts involving scores of people to push their narrative on Facebook and other social media, including Reddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, I've reinstated it. Sorry about being to twitchy but we get a lot of spam, some of it pretty clever. I've also updated my pinned comment.

The thing about web-based mail is most of it is "free" in exchange for extensive metadata analysis. This is an intrinsic problem if you're interested in privacy and a threat if your friend lives under a hostile government. There's also a transparency issue: we know what SMTP is, how it works, its processes. No gotchas, versus whatever web-based email providers do is opaque.

Personally, I don't think PGP is that hard, but I'm not a novice. ProtonMail is popular, as is Signal if you're fine chatting vs writing.

Check out EFF's Surveillance Self-Defense, on the right sidebar. It's amazing. Have your friend check it out too. You both also want to insure your devices are secure (consider doing a clean wipe then reinstall, after backing your files up). Change all your passwords to new, stronger, different ones (cue a suggestion to use a password manager). This includes **all** your web passwords, every single one. Plus 2-Factor Authentication. Yeah, what a pain. You're in a different league than before, it looks like (or at least, s/he is).

At some point, given your threat profiles, you'll want to evaluate Tor.

Cheers and again, sorry for pausing your post. :) </TEXT>

Plus, the irony of /r/Privacy insisting on basically doxxing people would cause a rip in the timespace continuum. ;)

But we do verify protocols and procedures (especially to the extent that they're FLOSS so you, our esteemed readers, can verify) since like all good things privacy related, don't trust the person, trust the protocols, tech and procedures.

	<TEXT> The European Union has called on Theresa May to provide immediate serious and real guarantees to its citizens living in Britain. The EU leaders took just four minutes at a special summit to agree unanimously an uncompromising opening stance in the Brexit negotiations.

Leaders said they would not discuss a future trade deal with the British government until sufficient progress is made on the issues of Britains estimated 60bn divorce bill, the rights of EU nationals in the UK, and the border in Ireland.

The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, told reporters at the special summit in Brussels that EU citizens in Britain were the number one priority, and that he had discussed the need for Britain to now live up to its warm words regarding EU citizens during a dinner with the prime minister in Downing Street last week 

Having May   the Tories live up to what they promised seems a reasonable request.

**Where does the money go? How does the Panel of Experts work?**

The tax revenue goes into the citys general fund. Accountability is written into the measure: Measure D creates a panel of experts in child nutrition, healthcare, and education to make recommendations to the City Council about funding programs that improve childrens health across Berkeley. The panel will issue annual public reports detailing the impact of funded programs.

This is a system that has proven to work in Berkeley. The City and citizens of Berkeley have a decades-long, ongoing commitment to child health and nutrition. City Council has a proven track record of respecting the recommendations of their boards and commissions. For example, the Children, Youth, and Recreation Commission makes recommendations to Council about general fund appropriations in the same way as the Panel written into Measure D would, and the City Council has consistently adopted that Commissions full recommendations.

After Measure D was passed, the panel of experts was formed. As of January 2017, over $2.5 million has been raised by the tax, to go to community health and nutrition efforts, including school garden programs. 

We can do it, Oakland. Big Soda is *praying* pols like Schaaf make a cash-grab against the spirit and letter of the law we passed. That way, Oakland can be their poster child for why no other city should ever pass *any* laws protecting their kids (and big kids) in situations like this.

Don't let Oakland be their corporate stooge. Call/email your councilmembers today and tell them to fight Schaaf's Soda Tax cash-grab. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Sigh*. It totally is a story.

The summaries and supporting sites also say that while funds will be shunted to the general fund, that a board will be created of health   kid-related folks to administer Soda Tax funds to the promised purpose.

Berkeley did it. So have other municipalities backing the Soda Tax. We can do better. And we are. Council members Brooks, Campbell-Washington   Kaplan have announced their opposition to Schaaf's cash grab against the initiative's intent, and they'll take action to prevent it.

This is **not** normal. If for no other reason, do you think other cities' Soda Taxes will pass if Oakland becomes the poster child for cash-grabs taken under false pretenses? Big Soda will go nuts over this. Think big picture: they're licking their lips over this, hoping we'll be their stooges.

So, don't downvote. Instead, contact your Oakland reps to make your voice heard! </TEXT>

[Berkeley, CA: Racist Attacks on Black Owned Cooperative Follow Alt-Right Trump Rally](https://itsgoingdown.org/racist-attacks-on-black-owned-cooperative-in-berkeley-after-alt-right-rally/). 

April 27th, 2017  The windows of Alchemy Collective Cafe were shot out the night after white supremacists and pro-Trump supporters rallied in Berkeley, California.

Alchemy is a largely Black and People of Color owned worker cooperative with Black Lives Matter and indigenous solidarity posters in the glass. Community members suspect the attack is race related because this is the second time windows were broken here after a pro-Trump rally in Berkeley, them having been broken a few nights after the March 4 Trump rally.

I am shocked and angry, but this is just the kind of tactic white supremacists have used for ages to induce fear in our communities, and its not going to work, one patron said. Neighbors are pouring in with support.

Click thru for more.

And so, yeah, when the Neo-Nazis #hashtag on and on and on about #FreeSpeech, **always** ask yourself, "Okay. Fine. But let's go one hop forward. So, what *ideas* are they about? What's their end-game? What's their concept of the ideal world they want us all to ~~live in~~ be trapped in?" </TEXT>

Highly elastic goods have a more direct effect while non-elastic ones less so, but forces still remain. Raise prices enough and even insulin customers won't buy it (because they can't afford it).

Of course, Republicans wouldn't see this as a problem since the (dead) customer had "access" to insulin up until his last, dying breath. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, let's get away from the "Free Speech!!" aspects that the Neo-Nazis go on and on about. Fine, they had their chance to yammer on amongst each other. Most from outside Berkeley, even the Bay Area, even some outside California. Ok, great. So they had their venue. And?

What precisely *is* the speech and ideas that, once they have (even more) platforms, they want exposure for? That women with agency suck? That non-heteronormal folks should cower in basements? That woman secretly want to be raped by so-called Alphas? That Jewish people make great lampshades? That corporations are people and as such they should rule societies like back in the 1920s? That the SS had great uniforms but what they really needed was a frog mascot? What?

*That's* what we should be focusing on. Once the song   dance is over and they get to the stage and can't yammer on about "Free Speech!", what ideas are they championing? Pretty stupid ones, and ones we've heard before, back in the 20s   30s, actually. Particularly for a group that are largely under-employed and ill-suited for the latter half of our 21st century. They are going to be *so* hosed once the Mercers, Koches, Trumps and the like have no more use for them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you edit and rephrase your question? You're making a **huge** accusation with **no** rational and supported basis. Also, if you click thru to the site, then their FAQ (which given the phat claim you make, you should at least bother the click), [you'll see](https://www.haveibeencompromised.com/faq)

**How do I know that you're not harvesting my email for phishing attacks or spam?**

HIBC was designed to assist and prevent individuals from becoming further victims of cyber crime. We aim to do this by delivering the platform that we are offering without any interest in profit in any shape or form. We have no intentions to harvest emails and have not built our platform in such a way to do so. However, it is virtually impossible for us to prove that these are our real intentions. If you are still worried, you should probably avoid using our platform.

Also, consider the fact that we identify over 10,000 emails on a daily basis. One or two email accounts is useless to us, not to mention the fact that we most likely already have your email(s) stored in our database. If we were to harvest your email addresse(s) to sell to spammers, we would require a significant amount of email addresses to be profitable. It's evident to note that almost every online service requires your email address (most of the time, they require a whole list of personal details).

~~We could remove it since it's spreading FUD w/o foundation but we'd *really* prefer you to rephrase it in a more neutral and constructive way.~~ 

Thanks!

*Edit:* Downvoting isn't really addressing the problem. If you'd like, I can post a better version of your question w/o the /r/conspiracy overtones (Rule #15 violation  *hint!*), but I'd prefer not to. The thing is, you do raise a fair question  but it's going to be buried in down votes and this response is too good to be taken down with it. :) </TEXT>

You can contact FCC chairman Ajit Pai and let him know what you think by emailing him: Ajit.Pai@fcc.gov. You can also call the FCC at 1-888-225-5322. At the prompt, press 1, then 4, then 2, then 0 to be connected to an agent and file a complaint.

I feel like a broken record, because I've posted this thought before, but DO NOT send emails to the FCC. [It's the third worst thing, by far, after mailed letters and phone calls] Type up a letter saying "This is what the future looks like without Net Neutrality and privacy on the internet". Print ten (or a hundred) copies and put them in the mail. One person at the FCC can ignore hundreds of emails, but they won't be able to ignore hundreds of letters being delivered by the postman.

I get that loosely speaking, these alternatives are more private. But like veering into paid VPN providers, they quickly spin out of control.

So we're clear, it was never about free speech. It wasn't "free" but sponsored by the usual cabal of Koch brothers types. And even the shadowy corporate   right wing financiers of Coulter's stuttering ragefest looked at this and said, "Nope  too stupid and pointless, even for us."

And of course, even after decades of Coulter grifting tens of millions of dollars from gullible audiences, when it comes to her "principles", they're not worth her springing the $300 to buy her own damned airline ticket.

Not that I have any sympathy for the Neo-Nazis, but if I were them, I'd feel even more stupid (than usual) after being played by this cackling scarecrow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, HIBC 

It's good you've developed your site. I'd suggest something to put in a text post, explaining more and especially, the work you've done on the privacy policy and the like.

Think of who's reading it (and why they'd care). Also (no offense) why should they trust you (and how can they verify this)? The safety you have for PII visitors give you, which I really liked. It can't hurt to have a question ready for, How is this different than HaveYouBeenPwnd.

Also, be sure to check w/ your site during the IAMA. There is a report that someone saw this then was irked that they didn't get a response back after they left their email address. Expect some traffic and the extra scrutiny that comes with it. :)

Everyone else, we're helping HaveIBeenCompromised. It's a new site but we over at /r/Privacy agreed to let him have a three-day IAMA there. /u/HIBC2017 was very forthcoming when he was around answering questions before, so we hope you'll ask him anything that you'd like to.

Also, please ask questions over in /r/Privacy once his IAMA begins. And also, do **not** pose questions nested inside questions. Each should be its own parent thread. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you trying to misdirect on purpose? You seem to be shifting topics and goalposts all over the place. By feet. Meters. Yards. Leagues, even!

Our discussion started because of /u/DarkGamer's curious use of "American middle-class kids" w/in the context of Oakland teens swarming a train. G'head, check it out again I'll wait. 

Why did you use "American"? Last time I visited/checked, neither Europe, Asia, Africa or even Antartica were rife with roving "wilding gangs" of adolescent commuter train robbers. Seems a curious addition. Why?

I said American because I'm not familiar with commuter train robbing frequency in other countries. It could be common in some places for all I know.

Once we're back to comparisons w/in the US, then we're back to the original question/issue. That there is a double-standard with how people of color are represented in the corporate media and that /u/DarkGamer is being either naive or "cute" when taking the "we're all post-Racial" line. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a story that Sam Biddle mentions, from someone who worked for a company that considered buying Unroll.me, then [posted about it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14180463) in Hacker News. Unbelievably immoral over-reach paired with recklessly substandard security. With a history of screwing over their own employees' stock options via diluting them on the eve of the buy-out, so the execs could made even more money.

Almost as bad as Uber is, which is the gold standard for evil companies.

I worked for a company that nearly acquired unroll.me. At the time, which was over three years ago, they had kept a copy of every single email of yours that you sent or received while a part of their service. Those emails were kept in a series of poorly secured S3 buckets. A large part of Slice buying unroll.me was for access to those email archives. Specifically, they wanted to look for keyword trends and for receipts from online purchases.

The founders of unroll.me were pretty dishonest, which is a large part of why the company I worked for declined to purchase the company. As an example, one of the problems was how the founders had valued and then diluted equity shares that employees held. To make a long story short, there weren't any circumstances in which employees who held options or an equity stake would see any money.

I hope you weren't emailed any legal documents or passwords written in the clear.

And in the comments, someone dissects unroll.me's claim that they "don't store your personal information on any of our servers", pointing out, of *course* they don't. Since they use AWS, they store all your PII on *Amazon's* servers.

*Evil.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're being cute. Or in your writing, you're failing to account for how readers will interpret "Oakland teens swarming train" and "American middle-class teens".

We agree that race and class are important, let's not lose sight of that. However, especially now in our Trump Era, you're being naive (or cute) to not layer in race into your "Let's be Post-Racial" observation.

Why did you use "American"? Last time I visited/checked, neither Europe, Asia, Africa or even Antartica were rife with roving "wilding gangs" of adolescent commuter train robbers. Seems a curious addition. Why?

Back to the key question I asked. Do you think the national media treat these two groups differently? Why (or why not)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not that many Black ones, either. That's why this story is generating so many comments.

More broadly regards "American middle-class kids", most of the US public don't hear of "Wilding Gangs", it's because when White teens riot, it's "Misguided adolescent sports fans get a bit too rambunctious".

Same as all White shooters are misunderstood Lone Wolfs who neighbors swear seemed "nice as apple pie  and I don't know why society failed him". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many whizzy CSS features that folks think of, but I Mod for several Subs that are more activist and try pushing traffic to non-profits like ACLU, EFF, FFTF, and more. Rather than cutting deserving groups or drowning them in long 4" lists of worthwhile causes, pushing them traffic, we use drop down menus.

We also do stylistic things to make our stickies and posts stand out.

We'll lose these without CSS. So while some of the snazzier aspects of CSS get attention, less flashy implementations are also vital. Features that probably won't make the cut if ranked, thus will never be added to the Admin alternative. This hurts charities and non-profits that rely on us to help them.

So, something else for /u/Spez to consider.

Hey, Mods that moderate Subs that also do community/activist/charity work, are there other CSS features you use? Add them in replies since it shows it's not "just" visual effects (not that there's anything wrong with that!) </TEXT>

I also added a link to your post in a comment I made in the Admin announcement thread to /u/Spez, FWIW.

Fingers crossed that Admin listens. I understand their initial impulse  it's extra work, let's face it  but it's worthwhile work. Especially if they're doing it to "unify" to 4" screens and throttled mobile plans which Fingers double-crossed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's also the fact that different Subs with different focuses have different Must-Have CSS features.

A lot of my Subs are activist/non-profit oriented and we like hyping them for awareness and support. We use drop-down menus. Otherwise we'd have to triage many deserving non-profit groups or make them get lost in 4" of lists. So for us, drop-downs are a must-have. For many other Subs, understandably, it'd be deferrable. CSS gives freedom for each Sub to decide which features are must-have without dragging all of us into a lowest-common-denominator funnel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is an *amazing* post describing what CSS is, why it's important and why Admin should continue working so CSS is supported going forward. Amazing job, /u/Mlahk7!

Do you mind if we link to it for our announcement supporting /r/ProCSS? It's a work of art.

I'm pretty sure /r/NSALeaks will be going forward with a META post supporting ProCSS and I have two pending ModMails for /r/Privacy   /r/Privacytoolsio to ensure we have consensus (I'm betting, Hell Yes)

PS: We use drop-down menus for NSALeaks which are a gods-send for sites   subs we like but don't want 4" of clutter. That's another key CSS element we'll lose, for those reading. 

PPS: Do you have a **kitty** for your ModMail icon? *Awwww!*  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have deep concerns that dragging everything down to the lowest common denominator that a 4" screen can support will kill the experience for web users. Just a few Subs off the top of my head are /r/Diablo, /r/ASOIAF, almost all the gaming and SciFi Subs, etc.

Animations, custom palettes, graphics, etc., add character and it'd be a shame to throw away these simply so multi-tasking, borderline ADD-diagnosed commuters will be assured they're not missing anything special.

There are also functional CSS features that are unlikely to survive.

So, please consider keeping two tracks, one for the 4" screen folks and one for those that use Reddit on larger, more capable screens.

Thanks!

*Edit:* OMGosh, drop down menus. I didn't realize our drop-down menus were CSS features until a fellow Mod informed me. DROP-DOWN MENUS. Seriously, we'll want to die without these.

/u/Mlahk7, one of the Mods for /r/FinalFantasy, has [an amazing post describing how CSS makes their Sub fantastic](https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/67508m/meta_admins_have_announced_that_they_will_be/). Well worth visiting.

There's also r/ProCSS. Please visit, join   participate to show support continuing using CSS for your Subs! </TEXT>
