	<TITLE> [Spoilers]John Green - Paper Towns is one of the very few books I decided not to finish </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 00:46:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love young adult fiction, but this book has both the central characters so underdeveloped that I cringe reading it. I have no problem with undeveloped charachters provided the book does not take itaelf seriously.  John Green tried to shove the ' friends since kids and love was always there around the corner 'trope down my throat. The superawesome girl flees home and its upto the dorky childhood destined lover to save her, while she leaves literary and pop clues for him to find her out. I cant take it anymore. Guys please share ur thoughts if you have read it. Last year I read ' The sky is everywhere' and 'All the bright places' and I loved them, so I did know what I was signing up for, but this I couldnt take. Or if you want to tell about a book that made you puke, you are welcome too. </TEXT>

Edit - I mean with respect to the story. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, saw this movie yesterday. I highly recommend it if you like stylish action movies. Its one of Luc Besson's early movies but all the signature notes are there. Has a great 80's background score too and he has used it lavishly. I could recognize some of the  french actors from their other movies too, Jean Reno, Jean-Hugues Anglade.
