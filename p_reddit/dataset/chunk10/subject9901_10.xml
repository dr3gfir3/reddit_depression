	<TEXT> I'm not sure why people are so upset/up-in-arms about this.  FBI Director Comey wasn't personally investigating Trump.  He was delivering briefs about the FBI's investigation.  Also, the investigation is really spear-headed by the Deputy Attorney General who took over when new Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself due to his possible connections to the Russians while involved in Trump's election campaign.

The thing we should be most concerned about is the termination of Attorney General Sally Yates...  Since she warned people of multiple people compromised by Russian intel services, and was repeatedly ignored.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True.  There are protections... but sometimes Reddit names cause IT guys to panic, such as /r/AskFeminists, /r/KingOftheKill, or even /r/MoviePosterPorn and /r/EarthPorn.

The alarms went off when "porn" was in the URL. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a lot of stuff not **guaranteed** by the constitution.  But then again, the US Constitution was written before our healthcare system was run by for profit corporations and big pharmaceutical companies were overcharging US consumers for medications.

Also, any time an uninsured person (legally in the country or not) goes to a hospital, and the hospital provides services, the costs are passed on to you, the tax payer and adequately insured person.

Technically, neither the ACA nor the AHCA actually provide or guarantee medical services, but rather insurance for coverage should you need it.  And for most healthy people, that's a big **IF**.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is true.  The AHCA passed with 217 votes.  All democrats and 20 republicans voted now.  The minimum to pass was 216, I believe, but I might be wrong on this point.

There's a big chance it will not make it. </TEXT>
