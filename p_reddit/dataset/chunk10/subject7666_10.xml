	<TEXT> Had a coworker once who was legitimately terrified about an upcoming period when she would be making more than her husband (he was between jobs, finishing his airline pilot training) and was baffled that no one else in the office cared if the woman in a relationship made more than the man. Her dad had drilled that into her head from a young age, along with a lot of other sexist crap. Everyone she asked was confused and kept saying versions of "That just means more money, so, good?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No real attempt at trimming, not a lot of luck at taming. Mostly I was going for growth to see what I'd get, and I think I'm at the point where I need a professional to work on it a bit. 

My hair is very fine and resists shaping. I wash it twice a week, use conditioner regularly and beard oil daily, and it still decides for itself what it wants to do on any given day. The mustache is still in the annoying phase where it's not long enough to go sideways past my mouth and eating anything wet is a challenge.

But I'm still enjoying the look and feel, and the reactions I get.

	<TEXT> I was a Piers Anthony fan back in the 80s when he was really hitting it big. His Xanth books were fun and funny and I started hunting out his other works. Even met him at a con and got the first Incarnations of Immortality book signed.

Only his other works started veering towards kids and sexuality until it was rare that he'd write a book that didn't include it somewhere. And the Xanth books got more and more creepy (a YA fantasy book called "The Color of Her Panties"? Really?) and now I can't read any of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a little torn on these.

I don't think any of them match Parker in his prime. But some of them seem to me to be comparable to Parker's later books when the text was getting bigger and the page margins wider.

Ace Atkins' Spenser books seem to be getting better. The dialogue mostly works, he gets the elements required for every Spenser book, and the plots aren't bad. I do feel a little weird when he reveals anything about Spenser's or Hawk's past, like it's not really his to talk about, but he hasn't done anything out of character.

Reed Farrel Coleman's Jesse Stone books don't work as well for me. If I had read them first, they'd probably be just fine as mystery novels, but he doesn't hit the tone and characterization I'm expecting and he seems set on making big changes to that world.

I haven't caught up on the Cole   Hitch books yet so I can't discuss Robert Knott's books, but I'd love to hear what people think about them.

(If you haven't read any of these, what do you think about new authors taking over for deceased ones?) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is one of you shy, or uncertain about how to proceed? If it's her, go with missionary. If it's him, go with her on top. 

But if neither of you are particularly shy and you're both comfortable with each other,  consider the male sitting up and the female sitting on him. She controls the penetration, gravity can help her, and in that position she won't be taking all of him which might be a way to ease into things. Also that way you're still face to face and you both have both hands free. (And LOTS of foreplay and/or lube is your very best friend.)

If it's the first time for either or both of you, remember: you'll get better, it takes time to learn what to do, what the other person needs/wants, and how to make it better. And nothing has to stop just because the guy finished. Fingers and tongues keep right on working. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on the book. 

Most books I read in gulps, sentence by sentence or even paragraph by paragraph if its particularly dull exposition. If a book is especially good or the writer has a way with language, I'll slow down and savor it. Also if it's complex and I need to move slowly to understand it, and even then it's pretty fast.

Nonfiction books I read more slowly, for comprehension and retention.

I read a lot. But I don't see it as anything to brag about or even recommend, necessarily, since for all I know a slower reader gets more out of the books they read, or they may remember details for a longer time. It works for me, and it's how I've read for almost 50 years so it's unlikely I'll be changing anytime soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After 30+ years of loyal fanboy comics-reading, I finally stopped following characters wherever they went about a decade ago. I got tired of the regular reboots and retcons. I got tired of having to buy several more comics a week to keep up with my favorites. I got tired of the insult to my intelligence and sloppy story-telling of huge events that always ended with big changes and at least one shocking death that would last maybe a year. 

My last holdout was Spider-Man and that stopped dead for me with "One New Day." Clearly there was no point in getting invested in any history or relationships when they could all go away if an editor didn't like them. DC was just as bad later when the New52 decided no one could be happy or married, ever. Bye, all those books, too. 

Since then I've been following writers and artists I like instead, and comics that are self-contained. 

But I have to assume the Big Two aren't stupid. Big events MUST make enough money and bring in new readers to keep wanting to do them, right?

What do you think would happen if Marvel and DC allowed the monthly books to develop their own story arcs without getting yanked into big crossover events for five years or so? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Superman: Red Son" was a three-part "hey, what if" story that didn't touch the regular Superman series or character at all. 

The HydraCap thing has been going on for a year now in regular continuity. That's Steve Rogers, doing and saying these things, for whatever reason. 

We know the "real" one will be back, likely in time for the next big movie. We're not stupid or new at this. And when it's said and done, it might be a worthwhile story. 

But in the meantime, it's not making us like Steve very much and Marvel and isn't handling the backlash very well. 

How will he deal with his actions when he's back? Or, worse, will the whole thing get hand-waved away? 

Then there's the dismissiveness toward real-world atrocity. We only won WWII because of a Cosmic Cube? This isn't the Kree-Skrull war or the superhero registration Civil War, this is talking about a very real, very horrible event that Marvel is using as a plot device at a time when the real Holocaust is being denied and minimized. 

If Clinton (or even Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio) were president, it wouldn't be as bad. If it had been a 3-issue "What If?" story it would probably win awards. But a story dragging on this long that makes fans hate their favorite character? Just no, not for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife fell and broke her wrist very badly a few years ago. The doctor came to the hospital in the middle of the night to operate and put in a brace, we were very appreciative of his work. Paid the deductible, all good.

Turns out the doc was a jerk who didn't want to be bothered after he sweeps in and saves the day, and wouldn't recommend her for therapy, told her that doing housework would get it back in shape. (We heard horror stories about him after that, he was great initially but HATED followup care and ducked it when he could.) After a month she realized she could barely move it so she found therapy anyway, which insurance wouldn't cover because the doc hadn't prescribed it. 

Fast-forward another few months and she realizes it's not straightened the way it was supposed to and she can't bend her hand back without pain. Went to another doc -- had a hell of a time finding one that would go against a fellow doctor -- and discovered the brace in her wrist was too high and was blocking movement so she had to get more surgery. Insurance didn't want to cover that at all since it was "elective."

There followed weeks of arguing, with us (and the second doctor) fighting to get it approved. Finally did, but damn. </TEXT>

You could also try sites like Model Mayhem where models will often meet you for TF shots (trade for prints, trade for digital images, etc). You don't pay them, they don't pay you, you both get practice and images for your portfolios. Keep in mind that you still may not get offers or acceptances if the portfolio you post isn't good yet, and there are a lot of flakes on both sides of the camera in there. And not every model or photographer listed there will do TF shots. But I've also made some friends and gotten some great shots that way that led to paying work, sometimes with the same model I shot for free earlier. </TEXT>

(One thing I did like was his style. When they could show it, his moves were effortless and smooth, anticipatory. But that was more apparant in the early episodes, and nearly abandoned later on.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's hard to tell if the total story arc is actually good or bad before it's finished. It's pretty easy to judge individual books, or how you feel about the last six months. I don't know about you, but I don't read a book and go huh, I wonder if I'll think this is good a year from now. I might feel differently about it in context when the full thing is done, but right now I'm reacting to individual stories as they come out because that's how monthly comics work. 

If they're upset about people judging them on unfinished stories, perhaps they should have waited and released the whole thing in one or two big books. 

But my complaint isn't about the books, really. I'm not a fan of this storyline and I think no matter how good the finished product is, they've done a lot of damage to the character's brand and their own. But I also recognize there are a lot of readers who like it. Fair enough. 

My complaint is Marvel and its people telling me how I should react to a piece of art.  </TEXT>

 Then, there was this.

I caught her whipping her head back and forth laughing. When I saw it in the camera display later I figured it was ruined but didn't delete it. When I got home and looked, I liked it better than the "good" ones.

	<TEXT> I believe you are honest and sincere. You also need to talk to a lot more people and not just online.

 There is no sole definition of Homosexual Pride day, that I know of. 

I can tell you the sole reason for the Gay Pride March. The first one was in 1970, a year after the Stonewall Riot when LGBTQ persons rioted after a police raid on the Stonewall Inn in Greenwich Village. It was held despite strenuous objection from NYC. After that, the decision was made to hold it every year "in order to be more relevant, reach a greater number of people, and encompass the ideas and ideals of the larger struggle in which we are engaged-that of our fundamental human rights."

 There is a large amount of Homosexuals on the internet, and they're never shamed...

Wow. I honestly don't know how to respond to that, in the same way I wouldn't know how to politely respond to someone who assured me, sincerely, that the earth was flat.

All I would say is to go find any YouTube video posted by a gay person and read the comments. Or find a Twitter feed of a gay person and read the stuff sent to them. Or ask any gay person with a strong online presence to send you copies of their email. Or google "homophobic harassment online" and read for awhile.

Is it better than it was? In many ways, yes. Gays can marry. Public harassment of them is considered bad now, for most people. Many famous people are publicly gay and still have a career.

But the anonymity of the Internet allows harassment and abuse and there is an awful lot of it. You're basing your very sincere, I-just-want-to-know questions on an assumption that simply isn't true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some charter schools perform as well or better. Some perform markedly worse. Some destabilize existing nearby public schools. [Some turn out students who perform better on standardized tests but have much lower success rates in the job market](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2016/08/23/charter-schools-boost-test-scores-nothing-else/D6F7vTwLTqYnBJyeupoODK/story.html). Some are outright scams. 

I'm not against charter schools per se. I think that run properly with priority for the students over the bottom line, they can be incredibly useful. I am against draining public schools to fund them. I am against charter schools operating without the accountability and transparency that public schools have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "It" being...?

Homosexuality? No. Everything about humans is and always has been a curve, and there will always be people all along that line. There is very little about a human being that is either/or and a lot of grief has come about through the years from people insisting that there is.

The need for a pride parade? I think that when it really doesn't matter to the vast majority of people who you have sex with, then the need for a gay pride parade will fade away. By that point I could see it evolving into a general woo-hoo-sex day like some other cultures have, just from tradition. </TEXT>

**The Language of Rumiulf /umiulf/**

*...and he stood holding his hat and turned his wet face to the wind....*

**Pronunciation:** /k ug al ut d us k ut fz jd zll t i/

**Narrow pronunciation:** [ ug al ut d us  ut fz jd zll t ji]

**Rumiulf structure:** and he stood his hat holding and his wet face turned the wind to



Along with a page of pulmonic consonants, syllable structures, a vowel chart, simple grammar, and a couple-hundred-word lexicon.

	<TEXT> DeVos wants to pull funding away from public education and funnel it toward charter schools. There is no evidence that charter schools are any more successful than public schools overall, and in many cases they have been harmful. DeVos and her family have fought hard to reduce oversight and accountability for charter schools in Michigan. The New York Times reported that she had told a meeting of Christian philanthropists in 2001 that education reform was a way to "advance God's kingdom." 

She is not an educator. Prior to her posting she had never set foot in a public school. She knows nothing about running a school, running a school board, running a school district. She's a lobbyist with an agenda and she's been given the keys.

	<TEXT> You can be inclined to disagree all you like. Doesn't make it so. I'm pretty sure the 49 gay people killed in the Pulse nightclub shooting last year might disagree. 

[Attacks and hate crimes against LGBT people have been increasing](http://fusion.net/it-s-still-dangerous-to-be-gay-in-america-here-are-the-1793857468). 

There are lots of people still upset that gays can marry here. Our current vice-president is in favor of abusive anti-gay therapy. Our current Justice Department has removed protections from transgender people already. Gender identity has been removed from the U.S. Census. Much of the current administration has advocated against and/or voted against gay rights advances.

Evangelical Christianity has risen dramatically in Brazil, where hate crimes against gays have been skyrocketing in recent years. Indonesian officials are trying to ban homosexuals from holding office and there are bills in the works to criminalize it. In Nigeria recent laws have all but encourage violence against gay people. And that's not counting the Middle Eastern countries, or the anti-gay movement in Russia, or the concentration camps in Chechnya...

I would suggest you ask some gay people how safe they feel, how easy it is to get a job or rent an apartment. It is MUCH better than it was, but things are not equal. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Amazing Johnathan is touring again: still amazing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-30 19:24:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Amazing Johnathan was told that due to his cardiomyopathy, he had 18 months to live. His heart was unable to get blood through his system. His hands and legs would lock up periodically, which as he said is not the best thing for a magician. He performed his last show at the Magic Castle and retired. 

That was three years ago. 

Now apparently he's gotten tired of waiting to die and he's out on the road again, and I saw him Friday night at the Orlando Improv.

Which excited the hell out of me. I loved his specials and appearances but never thought I'd get to see him. I saw his poster by accident when I was at Pointe Orlando and walked past the Improv. I was messaging a friend at the time and sent him a picture; found out he was an even bigger fan and he had bought tickets for himself before I had reached my car.

The Amazing Johnathan is a bit smaller now than his larger-than-life persona used to be. Skin hangs a little looser. He doesn't move as wildly or abruptly. He doesn't stalk his volunteers around the stage the way he did (granted, this was a tiny stage). Most of the way through his act he stepped offstage to sit and rest for a bit while his wife took over and stuck a skewer through her arm, to music. The man has clearly been through some shit and is still slogging through it now. Most (not all) of his act were jokes I'd already seen over and over on his specials.

And damn me if I didn't laugh just as hard seeing them again.

His timing is *perfect*. That damn eyebrow glare gets me every time. The jokes are set up beautifully, he is in total control of the flow of the volunteer segment, and when the obnoxious drunks who had interfered with the previous two comedians started acting up he ignored them magnificently and rolled right over them. He had the room in his pocket from the beginning.

He did start off with an acknowledgement of his condition. "So if I fall to the stage it's not a joke. *Help me*." And then he laughed.

He looked very tired after, while fans were buying shirts and DVDs and his wife took pics of him with everyone. 

But onstage, he was Amazing.

This is just the beginning of his tour so if you get the chance, run do not walk and go see him. And remember those wise words: "Sometimes magic sounds a lot like tape." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Quantum Night" by Robert J. Sawyer. 

It's a lightweight book. Many of Sawyer's works tend to follow a similar pattern: he comes up with an intriguing idea about consciousness or something, and then contrives a plot to give his characters the chance to thoroughly explore it. Characters are almost always Canadian scientists or professors, and a large number of them are massive Star Trek fans in a way that's integral to the plot.

(Not putting him down here, I like his work and some of it is completely unlike this, but enough of them are to indicate a trend.)

In "Quantum Night" he looks at sociopaths, unconscious sentient people, and conscious conscientious people, and the scientists who discover how to switch people from state to state. I was reading this back at the beginning of the last presidential campaign, and that was really the wrong time to read about rising levels of fascism, fear-based ruling, and people lacking empathy but possessing a great deal of cunning. "Quantum Night" stayed with me for weeks after I finished. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By the same logic, Breast Cancer Awareness Month should be changed to Disease Awareness Month. All disease is bad and we should be working to eliminate all of them, yes? 

Feminism doesn't represent the equality of all genders. Feminism addresses a specific range of problems that affect women and their place in the workplace, law and society. People who consider themselves feminists have chosen that range of issues to work on. Doesn't mean other issues aren't as important, doesn't even mean that other gender bias issues aren't as important. But you have to pick your battles and the more specific you can be, the more effective you are. 

Besides, forcing feminists to subsume their issues into a larger, generalized heading is to minimize them, make them invisible again, which is kind of a big part of what they're fighting against. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very good article. Something that wasn't touched on, though, is that stories that strike at the core of who a beloved character is are always going to be controversial, even without Nazis.

When Spider-Man was revealed to have been his clone all along, fans went nuts and deservedly so. Even though Ben Reilly was (then) just as good a guy as Peter, even though according to the comics everything we'd experienced happening to Peter "really" happened to Ben, fans revolted at the idea and it was quickly revealed that no, whoops, didn't carry the two, it was really Peter.

Same with Gwen Stacy's kids with Norman Osbourne. Aside from being a terrible story, it changed Gwen Stacy into someone who would have an affair with a much older (and sociopathic) man while still with Peter. Fans... were not pleased.

Then there's neck-snapping Superman in the movies...

It's not just adding layers and depths to characters, it's when comics creators decide to screw with the characters' natures in ways that they can't come back from. In this case, Secret Empire might be an amazing story, but it may not be worth the hit that Captain America will take, both in comics as he comes to grips with the memories of all this and in pop culture as fans try to come to terms with their beloved character's intriguing new fascism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't see people stranded or walking along the highway nearly as much anymore.

Time was it was a regular thing to see people stuck beside their smoking cars, or walking along the interstate with tired expressions and kids in tow. Now if people are waiting they're usually talking to someone with no expectation of being stuck longer than it takes a friend or roadside assistance to arrive. </TEXT>

Personally I like it when people fly the Confederate flag. Saves me no end of time wondering if I should avoid them or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the lack of condemnation argument doesn't work for me. Absence of condemnation on events that have been blown out of proportion does not mean those actions are condoned or accepted. (Speaking of the first two, haven't heard about the third so can't comment.) 

I'd say that while the obnoxious actions of the woman in the "Big Red incident" may give you a strident feminist to point out, the constant attacks and doxxing on her prove that for every one woman who gets noticed there are thousands of idiot men willing to prove why feminism is needed. And I can't feel sorry for the panelists at the "UMASS incident" since Milo would be hugely disappointed if he DIDN'T get powerful reactions. That's kind of his thing.

	<TEXT> The other comments are handling the technical options nicely, so I'll just add: don't jiggle the camera. Get a sharp focus, and then either use a remote shutter or set the timer and step away. A tripod alone doesn't guarantee perfectly steady shots.

You should also try to get your pictures when the moon is still close to the horizon. The higher up it gets, the more direct sunlight it gets (no matter what phase it's in) and it's tougher to get good details.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thing is, the exact same figures could be explained by people not wanted to publicly identify as feminists because there has been such a concentrated effort by some people to paint feminists as man-hating bitches. 

"I believe that despite what feminists say "feminism" is, an increasing majority of people do not consider feminism to be promoting of either equality nor inclusiveness." If feminists aren't being taken at their word as to what they want, whose fault is it? Theirs? Or the people who insist on declaring them to be evil? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then you're working from a self-selecting set. You don't know what percentage of people you encounter are feminists, you only know how many tell you they are, and I'd need to know more about your encounters to know if you're an unbiased judge. If your encounter involved you ranting at them and they got huffy back, then yeah, your experience with feminists is going to be pretty bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, the CBS All Access app hasn't been working well for me for six months now. It's the one app I use that reliably crashes my Roku every single time I try watching anything on it. I get about 10 solid minutes and then it's crash, reboot, resume, crash, reboot, resume...

Removing and reinstalling hasn't helped, thinking about a factory reset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how many marchers really think that President Trump and the politicians seeking to slash funding for research, gut the EPA or back away from climate change legislation are going to suddenly change their minds because of a bunch of people made funny signs.

But what the march does accomplish is demonstrate how many voters feel very strongly about this. It undermines Trump   Co's position that all Americans agree with them. It lets corporations know that lobbying to get changes made that are anti-science and profitable will be noticed and pointed out. 

These marches demonstrate, over and over, that delegitimizing science will not be ignored and will not be normalized. 

But one of the biggest benefits of the march is for the people marching. People who have been discouraged, outraged or terrified at the constant, every-single-day bad news coming out of the White House can be at least reassured that there are many, many other people who agree with them. It's cathartic. It's therapeutic. It brings hope that this energy can be carried forward to the next elections where it can make some real change. And in that, it was an unqualified success.  </TEXT>
