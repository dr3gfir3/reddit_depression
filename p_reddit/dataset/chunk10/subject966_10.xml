	<TEXT> This story is about my cousin Chris.

On April 1st, 1964, the plane that Chris Finkbeiner was piloting crashed shortly after takeoff. Finkbeiner, who just six years earlier, had run against Orvil Faubus (the guy that opposed the Little Rock Nine with the National Guard) for the governorship of Arkansas, was a well known figure, but as you might expect, so was his wife.

Not knowing of her husband's death, she went shopping.  While she was shopping the story broke on the news.  The cashier recognized her and said, "I am so sorry to hear about your husband's death!" Thinking it was an April Fool's joke, it took her hours to comprehend that the news was real.

From the New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/02/2-die-in-arkansas-air-crash.html?_r=0

Fun fact: Chris Finkbeiner was also the inventor of the cheese dog
