	<TEXT> If Kennedy steps down and Trump replaces him, we are doomed for the foreseeable future. There are more than a few justices who are getting old and want to retire. Ginsburg wanted to retire, but Obama talked her out of it because he knew he would never get a replacement through congress.

	<TEXT> This part of the whole thing is amazing to me. It's the most unprofessional thing I've seen the White House do so far. It's actually just bizarre, but I can imagine Trump screaming that they have to do it NOW, and them trying to tell him he needs to fire Comey in person, but he won't listen. I wonder which one of his aliases leaked it to Fox News before Comey even knew? 

I cannot even fathom the level of ignorance and petulance and stupidity of people who would do this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was watching a video from a woman who sells erotic romance on Amazon and she says she has no problem getting them written or .01 a word. I know only one person who writes them, and they are absolute crap. She knows they are absolute crap, but she says she can crank one out in less than a day and she has never had a rewrite request. The woman who sells them says the first one she got back was horrible, but she put it up on Amazon, and people bought it for $2.99. I equate this to those horrid little Harlequin romance novels people used to eat up like candy. 

Personally, I could not be responsible for flooding the market with crap books and taking advantage of people so bored with their life that they would pay $2.99 for them over and over again, but if your only goal is to make money, I guess that's one way to do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're taking it all too seriously. What I find is that the better writers who have done high-end writing, or are seriously educated, tend to not be able to dumb themselves down to content mill level. I was one of those for a long time, fighting to increase the standards of content mill work. Now I just crank it out. Seriously, like /u/workathomewriter says, it's mostly just rewriting the first good link you find. 

After doing this for 9 years, I would never submit a free article to a website in an application. That just screams scam right there. They probably take those 2,000 word articles, break them up into 4 or 5 shorter articles and sell them for $50 apiece to their clients. 

And you just wasted a lot of time writing this long post. If you're going to make it in content mill world, I'd say you are going to have to understand what they are and how to make money on them at 3 to 5 CPW. You have to learn to crank out work quickly, and screw the quality. They want stuff written to an 8th grade level. 

If you take yourself and your writing this seriously, I'd suggest writing on spec at Constant Content where you can charge whatever you want, but first, read a few online articles from not-so-intellectual sites so you can learn that what most website owners (99% of whom are affiliate marketers) want is crap. Cheap crap with keywords that make them money. Trying to produce quality work is a waste of time, and intellectualizing content mill writing is a waste of your brain.  </TEXT>

What has happened (read something about this the other day) is that right-wing media and right-wing pundits have been using the word "liberal" in a negative way for so long, that it is a curse word to the right now. Actually, most dems aren't liberals. Liberals are to the left of strict democrats and to the right of socialists. Bernie is a liberal. Schumer is a democrat. God only knows what Nancy Pelosi and Hillary are. They are hybrid creatures of another God.

BTW, right-wing media did that on purpose. "Liberal" is one of their buzzwords that has been repeated so much it is now used as a weapon. "Libtards, Lefties, Leftists" are other words they use over and over to make dems look bad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ADDICTION isn't a choice, but whether you give in to it is a choice. Some people are strong enough to fight it, some aren't. I've been to AA meetings, in fact, I was a member of Al-Anon for 30 years. Like I said, everyone in my family was/is addicted to either alcohol or drugs. Nobody ever held them down and forced alcohol and drugs on them, and they all quit several times, so yes, it's a choice. Some people choose to not give in to the addiction, some choose to stay addicted. I didn't say it was an easy choice, but it's still a choice. When you're sitting there with that bottle of beer or shot of liquor in your hand, it's your choice whether to drink it. Your body may be saying you "need" it, but it's still your choice. If it wasn't, there wouldn't be an AA. They make that choice every day NOT to drink, or to give in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It also depends on what they are writing. Technical writing pays way more, and marketing copy pays way more. I have a friend who writes sales copy and she makes six figures working basically 20-30 hours a week. Of course, you have to be really good and get results. I know SEO writers who can draw in traffic like mad who make almost as much. 

Of course, there are also those who, like you, consider 10 CPW "a good rate" and will never ask for more. Let me just give you one example of how asking for what you are worth can work. One friend was working through a bidding site for 2 CPW writing quick little 400 words articles. She decided that wasn't enough, so she told the client she could no longer write them, because she was raising her rate to 5 CPW. He immedately told her he would pay her  price, and not much later raised it to 7 CPW. When she finally did quit because she just couldn't think of anything else to write on the topic, he told her his budget was 10 CPW. If she had asked for 10 CPW when she raised her rates the first time, he would have paid it.

The thing about asking for what you are worth is that you will have to bid more or market yourself more or try harder to get jobs, but it's like every other job. There are fewer employers paying that rate, but it's worth holding out. 

The key is not to tell anyone you are working for less to keep the lights on. Clients know that. They aren't stupid, but they also know that they get what they pay for. Some don't care about quality, just traffic. They open hundreds of crap sites and stick up crap copy loaded with keywords and ads. They work in volume. Then there are those clients who create quality sites and want quality copy. They are looking for expert status. These are the ones you want to work for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, we need to define "ignorant asshole?" Got it. 

Some of it would be easy, though. Recreational addicts vs. those addicted due to pain or injury. There would be a trail to follow to find out which is which. 

The hardest would be all the "subjective disorders," like fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, etc., since there is a complete cottage industry of doctors recommending disability for people who don't really need it. I'm not saying those are fake disorders, because I have lupus, so I get both as a package deal. The problem is, you can't prove or disprove lupus or any of it's many adjunct disorders. It's a subjective diagnosis. 

I'd hate to see people like me denied coverage because some disability-mill doctor is giving out diagnoses right and left. That's a hard one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So maybe if I segregate them from the actual personal posts, they might not annoy the regular readers who expect my personal touch so much. Or maybe if I do small ones stuck into the middle of a personal post, much like I do images now. I'll see what is available and see if there is a way I can use them.

For example, I do a post every month on what to do in the garden that month. It has tables with lists of things. Maybe replace those with infographics of those things instead for the more visual people, while the rest of the post is still very personal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe so. Maybe I'm wrong. I'm just stating how I feel about the entire scenario. I don't have solutions. I'll give you an analogy I can understand, though. It's like killing insects in your garden. If you look at a plant and see a whole lot of aphids and a whole lot of red and black bugs, you'd think you need to get rid of them all. The truth is, the red and black bugs are probably ladybug larvae that are eating the aphids. Kill them all and the aphids come back, but now there are no ladybug larvae to eat them, so they kill the plants. It's hard to tell the good from the bad sometimes. Say there is a vet who is also addicted to painkillers because of injuries he received overseas during a war. Do you lump him in with all the street junkies who just like to get high simply because he's an addict? 

Also, in my scenario (and this is something I have considered) a shitton of Native Americans would not get health care because of alcohol and drug addiction, so catch 22. </TEXT>

Here's a whole page that defines addiction in detail. Read and learn. All addictions have the same characteristics in common that separate them from compulsions.

	<TEXT> I don't know the solution. I just know we can't keep paying through the nose for people who destroy their own lives. Where does it end? There isn't enough money in the world to set this to rights. I was watching a video just yesterday of some radio show (I forget which), where a self-professed "welfare queen" called in to say why should she work when the government would take care of her? Also, she made the point that if she worked, all her money would go to child care. What do we do about that? She knows she can get cared for, that her kids can get cared for, that they all have medical care, but me -- I didn't have medical care for 9 years, first due to pre-existing conditons and then because my state didn't expand Medicaid. She also had a husband who didn't work except to pay for his own bad habits (alcohol   cigarettes). Why do they get medical care when I, who have done nothing wrong and worked most of my life, can't? Hell, the crackhead next door to me gets disability, housing vouchers and food stamps, and he's still doing crack and begging me for food when he sells his food stamps for crack and can't eat. I refuse to feed him. This is what I'm suggesting we do to them. Just stop feeding them -- stop feeding their addictions. Yes, people will die, but maybe -- just maybe -- people like me won't. And yes, I think I deserve to live more than he does. If that makes me hateful, then I'm hateful, but that's what I truly believe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do. My genes make me an addict. Right now, I'm addicted to sugar. I ate a whole bag of jelly beans yesterday, telling myself the whole time to throw them out and not eat them. No, it's not liquor or heroin, but it's just as much an addiction, and I fight it every day. I am also addicted to the internet. When the web goes down, as it sometimes does, I go insane. I mean really insane. I can't stand the thought of being disconnected. I'm also addicted to gardening. I can't stop. I used to be so bad when I had more space that I would end up giving away literal pickup truck loads of plants, and still had too many. I'm also addicted to television, to the detriment of my work life. I work at home, and I have not made a single penny in the past week because of watching t.v. and being on reddit. Now Sense8's new season just came out, and I will spend my entire weekend watching it. I can't stop. I try to, but I can't. 

I get just as high from these things as you do from drugs or alcohol or whatever you are addicted to, and they all affect my life and relationships negatively, but I can't stop. I count myself blessed that I'm not addicted to alcohol and drugs like everyone else in my family -- or food, like my nephew, who died from pancreatic cancer from diabetes caused by his weight, which was over 400 lbs., but I still know what it's like to get up every day and VOW to myself that "today, I'm going to work. I'm not going to watch t.v." and then fail at that over and over and over. I swear to myself every day I'm not going on reddit, but I do over and over and over. I swear to myself I'm not eating sugar, and I do over and over and over. Sometimes I feel so out of control and helpless, so yes, I do understand addiction. My husband was a drug addict and alcoholic. I watched him struggle. I watched my mother and father struggle. I walked away from my alcoholic drug-addicted sister because I couldn't stand to see one more person die from that disease. 

Will my addictions kill me? Maybe the sugar addiction. My grandmother, who didn't drink, died of liver cancer. The doctor said it was from eating too much sugar. You see, it isn't the alcohol that kills your liver. Your body burns that off very quickly. It's the sugar.

	<TEXT> So could we at least agree that a life-long alcoholic with liver disease could be denied coverage while someone who has gotten liver disease because their irresponsible asshole husband went out and screwed a prostitute who gave them Hep C should be covered? Should we punish their child born with Hep C due to his irresponsible behavior? 

The children are the ones that keep me awake at night. How do we punish a child for being born with a genetic condition because her parents chose to ignore the warning markers before they got pregnant? How do we deny coverage to crack babies, who are born addicted through no fault of their own? 

I don't want to punish people, especially not children, but I don't want to reward people for bad behavior either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be totally honest here, without purposely sounding insensitive, I happen to know that people can get on disability due to the damage that something like alcoholism or drug addiction has done to their bodies, and a great many of them use those disability checks to carry on with their bad habits. I know addiction is a disease (grew up in an alcoholic family), but it's a disease you have control over if you want to. You don't have to drink or do drugs. I know the compulsion is strong, and it's a tough choice, but when it comes down to it, it's still a choice. My entire family are alcoholics, but I'm not. I have every bad gene they ever could have passed down but I CHOSE not to drink to excess and I CHOSE not to smoke myself to an early grave like a lot of my relatives did. I CHOSE not to eat like a pig and end up at 300 lbs. dying of heart disease. I've never understood why the government rewards bad behavior. I guess the same could be said about women who have child after child with multiple men just to get more welfare. 

I'm not stupid. I know all the excuses these people give and I know that I sound insensitive to some people, but if I'm going to be a fucking asshole, it will be to someone who made the choice to ruin their body and not to a child who is born with a bad heart or some other disease, or someone who has diseases commonly associated with aging, such as arthritis or heart and lung problems, that were NOT caused by an irresponsible lifestyle. There has to be a line somewhere that needs to be solid and bright and that people are aware that crossing it may cause you to have no medical care if you proceed to ruin your body. When do we get to say "no?" without being called hateful and mean and any other list of horrible adjectives?

And this is why my friends call me a demopublican. Sometimes I thinks dems have just blinded themselves to common fucking sense. They sometimes remind me of those kids who will do anything to be popular, even if it goes against every form of logic. </TEXT>

Sociopaths just think the rules don't apply to them. They are usually very disorganized. Malignant narcissists are more dangerous, because they may appear disorganized, but everything they do has a purpose. They are vengeful and literally get off on watching those they consider enemies suffer. ETA: Which in Trump's case is more than half of the American public who did not vote for him.
