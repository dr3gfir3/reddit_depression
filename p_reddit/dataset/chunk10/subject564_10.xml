	<TEXT> We've kept it for now. Thinking about framing it! Not sure if you read my previous comments but I was cleaning the space to create a music venue and we've built a theme around the 'Mummy Cat'.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the thoughts. It was a dry/old shed. Most likely undisturbed for at least 3-5 years, maybe more. 

We cleared out the space to make a DIY music venue. We had our first show last night and decided to call the space Mummy Cat Lounge.  </TEXT>
