	<TEXT> Yes, when you are under contract there is no denying you MUST get it done. You dont want to get a bad reputation in the publishing industry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also met my natural mother was I was 18, and recently had to cut ties with her. She was a very toxic presence in my life. Like my ex-husband, she is also a con artist and moves around living off people with malicious intent. Was good to shed her! Sadly, I never got to meet my natural dad. I was told he died in a car accident but recently found out it was suicide. He parked in front of a church and plugged up the tailpipe. I mourned the man I never knew, sad that I didnt have the chance to know him.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oooh, you toughie Kristina! Well, there is that old saying you know "I like having written." This is true! The thing I like least about writing is how LONG it takes. I love SPEED in all things - reading, writing, biking, etc. But writing a full length novel is NOT instant gratification. The quickest book I wrote actually was Joshua and the Arrow Realm. I did it in 4 months and it was the tightest first draft ever. I brought everything I learned to writing it in one punch. It was also under contract so i HAD to write fast!  </TEXT>
