	<TEXT> We don't need to pander to them.

But it is easier than passing pro-business AND socially conscious legislative, which what you need if you want small businesses or other companies to take over their market share.

Left has problem with pro-busyness  and right has problem with socially conscious part. So we usually end up with mishmash that does neither.

For all saints pull your head out of your ass Corbyn! Nobody gives a shit about your 80s left agenda! People want to know if you can solve this clusterfuck  not if you will man the picket line.

Your party got fucked, how many times now? Three times in last three elections. Communal, commons, Scotland, Even blind could see that your approach is not working. 

So for once, do what is right for your country, I know you don't like it much anyway but whatever, and start talking about stuff people actually care about.

Or you can kiss parliament opposition goodbye and prepare for half decade of unrestrained Tory rule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually energy boom is a good time to build.
Just like in times when economy is booming you should reduce deficit so you can prop up economy when times are tough.

Sure we have enough energy now, but stuff can and WILL happen that can change that. What if, for example, several large transformers across continent were destroyed by terrorist attack or computer virus messing up their control boards, in that case the energy market would collapse and local grids would be on their own.

If that happened the last thing you need is unstable and unreliable energy source like wind or solar. The transformers are not exactly easy to come by and take long to manufacture. Most countries have barely enough to run their grid even now.

	<TEXT> Laffer Curve is bullshit. The underlying idea IS sound however. If you tax people too much it will break them.

The problem comes when globalization becomes a factor. When corporations can move around the globe easily, looking for place with lowest taxes and weak governments, the curve is deformed.

Opposite effect happens if you run a good redistribution scheme, with industry incentives, social safety net, healthcare, research and education investment. 

So all things said and taken into account. One should take the curve as a concept not as a gospel. A general rule rather than natural law.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the moment you're old enough to pay tax, you should be able to vote.

So five year old child should be able to vote after buying a candy bar using money from selling lemonade? Because VAT is a tax you know.

And if VAT doesn't count we should probably take voting rights from those who don't pay other taxes.

Unemployed people don't contribute to budget so they can't possible have anything to say./s

And what about 16 year olds living with their parents, with no income and independence? These probably shouldn't vote, because they don't pay taxes either. Right?

	<TEXT> Reducing voting age is the worst idea ever. 

I for one am horrified with idea of people like 16-year-old-me voting.
Back then I was much more radical, I barely understood basics of economics or social services, hell I could barely file paperwork for my bank account and tax-breaks. 

People like that voting is the last thing you need. Sure old people don't share our ideals, but that is part of democracy. Changing the rules so that some people have less say in things is anti-democratic by definition.

Why not take voting rights from rich people, or neonazis, communists, union members, minorities or give two votes to "reasonable people" so that we get outcome we want?

	<TEXT> In short: European countries generally exercise greater measure of control over their citizens, in exchange for that citizens receive various benefits: universal healthcare, social safety net, work regulations, price adjustments etc.

America has many of the same institutions but never puts them in effect completely. You have social security, but it has lots of conditions and is only for some people, you have state funded healthcare, but only for poor and old people and it's underfunded, you have work regulations, but they are mostly dependent on unions doing their job, you have laws that allow your government to regulate prices of medicine, but your government chooses not to so it doesn't hurt you companies.

On the other hand, European countries restrict their citizens much more than American government. Take voters IDs, in Czech Republic it's unthinkable to vote without official id. In fact they won't let you enter the booth, nobody cares about that. And when I tell people that Americans think IDs are oppressive and a way to silence minorities they think I'm joking.

And when I say ID's I mean this:
http://www.mvcr.cz/SCRIPT/ViewImage.aspx?physid=392823 docname=OP%202012.jpg

It has signature, date of birth, picture, place of birth, sex, marital status, citizen number (basically our social security number) and number of children.

Everybody gets it when they reach age of majority and loosing it can lead to serious trouble. If policeman asks, you better show it.  Not because you have to, the law is kind of vague about that, but because if you don't you look suspicious. Since everyone else does it pretty much automatically.

I don't have to talk about free/hate speech issues, we all know what they are about.

Another example could be gun control, many countries in Europe have gone completely bonkers with that. In UK not even most police officers have guns, much less people. And there are even restrictions on knifes.

Oh and EU politicians signed a law that makes search engines remove results if people ask them to. Right to be forgotten it's called, I will give you three guesses on who uses it most. 

Hint: It's not common people. ;)


Anyway American approach is more hands off, but the trade off is that if you mess up or have bad luck you are fucked. 

This worked rather well in the past, when it didn't take much to make it big. But these days the barriers are much higher and it is much harder for people to pull themselves up by their bootstraps. 


So in conclusion, American approach got America in number one spot in the world. If America wants to keep that spot it should try something new. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously not when it comes to language, French is descendant of Latin after all. Technically it is regional dialect of Latin which diverged from original and eventually was codified as language of it's own but...
never mind.

The point is that French people and French state, are descendants of Franks and of Frankish realms. Franks were among the most Rome-friendly germanic tribes so they quickly assumed Roman identity, culture and language. It is no wonder that Franks founded first and second incarnations of Holy Roman Empire and in a way the Roman influence is seen to this day in French politics.

For example intolerance of minority languages, tendency to integrate colonies into political infrastructure of metropolitan France etc.

But nevertheless French are descendants of Franks just as Englishmen are descendants of Britons, Angles/Saxons, Scandinavians and Normans. To claim otherwise would be rather strange. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They were one of many germanic tribes, along with Franks (modern French), Longobards (modern Lombardians in Italy), Visigoths (modern Spanish) and Suebi (modern Portuguese and Spanish).

Angles and Saxons lived in north of what is today Germany, parts of Netherlands and Denmark. During migration period (commonly known as Barbarian invasions) they moved to Britain, specifically it's south east. 

Over time they mingled with local population, sometimes peacefully, sometimes violently and in the end only Wales remained in hands of native Romano-Brits.

In the end Angles and Saxons adopted identity, if not language, of people they conquered and took Romano-British customs as their own.
Few centuries later it was them who were on defensive, again from germanic tribes but this time from the north.

But that is another story. </TEXT>

Poland? Spain? Italy? Romania? 

No other country matches them in population, economic power, contribution to budget or influence.

	<TEXT> To be honest Czech President doesn't have to do as much. His job is mainly representative, American President is on the other hand head of executive branch.

We have no idea what Zeman would do if he actually had to solve some of our countrys problems instead of just commenting on them.

That being said, you are right about both of them being senile.
Trump and Zeman both display tell-tale signs of dementia: increasingly limited vocabulary, confused behavior, reliance on family/inner circle for presentation (hey Ovcacek is basically Sessions!), declining oratory skills and last but not least lack of self restraint.

The vocabulary, gestures, even the damn face and obsession with popularity and general stupidity. 

God help us all if these two guys ever meet. Because I'm pretty sure that would mean Trump getting drunk on slivovice and unlike Zeman HE HAS NUKES!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same reason Trump is/was popular in USA, he's successful businessman and keeps saying that state should be run like corporation. And people think that's a great idea.

Doesn't matter that he robbed state blind during privatization or that he was communist State Security agent. He is successful therefore he must be the right guy.

I'm not kidding, this is almost exactly what one of his supporters told me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This should be higher. 

Let's be reasonable for a while. Trumps budget failed, Trumpcare failed, "Muslim Ban" failed, his proposed tax cuts are unpopular even among Republicans in congress and a day does not pass without him shooting himself in foot.

His team of cryptofascists is already falling apart (Bannon, Gorka, Flynn) and he can hardly even speak coherently.

This is not next Hitler or even Mussolini, this is a 70 year old man, probably with Alzheimer or other form of dementia, who was never really bright and who considers Fox News and Breitbart to be legit sources of information.

He lacks mental capacity to go week without humiliating himself or implementing any policy, so I don't think it's realistic that he takes control of most powerful country on Earth, especially given the fact that his own Secretary of Defense is known for being pretty patriotic and reasonable man (with bipartisan support btw). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Positive Christianity, some party members really tried to push it but they lacked time to implement it entirely.

Basically it had Jesus as Aryan revolutionary taking power from filthy Jews.

Edit: The movement fell apart after the war, but some ideas of it remained and were subsumed by traditional anticlerical and radical religious movements in Germany. Later they reappeared in some neopagan groups but never  became religion for itself again.

Take my great-grandfather, member of Czech nationalist organization (Sokol), officer of KuK army. His son spend most of the war in Gestapo prison and returned half crippled, half of his family barely escaped gas chambers and even that only thanks to "misplaced" documents. 

I can't ask him about how he felt about all of this (he died shortly after communist coup) but I have a feeling he was not exactly happy with a way our country got fucked up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Macron is better than Le Pen, but these comments keep reminding me that comparing people to Le Pen sets the bar really, really low.

I know that he panders to domestic audience, but this is not a way to help EU in the long term. 

Sure nationalists didn't win in Netherlands and Macron will easily win French election. But let's not forget that Wilders still got more seats than ever before, socialists in Netherlands collapsed, Macrons own party is barely a year old with basically no presence in parliament and at least third of French voters think Le Pen is proper leader for their country.

Not to mention Greece still unable to get out of the mess it's in, Turkey turning into new Iran and Russians undermining democracy left and right. 

This is not some renaissance of liberal values, at least not in my book. We have soldiers on streets of major cities now and attack almost every month, this is not time for more divisions. </TEXT>
