	<TEXT> I didn't mind voiced protagonist in Fallout 4, witcher games (altought in those I didn't play my own character, more book-Geralt) and Dragon Age Inquisition. I don't think it limited my roleplay but I would prefer silent protagonist. 

And if Bethesda insists on making protagonist voiced, *please* don't take one "Default_white_male_1" and "Default_white_female_1" voices and be done with it. Either give us at least 3 different kind of voice options *or* different voice for each race. So our pompous altmer mage from summerset islands, our backwoods barbarian orc and lived-his-whole-life-in-ashstorms dunmer don't *all sound exactly the same* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the short stories starts with words along the lines "as usual, cats and children were ones to first notice him coming " as children were scared of him. I think he looks more like Witcher in the first 2 books because he is doing witchers work and thus regulary uses elixirs while in the main saga he doesn't use them that much which would explain why he doesn't look so noticeable. In the first book it is said that the elixirs is what make witchers look pale and corpse-like </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't really find a translated version anywhere so my question is, as a not native english speaker how hard it would be to understand the english in the book? I recently read LOTR in english and there were few expressions and things I had bit hard time understanding and it made reading it bit slow. I have no problem reading newer books in english.

I get that it was written in 1859  I'd imagine the english is very old? Can someone who speaks english as a second/third language maby share their experience with this particular book or other books by Charles Dickens? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never smoked cigarettes but I do smoke (small) Al Capone sweet cognac cigars now and then. First time I tried it it felt unnatural and pretty bad. But after my brother taught me how to smoke it right I actually like it (it was not peer pressure). I never got addicted to it or started smoking but now I smoke maby pack (10 cigars) or maby two a month whenever I'm out. I might take a few months break not smoking and then when I go to a bar grab a pack.

It's easy to get hooked or cheat yourself saying "I only smoke socially". So be careful on staying only on the 1. But it is possible to smoke now and then and not get addicted on it too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the message was more "some things you think are just a joke might actually be hurtful to other people. Don't be a dick and don't let other people be dicks to others" I think it's more directed to people who either bully or stand and watch at side than people who are actually being bullied.

And IMO the ending was the best part because even thought there was so many questions and stuff left open, it felt good ending to the show. Otherwise the show was kinda meh but the ending was really nice. I really wish they don't make season 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say they are. They aren't the best books ever written. They are fairly short and the first book starts kinda slowly. But there is alot of interesting things if you enjoy elder scrolls lore and I really enjoyed the characters. 

But then again, they aren't the best books ever so the plot can be bit predictable and like the top comment said, they aren't too memorable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The smoke is very subtle, but definetly there. I may not have tried 300+ whiskeys but I know what I tasted. Taste is very subjective so our experiences differ depending on our pallettes. 

Also the packaging says its "delicately smoky" </TEXT>

	<TITLE> For beginners who want to try single-malt, try out Dalwhinnie 15 year old </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's smooth, oaky, slightly smokey but not too much and suprisingly fruity (first time I tried I was suprised how well I could taste pear in it) and the best part is that it costs under 20. Great if you want to try out a single-malt but don't want to use alot of money. 

Another nice one is Talisker 10 year old but I find Dawhinnie be smoother so it's better for people who don't have much experience with whiskey. Depends on if you want smoky scotch, in which you should get Talisker IMO.

Feel free to add something if you agree or disagree </TEXT>
