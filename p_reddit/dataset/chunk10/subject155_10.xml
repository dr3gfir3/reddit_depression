	<TEXT> Grey tree frogs laid eggs a few weeks ago in buckets of water we have outdoors. Two of the buckets were long established with pond water and aquatic plants so I felt confident leaving those eggs alone. One of the buckets had just been filled with tap water the day before and was devoid of plant life so I decided to bring those eggs inside to raise. Here are the 60 healthy tadpoles from that clutch, which will soon be developing legs. They are fed every two days with boiled kale and a small supplement of spinach, and occasionally algae when we're able to cultivate some. The tadpoles left outdoors did not fare so well, however. They remained small for weeks and then began disappearing until eventually they were all gone. During that time we found a second clutch of eggs had been left in one of the buckets. I moved those to a new container in a different part of the yard, freshly filled and planted, and those tadpoles are healthy and growing fast. There are about 100 and I feed them the same diet as those indoors. Yesterday a third clutch of eggs was left. I moved almost all of them inside to a 30 gallon container. I count 130 and they are already beginning to develop. The last time I raised tadpoles every one emerged healthy from the water and I hope to replicate that success with these. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many IRC networks out there but I know that Undernet for sure has file sharing channels. Connect to irc.undernet.org and then view the list of channels on the server. Channels that have names beginning with #mp3 are likely to be file sharing channels. In the channel there are users running file sharing scripts. Typically you would type *@username* to receive that user's file list. The text file they send will have a list of all the files available and instructions on how to request them. You can also search for something specific by typing *@find term* in the channel. </TEXT>
