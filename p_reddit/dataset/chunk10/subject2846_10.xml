	<TEXT> If we can re-sign Hayward and get Kyle Lowry, I wouldn't mind letting Hill walk. I just don't know what else we would need to get past the Warriors. I think the only team that has a chance is Portland. If they had a healthy center, and could add PG13 or maybe Hayward they could take them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 11/22/63 by Stephen King is really good. It's long, but it is a pretty easy read. One of my favorite fantasy series is The Kingkiller Chronicle. They are really good, easy to read, and get your mind working a little.

 You could also try the Longmire books, they are like western cop mystery books, and they have a tv series as well. If you really want to test your comprehension, read through Dune. Science fiction, interesting, but not a page turner for most of the book, with the payoff literally within the last 100 pages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. I think the book is meant to be ambiguous in how they talk because near the end you aren't supposed to be able to tell who is talking. As for the ending, I think it is the perfect ending. The boy gets lucky, and continues on, just like he and his father had before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a beautiful, terrible, wonderful book. The story is compelling yet grim, and even though we know that death is inevitable, we push through to the end to see how it all unfolds, which is what I enjoy most about this book. 

Our deaths are inevitable, and perhaps it would be easier to be spared of the cruel way the universe seems to have planned for us to pass into the next phase of our existence, we push through, clinging onto the hope that perhaps death can come upon us while we sleep, in some peaceful manner.

I think it gives us a perfect snapshot of the gritty nature that propels us as a species to survive, even in the harshest circumstances. What a fantastic, horrible, wonderful book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. There are a few classes that I would consider the "Great Separators". Gen Chem 2, O Chem 2, and Physics. Study through those if you really want to go to med school.

2. Just because you have your mind made up now doesn't mean you can't change it. You might find something you love to study, don't be afraid to change your path. 

3. Have a backup plan. Things might not always go your way, and having a fallback is a good idea.

4. Connections are important. Learn to make friends, network yourself, get to know your teachers, show up to office hours, apply for research positions, etc.

5. Part of being a healthy human being is having sex, but so is maintaining a healthy mind. Take care of your mind, don't let your hormones take control of your brain, and vice versa. Balance in all things, yo.

6. This is the big leagues now. Grades matter, and failing a class and retaking it is bad. Don't be an idiot in that regards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are just a lot of Mormons, who are generally pretty nice but some like to be rude and snooty and uppity. In my experience, everyone is friendly, generally concerned with their family. Some will be pushy about Mormonism. I say go to one meeting to appease them. They generally have dances and other social events that are cool to go to,good way to meet people, even if you aren't and have no desire or disposition to enter into a new religion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There came a point when it became a huge wedge in our relationship. Religion was a top priority for both of us, and she didn't see the problem with me stopping going to church h and just going with her. 

Eventually she would say things like me not being Christian, asking if I believed in multiple Gods, and asking about Joseph Smith with very pointed and derogatory questions. It became very clear she had been googling Mormonism and reading the most salacious articles. We broke up not long after all this, for.multiple reasons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excuse me. 

I disagree with your sentiment and believe if you haven't read the material supplied by OP,  you should not comment, mainly bevause you are being critical of the author in a post that has nothing to do with his other works aside from the character featured.

If this were a post about his books, I would have nothing to say, but because this is a fanfic, and no reason exists for your comment other than to be negative, I don't see any value in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To add on to your character analysis, it bugs me soooo much that the main characters are very other paragons of virtue, which is one reason why I enjoy the story in the video game "The Last of Us".

Characters in dystopian/post apocalyptic societies should not be completely moral or immoral. They should be in the immense grey that lies between good and bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would agree with your analysis. The first book is a narration of the problem, the second is a pivot, and the third is analysis and solution. The trope does get a little heavy handed, but these books are for kids, and it is supposed to be easy to follow. </TEXT>
