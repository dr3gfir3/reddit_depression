	<TEXT> Are you able to get Custard Apples in South East Asia? They were my favourite when I went to Taiwan. I actually went to 3 different fruit shops because the shop keepers were very nice and told me the ones they had still needed to ripen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't know that. That's pretty cool! Probably why they are pretty expensive, I imagine it is pretty difficult to cultivate cacti. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually found the ice block got better as I ate it. The first bite was a bit underwhelming but as I ate more of it the refreshing flavour of the dragonfruit got stronger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might be the angle that makes my hand look bigger, but it wasn't that small. Also, dragonfruit is not that expensive in Taiwan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was probably made from the purple dragon fruit, not the white one. Though I think they don't taste very different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it depends on where you get it. I got this from Taiwan and I had some actual dragonfruit as well there. It is not as sweet as you would expect and I think it probably gets its flavour masked very easily. It tasted a bit more like a soft, slightly sweet cucumber.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm from New Zealand but only moved here a few years ago, so English is not my first language. I was actually kinda debating what to call it. Googled it and ice block seemed to fit better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They also focus a lot more on helping the people realise their food dreams. I've never seen a Master Class before in the US version, while they do it every week or every so often in the last Season. The closest is usually Gordon Ramsay showing of how well he can fillet a fish or butcher a chicken. And also I've seen a lot of the AU contestants go to do great in the food industry. I mean Billy from season 7 ended up working for Heston Blumethal, Po went on as a TV Chef, Reynold opened his own restaurant, Matt has his food truck I think, even Rose has her cafe and from the reviews they are pretty good. Meanwhile in the US, from the list I've seen somewhere about the contestants, most of the top ones are doing things like websites, blogs, private chefs, private dinners, etc; that's not counting the cooking books they release which some people say are average. I think only one of them opened a restaurant and it didn't do that well. </TEXT>
