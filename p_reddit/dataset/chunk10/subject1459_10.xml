	<TEXT>  But precisely! They DIDN"T actually assess infants with caregivers who weren't of their race! Meaning - this has nothing to do with preference for MATERNAL race, and everything to do with preference for CAREGIVER race.

So they didn't assess one factor that could be relevant to the findings, therefore that *must* be the only factor? That's not how science works. 

The reason I've pointed this out TWICE now (you know, 'keep resharing'), is because YOU are the one who is making assumptions about the study by claiming this has anything to do with preference towards own race. 

Actually no. All I've done is share the press release from the study, the claim that "infants have preference toward their own race" is a finding of the researchers. 

There are other studies that support this finding too. The real claim from this study is that it occurs *earlier* than previously expected. </TEXT>

You actually *don't know* that because, as you point out in the comment you keep resharing, they *didn't* actually assess infants with caregivers who weren't of their race.

You're right about the limitations of the study, but your answer to these findings is still hypothesizing. </TEXT>
