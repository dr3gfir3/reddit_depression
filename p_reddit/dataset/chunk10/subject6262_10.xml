	<TITLE> Clue for DLC5 (Theory) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-29 00:53:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So at this point in time, we are 70% certain that we are gonna be getting DLC5 because of all the leaks. But treyarch still hasn't said anything yet....or did they. Originally, when they wanted to add old gun like the MP40, they used to recreate them with a different design and give them different names. But about  2 or 3 months ago,treyarch started adding old guns with the same design and same name,remember that all of them were either in black ops2 zombies  or black ops 1 zombies or or world at war zombies. At this moment we have:
1.MP40(renamed HG40): in all cod zombies
2.PPSH: in WAW and Black ops 3
3.M1 garrand/m14( renamed mx garand): in all cod zombies
4.famas(renamed FAR):in black ops 1 and 3
5.M16: in black ops 1 in both zombies and multi,in black ops2 in zombies only and in black ops3 in multiplayer only(so far)
6. Galil: in black ops 1 in both zombies and multi,in black ops2 in zombies only and in black ops3 in multiplayer only(so far)
7.ballistic knife: in black ops 1 and 2 as both multi and zombies, in black ops 3 as a multiplayer weapon only(so far)
8. M1927: in black ops 2 zombies as M1927 and in both black ops and WAW zombies as the thompson.
These are 8 weapons that were in the old black ops/ waw games and are in black ops 3. Are they put only to be in some of the new maps of black ops 3 and only in multiplayer? I dont think so. I think that we will get a couple more supply drop weapons which might include the AK47,AK74-U, MP5,Olympia,M1911 and maybe the mouzer from origins. Even though not all of these might be in the supply drops, but if treyarch decides to add them, that will be a big clue for us that DLC 5 is coming.
And now for the main theory, i think that the reason of adding these guns is to add them to the DLC5 maps to give them the feel of the old maps, or to help recreate them. </TEXT>
