	<TEXT> That's not true you can be forcibly hospitalized for Suicide attempts and even saying to your friends, listen I'm going to kill myself and I wanted you to know because I care about you and don't want you to be shocked. 

That friend can then call paramedics to  your house and those paramedics will take you to the hospital where they will likely make you stay until you are no longer a threat to yourself in their opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The freedom of speech is a right, as is owning a gun, and publishing articles, and not incriminating oneself in trial. 

Not a single one of those rights require the government to do anything for you. 

The traditional definition of a right is that one is free from government intervention barring them from exercising that right, as opposed to the government having to assist them in carrying out that right. 

The government doesn't have to buy you a gun, or fund your paper, or force people to listen to you. They just can't stop you.  </TEXT>

I will say you've somewhat changed my view on minor physician interference but not so much governmental interference. In that the doctor should at least get them to wait and be sure they've not changed their mind after a week or two.

	<TEXT> Good point in favor of my view. 

If parents can not vaccinate putting all manner of vulnerable populations at risk for death, or attempt to pray the epilepsy or diabetes away for their child based on a very wrong interpretation of scripture. Why can't then a adult be allowed to do what they want also. 

I'd say not getting your child medical care based on generally accepted false religious beliefs and an adult with depression committing suicide are pretty much on the same level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personality disorders often include suicidal ideation as a part of it. 

They're not exactly, not thinking clearly or rationally. And personality disorders tend to not have medications that help with that and are entirely dependent upon things like DBT and learning behaviors. 

And worst of all there are quite a few Psychiatrists and therapists that won't work with people with personality disorders because of their tendency to manipulate situations.  </TEXT>

To be fair, their life could just get infinitely worse the longer it goes on. Just as easily as it could get infinitely better. 

In my own specific life I'd say me 10 years ago was at a much better position in life than me now. And I can definitely see it getting worse as time goes on. I'm sure there's a good chance it won't. But things tend to go wrong just as easily as they tend to go right.

	<TEXT> Okay you have a point, but then does that mean that someone else gets to decide at what point a person has had enough of trying to deal with the illness or that the individual can decide when they've tried enough treatment. 

If one consider it as the same as cancer, can doctors force an adult with treatable breast cancer to seek treatment rather than allow them to choose to let the disease run its course? Or furthermore, when a person has stage 3 cancer, can the doctor force them to continue to seek treatment under the hopes that it just might work, even if they would rather not? 

If the answers to those questions are no, then shouldn't the suicidal person then be allowed to choose to check out when they want?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not including people with deathly illnesses or with dibilitating and painful health issues.

I believe that people in emotional and psychological pain be allowed to commit suicide and that actions to stop them via the government and health officials is wrong. Additionally, I believe that intervention  by friends and family to seek help because of the family's own emotional reasons (ex: they will miss the suicidal person and be affected by such a situation) is wrong and should not be thrust upon the person as reasons to avoid what they believe is the solution to their problems. 

Here are some quotes from great thinkers on the subject:


 They tell us that Suicide is the greatest piece of Cowardice... That Suicide is wrong; when it is quite obvious that there is nothing in this world to which every man has a more unassailable title than to his own life and person.
 - Arthur Schopenhauer

Whereas, I reject such philosophical arguments like this: 

 He who contemplates suicide should ask himself whether his action can be consistent with the idea of humanity as an end in itself.
 - Kant

Change My View.

I've been molested, physically abused, and treated like shit. All before I was 10. 

I've been raped, and then they told everyone I was begging for the dick so no one believed me. 

I was plied with tons of liquor at a party and left by myself with a bunch of dudes only to come to later while I was getting done by 3 of them. And I'm pretty certain I didn't consent to that. 

I've a kid with autism, whom I will have to take care of for the rest of my life. 

I used to work at Google and now I'm stuck at home attending to my kid and sweeping floors when I could be doing much much more with my life. 

And I've only one friend now. And he doesn't need me. He's getting married.and I'm sure hanging with some chick that's not his wife will eventually become not a good thing. And he'll slowly fade away.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> On the one hand, I learned some very good coping skills. 

On the other hand, I did basically just say what I needed to say to leave. And I did check myself out against medical advice. The doctors suggested very strongly that I'd really benefit from being there longer. And maybe I'll regret that later. 


I still very much plan on killing myself, and my date is on my birthday; which is in late june. However some of the tactics I learned and the adjustment of my meds might at least make the time being more pleasant. 

Also I learned that I have like a psychological disorder not an actual sociopath because I feel remorse and care for some people. But that I don't really care about anyone because of it. 

Like basically, no one matters to me but me. But they said with some effort I might be able to learn to care about people that don't directly benefit me in a way. 

Like he said that basically, I care about my family (husband and kid) because they provide something for me. I care about friends because they serve me for entertainment and social reasons. But basically once they stop being beneficial to me they cease to matter.


They made some suggestions for my aftercare. Which I'm considering taking because my friends were pretty insistent in me going. And I might attempt to give it a shot instead of just going thru the motions. 

They suggested that I try a 2-3 week intensive DBT therapy program that manages and adjusts your medication and will address my multiple issues. 

I think I might give it a shot. I was honestly planning on stopping everything including the psychiatrist and all therapy together because it lead me to the stupid hospital.  But at the behest of my friends who are all very disappointed with me for not taking the opportunity seriously, I am going to really try to benefit from the intensive outpatient program. 


Any advice or opinions are welcome. </TEXT>

I said all my goodbyes and one of my friends kinda realized what was going on. And seemed very concerned. So it made it harder. 

All my other options were insufficient. And I tried slitting my wrists but it's exceedingly painful and it's difficult to get the correct angle. 



So I took a sleeping pill and went to sleep. 

I'm still not sure if I want to live. But I'm going to mull it over a bit more. And I'll talk to my pastor about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah,

Idk like it says that low blood pressure can be problematic with the prophynol 

And I'm using the hydroxyzine but I literally will fall asleep and be dead to the world. 

If for some reason I have a panic attack at 1pm and my son gets home at 2pm. I'd have to live with the panic attack til he got home and then basically while he was home. And that's on a half of a 25mg hydroxyzine tablet.

I'll cut if I can't do anything about the panic attack. Because that's the only fool proof remedy I have without Xanax or Valium. 

Valium and Xanax doesn't even get me high. I've taken double doses and nothing. Plus I pretty much calm my shit once I've gotten a way to deal with the panic attacks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently my psychiatrist has me on hydroxyzine for my occasional anxiety attacks. 

One of the psychiatrists that I'm interviewing or whatever for a replacement for my current Psychiatrist (he's moving to a new area after June) has suggested Propranolol as a option because the hydroxyzine makes me sleepy and I have things to do. 

However, I don't like the idea of the propranolol because of the effects it has on high blood pressure. I have severe anemia and often get light headed. 

I suggested that I'd prefer to go back into the Xanax that my former psychiatrist had written for me when I lived in NYC. However, he's gungho on this damn propranolol. 

I'd just rather use the medication that worked for me in the past. 

I was stable and everything was working well for me. I was working consistently as a freelance writer and was productive as a stay at home mom. 

Now I'm just doing a bunch of nothing because I'm not very able to do things because my moods are all over the place. 

He said he's worried about possible addiction but honestly it's a bunch of bullshit. I have panic attacks once my medication is stable about 2 times a month. 

A single 30ct script lasted me an entire year. 

I just think I should know what works for me better than someone who sees me once a week. </TEXT>

Also it's the true body and blood of Christ given for you for the forgiveness of sins. Keto or any other diet should not be in your mind when it comes to communion. 

I'm literally an alcoholic. And I have no problem with taking communion that starts out as wine. You know why because it's Christ's true body and blood over the bread and wine. And I'd rather be out of ketosis and out of sobriety than give up the body and blood of my lord Jesus Christ who gave himself up for me that I might be saved. 

So I really hope that this post is just a joke that you really didn't think about beforehand.  </TEXT>

I don't want to but, i know I'm not going to follow any of the advice i have given out over the years. 

I got numbers and i know i won't call them. 
I got hobbies to do, i won't do them. 

I got chatrooms.

I know to make lists. Pray etc. 

But I'm gonna drink cuz I'm an asshole. 

I'm hoping that posting this stops me. 
Im hoping it pick up the phone. 
I'm hoping that i manage to make it til at least 2 more hours.
I'm hoping. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kk. I only knew from my brother. When we started getting beat by our "step dad" he suddenly began wetting the bed. And when I grew older I read that was likely why. 


I'll check everything else to rule it out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay. I'll get a medical evaluation. 

I didn't realize there were all those other options. 

I hope it's one of those. Or else I'm going to have to just randomly choose people to beat up in attempt to find out who's messing with him.  


Tho I don't think it's diabetes. He's in pretty great shape.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd basically do that thing parents do. You know when you have two kids and they keep fighting over a video game.

I'd be like, if either of you start a scene, or anything else, no more anything. And I wouldn't care who started it.

No Christmas, Easter, birthdays, graduations, and more until you complete family counseling.

And if it happens again, after that no more forever.

When I was a kid that worked.

You basically realized that you'd fuck yourself over and try to be sensitive to the other so they wouldn't fuck you over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My son (9) has been wetting the bed again. 


Other than an occasional accident. He's hasn't wet the bed consistently in years. 

Even at about 5 he pretty much stopped having accidents. 

From what I know sudden new bed wetting is the result of some kind of trauma. 

In fortunately my son is non verbal autistic and can't tell me what's going on. 

Do you think I should contact someone to see if they can check his bladder or if he's been abused in some way? 

The only adults that have access to him other than my husband and myself are the bus aides and the teachers at school. I

It's possible he's been getting bullied on the bus but I figured the bus driver would tell me. 


Any advice is welcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I'm glad you finally got the Christian faith right. 

I guess the developmentally disabled who can't read the Bible are just lost. And those who can't understand the Bible are a bunch of sinners. 

And summarizing the entire faith into a few lines is stupid. 


All those church fathers were so wrong. Stupid council of nicaea and their studied Christian theology. 

How dare they take the time to make the summary of the faith easily accessible to the masses who didn't have entire Bible's at the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's bull. I'm lutheran and not the kind that thinks being gay is ok. 

But nevertheless, if my son was gay, I'd be like you're a grown man, do what you want. And when he got married, id be all in, and when they adopted, I'd be by their side.  

Family is family. 

And I'm not going to force my kid to believe what I believe. 

Sorry that your family can't get that. 

You're supposed to love your neighbor and that isn't love.

	<TEXT> My husband and I took the confirmation classes. I believe it took us about 6 months. 

I had a lot of questions that were related to topics but room us off topic occasionally.  


* Also yes we went thru standard confirmation like kiddos. And my husband and son were baptised at that time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you never read books explaining theology? 

Cuz then those are also pointless.  As are sermons in church. 

All based on the Bible but not the Bible. 

The creeds are especially good for children and people who can't understand extensively.
