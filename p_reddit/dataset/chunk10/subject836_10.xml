	<TEXT> Hey guys

Im making this thread because im just in a array of negative emotions. Im a 30 year old man ,who has a penchant for music and writing. I post on this music website forum and it spark interaction with various people. I met a online friend and we developed a relationship sort of long distance relationship.

The bad or rather sad thing is i lied to this friend because i felt inadequate in her eyes (i work a very very menial job and i still lived ith my parents). Oddly enough she accepted my situations. This made me like her more , however it was as if things got worse. 

I come from a strict household. My parents they are hard on me even at my age. hen i first met this girl they seemed happy but its started seeming like they didnt like her for whatever reason. 

before meeting this girl it felt like i didnt have a purpose, didnt feel like, didnt feel attractive, my self-esteem just was low. She motivated me, made me happy.

I was so caught up in my on feeling i forgot about her own and as she said self-absorbed. Mainly because it felt surreal and arbritary to me. I forgot important days New Years and Valentine Days was both disaster . I was mad at her on NY and i didnt take her calls and on V-Day, my mom ruin it (lets just say i didnt have my own phone and was using my mothers at the time).


Ive shared personal things with her i never shared with anybody. She got me to open up about my aspirations and it felt super good. Cause for once someone gave a damn. 

We started having verbal arguments and it lead to her asking for space, wish i gave her (although we were communicating not as frequent though). Recently, a situation happen where she was disrespected and i addressed the situation and the person who disrespected her. We started talking all over again and i just felt this attraction. She was at work and told me about a meeting . I told her okay, but she later text me and said she wasnt going to text me. 

I know i lied
I know i made mistakes
but i like her

Right now: it like im empty, she wont talk to me and i have no one to talk to. Its like i have no one at all, my parents at their age they dont give a damn. My father he is harder on me than what my mother is. 

*BTW im hope im making since with what im saying. </TEXT>
