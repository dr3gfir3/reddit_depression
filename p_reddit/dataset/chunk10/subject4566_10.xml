	<TEXT> This comment is about the competence of a leader during an emergency, and how it would be more reassuring to have a qualified agency head rather than a person known for both wanting to eliminate the Energy Department and for forgetting which department he wanted to eliminate, coasting by on the work of experts from previous administrations. The only reassurance is that some of those experts are still in the department, but there are 21 unfilled key appointments at the Department of Energy. Other agencies are even worse equipped. There are 43 unfilled positions at the Department of Defense. We are vulnerable, as a country, to emergencies when our government is a skeleton crew led by unqualified people. This is dangerous. </TEXT>

Edit: To respond to the downvotes, here's an example:

[NIH: Androgen insensitivity syndrome:](https://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/androgen-insensitivity-syndrome)

Androgen insensitivity syndrome is a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their bodies are unable to respond to certain male sex hormones (called androgens), they may have mostly female external sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Macron already has more votes than Le Pen. At most one could say that by abstaining you are increasing Macron's chances.

Only if your natural alliance is with Le Pen. Voting for Macron increases Macron's chances. This is "Hillary's going to win anyway, don't sully yourself by voting for her" redux.

 I thank you for dropping the personal insults in this reply.

You're welcome for your hypocritical repeated painting of your opponent as dirtied by a personal insult. You could have *actually* taken the high-ish road by leaving it at one statement that tried to position yourself as personally better than your opponent, but you needed a second round of transparent self-flattery. You deserve an insult. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An accusation of sophistry is meant as a criticism of your argument. I'm criticizing your comparison of Western democratic institutions with autocracy as though they both need toppling. 

You're promoting false equivalence between Macron and Le Pen as enemies of "fellow workers" while writing off the workers who will be directly targeted by Le Pen's ethnonationalism. Macron's extra month's pay for low-wage workers in the form of a permanent tax exemption, and 50 billion in new public spending, including 15 billion for job training as well as environmental, health, and infrastructure spending isn't nearly as left as I would like, but the French public has already decided they don't want someone as left as you or I would like. But you are sending France's most vulnerable people to the wolves by promoting abstention. You can protest for more progress and work harder to convince French citizens to vote for someone more to your liking next time after you've ensured some minimal level of human decency for all of France's people this time. </TEXT>

The big question is how long this trial lasts vs. how long Uber's current funding lasts, because it's got to be difficult to raise money for a company that's losing $3 billion a year *and* that has its only path to survival blocked by a judge. Uber raised $4.65 billion in investment and loans in mid-2016. If that runs out at the end of 2017, what do they have left? </TEXT>

But designing an economical LIDAR is not easy, and Uber will need to fund its money-burning taxi business in the meantime. Last year, the company got a Saudi investment of $3.5 billion and a loan of $1.15 billion. But also last year, it burned through $3 billion.

	<TEXT> Self-driving cars aren't going to disrupt the business model, they *are* the business model. Uber's first goal is to gain market share by any means necessary, including breaking the law and losing billions of dollars. Their second goal is to remove all the drivers and take all their wages for themselves to become profitable. Suddenly they're a company with hundreds of millions of profitable customers. The advantage of having hundreds of millions of paying customers from the outset is huge.

This injunction threat, and possibly a permanent injunction, is a potentially mortal blow because it could delay Uber's path to self-driving profitability enough that someone else, like Waymo, could get there first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only because Countdown is for nerds, I will be a nerd and point out there are problems with some of these Venn diagrams. For example, "Members of crews" should just be a circle that has the words "Pirates" and "Hip-hop artists" in it, because "Members of crews" is a set, and "Pirates" and "Hip-hop artists" are items in that set. Or, the circle labeled "Pirates" should have Blackbeard and Captain Morgan in it, the circle "Hip-hop artists" should have Biggy and Tupac in it, and "Members of crews" should be an even larger superset encircling both sets, with flight attendants and stage hands elsewhere in that larger circle. Or, really, there should just be a list titled "Members of crews," with "Pirates" and "Hip-hop artists" as items on that list.

"Reasons my husband pissed on me" could also be a list, as well as most of the intersections on the super-diagram, except for the last one: Countdown + Bellends = This show should just be an equation.

And now I've taken all the fun out of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You wouldn't put a comma in "The packing for shipment or distribution of," which would have the same problem. Use an Oxford comma or reword when necessary, but when it's unnecessary, there's no absolutist need to put a stutter in all writing. If there had to be a rule one way or the other for legal writing only, though, I would keep the comma for formal structuring, but also require disambiguating prepositions: "The packing for shipment of, or distribution of." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is such an interesting case. Eichenwald's lawyer compares it to mailing anthrax or an explosive, as it was done with the stated intent of causing physical harm. Rivello's lawyer cited a First Amendment right to post strobing images. So the question is on the limitations of the First Amendment. If someone publicly calls for an attack on another person, for example, they can be held liable for the attack. The First Amendment isn't an absolute shield from speech or expression that directly causes harm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Black people vote Democratic because of Republicans' Southern Strategy, opposition to civil rights, and the continued presence of people like Steve King in the party. The Republican party is not a reasonable option. Meanwhile, white people have always voted for the Republican presidential candidate ever since JFK called for what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He was assassinated, Goldwater ran against it, Southern states started flying the Confederate Flag again (they hadn't since the Civil War), and the White South switched from Democratic to Republican, because of race.

White identity politics are the only reason why identity politics exist. If minorities were not discriminated  against, they would never have to band together politically to fight it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was a shorthand example to make it clear that the source was not organic Sanders supporters. Here's more:

 People were so anti-Hillary that no matter what you said, they were willing to share it and spread it, she said. At first I would just laugh about it. I would say, Cmon, this is beyond ridiculous. I created a word called ridiculosity. I would say, This reeks of ridiculosity.

But Cowling got pushback. **She was called a Hillbot and a Trump supporter.** She ended up removing dozens of members who refused to stop pushing conspiracy theories. **I lost quite a few friends**, she said.

... None of the fake stories stood out to Smollon. He described the Facebook groups as being in a room filled with blasting televisions. It was hard to pick out the loudest noises. The ultimate goal of this **wasnt so much misinformation as distraction from valid info**, he concluded.

But Smollon **had a hard time convincing other Bernie supporters** that they were being played. No one cared, Smollon said. At that point, **you were a Hillary shill**. It was like an echo chamber of anger.

Even when pointing out that something like NBCPolitics.org was a fake site  the real site is NBCNews.com/politics  he drew criticism. **He was eventually removed as a moderator from one of the pro-Sanders Facebook groups.** Its the closest Ive been to being gaslit in my life, he said.

The people who spoke up about it during the campaign were insulted, ostracized, and pushed out. It was a poisonous environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basic income pays the same to workers and non-workers. Men and women will both get the same amount of money. Men and women will both be able to quit their jobs and live off basic income only. The only reason basic income will help women more than men is because women will be laid off at a higher rate, taking away from them their choice of whether to work, a choice that more men will still have. It only helps women more because women will be worse affected by automation of industries like retail and hospitality, and will therefore be more needy of the exact same amount of cash men will get.

Your argument is like getting upset at public restrooms for giving an unfair advantage to the homeless. No, public restrooms are equally available to all, they're just of more *value* to the homeless. Homeless people don't get extra public restrooms, but the same public restrooms that you have access to are more valuable to the homeless because without them, the homeless would have no restrooms at all.

You will get the same money as a woman. But because women will be laid off at higher rates, that money will be more valuable to them. You will still be free to become jobless. Just as you're free to become homeless and mooch off the lucrative public restroom benefits. </TEXT>

"Do women deserve MORE help than men?" is another strawman. No one has proposed more help to women, basic income is distributed equally. But if women will lose 20 jobs for every 1 gained, while men will lose 4 jobs for every 1 gained, then basic income will provide a more valuable income replacement (vs. mere income supplement) to more women than men.

	<TEXT> The writers aren't negotiating with consumers, though, they're negotiating with studios. Our access to content will make it more bearable for us, but they're not trying to make us suffer. If people go online for content, though, networks could lose out, especially if people go to Netflix instead of, say, ABC.com. Even if people do visit network websites, the ad revenue is smaller online. So networks will still be pressuring studios to make a deal. One way networks are better positioned, though, is that they have more reality formats available to them, they've been ramping up production of primetime game shows, and there's strong demand for news, so longform newsmagazine shows could proliferate. Sports is another schedule-filler. </TEXT>

"why couldn't [she] just keep [her] knees together"

"if she skews her pelvis slightly she can avoid him"

"Some sex and pain sometimes go together [] that's not necessarily a bad thing"

"sex is very often a challenge"

The judge didn't make one offhand comment that he got railroaded for, he continually argued that the woman is at fault for being drunk, for not fighting the man off, for complaining about a struggle and pain because challenge and pain are part of sex. It is reasonable for a female rape victim to question whether she could ever get a fair hearing from this judge, because of all these preconceived notions he puts on the scale about how women are like when they're drunk, how a good victim fights off her attacker, how pain and a struggle are normal, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Men buy guns more than women and therefore have a more effective method of suicide at their disposal, despite women being more depressed and attempting more suicides. Is men's higher rate of gun ownership oppression? (They also use those guns to kill women at a much higher rate than the reverse.)

Men are attracted to more dangerous jobs and take more risks, but are male police and firefighters oppressed by not being outnumbered by women? This is an argument for funding OSHA, not another bullet point on a laundry list of oppressed male resentment.

Females outlive males even among non-human primates. It is not anti-man society's oppression causing this. Men are the subject of more medical research than women, and the life expectancy gender gap is actually narrowing as men's lifespans are increasing faster than women's. Where is the oppression?

And the study you cited showed temporarily higher wages for women in their 20s *if women go to college and men do not*, which is soon reversed as men get promoted and women take on stay-at-home parenting at higher rates than men. This is an argument for programs such as free community college and vocational training, as well as more parental leave and childcare support, but it is not a picture of male oppression. 20-something men make more than 20-something women of equal schooling, and after promotions and parenthood, not even school matters: men earn more than women, regardless.

This feels a lot like someone's taken a preexisting position of men being treated unfairly, and backfilled it with a hodgepodge of stats that don't stand up to scrutiny. It's like when certain men complain that women get custody of children more than women, but neglect to mention that when men actually *request* custody, they are granted it at equal rates.

Again, I'm a man. I have nothing against men. I do have a problem with unfounded resentment of spurious oppression of men, because it feels an awful lot like junk science compiled to justify preexisting resentment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Male graduates earn more than women graduates, men earn more than women among non-graduates, and men earn more than women regardless of education across their lifetime. Maybe instead of feeling threatened, men in their 20s should just graduate to out-earn a woman, or take solace in the fact that they'll out-earn women soon anyway, or just not care about their relative position to women like some constant battle of the sexes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Automation could actually end up having a bigger impact on women's employment: According to one [study](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/18/women-to-lose-out-in-jobs-revolution-wef-warns), for every 20 jobs women are expected to lose to automation, they are expected to gain only 1, due to overrepresentation in automatable industries and underrepresentation in STEM. </TEXT>
