/u/nicalsilva might have more info about this as well. The long and short of it is that webrender isn't fully implemented in nightly and AFAIK the actual rendering is still done in Gecko. 

I'm pretty sure the target for Webrender (and Stylo) is Firefox is 57 (could definitely be wrong on that though). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's so many things wrong with this.

International wars have started over soccer in Latin America

For example?

ultras of teams defend them even with blood to the death

The most extreme of the extreme do, I suppose. The overwhelming majority  of *all* football games (in Europe at least) go on without incident.

hell Lazio is basically a fascist team.

Emm what? Why? Lazio was founded before fascism was even a thing. When fascists did come to power they wanted to merge the teams in Rome into 1 team, hence the founding of AS Roma, Lazio opposed this obviously. If some fascists support a particular team *now* there isn't much the club can do about it except ban them from the ground.

Real Madrid was the fascist dictator's favorite team

Vastly overstated. Franco wanted to politicise football domestically and internationally so Madrid were the obvious pick for that because of how successful they were, could've been any team really.

while people in Barcelona used the team as a way to express their culture.

This is right and they still do I suppose.

It lends people to follow a crest and indoctrinate and follow blindly, specially as long as your rival pays the price (vs. Roma; vs. Barcelona).

The amount of people like this is negligibly small. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the last few weeks (and especially because of the recent chemical attack) I've noticed that the community here is basically split in 2. The discussion in posts about basically politics e.g Trump said this, Putin said that, US / Russia mistakenly bombed some innocents the discussion is exactly as you describe, bottom of the barrel shit, conspiracy theories, non-sensical ideas etc. Then when you go into a post about something like SAA advancing in Palmyra, even rebels advancing somewhere the comments are completely different like totally level headed and dare I say even *neutral*. 

I've had the feeling that a lot of the commenters you're on about are /r/conspiracy, /r/the_donald types who've moved here for some reason and yesterday or the day before I decided to put it to the test. The post was about (I think) an anonymous US official saying the US had proof the SAA was responsible for the chemical attack and a huge amount of the comments were basically the US and MSM can't be trusted, but the worst comments were like how Russian media is more believable than western or Putin doesn't lie (these were real comments), I looked the posters up on snoopsnoo and to the shock of no-one the vast, overwhelming majority of these posters comments were in either /r/conspiracy or /r/the_donald and a few were both. 

It's my opinion either these people should be banned for life or a new sub called something like /r/true_syriancivalwar where the only allowed posts are directly related to the war, like current battles, advances etc and posts that are nothing more than a link to Trump's twitter account should be banned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what I've been saying and (based on no evidence, admittedly) the most likely scenario in my opinion. If the commander of the airbase decided for himself to carry out this attack without Assad's approval what's he going to do about it? Send the Tiger Forces after him? The Desert Hawks? Republican Guard?

Having people think Assad is in full control of the army is better than thinking he has no control because with no control there's nothing stopping more chemical weapon attacks which would be a very good way to get invaded by the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Assad

People every where keep throwing around this name like he's some sort of omnipotent, omnipresent being. Is it not possible that Assad has *a lot* less control over large parts of his army than people think and this was an act from some higher up in the army who decided "Fuck this town"? If the thought of this Chemical Weapon attack worked it's way up the chain of command all the way to Assad to sign off on like a nuclear strike would through the US or Russian chain of command and he said no would he be listened to? What could he do if they didn't listen? </TEXT>

They need cloud storage like pretty much everyone and from what I've seen (not from far right blogs or conspiracy sites) it needs to be custom made to be even more secure, so AWS seems like a no brainer since they're the best in the business. IBM was also in the running for this contract are they in bed with the CIA as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Criticizing Le Pen, the leader of the National Front who wants to leave the euro, hold a referendum on European Union membership and curb immigration, Macron said: "Nationalism is war. I know it. I come from a region that is full of graveyards."

The centrist, who voiced his strong pro-European views, comes from the Somme region, a major battlefield in World War One.

Le Pen hit back at Macron: "You shouldn't pretend to be something new when you are speaking like old fossils that are at least 50 years old."

Macron retorted: "Sorry to tell you this, Madame Le Pen, but you are saying the same lies that we've heard from your father for 40 years."

	<TEXT> This is a comment I saved from years ago:

Lasers operate specifically by achieving negative Kelvin temperatures. This is because they are not in equilibrium (due to population inversion), so the dynamics start to get a little odd. Also, negative Kelvin temperatures are hotter than infinite positive Kelvin, though the scale goes backwards with negative infinity Kelvin being just slightly hotter than infinite Kelvin. Source: Two physical science degrees and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_temperature

Edit: Further description and answers for many confused people.

Rightfully so, many of you are confused at the notion that we could achieve a negative temperature, since absolute zero is the absence of movement, right?. In fact, negative temperature arises from the fact that temperature is not exactly defined in terms of physical motion. Rather, we define temperature as the change in reversible heat per the change in entropy. In a laser, we pump particles to excited states faster than they can decay to lower energy states. This means that an increase in energy actually decreases entropy. This is analogous to boiling water and having it freeze. Since the change in heat is positive and the change in entropy is negative, the next temperature is less than zero.

As a side note, absolute zero is actually not the absence of motion. Rather, it is the absence of entropy. At the lowest possible energy we still see movement because of quantum vacuum fluctuations (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_fluctuations). Yes, even when we are as cold and motionless as possible, the universe still pumps out particle-antiparticle pairs that annihilate too fast to be observed. Don't believe me?

	<TEXT>  If it ain't broke don't fix it.

Is this not the main reason people advocate using Rust though? That there's inherent problems with C that just don't exist in Rust. [This comment chain from /r/Programming is mainly what I'm talking about](https://np.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/61rh9j/curl_is_c/dfgqkkq/) 

22 CVE's issued against curl in the past 12 months. Out of those 22, 10 are clearly to blame on C/C++ manual memory management model. So the quote

Of course that leaves a share of problems that couldve been avoided if we used another language. Buffer overflows, double frees and out of boundary reads etc, but the bulk of our security problems has not happened due to curl being written in C.

Is true.

But... the cURL project was started in 1997. They're still triaging memory safety issues 20 years later. Working in arguably the most conservative C standard to ease complexity.

How does any other project plan on doing better?

The other thing is that Rust isn't just about memory safety. Rust is about better programming using the lessons learned between 1978 and 2015. Some of those lessons are "C strings were a bad idea" and "manual calls to free() were a bad idea", but that's far from all of them. (I actually count 13 vulnerabilities of the last 2242, 46, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 57, 58, 60, and 61directly related to those flaws.) But Rust has a better type system, both in terms of the ability to define custom types and the ability to track things with those types, safe enums (instead of C-style unions) and an excellent match construct, public and private types/functions, traits, and many other things.

For instance, the patch for CVE-2016-5420, "Incorrect reuse of client certificates", is about making sure that when you compare two structs, you don't forget to compare a field in the two structs. In C, you have to open-code this comparison. In Rust, you just stick #[deriving(Eq)] before the struct, because unlike C, Rust knows that comparison of structs is a thing that people might want to do ever. The compiler will generate a trait Eq implementation that compares all the fields, using the Eq implementations (either automatically-derived or manual) of each field, so you even get secure string compares if you define some SecureBuffer type and use it for the strings. (As a bonus, doing that also makes sure that you don't accidentally use a normal strcmp on the strings.) When you add a new field to the struct, the automatic Eq implementation on the struct will automatically compare it, too.

And in fact, the current version of the comparison function doesn't check all the members of the struct, and there's no comment why. Is that a vulnerability? I have no idea! I assume not, because they would have noticed when patching CVE-2016-5420, but without a comment, who knows for sure?
