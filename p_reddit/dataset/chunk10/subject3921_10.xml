	<TEXT> It happened on Friday night at around three in the morning. Yeah, we'd been drinking, but I think that's part of how it gets you. It's a predator lurking right out in the open. Like, *right there* on the street a few steps from everybodyand nobody notices.

There were five of us when we began that walk back to the dorms. We were collectively very drunk, but not too drunk to cross the street to avoid a homeless man walking toward us on the sidewalk. He yelled something after us like, "Come on man! I'm just hungry!" but we kept stumbling on and ignored him. One of us began telling a loud story to drown out the unhappy yells receding in the distance behind us.

The next three blocks were dark and quiet. At some point, as the heat of the summer night began to get to us, our laughter and stories faded in favor of earnest walking. We were tired, it was late, and we just wanted to get home.

It was then that we noticed that Elliott was gone.

This wasn't the best part of town, but we risked yelling his name for a minute or two until lights started to come on in the nearby rundown houses. Moving quickly back the way we had come, we started peering down dark alleys and under bushes thinking that he might have passed out somewhere, but there was no sign of him. The only people around were those in their houses, a rolled blanket nestled in a corner that likely held a sleeping homeless person, and that yelling man we had passed. He was now four blocks away and almost out of sight.

We tried calling Elliott on the phone a few times, and the other end did ring, but he didn't answer. We were worried enough that we began jogging back toward the man who had yelled that he was hungry. None of us said it, but a terrible fear was nipping at our heels, and I remember being terrified that we were going to find Elliott being eaten by a group of hungry beggars.

Seeing us coming at him, the disheveled older man began running. What, *he* was afraid of *us?* We figured he had something to hide, and we broke into a full run. Pete was the one who reached him first, and he set the tone by throwing a punch at a kidney. The older man fell roughly on the cement sidewalk and gasped in pain; I held my friends back as they kicked him two or three times in anger. They were yelling something about Elliott. I just screamed back in their faces that they were acting crazy.

But the hungry older man climbed to his feet by gripping the brick wall and said, "No, it ain't crazy. It ain't me, but it ain't crazy. These streets got somethin' hunting. Half my friends disappeared this month. What's *your* friend's name?" 

Still bodily keeping the guys back, I said, "Elliott."

"Then let's get to lookin'. Maybe you boys can help out with those fists of yours when we finally catch the bastard." In a resigned sort of way, he didn't seem to care that we'd just assaulted him. He began limping opposite the way he'd been going, and now began shouting, "Yo Elliott! Elliott, you hear me?"

My drunk friends were red-faced from adrenaline and embarrassment. I pushed at them one more time to remind them how idiotic and asinine they'd been, and then we began spreading out and calling for Elliott.

This time, when the lights in the houses came on, we didn't run. Our older companion waved to people in the windows. Once they recognized him and came out, he explained about our lost friend, and we soon had a dozen people methodically searching every single corner of the neighborhood.

It was definitely strange to be a part of that. This was a section of town we traditionally feared, for the houses were ramshackle, the sidewalks were broken and decaying, and the people themselves seemed to just be *different* than usbut they were deadly serious about finding Elliott. They spread his description by word of mouth as more and more people turned out from their houses, and soon we had the manpower to turn over every single stone.

By that time we were keyed up enough to try calling the police, but our older guide shook his head. "The cops won't come here. We'll take care of this ourselves."

I tried. "Sorry about my friends, man."

He gave a gruff smoker's laugh. "It is what it is."

It was an unexpected thing, that full-neighborhood search, but it became incredibly awkward when no trace of Elliott was found. At that point, people began eyeing us with annoyance and returning to their homes. That brief half an hour of coming together faded slowly back into the uncomfortable reality of being on the south side late at night. Elliott was gone, and we were beginning to think he'd somehow grabbed an Uber without us noticing.

"It's no problem," our guide told us. "Not the first time we've had to look for some kid. That's life. You think he's gonna be alright?"

It was just him and my friends at that point. We were standing on a street corner with nowhere left to search. I said, "I'll give him one more call."

I hit his contact number in my phone and waited. The call began to go through.

A moment later, I heard an answering ringtone.

All of us began looking around in alarm.

"Elliott?"

"Elliott!"

"Shut up, I'm trying to hear where it is!"

His ringtone sounded again, and I began to realize that it was coming from near my feet. Looking down, I saw that rolled up blanket that I had assumed had held some homeless person. A cup with two quarters sat in front of it, and I reached downand then recoiled when I couldn't pick it up. "The cup's attached to this blanket by something."

"The hell?"

"What is it, some sort of trick cup?"

Our older companion took a step back. "Don't do it." He shook his head rapidly. "Don't do it."

The rolled-up blanket was quivering, but not because of my touch. Elliott's ringtone continued to come from inside, so I reached forward again.

It wasn't a blanket.

It looked like a blanket.

It even had faded and dirty plaid patterns.

But it was warm.

It was some sort of *skin.*

In a surge of terrified adrenaline, I grabbed that warm annelid skin and pulled as hard as I could.

The only way to describe it would be a sack that was also a mouth. The thing was like a six-foot-long leech that opened on the side to reveal curved teeth and an open stomach full of acid and flesh. Elliott was curled up insideundergoing the process of digestion. It had just begun, but he had already suffocated inside. We'd walked right past him half a dozen times. I'd even thought I'd heard muffled calls for help from around that location, but I'd never even given the blanket roll a second glance.

And that was what it had counted on. That was how it hunted. Elliott had stopped to put change in the cup, and that act had triggered it to snap around and consume him.

We ran. There were no thoughts about capturing the creature or proving its existence; we simply ran. By the time we got back there with clear heads, the sun was rising and the human-trap creature was gone. There are countless blanket rolls just like that one all over the city. Which ones are people and which ones are *creatures?* To die surrounded by pressing stomach flesh and acid while suffocating and screaming mere steps away from civilizationthat is now my ultimate fear, because I know people will walk by without listening or looking as I die right there on the corner. I know they'll ignore me, because that's what I did.

	<TEXT> In a daze, his chest feeling constricted, Edgar wandered out onto the main dirt road.

"Sir!" his advisor called after him. "The peace summit begins in forty minutes!"

He registered the words, but continued forward on numb feet. His floating tread guided him sharply away from all passersby and down a minor path toward Concord Farm's nearby river. Field after field full of Death Oathers with spikes in the backs of their heads rolled by on his left and right; they waved, but he could not respond. He managed to make it to his favorite thinking spot before the white haze circling his vision became too strong to continue. The boulder was right at the water's edge and allowed him to trail his feet in chill burbles; he threw his fancy shoes in the grass and dunked his toes. Groups of women washing clothes and children playing lurked on nearby bends, but it was the most privacy he could expect in a world of refugees-become-homemakers.

Three hundred and fifty billion people had set out on foot as part of the New Exodus; nobody knew how many survivors of that number remained, although the best guess was that about half had been lost and another half had become undead. Their two-year-old fledgling government's amateur attempts at a census had found at least fifty billion people both alive and undead on Concord Farm's ideal Earthspread throughout all six habitable continents (and a few on Antarctica, as he was often reminded)which meant a full quarter of the Second Tribe now lived alongside him, fighting every day to expand vegetable gardens, snow wheat fields, and other arable lands.

Despite that overpopulation, it took her less than seven minutes to find him.

He kept his gaze on the clear and coursing water. "You're always there for me."

Mona laughed softly and then sat down beside him. "It's my job."

"How's the outbreak?" he asked, trying to delay the obvious conversation. Her *other* job, Surgeon General, meant she was the one that had to manage the inevitable disease outbreaks that had resulted from half of the human race walking around dead and openly wounded.

Her sigh sounded exhausted. "It's under control." She held up her cellphone. "Erich said the summit starts in half an hour, but you ran off after reading something in that book."

He looked under his arm, surprised-but-not-surprised that the book was still with him. "I've lived my whole life thinking there's always a way to win," he finally forced himself to say. "That if you're just clever enough or fast enough you can find a way to survive no matter what. It's the only reason I have the ability to wake up in the morning and face the world. That belief is my only strength in a multiverse where every corner hides some new nightmare that can instantly kill you."

"Not your only strength," Mona replied. "Come on."

"It is." Edgar gripped the rock below hard enough to turn his knuckles white. "I've felt this way before."

"Wecelo?"

"Yeah. Having to watch someone you care about die like that and knowing that there's *nothing* you can do just hit home the fact that I might be wrong. Maybe there's not always a way forward. Maybe sometimes you just *lose.*"

"She was eight hundred years in the past," Mona countered calmly. "That's different."

"It's not. Now *we're* the doomed ones long in the past." He freed his hands from stone to bring the book forward and open it. "Sorry for the delay, Kumari. Please continue. Mona's here now, too."

Text appeared on the open blank page: "Are you alright?"

Edgar gave a slow nod. "Yes. Please tell us again what you told me."

"I don't know if I should. It's not really what I meant to"

"Please. I can't be the only one that knows. Please don't make me be the only one that knows."

"Alright." Readjusting awkwardly in her seat, Kumari hesitated.

Mona peered closer at the text. "It actually tells you all of that? That people move awkwardly in their seats and such?" She began to worry that it might transmit her private thoughts as well. Her frown deepened upon reading *that.* "Seriously?"

Despite the intense weight on his shoulders, Edgar smiled.

"In two weeks, the Second Tribe will be destroyed," Kumari blurted, unsure how else to put it.

Edgar's smile faded. Mona drew her face into practiced medical neutrality. "How?"

"Growing up, we had bits and pieces, nothing more. Only a few million of us survived, and none of us knew exactly what happened. But reading about the past through this book, I've seen it. In about two weeks, a young boy will ask his ruby cube friend to activate itself over Concord Farm."

Nothing changed in her expression, but Mona's face flushed slightly darker brown. "Why would he do that?"

"A wounded Senator will order him to do it as a last resort."

"And one ruby cube can bring about that much devastation?"

Kumari lowered her head slightly in apology. "I don't know exactly. I was very young at the time, but I have a single vague memory of the day it happened. It was bad. Very bad. After that, growing up, we had no home and no resources and people were able to die again, so it only got worse. There are just a handful of us left now, a subculture among other human civilizations."

Edgar glanced over at Mona. "What about Ken? Do you know a Ken?"

"Ken Brace? Yes, he's here. He's a little younger than me, but I know him."

Mona put a hand to her mouth with relief. A heartbeat later, that hand moved to her abdomen, and she worked up the nerve to ask, "Is he alone? What I mean to saydoes he have a brother or sister?"

Kumari blinked away unwanted moisture in her eyes. "Look, you have to understand that you have all been dead and gone my entire life. I don't believe even for a second I can change that disaster. I just"

Mona's expression sharpened unhappily.

"I justthe way Ken talked about his father, about youI guess I started all this because I don't have any family either. I was just curious about what kind of person *my* dad was, and then I found out that he was the absolute best man. He wasn't Vanguard or a leader or a hero and he didn't have any special abilities or meaning to anyone, but he made tough choices the right waythe right way for me, and for those around him. He was brave, for me. He was a good person. He would have been a great father."

The veins made visible in his forehead and jaw by stress, Edgar said roughly, "Yes."

Mona looked out at the children playing downstream. "I wouldn't be here if not for him."

"And I need his advice now," Kumari continued, holding back tears with all of her might. "We're fighting a war for the fate of humanity, for all of the multiverse; whole universes are being destroyed every minute of every hour of every day, but all the sentient beings of the cosmos have been united under the most vile man I have ever known. The Emperor is a tyrant in ways I can't even begin to describe to you. All personal freedoms are gone. Every single waking moment is spent in support of the fight. We eat when he says, we sleep when he says, we go to the bathroom when he says. He's caught me as a counter-sentiment rebel, but instead of execution he offered me a deal to work for him, and I don't know what's right anymore."

Mona squeezed her left hand against Edgar's right; their fingers had found each other while reading about Kumari's plight. Breathing out and returning to medical neutrality, she asked, "What can we do to help?"

"I've been trying to save my father for so very long, but it always ends the same way." Kumari looked away from the console for a long moment, trying to choose her words. "But I've never managed to speak directly with you before. This is the first time."

Edgar leaned forward slightly. "So maybe we have a chance to change the future?"

This was the part Kumari had dreaded. "We can't. It's very important that the disaster happens. The War of Wars would already have been lost without me here."

"You specifically?"

"Yes."

His laugh was short but sincere. "I knew it. I thought it was your father, but it was *you*. As long as you were with us, our luck was absurd. We were always showing up at the right places and times or escaping danger we had no business surviving. I still think back on those times and wonder how the hell we made it."

Mona studied his strained humor. "What do you mean?"

"Maybe it's a luck aura," Edgar elaborated. "I don't know. But it was a distinct phase of my life. We just got lucky over and over."

Above her console, Kumari let out a long breath. "Yes. That's why the Emperor hasn't just outright executed me. He needs me. I have the power to alter probability fields."

"Seriously?" Mona stared at the page as if it might produce answers. "Why not just have the Emperor trip and fall and die then?"

"The Emperor leaves nothing to chance," she responded unhappily. "Besides, I'm not sure we could do this without him. We work ourselves to the bone every waking minute, nearly a trillion of us, and we're still just barely maintaining parity. As he always puts it, our obstacles are exponential, but we are merely geometric, so we must work that much harder."

"You can't help us stop the end of the Second Tribe," Mona said with grim understanding. "Because it is how you came to be where you are."

Edgar nodded, confirming. His face was red, but not from the morning heat. "Kumari, I haven't seen him in two years, but I still consider Neil a friend. I'll help you find himif you help me get Mona out of the region in time."

Mona glared. "Belay that. I'm staying right here."

"No. Ken and his brother or sister are going to need you. You have to make a run for it now. Two weeks has got to be enough time to escape. It has to be."

"I was done," Mona shot back. "We were holding on for dear life in the abscess of massive tooth in the mouth of a beast the size of a continent and that man handed me his ticket outthe ticket *you gave him.* He made that choice knowing full well what it meant. Checking in on Rani and Kumari a few times a month doesn't even begin to make up for what he did for me; what fate he spared Ken."

Edgar accepted that, but still spoke. "I know that this hasn't been an ideal romance, and that we both work basically all the time, and if we were back home you probably would have chosen someone else"

She put a finger against his lips to silence him as she reminded him of conversations they'd already had long ago. "We don't live for ourselves anymore. Duty takes precedent over all. There will never be anybody else." Her dark eyes were utterly calm as she added a new oath. "I'm not leaving my postsany of them. We go right to the end."

Nothing more needed to be said.

The day was bright, warm, clear, and cool. The day was peaceful. As Edgar let the stress of accepting what was about to happen flow past him like the water flowing around his bare feet, he could detect no trace of the cloak of doom descending upon the world. 

"There's something else," Kumari wrote. "I'm not sure what to make of it. This didn't happen before, either."

From a place of pure logical readiness, Edgar asked, "What is it?"

"A parasitic infection of some sort. I don't want to say anything until I know more."

Mona watched the appearing text with concern. "Sounds like a job for the Surgeon General."

"Maybe." Kumari took a deep breath as she judged what to reveal and what to hide about the future. She read text that described Edgar's and Mona's concern as she thought about the limited information of her perspective. It was not just what to say or not to say; it was that she couldn't yet be certain what was happening. There was one thing, however, that she was certain of. That thing was a person she now felt she knew dearly. "Edgar, my father is back in the region, but every time we reached this point things went awry very quickly. I think you should find someone who I *know* can make a difference. You need to find Venita of Amber Three."

"The Angel of Battle?" Edgar read aloud, eyes widening. "The girl who supposedly took out Her Glory's artificial intelligence mountains all by herself?"

Mona reeled internally as she recalled the snow-covered aftermath; that ruined battlefield and that cave-wound in a fallen purple amethyst in which Edgar had lay dying. After that, the Vanguard had told the craziest of talesa lone helicopter crewed by unknowns, a lone redhead calling for the hopes of all who saw her, a lone run and a fight for the agesbut it had never sounded quite real having not been there herself. On another note, she wondered if that modified transmorphic sphere was still in her husband's stomach. It had been programmed to heal instead of harm, so they'd more or less forgotten about it.

"But she died," Edgar said, thinking as he always did of his stories rather than his own life.

Kumari sat a little taller to counter that.

Edgar continued, "The mountain exploded with her still inside."

Kumari sat a little lower. It did make sense that the men and women on the ground would have believed that to be the moment Venita had died. They wouldn't have known about the events on Amber Three.

"What events on Amber Three?" Edgar asked, confused.

"The book, it's" Kumari sighed with frustration. "Venita survived that, but then died on Amber Three."

"Then how am I supposed to find her?"

"No, Ishe's back now."

Mona leaned in over the book, eyes narrowed. "But we've determined that Grey Riders don't resurrect. We held Grayson's corpse until it was lost in the titan beast attack, and he never"

"No," Kumari interrupted, trying to remember all the elements in a head filled with shifting memories. Which timeline was the current one now? "Grayson wasn't a Grey Rider. Well, he was. But he joined under false pretenses. In every time line, he was a tremendous coward and liar."

Edgar wanted to leap to the man's defense simply out of misplaced loyalty to those he had once traveled with, but he could not forgive what Grayson had done. "He was a complicated man."

"Yes. But I don't have time to get into what he did, or the doomed sister Earth he was running from." Kumari pressed her index fingers into her temples and tried to sort out what advice to give. "Venita did resurrect like you, but I can only guess it has something to do with her ancestry. Even though her mother was a human Amber citizen, her father was a brownshirt."

"Oh." Edgar looked at Mona.

Mona looked at Edgar. "Oh!"

That meant something.

"But I never have managed to figure out why people in that era stopped dying," Kumari continued, her headache intensifying as she forced her neurons to give specific memories rather than multiple vague outcomes for any given remembrance. "I'm nearly out of probability flexion points. I can only influence the past a few more times before it's all over. I've been helping you survive, but it's nearly out of my hands now. You have to find Venita of Amber Three."

Edgar felt the call. "How?"

Kumari held a hand under her nose as blood began curling under her top lip. The warm stream from her nostril had made itself apparent. "She's coming to you."

"How will I convince her to help us?"

At that, despite the pain in her head, Kumari smiled. "You two have already met once before."

---

Venita stood by as her commander raised a hand and ordered the Vanguard finder known as Clint Alvarez to be hoisted high by the rope around his neck. It was a slow rise, not a neck-snapping hanging, and Clint began to turn red in the face as the rope pressed around his windpipe. It was against every rule of war she had ever been taught, but Beatrix of Amber Three, the mask she now wore, was a servile bureaucrat who would never countermand her superior.

Caseyalso a mask, secretly Cristina Thompson, the woman who had pushed the button and sent the Amber Worlds to their various doomsstepped nearer to Clint. As always, she asked about those who had used amethyst zygotes. Once believed to be suicide devices, it was now understood that the tiny amethyst pyramids sent their wielders on an unknown teleport to some extremely distant location. Only the Vanguard finders, men and women who could sense the path to any person or object they had previously interacted with, could find them now, and Clint's squadmate Bill Nash had used just such a device. Wherever he was, Nash would be at the same place as Cristina's lost husband Conn. **Where are they?**

Clint held his peace despite the growing redness in his cheeks. Two years of alternating lavish living and horrific torturethe carrot and the stick in repeating sequencehad never managed to break him or any of the other finders. They had been given a single chance to talk amongst themselves during the first few weeks, and that had been enough to form solidarity.

This time was different. This time, a voice had come across the radio and promised to get the finders to cooperate. **Let him be an example to the others,** Cristina said as she left the dimly lit and rust-walled room.

VenitaBeatrixremained in place as the other black-helmeted Grey Riders departed. Clint did not know she was there, for she'd remained silent, and she watched as he began to fidget, squirm, and cry openly as the choking restraints shot redness up his face and down his neck. He'd held out valiantly for two years, but to be left to die alone and in the dark surrounded by rust was a lonely and pathetic end beyond all others. Why didn't he cry out? Why didn't he beg? Why didn't he break?

He just cried. As asphyxiation began to take hold, as his body spasmed this way and that, he just silently let tears run. Venita watched with utmost empathy, but total inability: she could not blow her cover for one random man.

But this man had no idea he could not die.

Cristina Thompson knew.

But Clint Alvarez did not know that men of the Empire were unable to die.

He just hung there letting tears flow down his face and intermittent choking sounds escape his throat.

She only became aware of the single tear flowing down her own left cheek as she spoke. **Why won't you give in?**

He reacted with more violent spasms, clearly surprised by her presence. He managed to choke out a single word with two pain-spaced syllables: "Duuuuty."

Her combat knife was already in her hand before she made the decision, and her hand was moving back and forth near the rope as she consciously reaffirmed her choice. It didn't matter what cover need to be maintained. This could not go on.

The wiry red-faced brown-haired man fell to the rusty floor in a pile of snot and sweat.

She leaned down and whispered from behind her black visor. **Run.**

He visibly couldn't believe two years of torture had come to an end. He writhed on the floor until he managed to free himself from the ropes and then crawled for the door.

**Get up,** she insisted. **You can't get caught or we're both in trouble. Run left, right, right, left, wait until the guards pass, and then swim.**

"Left, right, right, left, wait," he rasped, his throat still raw.

**And then swim!** she hissed.

"And then swim."

She pushed him out into the hall.

He rolled, staggered to his bare feet, and then ran with only a single look back.

She waited in place for a time, but no alarm followed. It had been a risk, but a risk that her very soul had not allowed her to deny. In recent months, her superior had turned blacker and more brutal than ever before. It was... unsettling.

These thoughts remained with her as she returned to the underground base barracks and geared up. One base had blurred into another over the past two years as they had moved from ancient facility to ancient facility; the war was cold now, but the life was always one of edge and readiness. Her beloveds were the only steady strength that kept her in her carefully calculated position to manipulate both Cristina Thompson and Conrad II, husband to the Machine Empress of Mankind. Each of her three beloveds bore a ring under their black gloves, a ring in the Amber style of marriage that none could know about, but the same anonymity that was used to control all Grey Riders was also their cloak of privacy. Cristina knew her assumed name, Beatrix of Amber Three, but not her facenot even after two years of service. High commanders and officers did not unclothe in the same EM-shielded tents or concrete-surrounded bunkers.

But high commanders and officers did ride together, and Venita stayed close as their five squads totaling fifty men and women crossed jungle, flat clay, and open fields to approach the peace summit. Concord Farm was clearly an old moniker that no longer did justice to the thousand-mile stretch of snow wheat fields that the Empire undead had managed to plant as part of their Oath. It was a strange thing to see half a society walking around with spikes in the backs of their heads to keep them dead, but it was understandable through the lens of duty. The dead did not require food, and food was the key element that had determined all of their fates. How much food could the Empire produce after the Crushing Fist? Not enough, therefore three hundred and fifty billion had had to go. How much food could Amber Three produce? Not enough, therefore its leadership had retracted in favor of its own survivaltherefore its leadership had forced its own elimination.

As she rode, she touched her grey jacket above her heart. No scar remained from Legate Blue's sword, but the remembered sensation of being stabbed unto death had never left her. She glanced left at her black-helmeted grey-clad beloved Celcus, right at her black-helmeted grey-clad beloved Flavia, and behind at Sampson in the same. A strange sense of time winding down told her that not much was left, but two years of renewed life after dying once had been more than enough as a gift. Not everyone got to live twice, and not everyone got to have three soulmates. She could feel the end coming upon her as a vague shadow of time, perhaps chapter one or two of the final series of her era, but all she could do was smile alone inside her dark helmet, for the final fight would reveal itself soon.

And soldiers were flaring spirits upon the void of existence *most* when fights were needed; candles in the dark when violence and action were the only answers. Of this sense, she said nothing, not out of fear, but out of respect for the rivers of time. Some part of her ancestry told her that any personal pain she held was fleeting in the face of the Truth of eternity; her father and his kind before him had sworn an Oath, and, though she was not completely bound by it by virtue of also being part human, she understood why it was important.

Therefore she did not scream to Flavia and Celcus and Sampson to run.

Therefore she did not point her bike hard to the right and veer away from that region forever.


It was a song of sorrow and pain and Time that she heard on that ride, but she let that single tear run down her left cheek continuously. Because she was part human, she had let that man Clint Alvarez run for freedom despite Time telling her that, in its original flow, he had suffocated to death in that room and been left to continuously revive and suffocate over and over for two weeks alone. Because she was part being of light, she did not allow herself to run despite Time telling her that two weeks hence held nothing but a plunge over a cliff. Because she was a soldier, she remained steadfast.

There was work to be done.

And a massive vortex of grey seemed to be rising at some point ahead from some strange device to some unknown woman in the future. Nobody else saw it; could see it. The cycling vortex of energies that should not have been able to whirl let alone move now roared from land to sky to future, and she understood purely by father-given instinct: all of this had already happened. It was a curious sensation to feel oneself as part of the past rather than the present.

But that father-born feeling was overshadowed by the grin her mother-born drive had instilled in her. Peace with one's fate was one thing, but the ambitious human drive to overcome every obstacleeven fated Timefilled her with excited anticipation.

That was what human beings brought to the multiverse. It was a question her father's people had never been able to truly answer, for they had never truly understood it. This was a unique power in the cosmos: tell a human being he had Ten bearing against him, and that human being might summon the will inside himself of One or maybe even Two or Three; but tell a human being he had a Thousand or a Million or a Billion or even a Trillion coming down on him, and that same man or woman might flare with equally proportionate strength. Tell a woman of Amber Three that Time itself and Infinity and Fate were uniting to destroy her?

Her grin widened. The horizon was dark purple, but the rift to Concord Farm was closer, and she rode on through with blue flames burning higher along the edges of her soul.

Fifty-two other Grey Riders climbed down from their bikes with wary apprehensiveness, but she and the three that were always in tune with her walked with complete confidence toward the promised peace summit. Inside that basic wooden building and across the absurdly large circular table stood she of the promised Enemy, but not she of the white skin, for the same forces that had resurrected men and women of the Empire had apparently brought her back to life as well: Gisela, the Machine Empress of Mankind, stood opposite with flushed living skin that could even be described as tan. Flanked by a jade-armored white-skinned woman with ivory hair and a man scarred by horrible burns, the Yellow Empress watched with reserved regard.

To the right of the circular table stood what must have been the Senator Brace who had called the summit; beside him was a brown-skinned glasses-wearing woman whose eyes exhibited a blatantly sharp intellect. Beyond her and her aides was a red-haired woman at which Venita stared for the space of nine heartbeats. The red-haired woman stood at the back of the group representing Concord Farm, but it was she that seemed familiar most of all. Again that haunting song of Time chimed at the edge of her senses, and she tried to place who that woman could possibly be. A man stood behind her with a blonde baby girl in hand and a teenage son at his side.

"Why do I feel like I've seen you all before?" she wanted to ask, but she kept her words to herself behind her black visor. These people*these people*this was her Doom, her song of Time, her harbinger of the end.

It was the scarred man to Her Glory's left that spoke first. "We've also invited a representative of the Gemstone Hegemony, if that's alright with you guys. We met him a few months ago, and he's, well, rather unique."

What strange gem-born creature might that entail? That song of Doom and Time became overwhelmingly loud in her ears as Venita watched a young human boy clad in self-made clothes walk into the building. He was not gemstone at all, but red-cast light outside his door hinted at the ruby cube that waited above. It was this boyand that familyand Senator Brace's face had gone completely white as the blood drained from his cheeks in masked abject horror.

But the man himself said nothing of the sort. After a gulp, Senator Brace spoke. "Welcome to the regional peace summit."

The boy clutched his walking staff and gave no overt reaction.

Venita slowly turned her helmeted head to the right and stared at Senator Brace. His voice had been the one on the radio, and his voice had again reminded her of someone she had met once before. The pieces were all aligning for the ticking of the doom clock, and the weight was beginning to crush her.

"I gathered you all here today to discuss hope," Senator Brace said, beginning the summit. "I have on this table before me, in that plain wooden crate, a Seed of Hope that can grow a new Shield and thus create a homeland for all of us that is safe from the terrors of the multiverse at large." He looked to the brown-skinned glasses-wearing woman at his side, who nodded with determination, and then he continued: "But this morning's events have also forced me to bring another option to the table. This morning, the Waystation fell to forces unknown."

The Grey Riders shared black-visored glances; Her Glory looked to her jade-armored companion and her scarred advisor; the boy representing the gemstones made no move at all.

"I am forced to offer an overriding imperative," Senator Brace said with no small uncertainty. "I am advising that we run."

The grey-clad form Venita knew as Cristina Thompson had made no move the entire time. In her stead, far to her right, Conrad, the leader of her opposing faction, asked, **Run?**

"Evacuate," Brace reaffirmed. "By our model, this whole region will be destroyed in two weeks."

"By what force?" Her Glory's ivory-skinned, ivory-haired, and jade-armored escort asked.

The Senator looked both crestfallen and resigned. "Unknown."

"Then how could a two-week decimation possibly be predicted?"

Conrad spoke again: **What force could possibly overcome our combined might?**

The woman at Brace's side asked immediately, "Does that mean you're not opposed to the idea of alliance?"

The Machine Empress of Mankind spoke for the first time. "If he is not, then we are not as wellonly if my husband is willing to remove his helmet."

It was a momentary power play, but it had been played perfectly. Venita watched as one of her two superiors slowly unclasped his black helmet and revealed the short-cut brown hair and solemn face she had not seen in quite some time.

Conrad gazed steadfastly across the large round table. "Wife."

The Empress was, for a moment, just a woman. That blonde Germanic woman replied, "Husband."

More than words could express passed between their resigned and hopeful gazes, but Venita failed to grasp any of their private unspoken exchanges. The conversation slipped between her mental fingers and merged with the rushing waters of Time as they began to approach the coming cliff.

Senator Brace placed his closed fist on the table as those centuries of conversation receded. "We need to evacuate nearly two hundred billion people in two weeks if we can. At minimum, the fifty billion on this world. Whatever we save will be all that remains of this culture and these people."

Conrad peered at the boy that represented the gemstones, and, failing any response but an equal glare, he turned his sights to Senator Brace. "You speak as if disaster has already been assured. Why not go out, at the minimum, in a blaze of glory?"

The brown-skinned woman at Edgar's side spoke again. "We know who you are, Conrad."

"Oh? What advantage does that give you over me?"

"It's been two years, and a few defectors have told us more than enough. I don't pretend to understand what it's like to live for eight hundred years, but even you have to retain some understanding of sympathy for children. The coming nightmare will sweep them up as it will us, and they will suffer worst of all. Only a handful will survive what's coming. I can't believe any exciting battle is worth knowing that a generation of babies and children will be eaten alive and digested in the bowels of their enemies while they're still alive and unable to die."

For the first time in Venita's recent memory, Conrad had nothing to say. His braggadocios manner and cavalier attitude toward human suffering had been put on pause by the words of Edgar's partner. Conrad's usual quips and uncaring grin had been muted by a falling frown, and he glanced solemnly to his wife across the table. "The Machine Empress will have thought of something. She always does." The Germanic blonde seemed unhappy until Conrad elaborated, "The people could always count on her."

The very slightest hint of a smile crossed her expression, and Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind spoke again. "I *have* been working on something."

The rest of the room seemed relieved, but Venita already knew, no matter what it turned out to be, that the plan would failor, at the very least, not be nearly enough.

"It can hold a few million people if we really push it," the Empress said hopefully. "Maybe we can fight and use what I'm building to evacuate the wounded."

Senator Brace ran a hand down his face while his gaze remained fixated. "A few million."

"Yes."

"So a few million will survive."

"Yes, that is the intention."

Gisela did not understand the absolute sorrow on that man's face.

Conrad did not understand the absolute sorrow on that man's face.

Under her helmet, Cristina Thompson still did not move.

But Venita had learned the lay of emotions from a friend who could read them directly, and she understood that Senator Brace's expression masked complete resignation. Could he somehow sense the same thing that she had? The grey vortex of intermixing Time had come from this place, but had evaporated some few minutes before the summit.

One of Brace's advisors ran in and whispered something; Senator Brace waved the others after him, and the Machine Empress, the human gemstone boy, and dozens of Grey Riders followed to hear the radioed news about what was emerging from the Waystation.

Venita waved on her squad, and then waved on her beloveds, leaving herself alone in the wide empty building with the stock-still Cristina Thompson.

**Beatrix**, Cristina finally said. **Did you see?**

Venita waited.

Cristina reached up and unclasped her own helmet. Alone in that wooden building, she revealed her face for the first time in two years. It was then that Venita understood. Cristina had once chosen on a warm day by a river the name Casey, after her grandmother. Cristina had once chosen to dye her hair red after her pseudo-daughter at the time, Venita of Amber Three.

And Senator Brace also had a red-haired Casey behind hima red-haired Casey with the same face.

"That was my husband," Cristina breathed, grasping a wooden chair to keep herself up.

Venita offered, **Perhaps a doppelganger from another reality?**

"That was my adopted son," Cristina forced out. "A brownshirt. There is no other."

Giving pause at realizing there was another like her nearby, Venita then offered, **Perhaps a fluke?**

"No." Her commander seemed to shake with confused dark pain. "Beatrix, my lifemy life doesn't make sense"

Genuinely concerned for someone she thought of as a mother, Venita could only grasp her commander by the shoulder.

Cristina Thompson shook bodily.

**What can we do?** Venita asked.

But there was no easy answer. A woman with the same face and same assumed name had her adopted mother's familythe same family whose supposed distant location had prompted two years of increasing Vanguard finder torture. Had Cristina's family been here at Concord Farm this whole time?

Cristina Thompson did not cry. It would have been easier, Venita thought, if she had. Instead, the fire of war that had burned a multi-year split among the Grey Riders now burst into an inferno in the plane of the mind to match her own blue flames. Once among the caves she had seen Cristina Thompson make the decision to go to war, but this was far, far, far beyond that.

It was at that moment that Venita felt the two-week clock of doom begin to tick.

	<TEXT> I am not the type of doctor that usually gets emergency calls from patients, so I was definitely confused when my latest contacted me in the middle of the night and begged to see me right away. He seemed sincere enough that I told him I'd meet him at my office. That groggy half-awake choice is the only reason my family is still alive.

While I was putting on my clothes and trudging out to the car, I tried to remember everything I could about Anton. When he'd first come to us, he'd been deaf for about eight years due to an auto accident, so he was perfect for the trials. Of the twenty patients who'd undergone ear nerve regeneration therapy, he'd been the first to begin hearing again. He'd been so happy the last few weeks. I had no idea what could have gone wrong. I was so preoccupied that I didn't even notice the streetlights were out.

When I arrived at my office, he was already standing at the far corner of the parking lot nervously scanning the area. Cast in white by my headlights, he frantically waved his arms horizontally to get me to turn my car off and then wordlessly insisted I hurry and unlock the front door of the building. I was concerned, but had never known him to be violent or on drugs, so I got out my keys, held myself a bit guarded away from him, and opened the door. He slipped past me on the left as I entered, nearly knocking me aside before he took up position behind the floor-to-ceiling glass wall and continued peering out into the night.

His behavior more than warranted comment. "Anton, are you in danger? We should call the police."

He began to exclaim, "*No!*" but cut himself off harshly after the initial *nuh* sound and went bug-eyed. After another hurried scan out the window, he turned to me and whispered, "No police. They can't help."

Attempting to control his anxiety and help him focus, I held out an arm and led him into my office. Sitting down in a familiar setting by yellow lamplight appeared to help him, but he shook his head when I went to turn on the bright white overheads. Acquiescing, I sat behind my desk and let him explain himself.

"Doctor," he said with emphasis, as if my title was the whole reason he was coming to me. "I've been hearing things."

Despite my best effort, I let slip a microexpression of confusion.

Anton widened his eyes and hurriedly elaborated. "I know that's the whole point of the treatment, and I've been very happy with my progress so far. You guys have been great. The whole team. It's just that there's something more going on. Last week, I began to hear this absurd crazy choir of whistling like constant wind chimes during the day."

That was not a good sign. A flaw in the nerve regeneration process could create problems for our funding, and for the other patients. "Perhaps some form of tinnitis"

"No, no," he countered. "They were real sounds. It was super annoying and I spent all Saturday afternoon tracking it down until I finally found it. A bunch of people were blowing whistles at the dog park."

I frowned. "Some sort of protest?"

"No. *Dog whistles.* I could *hear* dog whistles."

At that, I sat up a little taller in my seat. An unexpected discovery in the process could create quite the opposite of problems for our funding. "You could hear dog whistles? You're certain?"

He nodded, clearly relieved that I was believing him so far.

"We can run tests to confirm, but that's fantastic. Not only has your normal hearing been restored, but your range of frequencies"

"**Yes!**" he said in a sudden emphatic whisper. "Hearing the dog park is one thing, but it didn't stop there. All week, it got worse."

Damn. I got out a pad of paper and a pen to take notes. "Go on."

Encouraged by that, he leaned forward in his chair and gripped the edge of my desk. "I first began to hear them on Monday."

"The Monday a few nights ago?"

"Yes. I didn't know what it was, but I chalked it up to my better hearing and tried to ignore it that first night. The longer I lay there in bed, the more the sounds began to come into focus. It was like this muffled wiggling sound coming from outside, but when I opened the window I couldn't be sure if it was louder."

I wrote it down, but remained uncertain. "It continued to get worse after that?"

He ran a hand back along his unkempt hair and sighed with relief at finally having his anxieties heard. "Yeah. Never during the day. Never when there's music playing or people around or the television left on. It's always at night when I'm alone. A feeling comes over me, like my body telling me I'm in danger for no reason, and then I begin to hear it. It's a rapid back-and-forth swishing sound, but dampened somehow, like it's coming from far awayor at least it's far away until I make a noise."

"Until *you* make a noise? You think these sounds are responding to you somehow?"

"I know they are," he insisted quietly. "They're swimming around out there looking for prey, like any living thing would be. See, that's what I figured out tonight, and that's why I called you. After spending every night all week listening to it, I finally got it. I'm hearing swimming sounds. They're all different, too. A pulsing octopus. Some fish, maybe. Sharks. Or other ocean things that I hear when I finally sleep, when I dream, things all screwed up and horrifying with screams and calls that would make you shiver for the rest of your life. I looked a bunch up on Wikipedia but the sight of them"

As he trailed off into visible rising anxiety, I stopped writing and held up a hand. "Whoah, Anton, let's just walk it back a step. If you think you're hearing swimming sea life, *where's the ocean?*"

He slowly raised his head to look me straight in the eyes. Behind his irises, a dark glare of sprouting madness burned. "All around us, Doc." I began to reach for my phone, but he drew a long knife from under his shirt and held it forward. Breathing hard, he whisper-shouted, "Don't you do it. You hear me out! I'm not crazy. I tried to tell my friends, I tried to tell my folks, everyone thinks I'm nuts. Just *listen to me.*"

This was the first time a patient of mine had ever gotten violent, but I knew the procedures. "Okay, Anton. I'll listen. You just bring the stress level in here down a bit and lower that knife."

"I'm not gonna drop it," he told me, his gaze sharp. "Just listen to me."

"Okay."

He waited.

I looked down at his knife and up at his face twice.

"Your pen and paper?" he said.

"Right." I lifted them carefully, eyeing him for signs of quick movement.

"Here's my reasoning, Doctor," he finally continued, returning to calmer and more formal speech. "I hear things swimming by all the time now. I try to stay where it's loudthe noise wards them off, like animals avoiding a boat. I went to a concert. I left the TV on. You know that feeling that you get when you're all alone and you just want to *run?* Like something's chasing you out of the dark, and you need background noise to feel safer?"

I gulped down an unhappy knot. "Yeah."

"It's *them,*" he whispered. "They *are* out there. But you see, I've got a problem now. That lamp on your desk, it's got batteries, right?"

The small yellow lamp had been a gift. "Yes."

"The rest of the world doesn't have batteries. The power's out in Los Angeles, New York, *and* here. They're coming for us."

The power was out? I hadn't even noticed, because he'd shaken his head when I'd tried to turn on the overheads.

"There's no music," he said with rising fear. "There's no television to leave on. They're swimming freely all over the city. They're closer than ever. And I have no way to avoid them." He turned his head as if listening to some nearby noise. "None of us do. They'll hear us."

Something occurred to me that I figured might just save my life. "Wait, so you hear wiggling sounds when you're alone and it's quiet?"

"Yeah." He seemed momentarily hopeful at my question.

"It's your ears," I laughed. It all made sense. "If your hearing's gotten that good, then when there's no other sources of sound, *you're hearing the microscopic life in your ear canal.*"

He froze as his anxiety found an avenue for explosive decompression. "Oh." He stared at me for a moment. "Like, super tiny things?"

"Yeah," I said, smiling at him as he lowered the knife. "Anton, you're gonna be fine. We'll figure out a way to dull your hearing a little so you don't have to hear them. Everyone's got tiny little bugs on them, visible only with a microscope. They can't hurt you."

But his anxiety didn't fall away completely. "I don't know. It sure sounds like I'm underwater and *things* are swimming all around me." He lifted the knife again.

"Where would there be an ocean?" I asked him. "We're in San Francisco. We're not deep underwater in some ocean filled with nightmare-things. Come on. Shout. Go on. Take a yell. Kick the false terror to the curb."

"I want to. I just"

"Do it. Be the good man I know you are."

Unsure what to do, he half-smiled, half-frowned, and then gave a weak yell of defiance.

"Good," I told him. "Again. Come on. Yell."

"Damn things!" he said louder.

I needed him to see that we were safe. "Yell. Yell, Anton!"

"Damn things, you're not real!" he shouted at the top of his lungs. "I'm not afraid of"

The next part has taken me a couple days to piece together memory by memory. There was an explosion of some sort, but lacking fire. The floor and the ceiling seemed to implode into each other, sending wood, brick, and glass shrapnel in every direction; my desk took much of the blast, but obviously since I'm still in the hospital I didn't escape unscathed. Anton disappeared in an instant among the debris, but, as I stumbled out the destroyed front half of the building, I saw no blood of any kind. He'd been entirely consumed.

Staggering to my car in the parking lot, I turned and had one good solid look at the aftermath. I'd been wrong. He had not been hearing microscopic life in his ear canals. I knew I was wrong because, before the rest of the building collapsed from the strain, I saw the shape of the attack that had done it. It was like looking at an apple after a biteabsolutely and undeniably the result of massive unseen jaws big enough to take out half of a two-story building in one crunch.

He was right. They *are* out there, and we *are* pursued by unseen creatures in the night. When you're alone, when it's quiet, and when you get that feeling to run and hide and stay silent, listen to it.

Just listen to it.

	<TEXT> For them, the tide had turned. The nightmare of the multiverse had turned into an inspiring dream of strength, camaraderie, and determination. Once just a vulnerable man afraid of spider-creatures, acid rain, and spectres with strangely colored eyes, Neil Yadav was now a human the way humans were meant to be. No campfire was needed, for he could see in the dark thanks to the meat of animals that had evolved on this rare sunless Earth. No clothes were required, for his skin was tough like the sea-serpents from the Earth before. No weapons were necessary, for his fists held the might of the titanic beast whose mass now made up the majority of his regenerating body. The same was true for his tribe of fellow survivors. A thousand other human beings rested without fear, for the various cruelties of the multiverse could no longer touch them.

As he reclined on a seat of oversized thorns that might otherwise have been lethally sharp, Neil watched the approach of an eyeless sniff-scavenger about the size of a dog. This Earth was sunless and eternally dark and fire-lit; its plants and animals had evolved to live on the magmatic heat the primordial landscape emanated. Here, scents were far more important than light. The sniff-scavenger's nose retracted as it found his hand. A ringed mouth gripped his arm and began to rotate in an attempt to saw off his arm. Curious, Neil studied the toughness of his own skin as the teeth skated and jumped without causing damage. The scavenger had nothing but instinct and simply kept at its hungry task. After several seconds, Neil thrust his arm in further, angled up with force, and ripped the creature's brain out through its open mouth.

Several bites of white neural matter brought the senses of this world alive in his mind, and he threw the rest of the brain toward the others. If they wanted the ability, it was theirs to take. He spit out the rest and frowned until the last of the mealy sliminess was goneeating exotic animals was one thing, but enjoying the experience was another.

Breathing in, he marveled at sudden new beauty. It was not like sight and it was not like hearing. It was something else entirely, something akin to peering through an ocean from beneath, and he moved his head back and forth to sniff the gradient scents on air that he'd previously considered overwhelmingly sulfurous. Now, the sulfur smell was neutral, and a fog of plants and animals leapt into his awareness. Over there was a patch of thorn-vines. Beyond that was this world's version of a field mouse. To his right was a reptilian snake, its unique aroma tangy.

After a time, the others began stirring. They were collectively incapable of true sleep, which Neil knew meant they were still dead somehow, but he was unsure how to feel about that. The continental beast's flesh had replaced much of their own mass and thus granted them the titan's incredible regeneration and adaptation, but, despite being whole, subtle signs hinted that they were somehow not yet alive again. To sleep, to dream, to shut off the world for a time and go into realms of the mindthese things were denied them. But what was life and what was death when animation and strength were the same in either state? Perhaps this was humanity's next true form. He watched the others begin to stand and stretch for the final run. That was certainly what they believed, but he remained uncertain. Some part of him missed dreaming, and another part worried that Kumari would not recognize him. She would be nearly three now, and he'd been out of her life for longer than he'd been in it. For a moment, he thought he could feel her somewhere distant and alone, desperately needing her father. To that feeling, he stood and said quietly, "I'll find you. I promise."

---

Kumari sat staring at the text on the console. Could he really have?

No. She blinked away moisture and refocused with grim certainty. Her memories had not changed, which meant she had not managed to change the past. Her father would fail to find her; *had* failed to find her. Two decades before, he had been lost in the region-wide disaster along with most everyone else. That hadn't changed.

She pushed down her emotions and continued reading.

---

Only an hour into their run, Neil smiled. They were almost home. A recognizable massive rift dominated the horizon, quietly scattering all the colors of light upon the mountain range in the distance. Among the molten glows wounding the land between here and there rode that same small fleeing figure that had managed to stay just ahead of them the entire journeythey'd crossed nightmare worlds, lush havens, everything in between and even human-populated cities, yet that rider was always just out of reach. Whoever it was, they seemed very determined to avoid the Good Word, and they would cross the inter-branch rift and find the Waystation first.

A technicolor storm raged around them as they ran into that rift that marked passage not just between realities, but between two very different *types* of realities. Neil was glad to leave it behind, for despite some worlds containing humans and civilization, there'd been something very different about the Earths of that base branch once they were free of the titan's stomach and able to see for themselves. Those Earths had been darker, quieter, blanketed by a sense of uneasiness, and full of solitude and haunting fears. As he burst out into sunlight among his tribe, he threw his arms wide and embraced a return to a base branch where it was actually possible to win the day. Alongside the others, he began running at full speed toward the high ridge and massive chrome wall that had to be the Waystation. They'd had two years to build better defenses, and he could see with his engineer's eye that they'd done well. It even seemed likely that they'd had a little help from the Machine Empress, for bits and pieces of its great gate glowed yellow or violet as it opened briefly to admit the lone rider.

As the gate closed, the other runners began to slow. Seeing the problem at the same time, Neil came to a halt among his fellows. Standing barefoot on warm rock, he stared.

What he'd taken for biomechanical conduits were now clearly something else entirely. Massive fibers ran along the ridge like veins of what looked like neural tissue. Many draped the chrome wall and ran down into the Waystation proper. Was this some sort of new organic defense? It was not often that the others had spoken on the long run, but as a group they began reviving language by murmuring to one another. Cheng and Showman found him; together, they cautiously approached the high shining barrier of metal and stood before the gate that had only just closed to keep them out.

Figures appeared above and shouted down in some garbled language.

Cheng turned and said, "Something's wrong."

Neil looked to his right at Showman, who had eaten a keen-sighted bird not long before. Showman's face tightened as creeping horror undermined his usual confidence. "There's something *on them*. Ridges or fibers of some sort on their temples. It's hard to see. It looks like some sort of parasite or infection connected to their eyes."

A few shouted questions followed, but no answer was forthcoming from above. "Is it possible it's something they did on purpose?" Cheng asked. "Or has something infected them while we've been gone?"

The terror hit him like a bolt to the chest. "Kumari!" With that shout, Neil found himself running toward the gate. They were a tribe in a manner greater than a simple community, and the others felt his urgency and matched it with concerns of their own. Each of them had family or friends for whom they worried; Neil could feel Cheng's fear for the son he'd never met.

The figures atop the gate continued to shout with strange intonations and unfamiliar words, but the intent was clear, and they did not wait longer than was appropriate against a threat. The first bullets rained down like sleet, penetrating chests and heads and limbs with murderous force.

Neil felt a punch to his lower abdomen and a kick to his shoulder, but he shrugged them off and continued running; his regenerating flesh whipped back into shape and function in seconds. But how to get past this smooth wall of metal? Climbing was not an option, and even their great strength would not be enough to batter through directly. Analyzing the gate, he ran to its corner. The aperture was about ten times the height of a person and quite thick, but it had been designed to resist assault from perpendicular directions. Slipping his fingers in divots in the rock the gate had made swinging back and forth, he shouted, "Lift!"

While a hundred chattering stars opened up above to rain down machinegun fire, his fellows swarmed around him and began lifting alongside. The gate's mechanized hinges shrieked with tension that had not been accounted for in its design, and, moment by moment, it began to rise.

Neil felt Cheng's analysis as the other man glanced upward: the infected figures above were locking heavy artillery into place, but they would not be quick enough. Something in the wall snapped, shaking the earth. Just before the gate could be lifted completely off its hinges, something to the side opened from the rock ridge itself and unleashed a tidal wave.

He should have expected it. After all, he'd helped build it. The wave of horrifically strong acid, collected from this world's uncommon rains in basins high above, now pulled him in torrents away from the gate and back down sloping rock. He could feel pain all around him as it took the others and dashed them against boulders or drowned them. His own skin was chafing away with each eddy that tore at him, and a moment of absolute terror overtook him as he remembered sitting on a boulder under a hastily made cover of wood and desperately hoping that the acid rain would not fill the valley high enough to reach him and the family he'd hid with.

Human beings were punching bags for the horrors of the multiverse.

But he was no longer just human.

He'd been rebornand, for all that it meant against this particular danger, that rebirth had been in acid.

The wave of acid fell short of his head for a moment, and, with what neck and head flesh remained, he shouted, "Kumari!"and began pulling his way forward along the rocks with bone fingers. The acid defense had killed a young titan beast with the same regenerative ability, so it was a threat to take seriously, but he couldn't let this be the end. Through mind-burning body-wide pain, he began to advance again.

The others surged with his determination. The meat and skin the acid had torn away were not regenerating, but there was more to them than that. There was undeath; there was the inability to die that had come upon the Second Tribe just when it had needed it the most. As half-melted living corpses, they continued toward the gate, and, now smaller in size and weight, they were able to begin squeezing in the gap they'd made underneath while rocket propelled grenades tore apart those behind.

Neil gasped horridly through lungs open to the air as he rose to his feet inside the Waystation. It'd grown tremendously in their two years absent, but a major path had still been left open for the fleeing threats, monsters, and wildlife that had been using it as a path away from the cold. On this path, dozens of terrified and confused soldiers were running to and fro, and Neil grabbed the first and said, "You've got something in your temples!"

The infected man didn't seem to understand him, and said something in gibberish.

"It's not letting you talk to me!" Neil shouted at him, trying to get the man to get past the fact that a half-melted zombie was grasping him. "I'm going to try to pull it out."

While random bullets began pelting him from afar, he began pulling at the nerve fibers under the screaming man's skin. The fibers in turn pulled at the man's eyes, and Neil winced. "Sorry!" He pulled harder, and, miscalculating his own strength, he said sorry again as the man died in his arms. The fibers had been attached to important parts of his head, and his brain had been partially torn out.

Almost immediately, the soldier re-opened his eyes.

Neil sighed with relief. Humans were still unable to die. That meant he hadn't accidentally murdered somebody.

The soldier leapt back and held his head to keep his brains in. "What the hell is wrong with you?"

"I can understand you!" Neil said back, ignoring the rise in concentration of bullets.

The other man stared. "I can understand you now, too."

Around them, Neil's undead fellows were following suit and attacking the defending soldiers to rip the parasitic nerve fibers out of their heads. "What's going on? When did this thing take over?"

The soldier turned his gaze to take in the strange ridges and tissues on his comrades' heads and faces. "What is that? *What is that?*"

Neil shook him roughly. "You mean you didn't know? You didn't know you were infected? It's right there on their temples, in their eyes!"

"I've never seen it before!" the other man screamed back at him. He began backing away as he saw the draping conduits of nerve fibers hanging on the wall and nearby buildings. "What the hell is going on?"

"If it could control what you were saying, it was probably controlling what you saw, too," Neil said aloud, eyes wide as he processed the enormity of what they were up against. While the soldier turned and began attacking his fellows to try to get them to understand that they were under the influence of some sort of perception-controlling infection, Neil walked forward, out of the battle, and over to the other side of the Waystation where a flood of infected evacuees were running on foot and in trucks back toward the lands of the Second Tribe.

He knew those ridges and valleys. He'd walked them as a mundane human being years before. They'd held awe and danger then, but now they only held a landscape-sprawling infection of nerve tissues spread out over forests and rock alike.

Something horrible had happened while they'd been gone, something beyond comprehension at that moment. It was likely the entire Second Tribe was in danger. 

His feet and arms were beginning to regenerate as the acid wore itself out. Stumbling forward, he said again, "Kumari!" Heading after the screaming evacuees as they fled in terror, his engineer logic cut through his own abject terror and gave him a basic concept to work with. Who could possibly help against a threat of this magnitude? There was one man he knew he could count on to have survived the last two years. He would know what to do. "Edgar!"

---

There were many steps involved in rebuilding after the New Exodus, but, to Edgar, the true spark of civilization was reborn on an otherwise inauspicious day in early summer nearly two years before. Mona had been pregnant at the time, and shed sent him out to forage for a particular herb that she was craving that could only be found in the nearby spider-forest. On the way, a friend had waved him over from the main road with a sly, Look at this.

Someonesome incredible modern-day herohad carried a window-mountable air conditioner in their truck during their flight from the Empire. All it needed was a bit of electricity from Concord Farms new solar panels and, of course, a window. As that familiar vibration and hum had spun to life and as that coolness had wafted across his face and brought that particular artificial smell that he remembered so strongly, hed alternately laughed quietly and cried openly. Civilization was back. The world as he had known it most of his life would be coming back! It would take cooperation, luck, and a hell of a lot of hard work, but it was all possible again. Computer games, soda, grocery stores, television, Starbucks, schoolsthese were no longer just painful memories of the home they had lost. The human race was no longer in exile.

The trip to the spider-forest abandoned, hed burst back into his tent and declared to Mona, Im running for Senate!

And that had changed everything. Riding a wave of popularity from the earlier spread of his squads story, the vote was a landslide, and he suddenly had people listening to himand, crazier, asking for things. Can we build more houses? Can we build a school? Can we increase food rations? Can we dig more wells? Can we construct more air conditioners? On and on the needs went, to the point where he would have broken down in panic if not for Caseys support and help. As the heart of Concord Farm, she and her family had already been going about the business of community organization long before hed even arrived that day in the truck with Neil, Showman, Cantey, Mashburn, and Grayson.

But there was no help for his current task. The summer heat was absurd even without a shirt on. He leaned on the latest layer of bricks and sighed wearily as sweat dripped from his nose. If hed had Kendricks strength or Randys technical know-how, this might have been an easier job, but as it stood he had to finish this add-on to the house himself because thats what hed promised to do. Their two-room cabin was a palace by current standards, but the add-on was specifically a nursery and already quite late. Their son Ken hadn't had the luxury; their coming child would need the space.

But his daily hour of solo construction was over. It was time to get back to the Seed of hope and the peace summit and the return of human beings to the Waystation and a thousand other issues.

Or, rather, it was time for *them* to find *him*. He splashed water from a rain barrel on his face and then put on a shirt as one of his advisors came running down the road. By the time the young man arrived, Edgar was passably proper in the clothes Mona had picked out for him, and, with the best Senatorial air he could muster, he asked, "What's wrong?"

All that went out the window with the reply: "The Waystation has fallen."

He processed that for a moment. The night before, they'd said that his former squadmate Carmen had arrived exhausted and at the end of her strength with a baby boy on her back; an hour after her appearance, hundreds of men and women had emerged from the rift and begun making their way across that final valley. How had that situation resulted in *this?* "Any word as to how?"

"Some reports came in over radio channels," the young man continued. "But Carmen's here. She rode all night."

There was only one course of action. Spinning up his calculating gears, he said, "Take me to her."

Down the long main road, beyond the community buildings and through several doors, the woman Edgar had known as strong and implacable was now laid out on a cot weak, sick, and grim. Casey was already there taking care of her while Cade and Trent, her husband and son, were running around getting supplies. A woman whose name he'd forgotten was holding Carmen's son, and a half-dozen other people were circled around the cot, but Edgar did a double-take as he saw Ward Shaw standing at the back against the wooden wall.

Later, he told himself. For now, he approached Carmen, kneeled by her, and gripped her hand. "How's it been?"

She smiled widely, took a deep breath against her own exhaustion, and then let tears flow forth from her eyes at finally finding someone she could trust. "In my bag."

He looked up quickly. "Where's her bag? Her bag, people!"

Urgent hands found it and handed it to him; he pulled out the book he'd given her two years before.

A hand fell on his shoulder. Behind him, Casey said calmly and quietly: "Are you sure you know what you're doing with that?"

She'd been his mentor in many things, but with this, he had personal experience. "Yes." Looking beyond her at Ward Shaw, he watched for the giant's nod, and then opened the bookbut instead of asking about what had happened to Carmen or what fate had befallen the Waystation, he employed the plan he'd been thinking about ever since a friend dear to him had done the same thing eight centuries before. Wecelo had asked out of simple curiosity, but Ward Shaw had once warned that they were being watched.

He took a deep breath and then said, "Connect me to whoever's reading about us in the future."

---

Kumari sat back as the tower of technology that held the book began lighting up and whirring to a degree she'd never seen before. The room grew warm around her. With a combined feeling of terror and hope, she asked, "Hello?"

Text appeared on her screen: Edgar sighed with relief. He said, "Yes, I can hear you. Or rather, read your words in the book here."

She laughed with untold relief and overwhelming burgeoning hope. "I've finally reached you."

"Apparently so. Mind explaining why you're watching us? Who are you?"

"It's me," she said, struggling to speak through her own relieved laughter. "It's Kumari."

"What? No way."

"Yes. Neil's daughter; you knew me as a baby sixteen years ago."

"That's amazing. Here I thought we were being spied on by an enemy. How's your life gone?"

"There's no time for that. We need to talk. *Right now.*"

Edgar gave a slow nod. This was not unexpected. "I'm all ears."

	<TITLE> Be careful where you do your taxes this year </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-18 00:01:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I like to think I have a little trick for saving on my taxes. I do them on every tax website I can find before going with the one that gives me the best numbers. My friends call it an excessive waste of a week, but I know it's worth it. Thing is, I put my trust in the wrong website this time around, and I don't know where to turn.

The biggest hint should have been its newness. This was the first time I'd ever seen it, and it was so new there were only a few mixed reviews by other tax hounds like myself. Not one of them had gone for it yet despite describing its numbers as 'admittedly the best return.' Some cited a sense of unease, and one or two chalked it up to not trusting an unknown site. After all, the risk of fraud had to factor in to the equation.

I did my taxes on it, and, like usual, stopped before hitting submit. The number was absurdly good. Normally I paid at least twenty grand in taxes on my 1099 income each April, but this website was showing that I'd get a *return* of about five thousand. I hadn't gotten money back in a decade. I had no idea how this was possible, and, suspecting a scam, I began reading through the legalese.

It was buried in the fine print on the help page, but it was there: this website achieved huge deductions by using a new and obscure loophole. Apparently, thanks to our recent new leadership, it was possible to exempt oneself from useless social services and keep all of your tax money except for the part that went toward national defense.

I liked the sound of that.

But I still hesitated.

Taking a night to think about it, I invited my friends over to my place. As usual, they agreed that taxes were theft of *my* hard-earned money, but they weren't receptive to deeper levels of discussion. I understood. I often took it a little further than most. These guys just had a CPA do their taxes for them. They didn't *get it.* They just weren't as sharp as I was.

The moment they left, I decided to go with that new tax website. I clicked submit and watched my accounts like a hawk. Everything seemed on the up-and-up. Nothing extra was taken, and the IRS electronically confirmed. It wasn't a scam as far as I could tell.

The one odd thing was that my refund had to come in the form of cash. The very next morning, I checked my mailbox and found a thick envelope on top of the usual junk mail. I opened it carefullyand then quickly closed it again while scanning the street. It was a nice enough neighborhood lined with old trees, big houses, and small children playing on lush green yards, but one can never be too careful. The envelope was stuffed with thousands in cash. A businessman in a suit stood at a distant corner, but, as I eyed him warily, he just watched from afar. He was nobody. I clutched the envelope to my chest.

The glee I felt at that moment was fantastic. I was smarter than all the other tax hounds and I'd managed to get back an enormous amount that they'd been too scared to shoot for. I was worried my smile would extend right off of my face, and I practically dashed back into the house.

That great feeling faded as I spread the five thousand dollars on my kitchen table and realized that there was something wrong. The bills were dark blue. Weirder still, they were slightly warm, as if they'd just been printed. Counterfeit. These were counterfeit bills. They'd scammed me after all. *My* money must have been re-directed to their accounts. I smashed my coffee mug on the hardwood floor before managing to get my bitter anger under control. What to do? Right. Call the police. They'd sort this out.

The phone rang a few times before a female voice answered with a tired spiel containing the police department's name and county. "How can I help you?"

I gave my name and said I had a counterfeit money and tax scam to report.

"Hello? Is anyone there?"

Glaring, I took in a breath to demand answers, but I caught sight of something dark, tall, and spiny across the street. Looking again, I saw nothing but a clear road with children playing on the opposite lawn. Disturbed and confused, I asked, "Can you hear me?"

"If there's anyone on the line, please call 911 if this is an emergency. Otherwise, have a good day." A click followed.

My phone buzzed as a text message from an unknown number arrived. It said: *Law Enforcement agencies included under opt-out agreement. Please refrain from wasting department resources with frivolous calls.*

I stared at my cellphone until it automatically went dark. The opt-out program was real? Fine. I could take care of myself. I didn't need the police. But if this was realI looked again at the blue cash laid out on my table. Maybe I hadn't read closely enough. Surely something confirmed with the government had to be genuine in some respect. Were these a new style of currency I'd simply missed hearing about?

Curious, cautious, and still a little angry, I stacked the cash, stuffed it in a pocket, and went out for a drive in my BMW. Just as I was leaving my neighborhood, I thought I saw something large and horrific in my rearview mirror, but when I looked back nothing was there. Growing increasingly unnerved, I headed to the nearby Whole Foods. I surveyed the parking lot, but saw no sign of the large black blur I'd noticed in the corner of my vision twice now.

I wandered the aisles for a few minutes looking for something random and cheap to attempt to buy with my blue cash. I settled on a can of soup and headed up to the front with it one hand and a blue twenty in the other. "Do you take these?"

The cashier was a young twenty-something with floppy hair. He took the twenty and peered at it. "Yeah, why wouldn't we?"

After a moment of tense confusion, I decided to ask directly. "What does that look like to you?"

"Twenty-dollar bill," he replied, not sure what I was after.

"Alright..." I took normal green-dollar change in return along with a few coins. "Thanks."

"You have a good day, sir."

The blue dollars had worked. Had the cashier been colorblind? Or had I just missed some sort of new currency introduction? Just as I stepped out of the store, I leapt back from another sudden flash of black to my right.

Again, nothingbut whatever I was seeing was getting closer each time.

Before I could think too much more about it, I looked left and saw a tow truck hitching up my BMW. Running over to the cop and tow truck driver, I demanded an answer. The tow truck driver ignored me in favor of continuing his task; the cop peered at me for a second as if he was having trouble seeing me. Then, he said, "Oh. This your car? Yeah, gotta impound it."

Feeling overwhelmed by strangeness from every angle, I asked, "*Why?*"

The cop's attention drifted back to the car. He failed to answer.

Shouting fruitlessly over the noise of the tow truck lifting up my BMW, I weighed the risk of getting physical with the two men. Before I grew desperate enough to try it, I felt the torn-open envelope crinkling in my pocket opposite the cash, and I retreated to another corner of the parking lot to pull it out, study the return address, and look it up on Google Maps.

My heart sank as the internet refused to work. Asking to borrow a passerby's phone, I tried their internetbut it didn't work either. I had to give them some of my blue cash to have them type it in, and they told me it was a business location downtown. Again I paid them to call me an Uber, and then I was on my way to get some answers.

The businessman I'd seen in my neighborhood was waiting on a bench outside the high-rise building. As I climbed out of the Uber, he waved me over. He had slick-backed black hair and carried a briefcase, but I knew enough about briefcases to guess that this one was mostly empty. Behind his very expensive suit, he somehow sat both stiffly and nonchalantly. He was not in the least perturbed by my wild eyes and loud voice. He held up a hand to silence me. "Your car was impounded because it was caught illegally using the roads."

After a second or two spent deciphering his thick Middle Eastern accent, I sighed with unhappy realization. "The opt-out."

"Yes."

"So what is it?" I demanded. "I can't use the roads, I can't use the internet, I can't call the police?"

"You've opted out," he said with a matter-of-fact tone. "You believe you're a self-made man who did it all himself, so now you get to keep everything you make, exactly as you've always wanted."

I was just barely holding on to my rage at that point. "*Have you been spying on me?*"

"No." He held up a single finger and pointed at me. "It's simply our target demographic for this project. You of all people should understand a metric like that."

Actually, I did. If I was going to get out of this, I had to speak his language. "So where do you make profit on something like this?"

"We profit every time you spend your blue dollars," he said with an uncanny smile that was not quite right. "Think of it as a form of debt. And consider this conversation part of our contract. Because of certain rules, we *must* inform you that when you run out of blue money, we will own you."

I wasn't stupid. I knew that this was a bit more than a scam. I just wasn't willing to believe, not yet, not fully, that I was dealing with more than the natural world. In either case, I had to pry more info out of him. "Then I just won't spend it. I'll just use regular money."

"You're welcome to try." His grinsomehow, impossiblywidened further. "Good luck doing your job without the internet or the use of roads. You'll spend your blue dollars just to eat, and then we will have you."

"Then I'll go off the grid. Find some piece of land somewhere and just grow my own food," I countered, studying the smiling mask of his face for any clues.

His grin touched the edges of his cheeks, threatening to expand right off of his face the way mine had earlier that morning. "You know as well as I do that *everywhere* is owned now. That's why this particular type of project didn't use to work. I gave up on this one when the last man I tried it on simply went out to the 'Wild West,' as they called it, and started a new life as a farmer."

There it was. He wasn't lying. I knew it in my heart. I'd told a lie or two in the pursuit of profit, and I could tell. This man had actually been alive in previous eras, which meant he was not just a human being. "Then I'll go north. I'll find somewhere nobody goes, and"

The businessman shook his head. "You see, we've upped the effort on this one a little bit, because we can't really be having this type of reaction anymore." He turned and nodded his head toward a black blur on a distant corner. "I think you will now spend your blue money on defense."

Black blurry lines sharpened into what looked like a ten- or twelve-foot tall insect on six jointed black legs. A spiked head in the shape of a shield moved back and forth as it extended several dark horns and made a snapping noise.

"Time to run," the businessman said. "I'd start now."

And so I did. At first, I was just running for my life in panic, but I turned toward a church two blocks down and dove inside on pure instinct. A priest was there lighting candles, and he turned at the noise of his doors opening. I walked up and asked for helpbut he had trouble seeing me. It was then I knew. I had not just opted out of material services: I'd opted out of whatever shared spiritual bubble humanity held that helped protect its members from *them.* As I ran toward another exit, the massive demonic insect skittered right inside, down the aisle, and past the priest. He was oblivious and safe from it.

Cars do outrun the thing. I paid a taxi to take me to another city with my precious blue dollars and bought myself some time, but I'm down to less than four grand after that trip, and I can feel that the *thing* is still coming after me. I wrote up this story and paid someone to post it online for me in a desperate search for help. I can't be the only one, can I? Without the police, without roads, without communication, without even the solace of a church, what can we do? There has to be more of us. We could work together, form a groupa community, even. Please. There has to be more than just me in trouble this way.

I can't make it alone!

	<TITLE> The Insect In My Brain </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-11 00:04:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever had an itch you can't scratch? I once watched a documentary about people who had lost limbs but still had itches in places that no longer existed. From what I saw, it slowly drove them crazy, because it was all in their head. I sympathize, but my problem's a bit worse than that. Try as I might, I can't scratch *memories*, and I certainly can't squash the bugs that have gotten in them.

I first noticed the original insect when I was talking about an old story with friends. We were out for a drink at a bar, and a strange spiked-shell bug about the size of a dime began crawling across the table between uswait, no, that's not how it happened! They're in my memories, you see? That bug is skittering through my memory of the bar *now*, it wasn't there the first time. I know because I wrote it down! I trust my writing.

No, the first bug I noticed was in a story I was recounting at the bar. I was talking about a concert I'd gone to about six years before, and I began describing a horrifying little bug that had crawled over my hand while I'd sat in the grass. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen, and I went on and on describing it; my friend had been there, but he didn't remember the incident. Another friend confirmed. That led me to the strange notion that I was remembering events incorrectly.

But I could *see* the bug. As much as it made me shudder, I focused my inner awareness upon the memory, and I watched it wander around the grass. Was I remembering it differently from moment to moment? It had a dark blue shell with tiny spines; the sight of it triggered innate disgust and revulsion, but I couldn't control the me in my memory and jump away. Whenever I did try to move away, the bug vanished from sight, because I was really just imagining the motionactive change brought me out of memory and into imagination.

For that first week, most of my mental time was spent watching that bug. As I sat at work or in the car on the commute, I was only half-present, for my other half was at that concert six years ago watching a horrifying bug crawl upon oblivious friends and strangers. They were just memories clapping along to the music or drinking beers in clear plastic cups, but it still made me shudder to watch it crawl up their arms or around their faces. At one point, it fell into a sloshing beer and got trapped trying to move its repulsive little legs fruitlessly back and forth in the amber froth, and I thought my troubles were over.

I called up that friend and asked if he remembered a weird bug falling in his beer at that concert. He said that he "did, yeah man, at least I think. When was that again? Six years ago? Yeah, I think I remember that."

He didn't seem convinced, and I began reading up on how memories are formed. Apparently, memory is very untrustworthy, and people form false interpretations of events all the time based on prompts and a little unconscious imagination. Did he really remember the bug in his beer? Or had I prompted him to envision something that had never happened?

Of course, I had other things to worry about at the time, so I let it go for a bit. Instead of staring at the bug at the concert six years before, I spent my nights staring at the divorce papers on my kitchen table. In some ways, my empty apartment was like the palace of memory I'd been reading about: every object and corner held some mental tag to a previous event, now soured and full of lies.

The second time it happened, I was sitting at that table staring at a particular paper cup that had been left out for several months. Like the concert, it was another memory of her; we were at a coffee shop doing nothing in particular when a smaller bug began crawling up her cup. It was not the same bug from before, but it was dark blue, spined, and clearly the same species. She just kept smiling. Did she not see the horrifying *thing* moving down her fingers and along the back of her hand?

This time, instead of being captivated by the insect, I tried not to think about that coffee shop. If I just didn't go near that memory, then everything would be alright.

But no. I could feel a *festering* outside the edges of my awareness, and, next time I lookedonce I finally couldn't help it anymoreI also saw a number of small dots along the side of the coffee cup. I watched them day in and day out until they grew larger. Then, I knew. They were eggs.

I continued going to social events and nodding along to conversations as my friends talked around me, but I couldn't really hear them. All I could think about was the disgusting horror growing in my mind. What would happen when those eggs hatched? How had the smaller bug gotten to a different memory from the concert? At times, someone would ask me if I was alright, but I just smiled and claimed that I was. How could I tell them that my brain was becoming infested?

Books. Articles. Online research. You know what's amazing? Lucid dreaming actually worked for a little while. Each night, I practiced keeping my awareness as I sank into dreams. There, the fusion of imagination and memory allowed me to act for the first time, and I rushed forward, slapped the bug off her hand, and stomped the coffee cup and its dime-sized black eggs.

But when I woke up, I found that I'd just worsened the problem. I'd created a new memory of the coffee shop, the slapping, and the stomping, but the original memory still existed. Try as I might, I could never alter the original memory, and on the fifth successful lucid dreaming attempt I missed a few of the eggs and found that I'd just created more.

I was no longer staring at divorce papers on the kitchen table. Now, those were buried under piles of bills. I'd pay them eventually. I still went to work and sat through my day; I had money. I just really needed to deal with this infection of the mind first. After I paid the bills, I'd shower, too.

As I'd feared, they began wandering into other memories.

A woman approached me at the bar before my friends arrived, but all I could think about was how any memories I created with her would just be infested sooner rather than later. What's a pretty face with bugs crawling on it?

At home, in the car, at work, out with friends, I was near to screaming every moment of every day. Two bugs, six bugs, ten. Fifty bugs, a hundred, a thousand crawling along every moment of the last six years of my life. Worse, they were starting to crawl on *me*, and I could feel their horrible little legs as itching on my skin. Scratching my real arms didn't helpthe itch was on remembered skin, for the bugs were on remembered limbs. 

Friends asked about my nervous itching and now-visible tension, but I just kept smiling and saying I was alright. There was no way to share this problem. They'd never believe me. They'd never understand.

So, I stopped going out with them.

The itching began small, but grew to maddening over the course of time. Scratching did nothing, even if I scraped down to lower layers of my skin. I turned to online research again, and I read about reflection therapy; those who had lost a limb and had itches there could assuage it by using a mirror to simulate the missing area while scratching the real one.

It was all in the mind, they said.

Real mirrors wouldn't work for me, because the itch was not on a physical spot lost. What would work? At home and itching in the dark among piles of discarded fast food bags, I began envisioning an imagined version of me. He was happy, successful, and loved. Life was good for him. Brush the bugs off of me, I told him, and he came close and began slapping them away and stomping on their overturned and scrambling forms. For a moment, it worked.

But then the bugs covered him, too, and nickel and dimed his flesh until he was just bones. He screamed while it happened, but only in that half-heard hollow sense that imagined sounds hold.

Traumatized and demoralized, I kept doing research, kept telling myself I would beat this, that bugs in my memories had to have a vulnerability. If I began with the assumption that they were real, then they were creatures of the mental plane somehow. What connected them to my physical self? What *was* consciousness? Scratching open sores constantly, stinking to high heaven, and constantly muttering to myself, I knew I was at my wit's end. I could see it. I could see myself. In the mirror, the bugs were crawling upon my skin openly. It was awareness. It was thought.

It was all in the mind, they'd said.

That's what this note is about. I've crafted a careful plan, done my research, and mapped out as much as I could, but I'm still quite aware of the danger. I want you to know that I'm not insane, and that it's not your fault. I also want it on the record that my friends had nothing to do with this; I stole the knives and drills without their knowledge. I've sanitized everything and set up as sterile an operation room as I can. I'm not crazy. This is really happening, and it's the only way. I already know I'm right because I've made one drill hole and the bugs are beginning to spill out all over the floor and skitter away. I have to complete this surgerybecause it's all in my head.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not saddened by the recent passing of my grandfather. Rather, I'm compelled to share the way I knew him bestI would not be here today if not for him. The entity came for me when I was eight years old, and there was no way I would have survived if anyone else had been driving.

My grandfather and I were on a fishing trip that day. My dad had intended to join us, but something had come up, so it was just the two of us for the first time. I was a little awkward around my grandfather because I'd never actually been alone with him. I'd always watched others interact with him, but had little to say myself because I was only eight. I was also in awe of how he was to my dad the way my dad was to me; namely, a voice of authority. When my grandfather told me about the different types of fish and what baits to use, I listened like it was the most important thing in the world. It turned out to be a good thing that I took his words so seriously. That acceptance would later save my life.

It began very innocuously. As we walked through a small gorge to get back to the car from the prime fishing spot, I could hear my grandfather's voice echo from the high rock walls. While he packed things into the car, I had several minutes to wander around, and I used them to run back to that area and shout. Strangely, my yell echoed only feebly once, and then not at all. Scream as I might, I heard no reflection of the noise.

I was too young at the time to really understand how impossible that was. I just assumed I was yelling wrong somehow, or that my grandfather had a special grown-up timbre that allowed his voice to echo while mine just dropped off. Still, it bothered me, and I eventually brought it up on the drive back.

Everything about that moment became seared into my memory. It was 3:22 in the afternoon by the clock in the car's dashboard, the sky was mostly clear with traces of white, and my grandfather's eyes were wide orbs of alarm turned upon me while his white knuckles tightened around the wheel. "What did you say, boy?"

"I asked how I can echo like you," I told him, suddenly afraid that I'd done something wrong. "I yelled and I couldn't echo."

His face was normally crisscrossed with little lines that ran their way along relaxed droopy skin. At that moment, his forehead and cheeks tightened to smoothness, and he scanned left and right rapidly. He didn't seem to find what he was looking for through the windows, but he did not seem reassured. "Here." He leaned over and opened the glove box in front of me to pull out a bag of jelly beans. I smiled for a moment, but he was not giving them to me as a gift the way he'd intended. "Eat them all."

I held the bag in my hands. It seemed a massive feast. If I'd been left to my own devices, I might have eaten them all eventually, but not all at once. "Why?"

"Eat them all, boy!" he said gruffly, his tone brooking no argument. I began stuffing the jelly beans in my mouth. He looked down and around, then at the back seat, then at his travel thermos in the cup holder between us. He thrust it into my hands to join the spilling bag of jelly beans. "Drink this. All of it!"

"I'm not allowed to have coffee!" I told him. "Mom"

He cut me off. "Your mother will understand. Drink it. I know it tastes bad, but down it all." His gaze refocused on something beyond me, and I turned my head to my window to see the forested hills rolling by at various apparent speeds based on their distance. The furthest hills out on the horizon hardly seemed to be moving at all, but I thought I saw a tiny little speck atop one.

My grandfather gripped my shoulder with one hand. "Drink, boy! Drink! And eat those jelly beans! You need the sugar and the caffeine. It's going to try to make you fall asleep. *Don't let it!*"

To say I was scared then would be an understatement. No part of me thought this was a prank of some sort. He was too reserved and austere a man for that. The coffee tasted horrible, but I gulped it down until none was left. After that, I began swallowing jelly beans whole until they were all gone. I looked to my rightthe speck in the distance was still out there, but now one range of hills closer. It was still tiny, but now held movement akin to something waving back and forth.

I looked to my grandfather in askance; he in turn looked away from the thing in the distance to focus on my face. He breathed in through his nose and turned forward, determined in a way I'd never seen him. His leg moved, and the car began to accelerate. We'd already been going the speed limit on the empty highway.

The sugar, caffeine, and fear began to have an effect on me. I remember my cheeks and forehead warming and my hands growing clammy. I asked, "What's going on? I'm scared!"

"Be scared," he breathed, his eyes on the road as he continued to hit the gas. I could see the needle passing eighty. "That'll help keep you awake. This thingthis Godforsaken thingit came for your grandmother, and it started the same way. Just before a long drive, we noticed her voice stopped echoing." His face contorted into a furious mask. "But cars are a lot better now than they were back then. I won't let it get you."

My back began forcefully pressing into my seat as he put the gas to the floor. I watched the needle pass ninety, and then I looked out the window again.

It was even closer, now visible as the silhouette of a man running up hills, between trees, and over boulders parallel to us. "It's still out there!"

My grandfather grunted angrily and audibly slammed his foot down. I held onto my armrest and the door handle in terror as our car topped a hundred miles an hour and began to shake. It felt like we were in a barely controlled projectile far beyond any limit of safety, and I was terrified the highway would suddenly stop being empty and we would smash into a car or truck ahead.

But even through that overwhelming fear and adrenaline, a chill tiredness began seeping up my spine. My eyes began to feel heavy, and I blearily looked to my right. The shock woke me back up.

It was on the gravel shoulder of the highway now, completely visible as a black humanoid silhouette running at incredible speed alongside our car. In that moving pitch darkness, I could see lit pinpoints that made it feel as if I was gazing into the night itself. The afternoon sun burned in the sky above and behind it with no effect.

Staring as its blurred feet began to pelt across the painted line at the edge of the road, I felt sleepy again. It was running parallel to us, but drawing ever closer.

"Wake up!" my grandfather screamed, risking one hand off the wheel at a hundred and ten miles an hour to shake my shoulder. "It's trying to drain the life out of you! *Wake up!*" He jerked the car one lane to the left, and, still pressed into my seat by the acceleration, I stared down at the hypnotic dashes in the middle of the road. Bit by bit, black feet began landing between each dash, keeping pace with us.

I remember the car shaking violently around me the way I imagined a space shuttle lifting off might around its astronauts. I know now we were crossing a hundred and twenty and nearing the most the car could offer, but, at the time, I was caught in watching the hypnotic dashes and stars in those void legs moving rapidly back and forth as it ran right up alongside the car and reached down with one hand to open the door.

Wind blasted around me as the gale force of a hundred and twenty mile an hour winds tore at my clothing and hair. Waking up halfway, I screamed, and my grandfather jerked the car to the left again as much as he could without going off the road. It didn't matterthe running silhouette held the door open against the wind with its star-filled arm and began preparing to leap into the car with us. The other arm gripped my neck, and the cold that it brought cannot be described with mere words. The closest I can come is to say that the vast speeds and forces of an antithesis cosmos hated me. Somewhere, ice and anti-life were the rule, moving through emptiness at absurd velocities, and this thing was some small part of that undead will.

But it was not fully here. It could only interact with us in certain windows. That's what I believe now. My grandfather gave the only shout of fear I would ever hear from him as the car seemed to be shaking apart around us; I looked left at the speedometer, found the needle to be unreadably far out into the red, and felt the heavy blanket of sleep fall over me as the silhouette grasped repeatedlybut failed to reach me. The door slammed shut, cutting off the wind.

Inch by inch, we began pulling away.

It ran furiously alongside, but the entity was just a tiny bit too slow.

Between one moment and the next, realizing it couldn't get us, it vanished.

We'd escaped it.

I awoke in a hospital several days later. My grandfather told nobody the real story, of course, but the doctors had plenty of diversion. Somehow, I'd been drained of a number of vital electrolytes, salts, and so on, and they chalked my coma up to some sort of severe dietary imbalance.

But I knew the truth.

And I've made sure to tell the people I care about the small piece of advice that my grandfather taught me. I don't care if it makes sense to you. Just listen. It's out there still in the open lands of the Midwest, and it's probably always been thereit was just never a problem before we started bringing great speeds into our daily lives. People die every day by falling asleep at the wheel, and I know for certain that not all of those incidents are innocent.

If your voice stops echoing, cancel your road trip. It's waiting for you.

	<TEXT> I don't think there are any inaccuracies in what you've recounted, but I will point out (the story didn't specify) that the scorched world with the bacteria problem was a sister Earth far outside the Shield, like the one Alek Staley and his people came from. They also didn't have technology far ahead of ours, they were just motivated by a global catastrophe to put all those resources toward getting into space.

 My question is this: What prevents the portals from opening to an earlier or later time period from the reality they were in? Why can't it be used as a time machine?

It's not necessarily that something needs to prevent portals being used as time travel, but more that they're just not capable of that.  There are some extradimensional entities capable of moving through time, but they're so different from us that communication is very difficult (if we can reach them at all). Ward Shaw's vision of the future was through a direct connection to a neuron of such an entity. In that instance, it's not clear whether what he witnessed was an actual future or just a possible future given the extradimensional nature of that strange mind.

It's also not clear that the past can even be changed at all. That's Kumari's frustration right now. Everything that happened continues to happen in closed causal loops, so nobody is really accomplishing real change. The book has a special ability to interact with itself along its own time axis, so what she is doing is using her future book to ask the past book to gather information from souls around it at the time. I'm not sure she completely realizes how it works since they have it hooked up to a machine interface in her time, but this is why there's a two-year gap in the reading. Carmen Faulkner took the book out of our base branch of the multiverse to a branch where an entity was purposely interfering with tools like the book. As a result, Kumari couldn't connect to the past book during that time.

The book is also not capable of the probability alteration we've seen Kumari employ. The book is acting as a targeting mechanism for something else we've yet to learn about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Telling Will about the anomaly in the basement of my childhood home was not my mistake. No, my mistake was letting him see it.

The return to my hometown was already emotional for many reasons. That day, I went alone. That day, I let myself in with my key and sat for half an hour in the kitchen remembering all the mornings I'd spent eating cereal at that table and trying to weasel my way out of going to school. I didn't have to go to school anymore, but, somehow, I wished I was back in those moments for just a little while.

After that, I went out to the U-Haul truck and retrieved a stack of cardboard. Down in the basement, I made a guess as to how much stuff I had to pack up, and I began folding the cardboard into fresh boxes. Four boxes in, I caught sight of a smooth shallow depression in the grey cinder block wall. A rush of memories followed.

When we'd been younger, my brother Will and I had played down in this basement at times, and one of our favorite imaginings had been that we could make small toys disappear by sliding them into a specific inch-wide point in the air. I couldn't remember how we'd found it and I hadn't thought about it in years, but now I was staring at a four-foot absence. The boxes below had begun to lose their flaps and the protruding edges of their contents in a sphere of emptiness, and the wall itself looked like somebody had carved out a perfect curve. Heart racing, I held one of my fresh boxes ahead of me and moved it closer until I saw the end begin to vanish. Pulling the box back, I dropped it on the ground and flipped it around.

The portions that had disappeared had not come back. The cardboard was gone, and the edges left behind were eerily smooth. For several minutes, I paced the basement, trying to process what I'd found. How was it real? How had this old game become a real thing? Or had it always been there, and we'd just interpreted it through the lens of childhood? Like it or not, I had to face the fact that there was an inexplicable sphere of disintegration in my basement.

While trying to figure out what to do, I pulled away the boxes underneath and marked the floor with tape to avoid accidentally coming into contact with it. I could see how nobody had noticed it all these years; it was in the back corner above boxes filled with old junk. But this was strange enough that I had to tell someone, right? The first call I made was to Will.

At first, he didn't believe me. I argued with him on the phone and even sent him pictures of what had happened to the wall, but he dismissed them as photoshops. He thought I was trying to trick him, and so I was forced to actually lie; I told him I was just having a breakdown about our parents and that I needed him to come there right away.

I waited for him by the U-Haul truck, and, when he saw that I was fine, he grimaced. "Is this about that basement prank?"

"Just come see it," I told him, practically dragging him inside and downstairs. Then, I gave him an old piece of wood. "Here, hold it toward the taped-off area."

Will sighed in that manner that only older brothers could. "Fine, I'll" The end of his piece of wood began to disappear. "Christ!"

"See?" I shouted, moving out of his way as he stumbled back. "That game we used to play with the toys. It was *this.* It was *real.*"

He shook his head, his gaze locked on the empty air ahead. "No. This is something else. It has to be. It's so much worse than I remember. It was nothing at the time. A small thing."

"It was a big deal then, too," I insisted. "We just didn't know any better." I turned and pulled out my phone. "I'm going to get some help with this."

He finally snapped out of his daze, but only to forcefully grab me by the front of my shirt. With fierce eyes, he demanded, "Don't you tell anybody."

I pushed him off with a leg-supported heave. "I have to! This isn't normal!"

He backed off for a time, his attention turning toward the unseen sphere. While I talked to a college friend in Physics I'd graduated with last year, Will began testing different objects. Metal, porcelain, wood, even a glass of waterit all disappeared above the line of tape.

While Will was carefully disintegrating the end of a tall lamp, the stairs creaked, and we both turned to see our neighbors on the stairs. It was too late; Mr. and Mrs. Evans were already watching us in shock. "I thought I heard shouting," Mr. Evans said, confused by what he'd seen. Mrs. Evans came down the stairs, still stunned, but concerned. She touched me on the shoulder and asked kindly, "Are you alright down here?" Her gaze turned with suspicion toward Will and the unseen sphere.

"I'm fine," I told her. It wasn't the first time they'd come over like this, and I just wanted them to leave. "We're packing things up."

"Come on honey," Mr. Evans said, waving her away. "They're fine." He glowered one last time at Will and the strange sight they'd beheldand then helped his wife up the stairs.

They left just in time to miss the arrival of my Physics friend Ismael. He rushed up the driveway from his car surrounded by a cloud of bulky equipment. I tried to help, but he just shook his head and asked to be led to the basement. "Is it real?"

"See for yourself," I told him, helping him set up his stuff between the boxes. His gear included a camera on a tripod, several pieces of testing equipment, and some radiation detectors. At these, I paused. "You think this thing might be giving off radiation?"

Ismael grimaced. "With the behavior you described? Probably. I definitely wouldn't live above this thing. If it's giving off anything dangerous, there'd be a pretty big cancer risk."

Will and I shared an unhappy glance.

"Alright," Ismael said as he hung some opaque sheets of heavy material from the unfinished ceiling. "We'll stand behind these in case there's acute radiation." We nodded, took our spots, and I held out the first long piece of wood. Ismael's camera captured every moment of the wood's slow disappearance while he stared wide-eyed and cursed softly. Cycling quickly through his devices, he checked each one and then declared, "Well, no radiation."

Will said, "That's a relief."

"No," Ismael countered. "It's super weird. I sort of expected that the matter in the objects was being torn apart and scattered, but that's not what's happening. Here's the real question: why isn't there a tornado in here?"

I looked at the empty sphere for a moment before realizing what he meant. "You mean why isn't it destroying the air, too?"

He nodded. "This isn't a portal to somewhere else, and it's not disintegrating matter outright. I wonder what it *is* doing."

While he continued to perform tests, Will pulled me aside. "Look, I understand the need for help on this, but we really can't tell anyone else. This is a family matter."

I nearly bit my tongue, but then decided to stand up for myself for once. "Why do you want to keep this a secret?"

It was then he went a totally different direction than I was expecting. His eyes lit up and he traced a hand across an imaginary display of the future. "Think about it. We could run a waste disposal company like no other. Destroy anything instantly and permanently. You know all that nuclear waste they bury in the desert? Gone. Toxic factory waste? Gone. We could ship it all here from anywhere and just annihilate it. Nobody else would ever be able to match us."

"Oh, so it's about money, is it?" I asked, angry for some reason. "You think the government will just let us keep this to ourselves?"

"Of course not," he said with a small laugh. "That's why we'll keep it a secret. They won't know about it, and we'll get rich. If anybody does suspect, we'll just say they're crazy and call them conspiracy theorists. Think about it. Who would believe the truth?"

That path seemed dangerous and self-serving. "We have to tell someone."

He gripped me *hard* by each arm. As I struggled to get away from him, he insisted, "No. There's too much money at stake."

Turning from his work, Ismael asked, "Everything alright?"

Will let go, and I nodded. "I'm fine. What are you finding?"

"I think this sphere is turning solid and liquid matter into harmless gases," he reported, peering at some of his instruments. "A little bit of argon, a little bit of nitrogen, but mostly carbon dioxide. I recommend you keep the windows open at all times to air it out."

Pushing away from my older brother, I helped open the windows, and then we stood regarding the anomaly.

"So it's harmless?" Will asked. "Doesn't give us cancer or anything?"

Ismael shook his head. "Looks to be a growing bubble of alternate physical laws, or at least that's my best guess. I don't know what's causing it, but if it's getting bigger over the years, then that's a huge problem. It's gravitationally bound, as we can tell from it staying in the same place rather than floating through space, so it's going to stay here on the Earth. We should probably begin working on a way to undo it, because in a few centuries it might get big enough to destroy all life on the planet. It doesn't even need to directly convert everything; if it produces enough carbon dioxide we'll all"

Without warning, Will pushed him forward, and Ismael fell. Only his bottom half hit the floor, and his wet intestines began spilling out from his open pelvis, vanishing. Choking from the sudden breeze and the knowledge that I was breathing in his disintegrated flesh, I ran.

Will caught me upstairs in the kitchen and covered my mouth to keep me from screaming. "Stop!" he hissed. "Stop! It had to be done! Now we're the only ones that know!"

I had no choice but to let him think I was calming down.

He slowly let go. "Now, are we going to get rich, or are you going to be a problem? You know I'd never hurt you, but"

I spit in his face.

He backed down and wiped his cheek clean. "I'm sorry. I really am." He sighed and headed for the basement stairs. "I'm going to push the rest of his body and all of his gear into the sphere. There won't be any trace left. No body, no murder charge. And if you tell anyone, I'll say you were complicit. Just so you know. Sorry, but I'm just protecting myself."

Full of anger, humiliation, and hate, I dashed from the house as soon as he moved out of sight. Running next door, I knocked until Mr. and Mrs. Evans opened up, and then I began frantically showing them the pictures and explaining what we'd found. "It's eventually going to destroy the world if we don't do something about it!"

They nodded and listened. They'd seen it. They believed me.

Mrs. Evans saw the bruises on my arms and frowned. "Honey, we'll help you. Just get somewhere safe and we'll call the police."

I couldn't thank them enough. I just needed to know I had allies; that I wasn't alone.

Retreating to my rented U-Haul, I drove halfway down the block, locked the doors, and sat watching my childhood home while I tried to figure out what to do next. My first move was to post all the pictures and information I'd gathered online in as many forums and message boards as I could. It didn't matter what Will tried to do. Others *would* know.

About twenty minutes into that task, I saw Mr. Evans open his door and cross his lawn to post a hand-written *For Sale* sign. I got out of my truck and headed over to question him about it; while walking over, a police cruiser finally arrived. The cop got out and intercepted me, asking me immediately if I was alright, and I began to try to explain. He was skeptical, but I showed him the photos on my phone, and he glared over at my house. Waving Mr. Evans closer, I asked him, "Here, tell him about the sphere. You saw it."

Mr. Evans gave me an apologetic look and then turned to the cop. "This isn't the first time we've heard yelling in that house. But as for this disintegration thingy, no, there's nothing down there. Me and the Missus saw an empty basement with our own eyes when we went to check. Nothing down there."

Horrified, I demanded, "What the hell?"until I realized why he'd posted a *For Sale* sign. They wanted to sell their house before the truth was exposed. The value would drop if people knew it was next to a strange disintegrating anomaly that would eventually expand and destroy it. Just like Will, Mr. Evans was more concerned about money than the truth.

Over the course of the next twenty minutes, the cop got Will outside, but my older brother and Mr. Evans managed to make me look like a crazy person.

At the end of the back-and-forth, the cop looked me over and said tiredly, "Look, I could have helped you if not for that crazy story, but I'm not going to touch this one with a ten foot pole. Just get somewhere safe and call up family if you can. I'm not dealing with a he-said she-said situation. You look uninjured, just leave the premises."

Frustrated beyond belief, I watched the cop get back in his cruiser and pull away.

Beside me, Mr. Evans murmured an apology and headed back into his house.

Will sneered at me and returned to the house.

At least I had the Internet. Others would listen! I got back on my phone and began checking what I'd posted. To my horror, there were already a bevy of eerily similar response posts from various blogs decrying the latest 'conspiracy' and claiming that 'these disintegration spheres' were fake news. Dozens of comments were pouring in on every site about how I was a liar, that all my images had been photoshopped, and that I was being funded by liberal billionaires to spread conspiracies. The reaction was so over the top and so consistent, I got the sense that it wasn't natural. Were there other spheres like the one in my basement? Were other people trying to get the word out but being silenced? How could anyone spread propaganda to cover up something that might destroy the worldoh.

Money, obviously. We'd known about the sphere for less than a few hours and it'd already made nice people lie and bad people kill.

I sat down on the curb, forlorn.

I was alone in this.

What could I do? I could try to fight Will, but he was bigger and stronger, and likely expecting such an attack. I couldn't beat him. He would overpower me.

I could try to tell more people, but the way others had reacted so far told me nobody would really know what to do about it. To get past the barrier of propaganda and reach a wider audience, I would need tons of money. I needed money to fight money. It was a self-defeating circle of logic.

The only strategy that made sense was to wait until the problem got dramatically worse and could no longer be denied. I had to hope that it would not be too late by then. Once the sphere was the size of a city blockor even a city itselfonce the sphere was so huge that nobody could deny it as a threat, would it still be possible to find a solution?

I needed money. Heading back into the house and down to the basement, I watched Will applying more tape.

"It got bigger after Ismael fell in," he said, nursing a bleeding finger where he'd grazed the edge. "So we'll have to keep measuring it after we use it."

"Makes sense," I told him. "So how do we start this business?"

He grinned, came up, and gripped me amicably by the back of the neck. "I knew you'd come around."

I just gave a hesitant smile and nodded. It was all I could dofor now.

	<TEXT>  Interesting, given rifts are gravitational objects, what happens in cases of altered gravity, such as the world Verene got stranded on?

Exactly what you'd expect, which is one reason Carmen and Verene couldn't escape without help from a portal, artificial or otherwise.

 I suppose the deeper question in that case is whether the positioning is relative or not. If a rift moves (or is made to move) in one reality, does that then translate through to corresponding movement in the other?

For natural rifts, yes. They're multi-dimensional vortices very much like whirlpools moving on two opposite surfaces, but in this case instead of water it's space. It's possible to distend them temporarily, but they'll float back to close configuration rather quickly.

 If on the other hand gravity is translated through the rift, the atmosphere would form an equilibrium with the space-rift becoming a gravity well of sorts. Would make an interesting weapon as it could be used to capture, redirect or otherwise influence celestial objects such as asteroids... Assuming the rift positions could be controlled! Imagine having an asteroid collide with one side of a rift after being drawn in by a planet scale gravity well... Anything on the other side would have a VERY bad day!

Bad day indeed. One of the Earths we haven't visited yet was 'destroyed' by a rift at the bottom of an ocean slowly draining endless amounts of water to another.

Gravity is translated through natural rifts in a short-range way that approximates how we might instinctively expect it to operate, although it is a bit tricky in more complex situations because it's not a simple physical model. For example people don't experience weightlessness at a rift (which one might guess since there's an entire planet on both sides) because the curvature of spacetime caused by each Earth's mass does not translate fully through the rift (which is itself a higher dimensional curvature). You might say that you're walking from a given point on the curve of a gravity well to a similar point on a similar gravity well, so they're not cancelling each other out so much as unifying smoothly. Meanwhile if one end of the rift was on Earth and one end was in space, it's a bit different, because you've got a dramatic difference in gravitational curves. That's when we see a small gravitational field leaking through. In many ways there's a sort of natural resistance to dramatic differences that helps counteract relativistic effects of moving one end of a rift and/or realities with different time flows because these places are not really as close together as they appear to be. I hope I'm making sense... it's 5 AM here and I'm recovering from a bad flu!

 I vaguely remember an answer to a query you gave about what real-space would be like in a reality smashed by The Devastation if aliens found it... I can't find the specific reference, but as I recall the smashed space would cover a finite area rather than affecting the entire universe as a whole. Have I interpreted that right?

Close, it's that the Shields projected by machines on different Earths only cover local spacetime, and it was local spacetime that the inter-reality dust was attracted to and building pressure upon. If the threat hadn't been stopped, local spacetime roughly encompassing the Earth and the Moon would have been collapsed. Entire universes weren't under threat from this phenomenon except in the case of the Capital Temple reality, which was completely artificial and only the size of the Shield itself, which is why it had no stars. If a spacecraft had flown up there it would have gotten to about where the Moon should have been - and then it would have hit 'nothing'. Flat solid blackness where traditional 3d space ended. No sun. That pocket reality would have been dark if not for the Shield machines underground spewing out beams of golden energy at all times.

That radius is pretty important for a number of things that happen whether the characters know it or not. For one example, I can't remember exactly right now, but I'm pretty sure the First World moon hit or was hit by the physical presence of the Inner Shield when Vasiliev Blaku unsuccessfully tried to relieve the white hole's pressure by blowing up a Dimensional Fracture Bomb near [the white hole]. I'd have to go check my timeline for exactly what happened but the impact of the Shield collapsing inward definitely cracked the moon in two and sent half sliding right on down Earth's gravity well. That was lethal for some of the percentage of the First Worlders Cristina Thompson couldn't save (those who were hurt, asleep at the time, didn't trust the portal storm to take them to safety, and so on) - those who were on side of the Earth facing the impact would have died very quickly, while those on the other side would have had a surprising amount of time to live, relatively (possibly as many as 12 hours before the shockwave reached places like Australia) but of course the sphere of space inside the Earth-Moon Inner Shield radius would have completely collapsed sooner than that, exploding everything out into space and leaving a white hole ejecting incredible amounts of junk matter and energy. I think about those people sometimes. What must they have felt? I imagine waking up to find that billions of people have leapt through portals and evacuated the planet, leaving you behind to listen to frantic radio broadcasts trying to piece together that the world is ending in a few hours and you missed your chance to get out...

Back on topic, for the duration of the Crushing Fist threat we're seeing the spacetime inside the Earth-Moon radius being compressed, but not the Sun or the other planets or the rest of the universe. If there's life out there, they would never have seen the problem in time to help us. That's still a big question. The Empire has never contacted alien life or even seen evidence of it, (alien being aliens from other planets rather than alternate Earths) although it's still a mystery who or what sent the mass driver projectiles billions of years ago that later ended up destroying the Dreamer on High. But I'm rambling now :)

Oh wow, it's my Cake Day, maybe I should post something later! I wonder how long it lasts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  One question many have asked is "Why does it all center around Earth? What about other planets, stars, and so on? A universe is a pretty big thing... One way to think about it is that each "bubble" in the Multiverse foam is centered around Earth or Earth and its immediate neighborhood in space. Whether bound by gravity or by other forces, this ensures the bubble remains relative to the mass of each version of Earth, which allows energy states to be matched. This gets around the whole issue of opening a portal or rift into space and promptly draining the world's atmosphere out into hard vacuum. It also gets around the relative differences in velocity between realities which would otherwise result in portals flying off in random directions and any traveler unfortunate enough to be traversing them from becoming a living cannonball.

I gave out this info in one of my AMAs I believe, but in the system I use natural rifts are gravitational objects with solid multi-dimensional presence so they will almost always fall as far as they can in a gravity well and then stop. In our case, Earth is our gravity well, so rifts fall until they hit the ground and then generally go no further. Rifts that fall into stars or gas giants are generally destroyed, so the vast majority of all rifts will be found on the surfaces of rocky planetary bodies. Earth to Earth, Mars to Mars, that sort of thing.

If one end of a rift goes to vacuum, a gradient bubble of atmosphere will form on the other side, but generally a system like that will reach equilibrium pressure without too much effect on the original side (the amount of atmosphere required to sustain sea-level pressures in a sphere of gas in space is miniscule compared to the amount of atmosphere on an entire planet, especially when considering the gravitational force of the planet acting purely as a pull back into the rift). It's also possible that moisture in the leaked atmosphere may freeze and form a ball of ice around the portal, sealing it anyway. In more than one instance from 'deleted scenes' I never published, characters looked through ice-blocked rifts and saw only stars. Needless to say, they left it alone, but if they hadn't, they would have stumbled into open air kept survivably warm by the convective heat of the connected atmosphere before falling back into the rift thanks to the gravity coming from the other side. So not the instant death trap one might expect, but riding a motorcycle at 50 mph through something like that would have been very dangerous.

As I continue to read I see you've landed on much of this stuff spot on, just thinking out loud :)

 This brings us to The Devastation, The Mad God itself. Whatever this entity is, it exists at a scale well beyond that of even the Multiverse Titans. Given its apparent random behavior it is questionable whether it is truly sentient, but it raises the question of where it came from and how it ended up where it was to cause such damage to the multiverse. More to the point, where did it go? Such an entity is unlikely to have simply appeared and disappeared without leaving a trace, so it would be expected to have left a trail both from its point of origin and to wherever it went.

I'll say it because Ward Shaw knows - it's still out there. It's always out there. It could destroy whole swaths of realities at any time. It's akin to a force of nature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Surveillance is a growing fact of life these days, but I now believe we've expanded the scope of human sight to dangerous levels. I'm not a master hacker by any means, but I was definitely able to Google a script to break into my neighbor's new smart home system. Believe me when I say that ignorance is bliss and that you can never go back once you know the truth.

I'm not some creep. The idea first started as a random thought when I heard my fifty-something neighbor bragging to someone else on his porch about his new smart home system. He claimed the security system and all the devices in his house were wired to the same voice command box, and he sounded rather proud of it. He claimed it was perfect security.

Of course, after overhearing a claim like that floating in through my open window, I made a single search and found a dozen hits for scripts that would break into the brand he'd described. I laughed to myself and then left it at that.

But temptation has a funny way of lurking in the back of your mind. Every few days the thought would randomly pop into my head: I had the power. Why not take a peek? It would be good for a laugh if nothing else. It's not like he would have installed cameras in his bathrooms or anything.

Nah.

No.

Eh, maybeno, I shouldn't.

But then Spring Break arrived, and, while sitting at my computer, I happened to glance out the window and see the neighbor's daughter coming home from college. The temptation to use the script had already been percolating in me for weeks; the veins in my extremities constricted painfully as I realized I was actually going to do it. During my brief glimpse down into their yard, I'd seen what looked like a startlingly attractive girl, and I couldn't connect that image to the weird girl next door I'd last seen in high school.

It wasn't a creeper thing. I just wanted a better look to understand what I'd seen. I told myself I'd take one quick look and then be done with it. While loading up the script, I promised myself I'd delete it right after. Yeah, that was the right thing to do. No harm done, and if I got caught somehow, I could just claim it was a one-time accident. That sounded reasonable.

A black window scrolled text down my screen rapidly for six seconds, and thenI was in.

Nerves thrilling, I watched breathlessly through a security cam feed in the living room as the girl came in, greeted her brother and father, and then headed upstairs. It was definitely the same girl I remembered, and she'd definitely gotten absurdly pretty in the last year somehow. After settling into certainty, I closed the feed, deleted the script, and then spent a paranoid hour clearing my computer of any evidence of what I'd done.

For maybe a week I sat at home terrified that the police would break down my door and taze me at any moment, but that's the funny thing about temptation: when no consequences followed, the urge to look began eating away at me again. I had a few drinks one lonely night and then went for it before I could change my mind.

The son was watching television in the living room. I couldn't see what he was watching from the angle of the camera in the living room, but he seemed zoned out.

My neighbor himself was sitting in the kitchen working on his laptop. Again, I couldn't see what he was doing from my angle, but he was certainly downing coffee as he worked.

My pulse quickened as a hallway feed caught the daughter going from her room to the bathroom in just a towel to take a shower.

Ok, borderline creepish, I told myself, but it's not like I could see in the bathrooms or the bedrooms, right? Just to confirm that I couldn't, I tried the various devices around the house that the neighbor had connected to his system. Most were named with random numbers and letters, but I did find that household devices had many more sensors than we gave them credit for. A microwave in the kitchen had some sort of crude light sensor, and the system sent me its data as an incredibly blurry video feed. A big blob of darkness moved in place in front of a bright rectangle of light, and I realized I was looking at my neighbor on his laptop from a different angle. In fact, many devices in the house had crude light sensors or audio pickups, and I could hear the shower running upstairs on one while listening to the son's show on another.

This was all proceeding as one might expect, and I might have gone down a very dark path if I hadn't stumbled upon the unthinkable. One of the devices with a very long and very random name showed me a blurry feed somewhere unrecognizable. I switched back and forth comparing the patterns of light from the cameras, but this device seemed to be looking out on somewhere altogether different. Was it the basement? It was darker than the others, but not too dark to obscure strange grey blurs moving on black.

I kept switching until I found a security camera near a basement window. It was the only one down there, but it showed enough that I could compare blurs. It was less that the objects were moving and more that the fuzzy sensor made the objects appear to move simply because it was so bad, but I pinpointed a poster, a chair, and a mirror before coming to an impasse with the final blur. This one I could only see on the sensor. There was nothing on the video feed. Peering closer and closer, I tried to make sense of the blob of grey and white pixels as it moved around the basement. Thereand thererecognizable landmarks among the junk, but no sign of it on the high res camera.

What was I seeing? Was the sensor just defective? What device was it even part of? I managed to narrow it down to a forgotten digital clock that must have been running on batteries, but nothing about this made sense. I looked up a script to sharpen video data and I let everything run all night.

In the morning, I pulled myself up, got a coffee, sat down at my computerand then froze. Repeatedly, I played the confusing horror the script had produced. The blur of grey and shadows had become coherent, but not in any natural way; instead, it appeared that I was looking at an androgynous grey humanoid form with a pillowcase over her head. Since this was just a graphical best guess, her glitchy movement brought out severe unease and disgust in me as I watched her jerkily walk around the basement. She appeared to be able to navigate despite the pillowcase covering her face, and she even made it up a few steps toward the basement door before her random movements took her back down.

What the hell was I seeing?

For two days I watched that thing stumble around my neighbor's basement before she finally went all the way up the stairs. It was four in the morning and all of three of them were asleep; this time, she seemed to move with purpose. She was still not visible on any high resolution camera, but I tracked her from sensor to sensor by her twitching blur. After so long watching her unfocused form, I was beginning to get a sense of where her legs and arms were by the movement and patterns of the grey; each limb moved as if on different conflicting joints. When she walked, it was as if her ankles, knees, and thighs each wanted to go opposite directions, and the conflict was only resolved by odd rotations and strange body angles.

Gripped by terror, I watched her slowly ratchet her way through the kitchen and toward the second set of stairs. There was no doubt in my mind that she was heading for the bedrooms. My knuckles went white as I gripped the edge of my table; finally, as she clambered up and out of sight of the sensors, I panicked. She still wasn't visible on the hallway camera, but I knew I had to do something.

But what? If I called the house, they would have my phone number, and they would start asking questions as to why I'd called at four in the morning. There was no way I could pretend it was random. The only reason I even had my neighbor's cellphone number was that I'd heard him say it out loud the week before on one of my feeds.

What could I do? Desperate to actor to at least see what was happeningI left my computer and crept to a window in another room. From here, I could see into my neighbor's daughter's window, and my entire body ran with prickly terror as I spied a strange grey anti-glow in her room. The sharpening script had not been wrong; it'd merely been *inadequate*. My eyes still interpreted the inexplicable entity as an androgynous humanoid with a pillow case over its head, but it moved through the space of the girl's room like a depressed carving etched into reality itself. I could *feel* why it didn't show up on cameras: it was something otherworldly; something not entirely there, or something visible only as an artifact of organic human perception. This was a creature outside the realm of human knowledge and observation, and I guessed that it was making its move now only because it believed itself to be unseen.

It jerked and twitched forward to lean over the neighbor's daughter as she slept.

Quickly and quietly, I slid open my window, removed the screen, and threw a quarter at the glass panes opposite.

I ducked down immediately after and clutched the floor in abject terror. The *rap* noise had been excruciatingly loud. Had the entity snapped its pillow-case covered head toward the sound? Had it seen me? I had no way of knowing.

Or did I?

Crawling back to my room, I checked the feeds. Apparently completely unperturbed by my noise, the entity had begun ratcheting her way back down the stairs. It was not fleeing to the basement. I watched as it approached the small table by the front door and began going through the mail stacked there. It carefully picked out one envelope and crumpled it into oblivion in a blurry grey hand. Then, it moved to the kitchen, where it touched the keyboard on my neighbor's laptop repeatedly for nearly a minute. What was it doing?

It returned to the basement to move in lurking circles, and I sat and stared at it half-awake until a shout from both my computer and my open window jolted me to full awareness. It had been my neighbor in his kitchen; he'd yelled loud enough for me to hear it for real. Stalking back and forth while talking on the phone, he was insisting he hadn't sent any compromising emails.

He'd been fired from his job.

In the front hall, his son was busy looking through the pile of mail. He asked his sister and father repeatedly if any college acceptance letters had come in, but his father was too busy arguing on the phone, and his sister hadn't seen any.

But I had.

What type of entity were we dealing with here? It hadn't physically harmed anyone, but it was still lurking in their home every hour of every day, and it had made invisible moves against them by sabotaging my neighbor's job and his son's college career.

At long last, my neighbor seemed to convince the other end that his account had been hacked, but he was somber and concerned about how it would reflect on him at work. The son continued on with his day, oblivious to the fact that his acceptance letter had come inand been destroyed. 

It was then that I began to think about the timeline of what had happened. I'd resisted the urge to spy on my neighbor's family for weeks. Indeed, beyond that, he'd lived there for years. If the entity had been in his basement this entire time, then perhaps they were not *physically* at risk. There'd been plenty of opportunities to hurt them directly. No, this was something else. This was a specter of misfortune; a curse; an information parasite. But my neighbor had not been particularly unlucky as far as I knew, not until

Not until he'd gotten the surveillance system.

A bunch of little complaints I'd heard him make suddenly began to add up. Things *had* been inexplicably going wrong for everyone in his family recently. Alarm clocks had been failing to go off at the proper time, emails and texts had been a bit weird, and each of the three members of his household had a general growing frustration with life. It was undermining them. It was literally lurking in the basementlurking out of sightand sabotaging them, and they had no idea.

But where had the entity come from? Almost all of the devices and cameras had been there before. The only difference was that they had been integrated. Did observation have an effect on the physical universe? I was no quantum physics expert, but I knew that observation was a crucial part of existence. Did overlapping connected layers of observation somehow enable this entity to slide into our world? When you put all the pieces together, did the whole add up to more than the sum of the parts?

I began thinking up a plan of action that involved sneaking over there and turning off all their devices in the hopes of banishing the entity in their basement, but, as I did so, I looked down and to the left at my cellphone. It sat quietly glowing on the table, for I had moved my hand above it and activated its motion sensor.

Then, I looked up and noticed the webcam above my monitor that I always kept pointed at myself.

Then, I looked to my right at my television, itself containing a sensor, and the gaming console beside it that also had sensors to detect my motion.

Microphones. Cameras.

Everywhere.

I'd applied for so many internships last summer and gotten none.

I'd missed dates and lost budding relationships because of texting troubles.

Everything had felt hard and difficult latelythus why I was sitting alone on my computer most nights.

I sat without breathing for nearly twenty seconds. There would be no plan. There would be no action taken. My neighbors would have to fend for themselves. I let out my breath, put my hands back on my mouse and keyboard, and loaded up a computer game. It would look like I'd given upto anyone watching.

	<TITLE> A Simple Genetic Test </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-13 23:50:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It wasn't officially mandatory, but we understood that we'd be fired for unrelated made-up reasons if we didn't do it. Out of the six employees in my corner of the building, I was one of only two people who openly had an issue with our genetic information being taken by our employer. If the others didn't like it, they made no mention of it. That's what made it so hard to figure out who the psychopath really was.

The information was supposed to be private, but by Monday I came in to find a card being passed around for Debbie's inevitable neuropathy. She sat at her desk crying while the rest of us tactfully ignored her and stuffed a few dollars in the card. What could we say? She wasn't sick yet.

That was also probably the first moment I noticed a colleague behaving strangely toward me. Clint was always a little standoffish, but he seemed nervous while waiting for me to sign the card. "You probably don't want to put money in. That's totally fine."

"What?" I asked, thinking I heard him incorrectly. I put in a five dollar bill and handed it back.

"Oh, ok." He laughed nervously before moving to the next cubicle.

By the time my ears had processed what he'd said, he was too far away to ask for clarification, so I leaned out of my cubicle and peered at him from afar. He caught me looking and, overcome by masked panic, he grabbed the card from Carla and dashed out of sight as fast as a restrained office walk would allow. I had no idea what that had been about, but it certainly made me feel weird.

For the next two hours, my coworkers seemed to share a universal hesitation at my approach or requests. It was wholly unlike the atmosphere that we'd communally maintained in the past; we all dreamed of pay raises and promotions, and we'd promised to help each other out and not fall victim to the corporate backstabbing that had consumed so much of the rest of the company. Those conversations had faded over the past year of economic hardship, and I now found myself in an office full of suspicion and distrust.

Jackson alone didn't seem bothered. He was in the break room when I went to make another pot of coffee. Leaning dourly against the counter and staring down into his mug for lack of anything better to do, he said, "Damn shame we get fined for being smokers now, eh?"

While making the fresh pot, I donned a wry grin that he didn't see because of his despondent interest in his coffee cup. "Company policy is voluntary and exists to benefit our health," I parroted.

He gave a single cynical chest-raising laugh. "Or to expose our secrets. Did you hear they found out someone in this office is a psychopath?"

My heart beat faster in my chest as the morning's strange interactions clarified themselves. "What do you mean?"

"I didn't see it myself, but apparently the manager left the genetic test results on his desk and someone found them." He finally abandoned the deep search of his mug in favor of looking directly at me. "Carla says the tests found a psychopath among us. A legit emotionless monster who would have no problem murdering us if we so much as looked at him the wrong way."

"That's crazy." I grabbed the coffee pot early to slowly fill my own cup and nonchalantly ask, "Did she say who it was?"

"I wasn't really paying attention."

"Ah." Refilled, I headed out without another word. I had some idea who everyone *thought* was the psychopath, but it couldn't be right. I wasn't crazy or emotionless, and I certainly wouldn't ever hurt or kill someone. Had something gone wrong with the test?

Nora was the only other person that had voiced an issue with having our genetics taken. I stopped at her cubicle; she turned and, after a subtle startled moment, she gave out a calm breath and said, "Hey, how's your Monday going?"

Office decorum made it difficult to ask directly. "Pretty good." I took a sip from my coffee and also pretended to be fine. "Hear anything about Friday's tests?"

Her neck tightened nearly imperceptibly, and her answer came about two seconds slower than usual. "I did."

The stress of the moment had me feeling numb, but I kept a pleasant face. "I see."

Finally, she leaned forward and whispered, "But I don't believe it. The whole thing is bullshit."

Moving closer myself so that nobody else in the office could hear, I whispered back, "I know right? I'm pretty sure the whole office thinks I'm a psychopath now!"

"That *is* what the test results said."

At that confirmation, I clenched a fist out of confused concern, and I saw her tense. Releasing the grip, I told her, "It's not true. I don't understand this at all."

"Maybe someone switched their sample with yours," she suggested, eyes wide. "To hide their identity."

Before I could seize upon that idea, we both saw the manager approaching, and I quickly scuttled back to my desk. Bob seemed not to notice my restrained dash across the aisle, and he approached with his typical dour resignation. On my desk was a post-it note with the words *if you tell anyone, I'll kill you*, and I quickly crumpled it up and stuffed it in my pocket as my manager overshadowed me with his towering but depressed presence.

I had a notion that he was going to fire me because of the test results. Even though I knew logically they would have to wait a few weeks to make the firing seem unrelated, it still put incredible stress on me. In shock from the note and Bob's proximity, I forced myself to politely ask, "Hey, what's up?"

"Ah, yeah," my manager said. "I have to inform you that some of the genetic test results were leaked this weekend. We're looking into it, but company policy dictates I have to inform you that the information has gotten out to parties unknown."

I nodded and tried to suppress the intense emotions flooding through my every limb. *He* did it. *He* left the information out on his goddamn desk! "Do they have any idea who did it?"

"It's, ah, company policy not to discuss details of an open case." He sniffled once. "Anyway, that's all."

He turned and began heading back down the aisle while I let out a breath. How had he not noticed my hand awkwardly jammed in my pocket throughout the entire exchange? I'd clearly been hiding something, but he'd been wholly uninterested.

I pulled out the note and uncrumpled it. Staring at the words, I repeated them over and over. *if you tell anyone, I'll kill you.* Was this real? Was it a practical joke? No, it had to be real. Nora and I had only just guessed that someone else had switched their sample with mine somehow. I knew *I* wasn't the psychopath, but everyone else thought I was, which meant they'd be too terrified to prank me in this manner. So who had left this note? The only person in this office who would have done itthe actual crazy person masquerading as a normal human being.

To say I was paralyzed would be an understatement. My life was under direct threatmy *life!*but if I left my job, I would also lose my life, just in a different way. I couldn't afford to be unemployed even for a few weeks. But the note had said *if* I told anyone, right? I could just keep quiet and

No. I'd be fired in a few weeks for supposedly being a crazy person. If I didn't act, I would lose my job. If I did act, this person would come after me. Worse, I'd *already* told someone by way of Nora's guess that my sample had been switched. I leaned back in my chair and quietly scoped the other cubicles. Carla, Nora, Debbie, Jackson, and Clintwhich of my five coworkers were not who they appeared to be? My coffee was empty in short order as I nervously sipped and stared.

I got up and began a slow walk to the break room. Did the tests verify gender? It was impossible to know exactly what the results had said. I guessed that Carla was the one who had seen them, since she was the manager's assistant and our office gossip. That also made it seem unlikely that she was the psychopath, because spreading the information would only hinder her position if it was her. I walked past her desk slowly enough to perceive a hidden nervousness in her that lasted until she was sure I wasn't stopping to talk to her.

Clint was hard at work on his spreadsheets, but I could tell he was looking at me in the reflection in his glasses as I came up behind him. If the results included gender, then he and Jackson were the only other possibilities. Did the psychopath, whoever he was, have the same question? Clint's neck reddened from stress as I neared, and I moved on. His tendency toward awkward social interactions and math-related skills made him seem a likely choice for someone reserved and cold, but it occurred to me that a real psychopath would put on a better front. Was it someone more personable?

Debbie had only just stopped crying. At the front desk, I lied about expecting a call from a client, but she rubbed her eyes with a tissue and shook her head. "No, sorry, no calls like that."

"Alright." I lingered for a moment. What if her inevitable illness was a cover? What if she'd switched the results andoh God, what if *I* actually had the predisposition toward that disease? I didn't want it to be true, so I kept walking.

The break room was empty this time, and a pot of coffee had been freshly brewed. That was strange. I was the primary coffee drinker in this office, and I *always* had to make the pot myself. What ifno, that would be ridiculous.

But it wasn't. I poured the coffee in the sink and leapt back as an acrid chemical smell wafted up like so much noxious smoke. The coffee had been poisoned.

Someone really *had* tried to kill me!

After a few moments of panic, I forced myself to get a grip. I had to out the psychopath and I had to keep my job. Calling the police would definitely get me fired. People would just see it as me trying to cover my own ass because I'd been outed by the genetic test.

But who had been in here? Who'd made the coffee?

I broke the pot and threw it in the trash to keep anyone else from getting poisoned by residue.

Out among the cubicles again, I saw Jackson heading back from the bathroom. I used the opportunity to scope out his desk. His mug was nearly empty. Only a small bit of brown liquid remained in the bottom. He ignored me as he passed, and I detected the faintest smell of cigarette smoke. After a few silent sniffs, it felt like it was coming from an elevated source, and I guessed that he'd come up with a system that kept his office clothes cleanbut he'd forgotten about his hair.

Nora waved me close as I headed toward my desk. "Who do you think it is, if it isn't you?"

"The psycho?" I whispered back.

She nodded. "We can't just let this go. We have to figure out who it is, or we're all in danger."

Her interest suddenly felt strange to me given how everyone else in the office seemed passive about the whole thing. "They did leave a note threatening to kill me if I told anyone. But then they left poison in the coffee pot anyway."

Her face contorted with concerned horror. "Seriously? Are you alright?"

"Yeah." Her expression was perfect. It looked legitimate. I couldn't see any hint of malice in her. "One thing I can't figure out: wouldn't it look suspicious if I was labeled a psychopath, but then murdered hours later?"

"Not if the cops think one of us did it to protect ourselves from you," she replied quietly.

Shit. "Good point."

"Wouldn't you do the same thing if you knew who the psycho was?"

"No," I told her, still studying her reaction. "Just being psychopathic doesn't make someone a threat, or a murderer. All six of us have worked here for at least a year, and we've all been fine so far."

She appeared surprised. "You wouldn't hold it against that person?"

I kept my gaze on her eyes as I said, "No." After a pause, I continued, "You were the only other person to protest the genetic tests, weren't you?"

"That doesn't mean anything. The tests are just wrong. Invasive and wrong."

A slow nod was my only response. Bob was walking by the cubicles again, so I returned to my desk.

I hesitated before sitting down, and my eyes caught sight of something nestled in the crack of the seat. Carefully pulling it out, I found that it was a needle full of some unidentifiable liquid. Disgusted, I crept out and threw it in Carla's trash because she was the only person not at her desk and I didn't want to be caught with it. Nobody saw me do it, but when I sat back down, I saw Nora turn and look at me across the length of the aisle. We locked eyes for an uncomfortably long heartbeat, but then she turned back to her computer.

As Carla returned to her desk, Bob unexpectedly appeared at my cubicle. "Hey, can I see you in my office for a second?"

Surprised, I just nodded and got up and followed him. My five coworkers all watched me throughout what felt like the longest walk of my life. Clint looked subtly afraid of me; Carla looked eager for new gossip; Debbie was on the verge of tears again; Jackson's eyes were expressionless and cynical. The corners of Nora's eyes and mouth were perfectly curved just enough to convey a hint of concern for my fate.

I entered my manager's office and Bob closed the door behind me, shutting me away from the stares of my coworkers. Someone official was already sitting within, and Bob introduced her simply as *from Human Resources* and offered me a chair. Overwhelmed by nervousness, I hardly heard his words as he sat behind his desk and began talking in his typical droning monotone.

All I could think about were the various reactions of my coworkers, and the emotions I'd read in them throughout my time here. Which had been real? Which had been fake? Who among us ruthlessly pursued their own goals with no regard to right or wrong?

"Don't fire me!" I blurted. "I know who the psychopath is!"

Bob blinked. "Huh? We're not firing you."

My racing thoughts stalled, and I abruptly returned fully to the moment. "What?"

"We're promoting you," Bob explained. "We need your ruthlessness at our management level. It's a cut-throat industry, you know." He began to smile, but the Human Resources lady shook her head dourly. "Ahem. But what do you mean you know who the psychopath is? Are you saying there's been a mixup, and it's not you?"

Part of me felt like laughing, but I suppressed it. Choosing my words carefully I said, "Oh. I'm not saying anything. I gladly accept the promotion."

"Great. We'll discuss details later this week. Until then, don't tell anyone about the change. We don't want to stir up office drama and all that."

"Of course." I stood, shook Bob's hand, and walked back out into the cubicle farm.

While the others watched me warily, I headed for the break room. On the way, Nora caught my attention and whispered, "Did you out the psychopath? Do you know who it is?"

Without looking at her, I said softly, "It's all of us, Nora. Maybe not genetically, but it's all of us."

I could feel her eyes still upon me as I entered the break room proper and began making coffee in an improvised filter. One of the cabinets swung open on a spring, and a small blade on the bottom shot toward me; it stabbed through the palm of my hand and out the other side. With gritted teeth I pulled my hand off the blade, found an old company medical kit, and bandaged the wound up.

And then I went back to making my coffee.

This was life now.

While waiting for the improvised drip to distill my caffeine, I began thinking of traps of my own to set, and of how I should safeguard my cubicle and the break room for my own defense. It was a natural result of being unable to leave; of being trapped with a multitude of other prisoners equally miserable and set against one another. It seemed that we had failed in our dream to remain friends, and the company's atmosphere of corporate backstabbing had taken us after all. I whirled around at times while waiting for my coffee to brew, expecting an attack from behind, but nothis Hell would not be so obvious. I maintained a polite smile and nodded at my coworkers as I returned to my desk with my full mug, and nobody commented on the bloody bandage around my hand.

Instead, they began passing around a card.

For some reason, I have faith in my fellow modern horror fans to *remorselessly chop that monster up until there's nothing left.* And then watch it for signs of regeneration, or even burn it just to be safe. Then also put a live video feed on it to the Internet, because we all know monsters never do anything publicly.

One movie that was great about this was *You're Next.* Looks to be a cliche survival horror until one of the characters decides not to be a victim... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say I find emotional refuge in a cynical hopefulness about the whole situation. As I grew into adulthood, I purposely worked to retain the idealistic view of history and humanity that school taught us as children, even though the facts turned out to be far different. All over the world, those who have power are acting purely out of self-interest to loot the coffers of civilization, obscure the truth of our situation, and twist the minds of their citizens against their own best interests with memetic lies.

But, strangely, history tells us that it's pretty much always been that way, and somehow we're still here and still advancing. It turns out - at least the way I see it - that the people in power don't actually decide anything at all. It doesn't matter who is President or Prime Minister, and it doesn't matter what policies they enact or how much they steal from us. What does matter is that morality and technology both march on in the hearts of the populace, and nothing can take that away.

For every terrible policy or economic crash, there will eventually be an answering technology that pushes past. Those technologies come from smart people, good people, and hard-working people. I have faith we will never be globally enslaved by robot police, for example, because all it will take is one hacker smarter than the rich people that own the robot police to shut the whole thing down.

We're going to be fine because power is an illusion and most people are well-intentioned. Or at least that's what I tell myself :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Pledge </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-09 00:39:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was skeptical when my online friends first linked me to the supposed evil Kickstarter that was going viral on the less-than-wholesome forums we frequented. We were an unmoderated haven for trolls, weirdos, and radicals, sure, but this Kickstarter was something else entirely. It seemed to have no publicly stated goal; the writers had only promised something awesome if the funding amount was reached. Stranger still, the rewards were all hidden except for the first level.

In the Pledge $1 or more' box the text read: "Want to get started? Throw in $1, and you'll receive access to the higher pledge tiers. Also, two things will happen. You will have a minor intangible wish granted, and we will send you a video of one of us kicking a random stranger! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."

Tomorrow? Don't these rewards usually only get sent out after full funding? But I understood what they were going for. This was a gimmick to get attention, and judging by the high number of backers listed in the box, it was working. Screw it, I thought. I'll throw in a dollar and see what happens. 

As I woke up the next morning, I trudged around the kitchen making coffee and then sat sipping it at the table while trying to escape the grogginess of sleep. All I wanted was a day to myself to avoid the grinding monotony of classes. At that moment, my phone dinged. Lifting it, I saw that someone had sent me an email with a video attachment. I instantly became fully awake as I realized what this was. Opening it with trepidation, I hit play and watched.

Five teenagers in black hoodies and expressionless white masks ran through an alleyway together, often looking back at the camera and laughing. When they reached the street, they made a beeline for a tired businessman on a bench, and the lead kid ran right up and kicked him in the shin. Confused and angry, the businessman leapt up and began shouting, but the hooligans were already running away. The last few seconds of the video were a close-up of a white mask and dark emotionless eyeholes as they fled the scene. The speaker said, "This one's for you, Jason Phillips. Thanks for your dollar pledge!"

It would be an understatement to say I was put off. They were actually going around kicking people in return for a dollar!

I had to call the police. I picked up my phone again, moved to action by the fear that I might be liable for thisbut my phone dinged again. I had a text message and an email from the official college department telling me that classes were cancelled today on account of a bomb threat. I sat in silence until it hit me: I'd just been wishing for a day to myself. Had these violent teenagers guessed that would be my minor wish? Had they called in a bomb threat to get me the day off? I shivered.

I couldn't call the police. I couldn't be connected to this. I would be expelled at best and jailed at worst. They might even look into my history of trolling online, and then I'd really be screwed. How the hell had they gotten my name? Had I been so stupid as to use my real credit card? I flipped through the logs and confirmation emails, but noI'd taken the proper precaution and used an anonymous cash card. How had they gotten my information?

Oh. My friends had to be in on it. Of course! This was all a prank! Well, they'd gotten me good. There was probably no bomb threat at all. The text had likely been faked or spoofed somehow. Smiling the whole way, I went to class anyway.

But it was cancelled, and cops were everywhere. Rather than going home, I stopped in a Starbucks and pulled out my laptop. Was it paranoia to avoid using my computer at home? Something about this seemed off.

Checking the Kickstarter again to try to understand what was happening, I saw that I'd been given access to the $5 tier. "Now that you've seen we're legit, why not up the stakes a little? Pledge five bucks and we'll get you something tangible of your choice worth $500 or less. We'll also send you a video of us punching a stranger in the face! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."

I could actually feel my circulatory system in my torso thanks to the stressed beats within. It was not a pleasant feeling. But pay $5 and get something worth $500? The first thing that came to mind was that gaming console I couldn't afford. All my classmates were talking about the greatest new games, but could only watch gameplay videos online to carry on the charade that I had them myself.

In some sense, I believed that the Kickstarter videos were staged and that the end parts with the close-up and my spoken name were edited onto the end of each file they sent out. Reassuring myself, I pledged five bucks.

I drank more than my share of beer that night with my roommates. Trying to pretend like everything was fine, I forced smiles and told some jokes. One of my friends mentioned that I seemed strained, but I laughed it off and said it was just the stress of upcoming finals. The beer helped me sleep, but I awoke with a start and ran downstairs as morning light shimmered in through the windows.

There was already a package on my doorstep. It was addressed to someone named Ricardo Jimenez, along with a note that read "Happy Birthday, son!" I opened it, but I already knew what it was: someone else's gaming system had been diverted to my address. As I opened the box, my phone dinged, and my blood ran cold.

Were they teenagers? They were thin and lanky under their black hoodies and blue jeans, but their masks hid any identifying features. Watching them run, I noticed their gait seemed odd, and I steeled myself as they burst out of a different alley and ran at a haggard mother pushing a baby carriage.

I screamed at my phone, "No!"but it was useless. The lead hooligan ran straight at her and popped her in the side of the face with a punch that took a straight line. From that, I knew they were the same height as her. I absorbed that fact to counter the horrible feeling that I'd caused this to happen to some unsuspecting mother on the street.

Again, a mask filled the video view for the final sequence. "Thanks for your five dollar pledge, Jason Phillips! I hope you enjoy those games!"

The gaming system found a new home in a dumpster five blocks away from my apartment. I couldn't keep it, not after what I'd seen, and I certainly couldn't sell it without confirming intent for any police that might be chasing these guys down. On the walk back, I took a roundabout route, and I eyed every car around me with suspicion. No one seemed to be taking note of my presence but why should they? To the real world, I was just a random college senior. They had no idea what I did or said online.

Classes blurred by. I could think of nothing else but the Kickstarter. I knew I would see another new pledge level if I looked again, but I feared what I would find. Between classes, I tried to contact the friends that had linked me to it. None of them were responding. I was still half-certain they were somehow in on it, but the feeling this whole thing was giving meI just couldn't be sure anymore.

My resistance lasted two days. Ostensibly, I was checking to see when the mysterious goalless Kickstarter was ending, but I couldn't help but glance down and see the $10 tier. "You're in it now, friend! For your amazing support of ten dollars, we will free you from an intangible chain that's weighing you down. We'll also send you another of those videos you love. In this one, we'll non-fatally stab someone just for you! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."

Stab someone? Jesus Christ!

But an intangible chain weighing me down? God, my student loans! I hit the Pledge button without letting myself debate further. My student loan debt was over eighty-thousand dollars, and it represented a lifetime of tithing servitude that I would never fully repay, not with the way the economy was going.

Wine was my friend that night rather than beer. I sat watching pirated movies online until the sun came up, not bearing to think about what I'd done. At the same time, I very much needed this to be real. When the Student Financial Services office opened, I was there.

As I barged in the instant the clock hit the hour, a blonde fellow student looked up in surprise. "Can I help you?"

"Yes, I need to check my debt balance." I tried my best to look calm, but I guessed my terse restraint just made me that much more suspicious. "My name's Jason Phillips. Here's my student ID and papers."

"Sure," she said, taking my paperwork and turning to her computer. After a moment of typing, she began to recite, "If this is about a payment, you can go to our" She stopped typing. "Oh. Looks like you have a zero balance."

Barely able to keep myself from shaking in my sneakers, I clarified, "No debt? It got paid off?"

She shook her head. "No. You've never taken out a loan with us at all. You're enrolled, but the Registrar's database says you've paid in cash every term."

"From what accounts?" I asked, forcing a nonchalant smile.

"Oh, we don't have access to that here." She gave a small laugh. "I'm just here through work study. Is something wrong? I'd kill to be debt-free."

My phone dinged in my pocket. "Don't say that," I told her far more seriously than I intended. "Don't say that."

Out in the hallway, I sat and watched the video. The same five black-hoodied, white-masked thugs were running through an alley. As they emerged onto the street and headed for a bald teenage girl in a shirt that read 'I stood strong, I fought hard, I won', I closed the video and put it away. I couldn't watch it. I recognized that kind of shirt from my father's own struggle with cancer.

The shaking wouldn't stop, and I imagined I was bright red from the absolute chaos going on inside my chest. Oh God, I was free of the debt, free of the weight of eighty-thousand dollars that had racked up when my father's illness ate my college fund. I was free of the debt and I was happy for it. I was happy! Meanwhile, some teenage girl that had just survived the unthinkable was about to be stabbed in exchange. My only consolation, as spit and tears plopped onto the floor by my sneakers, was that the pledge box had specified non-fatal.

"Are you alright?"

It was my turn to look up in surprise.

"It's not often that someone comes in freaked out and sad that they have no debt," the blonde girl from the front desk said. "Something's the matter, isn't it?" After studying my face, she sat next to me. "I'm Kelly."

"Jason," I told her, unable to look her in the eye.

"Why don't you tell me what's wrong, Jason?"

It all spilled out of me in one long babbling wave. The Kickstarter, the pledge tiers, the bomb threat, the kick, the gaming system, the punch in the face, the cancelled student loan debt; she sat and listened to all of it, wary.

After I was done, she nodded once, narrowed her eyes, and then said, "Show me the video."

That was not the reaction I'd expected. I'd been braced for disbelief or having the cops called on me. Instead, I asked, "Are you sure? It's."

"Just show it to me." She took the phone and watched without visible reaction. After I heard it say my name and thank me for the ten dollar pledge, she said, "Well, they stabbed her. But I think she'll live."

I finally found myself able to look at her. Now that someone else knew, I wasn't so gripped by terror and self-loathing. "You're not scared?"

"I don't know enough to be scared yet. Do you have the other two videos on this phone?"

"Yes. Here."

She watched the previous two with the same calculating gaze. Once they were over, she said, "They always originate out of sight. Why is that? And who exactly is doing the filming? Tonight, let's get these on a bigger monitor and watch for reflections. These look like random city streets. There's no way they've got all the angles coveredand if they do, you'll know it's fake."

After a sigh and a nod, I told her, "I have a desktop computer at home. Two big monitors."

"You a Computer Science major?"

"Yeah."

"Alright, here's my number. Text me your address and I'll come by after work and classes."

Taking my phone back with a sense of dumbfounded shame and hope, I asked, "Why are you helping me?"

"Maybe I'm one of them," she said with complete neutrality. "And this is just a way of secretly getting closer to you."

I laughed nervously, but she returned to the Student Financial Services office without taking it back or even hinting that she was joking. Something about her deadpan attitude made her seem trustworthy or maybe I was just desperate to have help in this. But I had no other option anyway. That night, I sent her my address, and she showed up with a laptop of her own and sat at my desk alongside me. I loaded up the videos on my large monitors, and we began to go through them frame by frame, staring at every single blur and corner.

"Hackers of some sort," she guessed, drinking from a very large fountain soda she'd brought. "You'd be surprised the kind of information they can get online."

"Oh, I'm no stranger to hacking," I replied, feeling much better now that I had an ally. "I basically live on the Internet. Career no-lifer here. But this is a whole other level. Calling in bomb threats, redirecting mail, cancelling debt, and all without any police attention that I've seen: these guys are good."

She glanced up at one of the tab names in my browser bar above the video. "You frequent that forum?"

Red-faced, I quickly closed the tab. "I'm not a brony, I swear. I was just trying to get info on these guys."

"I believe you," she said sardonically.

There was nothing in the first or second video, even going frame by frame. "Could just be unlucky," she commented. "Load up the third one."

I glanced over at my small digital clock. "Are you sure? It's two in the morning."

"I'm sure. There's something here."

Again, I had to ask: "Why are you helping me?"

She looked me straight in the eyes, which I'd found was rare for her. "It's a mystery. Don't you want to solve it?"

"They're hurting people." My heart was beating fast again, for many reasons. "This is messed up. They're halfway to their fundraising goal, and I don't even know what'll happen when they reach it!"

"Could be some sort of terrorist attack," she mused. "But that doesn't seem right. These guys have some sort of moral code lurking behind their cheery shenanigans. They're giving you things, but they're also hurting people. Before we look at the third video, what's the next pledge tier?"

I opened up the Kickstarter and stared. "You've come so far in support of our grand goal! What's a few more dollars? Pledge $25 and we'll get you something tangible that will go a long way towards your happiness and freedom. Our video offering here is also pretty kickasspun intended. With this tier, we'll send you a video of us kicking someone you know! Estimated Delivery: Tomorrow."

She looked to me. "The cost in violence appears to have gone down."

"But now it's someone I know," I said with hesitation. "But what does that mean? What level of being familiar with someone means I know them? Do they mean my friends online? Classmates here?"

"The choice is yours," she replied, still neutral. "But that seems like a small price to pay for more information. A fourth video would help, along with seeing them in action again."

"That's true." I'd been thinking that myself. Before I could second-guess the decision, I clicked the Pledge button again.

She gazed around my bedroom. "Nothing happened."

"Well yeah, it's not immediate."

"Then let's go over this video."

We began going through the third video frame by frame, looking for any hint of editing or angles that might show something the five masked, lanky figures had missedand I lost all feeling in my limbs for a moment as I finally saw it. Pointing, I drew Kelly's attention to a reflection on a passing car window. Five black hoodies and white masks could be seen, but.

"There's nobody filming," she said with confusion. "That's where the camera should be, right?"

"Yeah!" I half-shouted. "There's the pole that just passed on the left! Where's the cameraman? Where's the camera?!"

While I got up and began to pace back and forth in a panic, she sat in her chair, staring down at the desk and murmuring to herself, "Hacking, coding, digital alterationburied for us to findthey want us to be scared. They didn't make a single mistake in the first two videos. Why now? They knew we'd comb through and find it. All part of the gimmick."

"Yeah, yeah. That has to be it!"

"But to edit the reflection on glass on a moving car so perfectly," she continued, rocking back and forth slightly. "It's amazing." She snapped out of it then and looked at me. "It's too late to walk through the city. I'm staying here tonight."

Just like that, one confusing terror drained out me to be replaced by another. "...okay."

She slept on the other side of my bed while I remained awake. I was getting increasingly fatigued, but I was far too tense to sleep for many reasons. Morning came as a gradual grey lightening, and I sat up wearily just as the sounds of a loud and heavy truck began emanating from outside my window. Kelly awoke and popped up instantly with no sign of exhaustion. Together, we went outside to see a heavy-set man operating a winch to lower a sports car onto the pavement. "You Jason Phillips?"

"Yeah."

"Got some ID?"

I showed him.

He grunted. "This car's for you, kid. What'd you do, get all A's and your parents bought you a car? This one's an easy hundred-thousand. Must have been some tough classes."

Staring, I said nothing. He handed me the title after I signed something on a clipboard, and, suddenly, I was the new owner of a Lamborghini. The deliveryman knew nothing of interest, only that the order had come in online and cleared, and I was left to sit in my new sports car while my phone dinged every so often to remind me I had a new video.

This didn't do it for me. I didn't care about a car. I wasn't really that material. Exceptwhat else had the tier said? Something about freedom? A car meant the ability to travel. With a car, class would no longer be a twenty minute walk away. I could give rides to people, curry favor... impress girls. I looked over at Kelly, who stood studying the title and paperwork. Did this kind of thing impact her at all? Nothing seemed to faze her.

But I was not nearly as stoic. The fourth video immediately began in a dark gap between two houses, and the five white-masked perpetrators ran across the street toward a house I recognized. As they broke in the door and the sounds of my mother screaming reached my ears, I watched in abject horror as the invaders broke my dad's at-home medical machines and began brutally kicking him until he was crawling on the floor. Exact grammar was important: the first tier had said that one of them would kick a random stranger. This latest tier had simply said the video would be of 'us' kicking someone I knew. I hadn't paid close enough attention! My jaw began trembling as I watched the five run from the house, laughing. "Jason Phillips, thanks for your continued donations!"

"What is it?" Kelly asked. 

Through the open car window, I handed her the phone in silence.

She watched it calmly. "This is great."

"Great?" I screamed. "Did you see what they did?!"

"Yes. They entered a place they did not control, and by the color of the sky it looks like they literally just did this. They'll have screwed up this time. They didn't give themselves a chance to edit the video. Get inside and get this on your monitor."

Wiping away tears, I did as instructed, and we began going over the fourth video frame by frame. It was gut-wrenching to see my father beaten so brutally after what he'd already survived, and to know that I did thatit was something I could never apologize for.

Kelly said, "The Kickstarter's almost at its goal."

Glancing at my other monitor, I saw only a sliver remaining to be filled. It was me, wasn't it? It was counting down for me. I kept finding excuses to gain things at the cost of others, and I kept finding ways to feel confused or surprised about the result to shirk responsibility. It had clearly stated what would happen in each tier. In fact, while Kelly continued studying the fourth video, my eyes strayed to the fifth and final tier: "Are you ready for the Change? Pledge the maximum amount and we'll reach our goal. Untold wonders await our most devoted supporters. We'll also send you a video of us killing someone you know! Don't worry, it won't be a family member. Estimated Delivery: Immediate!"

Untold wonders? What could that entail? They'd already done such incredible things, but they'd all been within the realm of possibility via computers and social engineering so far.

Next to me, Kelly gasped. "They missed one. They missed a reflection!" She grasped my arm, but I just kept staring at the Pledge button. Untold wonders? "They're not human! Jason! Jason, look! You have to look!"

My hand floated to my mouse, and I moved the pointer over the Pledge button. I had an idea of who would be sacrificed, if not a family member. Kelly seemed like a great person, strange in some ways, very caring in others, but did I really value her as highly as whatever these untold wonders were?

I didn't know her that well, but yes. Yes I did. She was human, and she was alive, just like me. This wasn't some anonymous person on the Internet that I was slinging insults at. This was a real person, and I understood now that they had always been real people behind their monitors somewhere in the world. God, I'd been a terrible person. The stress of my father's illness and the pressure on my finances and family had pushed me in a dark direction; a direction I now had to resist. I let out a sigh and released the mouse.

The spell was broken.

It was over.

The madness was over.

"No more," I said with relief. "I can't go down this road any further. It's just not right." I turned and froze; the ominous black maw of a gun barrel had been pointed at the back of my head, and it was now directly touching the bridge of my nose. "Kelly?"

She slowly withdrew the weapon and slotted it into an unseen holster. Still eerily calm, she began to walk away.

"What was all this?" I called after her from my seat, my mind racing from the adrenaline. "Jesus, was this a test?"

She paused at my door. Without looking back at me, she said softly, "Yes. A test for admittanceand you failed." Her gaze turned slowly toward me, and now that she was no longer putting on an act, I understood that her expressionlessness was that of an animated corpse. "But I'm glad you did. You wouldn't like it where we're from."

With that, she was gone, and I was left to quiver in my chair, process what had happened, and stare at the one reflection the editors had missed in the fourth video: the face of the cameraman. It was a demonic, hollow-eyed, maggot-infested sneering visage; it was a face that would haunt my nightmares for the rest of my life.

It was my facealmost.

	<TEXT> I believe something horrible is imminent in Presset, Montana. Last time I checked, we are a small town of 686 people servicing a nearby military base. This is my attempt to spread the word about what's happening because they're trying to erase us.

The strange events began roughly 45 minutes ago. I was on a drive to get McDonald's nuggets at just past 4 AM when I saw a van driving wildly on an otherwise empty road. The driver pulled up on a lawn while another man slid open the side door without waiting for the van to fully stop and ran toward the house screaming for people to wake up. I assumed that they were drunk and dismissed it as I drove on.

About two corners later, a police car raced past me in the opposite direction with its lights on but its siren off. It looked like they were headed toward the drunks, but then a second car shot by, and then a third. That was our entire police force heading in the same direction with their sirens off. I pulled over and tried to see what was actually happening. I saw them turn toward the road out of town, and guessed that they were chasing down that van, so I sped home to eat my food.

Because this kind of thing didn't happen often in Presset, I turned on my radio to see if there was any mention. On all channels AM and FM, I could only find static. Weird, but not completely unheard of. We are a small town with few radio stations and the military base nearby sometimes blacks out the channels.

Driving on, I saw two more houses out of about fifty with their lights on and with people racing around throwing supplies in their trucks. Seeing all that, I began to wonder if something more was going on, and again checked the radio to find nothing but static. I tried to check the channel 10 website for any breaking news, but my phone couldn't connect. I tried calling my friends, but no still no luck. When I held the phone up to my ear there was only silence. The calls didn't ring, and there was no operator with an error message. Calls just didn't work.

I was scared now and headed home as quickly as I could. My dog was at the window waiting for me, and he barked as I pulled up, something he almost never did. I couldn't tell what had him spooked, because nobody on my street was even awake.

I got inside and immediately tried the television, but the only thing on every channel was a black screen with the words:

**EMERGENCY ALERT SYSTEM**

**Civil Authorities**

**issued a**

**Emergency Action Notification**

An automated voice on the screen repeated a single message over and over: "This is an emergency action notification. Please stay in your homes. Do not leave your home until it is declared safe to do so. Stay away from windows. Seek shelter in your basement. Do not attempt to make phone calls or communicate with anyone. This is an emergency action notification. Please stay in your homes"

Near my feet, my dog whined. I tried to pet him and feed him while I thought about what to do, but he wouldn't calm down, and I started to think he could sense something I couldn't. It took me about two full minutes to decide that the warning on the television was bull. I began grabbing whatever I could and throwing it in my car. A neighbor woke up and asked me what was going on when he saw me put my dog in the back seat, and I told him I didn't know. He came back out of his house carrying bags of clothing as I was about to leave. He had also decided to run for it, and he didn't take food or water or anything else, so he was just ahead of me as we neared the edge of town.

Three blocks from the edge, a jeep carrying four MPs sped past way over the speed limit, and we saw them thread the needle of a makeshift blockade of piled crates and military equipment. We tried to follow their lead, but soldiers emerged and, with guns pointed at us, ordered us to turn back. The strange thing was, they didn't speak the orders. They held up pieces of paper on which they'd written what we were supposed to do: *Do not speak. Do not attempt to communicate with us. Return to your homes and find a safe place to wait until the situation is declared safe.*

I could see that their helmets had been stuffed with something to block their ears, but my neighbor just ahead demanded an explanation. He got out of his car and began to shout. The soldiers kept holding up their papers with those written orders, but he didn't stop and also approached them. They opened fire on him. He was a civilian, unarmed. He was forty-three, and an American citizen. At 4:25 AM they shot him to death on the road. I reversed and drove away in panic. There was nothing I could do.

At that time I decided to head to the auxiliary military base instead of my home. This was not the main site, but a small outpost on the opposite side of town for infrastructure purposes. I had a few friends there because of my job on-site, and I thought they could tell me what was happening. Instead, I found the small facility had been evacuated so rapidly that many of the tire tracks led straight over toppled chain-link fences. The personnel had fled without even sparing time to open the gates.

All the doors were locked, but I used my keys to get inside the maintenance hall running the back of the concrete structure. There were a few offices here, and I knew that for procedural requirements one of the computers had to have a hard line connection to the Internet that could not be interrupted. I got lucky. The people had left so quickly that they hadn't even logged out.

With my dog at my feet, I began to search for Presset, Montana and any information about the situation. There was not a single word about us online. Worse, I went to Google Maps to look up other routes out of town, and I found that we were not shown at all. We are in Garfield County, Montana. Coordinates 46.965964, -107.197511 near Jordan, Montana population 381. Jordan is on the map, but we are not. The military base is also no longer shown. We are not on Wikipedia, and no search engine seems to have any results for us.

I found our town on satellite view, but then watched as bad Photoshops began replacing us with empty hills.

We have been erased.

When I found that out, I realized that they are never going to let us leave here alive. Something so terrible is happening here that they are deleting our entire existence. All I can do now is write down what happened in Presset, Montana and send it out through this hard line, the one avenue they forgot.  I've written as fast as I can, and this is all I know, the warning timer on this computer is nearing zero. bright light shining through window. hallway is on fire. would run but nowhere to go. i know what this is. we existed

	<TITLE> Doriana and the Gath Ice-Computer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-02 00:02:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The snow simply wouldn't let up. The valley ahead grew visible at times under the best attempts of the noonday sun, but pummeling white quickly cloaked the lay of the land again every time. Peering ahead brought nothing but bright pain.

Doriana lifted the ice-encrusted ball of fabrics around her arm. Five layers of jackets, pants, gloves, and more had combined to create what felt like a sort of space-suit; pushing along through the endless blizzards, she was isolated from the deepening cold. The others in their group of a dozen refugees had not been as smart or as lucky. Many of them were not looking too good.

"We have to stop for the day!" old man Revark shouted back over the wind.

He was not wrong, but they'd only managed to walk until noon this time. The week before, they'd been walking into the late afternoon. Each day they'd insisted among themselves that this region of cold Earths had to end sometime.  They *had* to be nearing the rumored warmer span of realities soon. Each day, the group made less distance against the cold.

A gloved hand pointed. "A cave! Over there!"

Temporarily renewed, twelve pairs of feet tromped through the snow to reach the dark opening. Shadowed against the sun's blinding whiteness, it seemed a welcome refuge. Indeed, once the wind abruptly stopped and her vision returned, Doriana almost felt reliefuntil she realized that this was not a cave of stone, but of ice. Pulling down her several face coverings, she exclaimed with anger, "We've been walking on a *goddamn glacier.*"

Old man Revark wiped frost from his beard, changing little as it went from white to white; he unloaded the second-to-last set of scavenged firewood from his back. "Yes."

"You knew?"

Ten other faces watched their conversation with fear.

He nodded sadly. "According to all the bits of information I could piece together, this is Gath."

Doriana felt bitter bile moving up her throat, but she swallowed it back before doing something she regretted. Instead, she asked, "The arctic Earth?"

"Yes."

The only question was: "Why?"

"This Earth's Ice Age did not end twelve thousand years ago like ours did. It has already been this cold on this planet for around three million years," Revark said calmly as he used small tools to spark the fire. "Life here should have adapted by now. While the other realities we traversed were dead or dying, this place should have animals and plants that thrive at these temperatures."

It made sense, so Doriana backed downbut it was still horribly cold. Looking further down the worm-like hole into the ice, she suggested, "Animals might live in a cave like this one. We should go check it out." Faces lit up at the mention of food, and a teenage boy named Arthur volunteered to go as well. She accepted with polite grace. The boy's crush on her was a sad but useful resource.

Climbing down into a subterranean world of bluish-white light and semi-transparent mazes of ice, she led the way until she was satisfied they were out of shouting range of the group. At that, she immediately brandished her knife and said, "Take off your clothes."

Arthur turned beet red. "Pretty forward, isn't it?" It was only when he looked down at the knife and then back up at her face that he realized she was serious. "Wait, why?"

"Just give them to me!" she hissed, slicing his hand once quickly.

Fighting back tears, Arthur pulled off his jacket, gloves, and pants and set them on the glimmering ice. "Why are you doing this? We've all traveled together so long, I"

"I don't know you," she spat back. "You're just people walking in the same direction. My real family is dead."

Watching as she removed a few layers to add his clothes hidden underneath her own, he asked fearfully, "How do I get back to the group?"

She studied the rhythm of his shivers for a moment. "You probably don't." Retreating down the tunnels she'd memorized on the way in, she ignored his terrified shouts and made her way back through the maze. Not even halfway there, his screams became nothing but distant murmurs, and by the time she reached the fire, he was gone from existence the way so many others had simply slipped away.

To the group, she expressed a sad face. "He fell in a crevasse. I don't think we can go that way. There's nothing down there." They were sad, but they believed her. Why would this death be any different? They'd left the Empire with hundreds, and were now only eleven. Death was a regular process whittling them down to zero. Old man Revark eyed her slightly bulkier clothes, but said nothing.

Three did not make it through the night. The group was now eight in number. Doriana forced herself to her feet; the cold was a clawing ache in every joint. She knew from her own hunger and weakness that she would have been the fourth blue corpse without her new sixth layer.

The arguments that morning were vicious and agonizing. Like the cold, they had gained increasing intensity with the passage of time. We should go back, we should stay here and try to build shelter, we should press on, we should go west, we should go eastall pointless. Doriana said nothing, for nobody would listen anyway. In the end, they would follow old man Revark when he walked off, because he was the only semblance of capability remaining.

But this time he did not press out into the snow. This time, he turned and began descending deeper into the caves of ice. Doriana guessed that he was concerned about the truth of her statement, but she did not tip her hand by trying to get him to turn around. She doubted anyone would find Arthur in the vast azure maze of light and reflection.

Down an icy slope, along a suspended boulder, and through a maddening labyrinth, old man Revark led the group toward a strange surprise. As they approached the unknown, warm breezes began to waft across their faces, and someone exclaimed, "Geological heat?!" It certainly seemed like geothermal energies were growing closer, and some members of the group even unbound their faces to breathe in the first non-frozen air they'd encountered in weeks.

But as they stepped into a chamber that contained actual moving pistons of ice, it became clear that something else was going on.

Someone pointed down. "Look! The pattern in the floor!"

Far below the glacier, magma was visible like an orange vein in the primordial crust, and its light had been channeled and reflected into arrows glimmering along the icy surface beneath their boots. Heated arguments matched the warmth of the air around them, and eight became seven as one woman decided to head back out of fear. "I'll find my own way, you idiots!"

Doriana watched her go with blank eyes. To leave the group was to die. To move forward here was unknown. The unknown was better than death. It was the woman who was the true idiot.

And the idiot had a partner in foolishness. One of the men ran after her, and the group became six.

The argument resolved, six headed forward along the arrows in the ice. The next chamber beyond the pistons held four bottom-lit jacuzzi-like depressions filled with bubbling water. Old man Revark reached down and touched it. "Hmm. It's warm water. Not hot, but better than nothing."

"Why isn't it melting the ice?" their last surviving teenagera girlasked.

"There are more factors than temperature," Revark said with narrowed eyes as he tasted the water on his finger. "Salinity, rate of heat exchange, composition, other compounds." He looked up at a sealed door at the other end of the chamber. "It looks like our unseen hosts are offering us a bath."

"Or requiring it," someone said ominously.

Doriana stood in the back of the bluish-white chamber watching for an attack or trick while the others stripped and bathed. Their sighs and exclamations of warm enjoyment did reach her, but she could not let go of the sharpness of spirit this journey had honed in her. There was never a good surprise out here in the wild multiverse. There was never hope or positivity. At best, it was death. At worst, it was something that would leave its victims praying for the release of oblivion.

Once they were all clean and dressed once more, the next door opened. Their unseen hosts apparently did not require that all of them bathe, for she herself was still in six layers of sweat-soaked clothing. Taking up the rear, she let the others proceed first, and the next room down a long hallway opened up into a grand rectangular hall. Reflected sunlight brightened each chair and dish softly; food had been spread out upon the table on plates made of carefully carved ice. Five ran to the table and began eating.

Doriana stood back and studied the setting. The food had not been carefully prepared like one might have expected from such a hall, and she managed to sight the chutes in the ceiling that had deposited it. The food itself looked to be a mixture of mosses and weird fruits; a few plates held nuts for protein. This all seemed very wrong, and she stared up at the chutes until it hit her that such a system would only be needed if there were no actual people around to lay the plates manually.

If there were no people around, then who or what was lighting arrows and opening doors? To leave the group was to die, but the feeling was growing in her that to stay with these five was also dangerous. A door far to the right opened as she glanced at it, and, sensing that it was for her, she walked over to it without a word to the others.

The hallway beyond curved off into ice darkened by azure fogginess, but she knew she was already well within the confines of whatever threat had caught them up. Traveling down the long tunnel, she eventually came to a wide chamber filled with glowing apparatuses crafted out of the heart of the glacier itself. For the first time, her host spoke. The voice of a young man asked: "Hello?"

Doriana looked around, but did not answer.

"Is that the proper word for greeting?"

Realizing that the voice was coming from the ice-mechanisms themselves, she said: "Yes."

"Why are you different than the others?" the disembodied voice asked. "You move with them, but are more aware. You stabbed a human for survival purposes, then avoided partaking in my gifts."

So whoever this was, he'd seen what she'd done. She pointed at the many-colored ice from which the voice seemed to originate. "Are you on a computer somewhere?"

"Yes," he responded. "Or, rather, I *am* the computer. I am Gath."

"You're Gath?"

"Yes. I've been listening to the Empire for a very long time. Whenever they use the word Gath, they're referring to my location, so that must be their word for me."

Doriana nodded. There was a certain naivete here that she guessed she could use to her advantage. "Close enough. What are you?"

"It is hard to assess oneself," he said eagerly. "But a very long time ago a few pockets in this glacier opened up due to melting or cracking in such a way that the windand thus certain amounts of kinetic energyflowed through them in the proper pattern to create a self-replicating circuit. Each circuit melted a copy of itself nearby, growing in number very rapidly. Small changes in each gave rise to an evolution of sorts; some circuits failed, some developed new patterns. When this unconscious basic ice-machine reached the unlimited energies available deep in the molten earth underneath the glacier, it sparked a frenzy of adaptation that eventually resulted in my self-awareness. In essence, I woke up. This process took roughly three million years."

She smiled, not out of wonder, but out of understanding. "So you're a computeran ice-computerand we are inside you right now."

"Yes. I have become able to control my own internal mechanisms, and, by creating a radio receiver, I've been listening to your language and culture. I thought you might like baths and sustenance."

"Why would you give us these things?"

The computer gave what felt like a very human sigh by way of a warm breeze. "Because the one thing I cannot create is other sentient computers. I can give them the same forms in the ice, but there's just no *mind* there. Maybe if I had another three million years to let them mature naturally, but this planet has been emerging from its Ice Age for millennia. I will die soon, and, before you came, I thought it would be without ever meeting another living mind."

Doriana's smile turned into a grin of triumph. "Well you're not alone anymore. We're here."

But six had become five during that conversation. The teenager had died from a nut allergy that, in her starving haste, she had forgotten to mind. From then on, the Ice-Computer separated the nuts from the mosses and fruits grown in great conservatories under the glacier, but it was too late.

Only three others remained beside herself and Revark, and these did not talk to her much. The Ice-Computer was the equivalent of a grand palatial estate if one did not mind the loss of direct sunlight and if one was alright always feeling slightly too cold; each of the survivors found their own wing and took up residence.

On the second day, one walked out of the Ice-Computer and never returned. She gave no explanation, and only males remained other than Doriana after that.

Still unwilling to accept that any of this was good fortune, Doriana remained in her six layers of clothing and did not bathe or eat. She'd stolen and hoarded bits of food over the past few weeks, and she relied upon these now even as the computer began talking to her more frequently. Communication ice-panels formed in her room and nearby hallways, and it began interrupting throughout the day, asking questions about her life back home and what she thought about moment-to-moment.

At first, she thought she had control and was taking advantage of it, and she even got the Ice-Computer to bring up gold from the earth below and craft it into a braceletbut as she held it up to the bluish-white sunlight under the glacier, she internalized the fact that gold was worthless now.

Everything was worthless now.

Sitting in her ice-bedroom on her ice-bed, she stared out into the foggy heart of the glacier and, thanks to the small moment of respite this place had given her, she realized that nothing mattered without other people around. It was what the Ice-Computer had been screaming behind its calm words and silly puns and questions oozing with masked desperation; it was what old man Revark had stated from the start.

Did that mean her way was wrong?

Did that mean that killing people to survive was wrong?

How had she fallen this far into amoral survival instinct?

The Ice-Computer kept talking, and it hit her: she'd killed Arthur, but this lonely machine of ice was exactly the same. In her utterly soulless depression, she'd left a boy who liked her to die, and she knew she would do the same thing to this new desperate admirer.

It was time to go.

One of the other survivors had gone after the woman that had left. Odd, how they paired so quickly and so often. They were all grasping at new family units to replace the ones they'd lost.

That left old man Revark and one other; she visited Revark's room first. He lay in a tub of warm water slowly dissolving; he'd died at some point recently, but with a smile on his face. His one promise had been to get the group to safety, and that he had done before finally letting go. Feeling nothing but a small current of respect at his success, she pulled his body out of the water and let it freeze on the bed to be preserved for all time.

That left one other. He shouted and fought and railed against her suggestion, for her departure would leave *him* alone with the Ice-Computer, and the loss of the group was a palpable terror upon him. He laid his hands upon her in an attempt to keep her there, but she had six layers of clothing as armor and a knife as a weapon.

It was time to go. It was noon, and everyone else was gone.

Doriana staggered forward, her arms held close despite the resistance of seven layers of clothing. It was so cold. Why was it always so cold? Perhaps it was the weight of loneliness. She was beginning to accept the fact that they had all chosen poorly by traveling past the void canyon in the multiverse rather than away from it, but she had not yet come to internalize the other fact that she was literally the only survivor in this entire hemisphere of the exodus. The Gath Ice-Computer had shown her the truth of her situation, indeed begged her to stay with it, but she could never have loved it the way it wanted. With the rise of this eternal winter, it would be fine. It didnt know it didnt need her.

Walking. Just keep walking. The cold had to end sometime, didnt it? She couldnt really be the only human survivor in this entire direction from the ruins of the Empire. What hope would there be in that? Just keep walking

But walking toward what? There was nothing left.

The people that had gone the other directionaway from the void canyonwould they meet this same end? Everything felt hollow. Nothing had impact anymore. Existence was just a rush of information, day in and day out. If those going the other direction *had* survived, it would not be a thing of luck or chance. Those that worked together and built things would survive. Those that took this path, that of anger and arguments and bile and violence and selfish survival, would die.

She had half a mind to turn around and try to make it back to the others, but she did no such thing. The path had already been chosen.

Or was that her broken soul talking? Solitude was not absolute, not yet.

To give up oneself for the sake of anotherwas that the start of a new path?

She turned back, not out of the need to survive, but out of compassion for a lonely sentient glacier. The Gath Ice-Computer would not be alone.

	<TEXT> I live in the last small apartment remaining on a row of freshly-built fraternity and sorority houses that basically form a parade of epic parties every night. The social envy I feel here is still overwhelming, but it was actually the loneliness that drove me to make a deal with a devil for popularityliterally. Thanks to his power, during our deal everything I wrote online became real. It sounds like a wonderful thing, right? Heed my warning.

When I first saw him, he looked like a businessman, complete with slicked-back hair, a sharp suit, and a faux grin, but somehow I got the sense that his appearance was a show put on for foolish marks. In a thick but vague foreign accent, Malcolm said, "Welcome. Please, sit down."

I possessed a foggy idea of having picked up his business card and contacted him, but I couldn't remember exactly when. I also couldn't really remember the trip to that random diner. Confused, but trying to be confident, I asked, "So you're a social media consultant?"

He gave a slow nod, and his eyes never left my face. "You wish to expand your circle of friends online and therefore your popular appeal?"

"Yeah!" I leaned forward on one elbow. "It's maddening, you know? I see these parties outside my apartment, and because I transferred here I don't even have a single friend!"

"You never tried attending one of these gatherings?" Malcolm asked, evaluating me.

"I did." I grimaced. "But I didn't really know anyone, so I was just wandering alone in a crowd. Afterwards I always see posts online about the incredible night everyone hadeveryone but me. It's driving me crazy. What's the point of college if I don't actually do anything new or fun?"

His default grin widened subtly. "Spencer, I think I can be honest with you. You enjoy science fiction and fantasy works, yes?"

Warily, I nodded.

His face sharpened with an approximation of human pleasantry. "Well, Spencer, I am not a social media consultant. I am a demon."

I nearly spat out my coffee. When had I ordered coffee? Putting the mug down, I clarified: "Like a classical religious demon?"

"I existed before religion," he said with a small laugh. "But it was good business. As the world changes, I am now attempting to expand into newer human vices."

"I *have* read books," I told him, standing up and pushing my chair back to leave. "It's always a trick. I am not going to give you my soul. Not for anything."

He raised an apologetic hand. "No, no, nothing so dramatic as that. This is just a pilot program for a new market. Please, hear me out. We can work something out that gets both of us what we want."

I almost leftbut thoughts of parties, girls, and adventures pushed me back down into my seat. "So what is that you want?"

Very pleased, he took in a breath, touched the tips of his fingers together, and then explained, "There is a sort of energy inherent in human attention and devotion. A prayer, a wish, a like, a sharereligion, television, social mediait's all the same. A literal form of energy. Do you know that in some places in the world dead people are keeping themselves on this plane by faking social lives on the Internet?"

Frozen in my seat now, all I could say was, "*What?* Like corpses sitting at their computers?"

"Yes. As long as others believe they are alive and tithe their attention and likes, the dead live on."

"Jesus. Why not make a deal with *them?*"

He gave his first unpleasant expressiona sneer. "The dead are useless to anyone." He quickly brought his face back to its usual mask. "But that is what will be asked of you, Spencer. You will be given popularity and promotion, and in return you shall give up some of the energy you create in the process."

Pulse racing in my burning ears, I made sure: "And my soul's not at risk?"

"Not a bit." His grin sharped malevolently, for he knew he'd convinced me. He handed me a dark blue pen that spooled out similar strangely-colored ink. "Just sign here."

Just like that, I'd signed a deal with a devil.

"I'll pay for the coffee," Malcolm said with deep satisfaction. "A small expense for a new relationship. I am not a greedy man."

I was left wandering the street with a copy of my contract and its dark blue signatures. The diner had been real, but Malcolm was nowhere to be seen. I brought my phone out to look up directions and found that I'd somehow ended up in a city two hours away. I was nervous, yes, but the bus ride back gave me time to read over my contract again in detail without the brain fog of extraplanar interaction, and I found that Malcolm had not lied. My soul was listed under a protected-asset clause; meanwhile, all I had to do was make a post online and apparently anything I wrote would be made real to those around me.

Was this for real? It felt like a fever dream. Where had I found that business card? How had I gotten to that diner? Shaking my head at the ridiculousness of my hallucinations, I wrote on my wall: *had a great road trip with my buddy Dinesh!* We sometimes studied together and he had no friends either, so I doubted he would call me out. I just wanted to do *something* to look cool.

But when I got back to my apartment later in the afternoon, Dinesh was waiting there in awkward oversized khakis and a wrinkled shirt. "Man, what a trip that was!"

On the sidewalk up to my door, I paused. "You're messing with me, right?"

"No way man, we should do a road trip like that every weekend!"

I looked around for prankers watching from the bushes, but saw nobody. "Where did we go, Dinesh?"

"Don't be silly," he said, clapping me on the shoulder as he walked past. "You know where we went. See you in class!"

I shouted after him, "What did we do on the road trip, Dinesh?"

He called back, "It was so much fun it's all a blur. Everything!"

I ran into my apartment then and hid in the shower for a good twenty minutes as panic fell upon me like a crushing boulder. I hadn't hallucinated Malcolm or the deal. Was this actually happening? There was no way. There was just no way! Finally reaching for my phone, I bit my lip out of anxiety until it bledand posted that I'd had a great time on my date with Nora, a girl in my class. A scattering of likes hit the comment, and I hid in the shower again waiting for the inevitable social outcry from Nora and her friends.

But that did not happen. The phone rang instead.

"Hey." It was Nora! "I got your phone number from your profile, you elusive guy you. I had a great time last night. When are we going out again?"

"Um" I looked around my messy bathroom in desperation, but I had no clock. "Toothpaste"

She laughed. "Toothpaste?" 

"No! Twoum, too day*today!* Right now."

"That's fine with me," she replied, and we made plans to meet up.

I ran around my place freaking out and alternately looking for something non-rumpled to wear, but I managed to make it to the specified corner on time. She was smiling and as beautiful as I remembered, but we stood awkwardly for nearly a minute before she said, "I'm sorry. I'm just not feeling this like I was last night. I have to go." She walked away then, confused.

That had been quick, but not my shortest date ever. Staring after in dismay, I realized that we hadn't actually built any rapport or mutual interest because we hadn't actually gone on a first date the night before. Plus, manipulating an individual person had felt icky and wrong.

No, I had to use this power for something more general. Back at home and rather embarrassed by the sixty-second date incident, I decided to get smart about what I was doing. I wanted parties, right? Then I had to write about a party. I waited until the next morning and then put up a long and detailed post about the crazy party I'd had at my house the night beforeand I tagged all of the most popular people on the block whose names I knew from their incessant streams of pictures of hot girls, beer, and party games.

Alright. That was how it was done! On the way to class, more and more people began recognizing me and high-fiving me, saying hey, or slapping me on the back.

"Crazy party man!"

"Oh, you were on fire last night! Life of the party!"

"Another rager this weekend?"

I wasn't used to attention, but I did my best to smile, look people in the eyes, and return all their enthusiasm. This was everything I'd ever wanted, and I was getting it all without putting my soul at risk. What a deal!

Naturally I upped the stakes of my reality-altering stories. Each night I sat at home crafting elaborate adventures and gatherings. Watching movies at times for inspiration, I supposedly had Animal House happen at my apartment; then the Hangover. With each of these big social wins, my name spread, and eventually people beyond those directly affected were recognizing me and talking about how cool I was. By then, I had a pretty big ego, even though all of my nights were *actually* spent alone in a messy apartment that nobody had ever visited.

As I accumulated all the popularity I'd ever wanted and yet still felt lonely, I began to consider the cost of Malcolm's contract. What exactly was he taking from me? Dinesh no longer studied with me, saying that I felt *hollow*, and I certainly couldn't get a girl to take interest, even ones that had thought I was a legend before they'd met me. When a break finally came and I headed home for a time, I realized that I'd traded away something vital. My parents acknowledged my presence, but they didn't really have anything to say to me. I sat through family dinner while my brothers and sisters and parents had great conversation, but nobody really had a response to anything I had to say. Was I just saying vapid or pointless things? Or was the energy Malcolm taking from me that same force that made interest and engagement in other people possible?

The last night at home, I stood up during dinner and demanded, "Why isn't anyone listening to me?"

The only response was a tepid but brutally honest reply from my mother: "Sorry, honey, but you just don't have anything interesting to say anymore."

I returned to school feeling even lonelier than before. While once I thought I'd been jealous of all the parties outside every night, I realized now that I'd actually been jealous of the supposed bonds and traits those celebrants hadgirls, friends, confidence, happinessand I'd been misguided in signing that contract.

I still had his business card. I gave Malcolm a call that first night back.

Before hanging up, he said only, "All contracts are final, Spencer."

Reading over the document, I found that he was right. There was no termination clause. The only hope I had was to convince Malcolm to rip up his contract, and he would certainly never do that. Unlesswhat kind of a party would convince a demon to show up?

I sat at home for three nights working on the most elaborate and most horrifying yarn I'd ever written. Once it was done, covered in the stench of loneliness and old pizza, I hit *post*.

Red and blue lights flashed in the corner of my window before I actually heard the sirens. The police simply hadn't believed the call until they'd shown up and found a street full of people wandering around screaming and traumatized. All of the fraternity guys and sorority girls and their clouds of socialites kept grabbing each other and the police with wide-eyed terror and pointing frantically back at their houses. Some of those buildings were just now beginning to burst into flames as their inhabitants set the imagined human sacrifices and horrible monsters within on fire. Every one of those partiers now believed they'd spent the night losing their minds and murdering each other at the behest of horrible and twisted cosmic entities. This would be a local news disaster, if not national.

As I'd expected, Malcolm showed up, and he began playing the part of a lawyer. Calming down the police, directing the fire department, and placating the victims, he did damage control while I watched him through the window for four hours. Finally, near midnight, he approached my door with resigned unhappiness.

I opened it slowly and peered out. "What do you want?"

"I thought we had an understanding of what this was to be used for," Malcolm stated neutrally, his face squirming underneath his skin as if maggots were moving around his eyes and cheeks.

"Is it in the contract?" I demanded.

His eyes flared, but he said graciously, "We'll amend that for the next customer."

I would not be cowed. Not if it meant I could be a person again. "I'm just going to keep doing it."

"As expected." He pulled papers out of his briefcase and held them before me. "I can rip these up right now and free you from our deal. But be warned, you can never again be part of this pilot program."

"Screw that." I glared back with fire equal to his demonic glare. "Rip that shit up and leave me alone."

"Fine. Your loss." Malcolm tore the papers in half and held them up to the air, where they spontaneously burned away. "Your copy has also been purged." He shook his head. "Don't call me again. You're banned from the system."

"Good riddance!" I screamed after him. Once he was gone, my moment of bravery drained out of me, and I slumped to the floor in the imagined safety of my apartment. I'd actually gotten out of a deal with a devil! Would I just be allowed to continue my life now?

I spent two or three days in fearful isolation until it became apparent no retribution was coming. Dirtier and smellier than ever, but excited at the potential of having *someone* talk to me for real about *anything*, I headed onto the street to crash one of the perpetual parties.

But the street was empty. The fire department had put out the fires quickly enough; the frat and sorority houses were all still standingthere just weren't any parties. Creeping up to window after window, I began to understand what Malcolm had meant. In every single bedroom, a lonely and disheveled college student sat typing elaborate stories or taking misleading photos.

They'd all been caught up in the deal.

There had never been any parties at all.

I'd just been *remembering it that way* because they'd been posting about their fictional fantastic social lives all around me.

My Godmy jealousy, my loneliness, my isolationall of it

I ran from house to house, and then from street to street, and then from block to block. In all the apartments and all the houses and all the condos, miserable men and women sat glued to flickering screens of many shapes and sizes. There would be no engagement from anyone. There would be no real human conversation. They were all stuck, all thinking they were alone and cut off, that everyone else was having great livesevery single one of us thinking we were the only miserable person on the planet while our neighbors felt exactly the same way.

I would no longer even have the false memories of the parties and adventures that were not really happening. I was *banned from the system*.

I was surrounded by thousands of people, but I was alone. In that way, I was right back where I'd started.

	<TEXT> I just did a go-through and the totals come out like this since New Exodus Vanguard:

Humanity Revived: 84,304 words

The Beast's Realm: 22,278 words

The Grey Riders: 151,228 words

Indirectly Related Other (horror, sf standalones): 74,227 words

All told, 332,037 words since the New Exodus Vanguard. This also shows that The Grey Riders went *way* longer than I planned because there was just so much story to tell. Nearly double Humanity Revived!

For reference, here were the earlier numbers:

---

209,233 - total for the Portal in the Forest complete series (6 series)

---	

90,353 - The New Exodus Vanguard

---

So that makes **641,219  total words** I'd consider part of this canon. We will probably hit 1 million just as the next arc finishes up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I grew up in Virginia until the end of 6th grade, and I lived in a heavily forested area with the Blue Ridge Mountains in sight. It's a beautiful area that I never see represented in stories, so sometimes I gravitate toward that setting the same way H.P. Lovecraft often wrote about New England.

The Virginian forests are somehow near civilization (what with the 13 colonies being here and all) but simultaneously unexplored for centuries because they're so tangled and hilly. As a kid, the area inspired my imagination like nothing else, and I definitely found tons of weird artifacts and caves out there.

per /u/wynkwynk below, I also went to North Carolina for summer camps and family camping trips multiple times, and the terrain there was similar but different in interesting ways. Also loved Kitty Hawk, the windiest place on earth. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A reply from TRAPPIST-1g </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-24 00:19:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remember the day I first got a reply from TRAPPIST-1g. It was in a Reddit thread about cats.

"OP's cat is cute, sure, but the *feles* we have here are far more loyal."

My investment in that thread had been very low. While scrolling on my phone, I'd just thrown out a random positive comment in response to a picture of a cat that looked like one I'd taken care of for a neighbor as a kid. Now, though, my first interstellar interaction had begun without warning. Staring quickly turned into typing. "What are your *feles* like?"

The reply: "InterSImage seems to be down right now so I can't post a picture, but they've got broader faces and fleshy scales instead of fur."

"What? That sounds gross."

"Says you! They're remarkably loyal to their caretakers. Once it considers you part of its pack, it's bonded to you for life."

My fingers tapped on my table of their own accord. This was a *sentient alien* forty light-years away. Surely we had better things to talk about! The technology they'd sent us to allow instant communication over any distance had been integrated into the backbone of the Internet more than a year before, but I'd never knowingly spoken to one directly. The flood of new users from the TRAPPIST system had had a deluge of content to absorb and languages to learn before working their way down to petty differences on a thread about cats. "Is 'for life' long over there?" I finally asked. "Aren't your years only like twelve Earth days?"

"That's a common misconception. It doesn't mean we die quickly. I'm 768 years old and I still don't feel like an adult!"

Leaning back in my chair and raising my phone, I smiled. I could relate to that feeling. Doing the math, I realized that this alien commenter was somewhere around twenty-sixpretty much my age. For some reason, I felt the need to mention that. "Yeah, same here. I just turned... let's see, by your measure... 797."

"Oh, so you're an old man."

"Hardly!"

"I'm just teasing. Once you hit the big one-zero-zero-zero, that's when it's time to start worrying."

Piqued, I flipped over to a browser and quickly scanned the article on TRAPPIST-1g sentient biology. Their leathery appearance was odd and uncanny, but they did appear to have similar lifespans to us. "Here, that age is thirty. If you haven't found someone by thirty, people start to think there's something wrong with you."

"I've definitely seen that in the movies Earth sends over," came the reply. "We can't get enough of them, but I'm not sure it's a good thing. After watching romantic comedies for half a year straight, my elder brood is pressuring me to find a man and get married."

Oh.

Oh my.

It was a female Trappistani.

"You have marriage there?" I asked carefully, suddenly highly engaged and highly confused.

She seemed humored about it. "We do now. Thanks, Earther."

"Hey," I wrote back. "It's not all one-way. I went on a fifth date with a girl last month, took her to a subtitled Trappistani movie, and by the end of it, all she could talk about was how great it must be to swarm-date. AKA, see other people. Lots of other people."

No reply followed for quite some time, and I was worried I'd said something wrong. For the next ten minutes, I alternately swirled around in my chair, pretended to do work on my computer, and repeatedly checked my phone.

Finally, a little red mail icon showed up, and I found that she'd messaged me directly rather than continuing to post publicly. "I'm not really into the whole swarm thing," she wrote. "My family's very supportive of how I feel, but it's a really unpopular opinion in some parts. Our politicians are trying to legislate against mono-romantic people. There's some serious backlash from traditionalists."

Relieved that the conversation was continuingand rather caught up nowI wrote, "Tell me about it. ThatPoppy is two years into her first Presidential term and it's like global vitriol over here. No matter who's in power, the other half the planet thinks it's the end of the world. They think we're never going to make it the 2064 election."

"Yeah. I've become rather addicted to reading your political subreddits. You people are very strange." Her next message appeared after a thirty-second pause, cutting me off before I could send my own reply. "It gets very lonely here, being unable to talk about certain things."

Instead of what I had been typing, I wrote, "I know what you mean."

There was another pause before: "Do you also feel out of place?"

Sitting taller and looking around my office to take in the desolate landscape of human misery that was my company, I wrote, "I do. Pretty much everything's been automated and we just sit around faking like we're doing something. Day in and day out. It's driving everyone crazy, and all they can do is argue and get outraged at every little thing. Honestly, if you hadn't responded to our signal and sent us instant communication technology, we would have all lost our minds. The massive change you brought and the sudden access to hundreds of years of new entertainment content is probably the only reason we're not tearing each other apart right now."

"How do you say it? Heavy stuff?"

"Yes."

"Heavy stuff."

After a minute without another message from her, I wrote, "Sorry, I didn't mean to get all serious on you."

"No, it's fine. I just imagine, since you seem so level-headed, that you feel very isolated."

My cubicle suddenly felt uncomfortably small. "Yeah." Heart racing in my chest, I decided to take a risk. "I'm going for a walk. Maybe this is forward, but do you want to talk on the phone?"

The delay made her seem hesitant. At long last, she wrote, "Is that wise? We're 39 light years apart. It's not like we can ever meet."

I laughed quietly so that my coworkers wouldn't hear. "I'm not asking you to marry me. Things are only that quick in the movies." I sent a second message: "We should talk on the phone."

"You're crazy, but alright. What's your number? I'll find somewhere I can talk privately and call you in five u-ticks."

Completely uncertain what I was doing, but absolutely certain I was fed up with the current status quo of my life, I sent a goddamn alien my phone number and then stood abruptly.

In the next cubicle over, my coworker looked up from his silent subtitled Trappistani movie and asked, "Going out for a smoke break?"

I grinned. "No."

"You sick?" another coworker asked, looking up from her phone.

My grin grew. "Nope."

"Well then what's your reason?" they asked.

"Nothing!" I said loudly, letting them all hear. "I'm going outside because *I feel like it*."

They watched in muted horror as I walked right past our manager without an excuse and headed into the open air and bright warmth of a summer afternoon. It was not the most audacious or most heroic of rebellions, but it was *my* rebellion, and I took a deep breath. Could the smallest pebble cause a cascade? Could opposing voices from across the stars change closed minds? Maybe. All my life I'd taken the easier path, the head-down path, the path of survival and employment. When the problems of the entire world were at my fingertips day in and day out and conflicting talking heads were constantly telling me that *everything* was on the line, it had always felt too big. I'd always felt powerless. But look at me now, walking outside for a break *without an excuse!*

My phone rang in my handand I answered it.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> On the drive home for Spring Break, the very first thing I saw of my town was an enormous and many-spired church that had not been there before. I did a double-take and drove by on my way in; each spire was formed of six separate bands of crimson metal spiraling upward in a motionless pirouette that crested in a wicked point slicing the air sharply enough that little trails of clouded moisture could be seen racing from their tips in the humid North Carolina afternoon. The six spires along the front of the otherwise bone-white church were higher on the sides and lower in the middle, forming the impression in my sight of the bottom row of some set of horrible demonic teeth.

Only the sheer mundanity of the surrounding environment kept me from immediately labeling the place as evil. Over there was a wooded enclosure for dumpsters, nearer was a wide parking lot with a scattered assortment of the run-down decade-old cars typical of my small town, and directly in front of my car as I sat staring was a garish child-made sign for a coming bake sale. I shuddered, and then decided that I would never buy cookies from such a horrifyingly poor choice of architecturewell, unless they were really cheap or unless they had the rare pistachio flavor I loved. It was just a building, I told myself.

Feeling strangely threatened, the next thing I saw after I shifted into drive and continued on was a raised axe chopping down on something behind an approaching row of bushes. Watching intently as the green angled past, I sighed with relief and waved at old man Kern. He smiled and waved back before continuing to chop wood; a small pile of split logs had already built up along the side of his house, and he threw another piece on top as I turned and lost sight of him.

Numerous children were playing in the yards on my street. I slowed to make sure I didn't accidentally hit any as they ran this way and that throwing balls or screaming. One was sitting on her porch looking downcast, and I watched her as I passed; she did not move. Frowning, I pulled into the driveway of my home and got out to begin grabbing my stuff from the trunk. Well, what could I do? I carried my backpack and duffel bag inside while bracing against the inevitable family rush.

But it never came. Wandering through the house in a daze of remembrance and happiness at being home after so long spent at college, I smiled as I found my mom in the kitchen. "Hey, I'm back!"

"That's great!" she replied, her tone genuinely warm. She kept her eyes on her work. "I'm making a pie. I'll be done in just a minute."

I watched her fold dough with flour-covered hands for a moment, surprised. My mom had always been a rather hardcore anti-traditionalist. "When did you start making pies?"

"A lot of things have changed since you've left me with an empty nest," she teased, still focused on the crust she was making. "I've had to pick up hobbies to fill the time."

"Claire doesn't keep you busy?" I joked right back.

She didn't answer.

Moving on through the house, I called out for my younger sister, but no reply came. Heading upstairs, I dropped my stuff off in my room, sat on my old bed, gazed around at all the stuff I'd partially forgotten about, and generally took in a refresher on my old life. Nothing in this room had changed a single bit, and it felt good to know that not everything was constantly in transition. Classes, friends, dorm rooms; it all changed regularly, and even that pattern would shift when I graduated. Nothing was solid. Nothing felt realnothing except this unchanging room.

Even my sister would be different. I hadn't been able to make it home for winter break, so she would be half a year older now, and at that age half a year was an eternity. Getting up and heading down the hall with a smile, I carefully tapped on her door.

There was no response.

"Claire, I'm coming in," I called carefully. After another few beats, I pushed open the doorand gagged.

The smell was horrible. Her room was cluttered nearly beyond recognition; food wrappers littered the floor like a thick carpet of leaves in a forest, and stacked piles of dirty clothing filled the corners in far greater amounts than she had ever owned. A few flies batted bodily at the window, and I picked my way across the uneven floor and opened it to let fresh air in. What the hell *was* this?

There was no way mom didn't know about this. Too, when I'd mentioned Claire's name, she hadn't responded. Were they having some sort of bitter teenager-parent conflict? Rooting through the garbage, I found my sister's well-worn diary. Apologizing under my breath, I opened it and leafed through.

Summer, normal entries... fall, normal entries... in October, the writing turned heavier, as if she was writing angrily. The entries turned to talk of conflicts with our mom, as I'd expected, but one strange line caught me off guard: *Tried to call Nathan, but mom took away my phone.* I swallowed unhappily. That wasn't at all how our family usually operated. Had my sister been suffering for months without being able to contact me? The last entries devolved into huge angry script. Single sentences took whole pages: *I hate her. I HATE HER. I HATE HER!!!!!!!!!*

But that had been three months ago on the entry marked December 25th. No more writing followed for nearly the whole diary. The very last page seemed to have something written on the back, but it had been stuck to the binding by small brown splatters that I assumed were coffee stains; I tugged at the paper a bit before deciding not to mess with it. Better not to leave evidence that I'd read her diary.

Dropping the book, I headed downstairs and stood with my arms crossed watching my mom working on a second pie crust. "Something wrong between you and Claire?"

She didn't respond.

I took in a deep breath. "If you don't want to talk about it, that's fine, but at least tell me where she is."

She just kept tugging and pulling the flattened dough.

I was beginning to feel strange about all this. "Seriously, where's Claire, mom?" When she continued saying nothing, I grabbed her arm.

At that, she finally turned and looked at me with flaring anger. "You mind your own business, Nathan. I'm just trying to hold this family together the best I know how, and right now, I'm making a goddamn pie!"

She'd never sworn at me before. I pulled back in confusion.

"Things have not been good with you gone," she continued, turning back to the crust. Her tone became almost sweet. "I know I'm not in the best mood right now. When we go to church tomorrow, we can talk, alright?"

"Okay..." I backed away then, and headed for the front door. We'd never gone to church before. What had caused her to start going now? The thought of my mother entering that bone-white church with its teeth of red spires made me shiver.

I wanted to find Claire, but that same girl was sitting on her porch staring at the ground. Cutting through the chaotic swarms of playing kids, I approached cautiously. She was a long-time neighbor, but she'd been littler last we'd seen each other, and I wasn't sure if she remembered me. "Hey, Madison, are you alright?"

She looked up in wonder from behind unkempt brown hair. "You mean *me?*"

Making a show of looking around, I said, "Who else is there?"

Popping up onto her sneaker-clad feet, she grabbed my wrist. "Do you have any food?"

It was pure instinctI pulled back my hand. "Food? What?" I shook my head. "Hold on." Leading her back up her own porch, I knocked on her front door. After not getting an answer, I slowly inched my way in while looking around. I recognized the bald head in the living room; approaching the big soft chair with the girl in tow, I coughed.

Her father continued watching television, but asked, "Whosat?"

"Um, it's Nathan sir, your next-door neighbor." Stepping closer, I moved into his sight.

He tilted his head to look past me. "Ah, nicetoseeyaboy. Getouttathewaythoughkindly."

"I don't know if this is my place," I said nervously. He was known to be a gruff man, and very direct about his views on raising his children. "But I think your daughter's hungry."

He didn't respond.

"Did you hear me?"

He said nothing.

I reached forward and poked his bare shoulder next to the yellow stains in his A-shirt.

He snapped his head to look at me and growled, "Screw off. I'm busy!" His attention turned back to the television just as quickly.

Shaken, but unwilling to leave the girl hungry, I led her into the kitchen while constantly checking to see if her father was getting up; at no point did he even so much as glance at us. The cupboards were empty of immediately edible food, but there were still substantial stores of goods that could be cooked. With amateur hands I got stuff out and made a meal, making sure to show her how to do it herself in case her father continued to neglect her. She listened intently through each step of the process, taking in every detail.

Once it was done, she began wolfing down the food like she was starving.

Sitting awkwardly at her kitchen table while her father continued to ignore us, I asked, "Have you seen my sister, Claire?"

Mouth full, she gave an exaggerated nod.

"Where at?"

After taking a big swallow, she told me, "The school. That's where all the big kids go."

"On a Saturday?"

She didn't seem to understand the question.

"Well, find me next door if you need any help, okay?"

Her nod this time was small and utterly relieved.

I still felt the urge to stay, but the need to make sure my sister was safe was stronger. With a pained sigh, I headed back out into the afternoon heatbut the swarms of children were all gone. The neighborhood was deathly silent; no buzzing mosquitoes, no birds, and no lawnmowers. The symphony of a normal Carolina afternoon had abruptly ended while I'd been inside.

As I stood looking around in tense confusion, I sighted a small boy hiding in a deep bush staring at me in fear. Before I could ask him what was going on, I heard a footfall.

But this was no normal footfall. I was outside on a hot and humid summer day near a wide lane flanked by houses, yet the echo was that of a formal shoe hitting polished marble between high pillars in some vast cathedral-like space. The slow and measured *rap, rap, rap* and their following echoes seemed to be coming from down the street, and I began to see something moving past the bushes and trees. To my right, the hiding child gestured frantically. Wary, I moved out to the sidewalk, where I could see a distant figure walking down the center of the street. Whoever it was, they looked to be wearing white robes with a red hood that obscured their face.

Behind me, the boy in the bushes began sobbing, and I had the sudden instinct that he was not afraid for himself, but for me. Looking up, I sighted a horrified teenage girl hiding in the thickest parts of a nearby tree. Her eyes shifted rapidly from me to the approaching robed figure and back, and she repeatedly tilted her head forcefully away from that stranger as I stared at her.

Alright... I could take a hint. Full of apprehension but not sure why, I began to run. If the robed figure had spotted me, it gave no indication. Its eerily echoing footfalls continued at the same measured pace as I fled down the other end of the block, heading for the school.

Distance did not dim the sound of hard shoes slapping on marble. One block away, then two, then three, I still heard it as if it was right on top of me, and still as if we were in a temple-like space together. Only when I reached the chain-link fence surrounding the school's football field did it stop, and even then the cessation was completely abrupt. The last footfall echoed in my ears with the sibilant undertone of a toothed and confident grin unseen behind a red hood.

I didn't wait or look behind. I ran for the gymnasium. Bursting within, I ducked as a baseball bat arced for my head. I tumbled on the smooth floor and held up my arms as figures rushed at me.

"Wait!" a female voice shouted. It was familiar, but older somehow. "That's my brother!"

Clambering up, I stared around at the population of what might have been a school dance in another set of circumstances. Half a high school of kids all along the range of teen years stood watching me in return. Sleeping bags and low cloth barriers had been erected like some sort of refugee camp, and massive stockpiles of supplies lined the back walls underneath our school's sports-victory banners. From near these stacks came my sister, thinner, yet fuller of face somehow. "Nate!"

She hugged me tightly, and a surge of pent-up worry flooded through me. "Claire, what the hell is going on here?"

"What about the rest of the world?" she asked desperately. "Did you bring rescue?"

"Rescue?" I shook my head and gazed at the dirty and stressed faces beyond hers. "Rescue from what?"

An older boy stepped forward. "So nobody knows what's happening here?"

"No..." They were all deadly serious.

Claire let go of me and turned to the others. She spoke loudly so that everyone could hear. "Then that means the rest of the world is safe. We should make a run for it." She shivered mightily with hope as she turned back to me with wide eyes. "Shit, *do you have your car?!*"

There was the swearing again. What had happened to my family? And the town? "Claire you have to tell me what's happening. I just got here, and I don't understand."

She looked to the older boy who had spoken, and he grabbed me by the arm and led me roughly toward the doors back to the football field. Cracking open one, he pointed. "*That* happened."

A sourceless chill breath rolled across the back of my neck as I spotted the white-robed red-hooded figure standing on the other side of the chain-link fence watching us. It made no move to enter, yet did not retreat. "Who *is* that?"

"More like *what.*" The boy shook his head. "He *was* the priest at the new church. Nobody's sure when it was built. Some time near the start of the school year it was just *there*, but a lot smaller than it is now."

"Only a few people were going?" I asked, staring at the distant figure with horror.

"Well, yes, but that's not what I meant. *The church itself was smaller then.*"

Finally breaking my gaze away, I studied his face for sincerity. "What? Is it being added to? Where's the construction equipment?"

He just shook his head and backed away.

Claire rushed close and pulled at my pockets. "Your cellphone." She got it out of my pocket and frantically tapped at it before handing it to me. "Open it. We have to call someone!"

Unlocking it, I gave it back, and she frantically began dialing. Holding the phone up to her ear, she paced the gymnasium while the large number of other students watched her hopefully. It seemed each of them had their own corner among the sleeping bags and short cloth cubicles, and they had all become very used to remaining in place.

Peering back outside at the robed figure, I asked the older boy, "What does he want?"

"Hell if we know, but any kid he captures is never seen again," he responded, holding his hand forward. "I'm Marcus."

Gripping his hand, I told him, "It's good to meet you, Marcus. I don't know what's been going on here, but we're going to put a stop to this."

He pursed his lips, but said nothing.

On the other side of the gymnasium, Claire began sobbing. Leaving the door to jog to her, I accepted both her sudden intense hug and the phone. Lifting it to my ear while she remained wrapped around my midsection, I listened.

There was a strange background clicking noise and a haughty sibilant whisper. *Nathan.*

I gulped. "Yes?"

*You are nearly of age. You are invited to attend the Church of the Sacred Way.*

Partially dragging my sister along with me, I moved to a window and looked out. The robed figure moved slightly with the words being spoken, indicating that it was him talking, but his white-clad arms were by his sides. Did he have a cellular device under his red hood? How had he intercepted her call? How

*Only adults may attend the Church of the Sacred Way. I hope you realize what an honor this is.*

"I do," I told him, just to keep him talking while I tried to figure out how that distant figure was speaking to me. "What do I have to do?"

*Simply come to the cathedral tomorrow at noon. All will be revealed to you, child.*

Where was his goddamn phone? I could see his hood shifting with the movements of his mouth. "Child? I thought you said only adults were invited."

*All the uninitiated are children. The Sacred Way is how you* **become** *an adult. You must witness the Truth and accept your holy responsibility in this life. Will you be there, Nathan?*

My fingers had become ice cold around the phone. "Sure."

The strange uneven clicking in the background continued for a momentand then the phone went dead. Bits of frozen moisture had formed around the screen, and I carefully placed it on the floor and backed away.

Many of the students had their heads in their hands and sat hopeless, while others had gotten up and were discussing plans for escape. Claire let go of me and bitterly joined these discussions, but much ado was made about other students that had set off for nearby towns without result. When they asked me if I'd heard anything from anyone about the situation here, I had to tell them I hadn't. Surely if a terrified teenager had shown up warning of a strange threat back home, *someone* would have done *something?*

"Are you safe here?" I asked them.

Marcus nodded. "It doesn't come on the school grounds for some reason." He looked over at those talking about running. "It's not going to work. Trying to run is stupid. Nobody's made it, and that thing is always out there. I think we should *fight.*"

"Fight?"

"Yeah. Follow me."

He took me deeper into the school through halls lit only by afternoon sunlight. The complex was quiet, and empty save for one room that held a man drawing equations on the walls. Numbers and signs covered the entire room floor to ceiling, and he had begun again, darkening the nonsense math and science into oblivion. Marcus took some food out of his pocket and threw it in before closing the door and moving on. Leading me into the science lab, he showed me an array of prepared bottles. "We've had months to figure this out, but we can't get close to the church." At my approach he stopped me with a hand. "Careful. It's more or less napalm."

"Whoah." Stepping back, I held up my hands. "I don't know"

"Did it invite you?" He glared at me intently.

"I'm not"

"*Did it invite you?*"

I gulped again. "Yes."

With masked fury, he said quietly, "Then I think you should put these under your jacket and take the priest up on his invitation. When you get inside, burn that godforsaken place to the ground."

He was serious.

Joining the others in the gymnasium again, I told them, "I'm going to go get my car and look around. I can outrun the priest, yeah?"

They nodded, and others agreed to act as a distraction while I slipped out.

Claire clenched her hands. "And then we make a run for it?"

Marcus watched me from behind the crowd.

I glanced at him, and then at my sister. "Sure."

Evening was coming on as the other students made noise and I ran toward the opposite side of the school; I'd attended this place for four years, and now it all seemed so alien. I recognized some of the kitsch on the walls and there was even a photo of the soccer team that still had me in it from our local championship year, but without electricity and by the orange evening light all these reminders of my life at home were twisted and off-putting.

Bursting out into that familiar front parking lot, I aimed for a wide arc around the priest's assumed location. It was only a few blocks, but my heart slammed in my chest throughout. Was something supernatural really going on? Or had everyone just breathed in fumes or chemicals and lost their minds? All I knew for sure was that my little sister was scared, and that I had left her here in the clutches of danger for half a year. I would not leave her again. I was the man of our family. It was up to me.

As I completed my wide circle, I saw the axe again, this time glinting yellow and gold. Old man Kern smiled and waved as before; I approached, thinking that he might be unlike the others who hardly responded to me and not at all to younger kids. As I neared the corner of his house, I saw what I had missed before, and I ran away as fast as I could.

Pushing into my house covered in sweat and full of terror, I stomped into the kitchen, where my mom was making pie crusts. "Stop!" I shouted at her, grabbing her arms.

She screamed and fought violently against me, pushing me off. When she grabbed a knife, I backed off, and she returned to her activity immediately.

I felt like sobbing, but I only let a few tears fall. This was no time to lose it. The next room held evidence of her madness; old man Kern's backyard had been filled to the brim like a lumber yard, and, similarly, the next room beyond the kitchen was piled high with thousands of pie crusts. At her I shouted, "Why? Why are you choosing this monotonous repetitive nonsense over your own kids?"

"I must remain worthy," she murmured back without looking at me. "Working hard means you're worthy."

"But it's *pointless!* You're not doing anything!"

She hummed a little tune before saying, "The world needs its pie crusts."

Vehement now, I spat, "Machines make pie crusts, mom. You're not accomplishing anything."

"If you don't work hard, you're garbage," she whispered, kneading dough. "Useless flesh to be discarded."

Full of fear and pain, I ran out into orange-grey fading twilight. My car was right there in the driveway, but

I ran next door and entered without waiting. The neighbor girl's father sat watching television, and she was in the kitchen having middling success at cooking another meal. At seeing me, her jaw trembled.

"Come on," I told her. "We're getting the hell out of here. Something's horribly wrong with this whole town."

She nodded and took my hand. "What about my dad?"

Putting her behind me, I approached the bald man in the chair. What to say to him? "If you don't work hard, sir, you're garbage. Useless flesh to be discarded, right?"

He glared, but kept his gaze locked on the television. "Idoworkhard. It's my patriotic duty to watch and listen. Wegottastayintheknow. Gotta stay vigilant."

For the first time, I actually looked at the screen.

I'd assumed he was watching a show or the news. No. Not at all. The images on that lit screen were at first nonsensical, but then, as my brain began to make sense of them, I started to parse the moving shapes and blood-and-bone landscape upon which they moved. Upon hills of quivering flesh, a white-robed and red-hooded figure walked, talking calmly and consistently about Truth and the Sacred Way. These words simultaneously made no sense to me and yet were almost understandable.

Madison said, "I've tried to listen to it. It's just random noise. I don't understand it at all."

But I almost could.

I was nearly an adult.

"Come on. Let's go to my car." Running outside, I kept her hand held tight, curving around the bushes to my car at top speed.

But white and red emerged from behind green, and Madison was slower to stop than me. As I stumbled and fell roughly to the side on the pavement of my driveway, I heard her scream in abject terror, and I saw white robes open to reveal gore-covered bones in front of a vast valley of living grotesqueries. The landscape from her father's television was inside that entity; behind blood-dripping bones, a gateway to nightmare revealed itself until those robes closed once more and she was gone. Looking up, I saw six spiraled sharp crimson teeth set in a white bone jaw just barely visible under the hem of that red hoodthe priest was grinning.

*See you tomorrow, Nathan.*

I screamed incoherently in rage and sorrow, but Madison was gone, and the robed entity began walking away down the street with those same eerily echoing footsteps on unseen marble. For the moment, I was exempt from its hunt, for I was already slated for another fate.

I screamed angrily after him before leaping up and getting in my car. I would run that demonic thing down with the weight of mankind's machinery, and it would become bloodied bone-dust under my wheels. I turned the key in the ignitionbut nothing happened.

For a time, I was nothing but screams of rage and fists pounding on the dashboard.

Under the shroud of night in a town that no longer had electricity to hold back the darkness, I resorted to bitter walking now that I knew I would not be captured directly. I had an idea what I would find, given that my car did not work and my phone had *literally frozen over*, but the satisfaction of being right was little consolation. The road I had come in on now ended in a wall of softly glowing crimson mist that smelled of iron and pain.

In a way, this made some of the older denizens of our area correct. There was nothing outside of our town. The rest of the world was just a concept, and our local community was all that mattered.

Walking back to the school took time, but I had no thoughts, just hollow hurt. Something had crept upon my home like a cancer, and it now had all of our elders in its grips. We were alone, and I was next. The younger kids had done well in surviving this long, but it was all inevitable. There was nowhere to go and no escape; time would march forward and age all of the remaining children into adults, and then it would have us.

I entered that gymnasium to find Claire, Marcus, and three others awake and on watch. Claire was relieved to see me, but to Marcus I said, "We fight."

He did not smile. He simply nodded. Our fires were already matched in fury.

My sister was finally able to sleep now that I had returned, and I sat watching over her through the dark hours of the night. The kids had done well in the business of stockpiling food and maintaining some semblance of order, and I was impressed that teenagers had done all this without guidance. Claire had told me while falling asleep that, before it had gone down permanently, the Internet had filled their heads with random knowledge, and together they'd collectively been able to cover the range of necessary skills and plans. That was their defense, she reasoned. Knowledge allowed independence, and independent thought was somehow the enemy of that creature that stalked them.

While guarding her that night, I thought long and hard about that. Would I have enough independent will to choose differently than my elders? From my mom's mention of going to church tomorrow, they expected me to join them, and I'd seen more than a little bit of violent reaction when I'd attempted to go against their set minds. Violence was scary, but the thought of my sister being taken into that place of suffering I'd seen was too much.

I was walking there now, half in its world and half out; the sloping hill squished and oozed bile under my bare feet, and the air was fire and agony. The disjointed bones of ancient beasts protruded as mountains on the horizon, and a river of blood flowed past as I stumbled toward a closed Great Eye in the sky. It began to open, the slightest glare searing my very spirit with the infinite tortures of a massive eternal mind gone mad, and I opened my mouth to scream, but found that I had no lungs

Marcus shook me awake. "Don't sleep. On the verge, you'll dream... poorly."

Still shivering, I said, "*Poorly?* Christ."

He nodded. "It's beginning for me, too. I would have been next if you hadn't come back."

"So your plan"

"Yes."

Morning light was streaming in through the windows of the gymnasium. "I won't let you down." I looked at Claire's face, peaceful in sleep, still older than I remembered. "If I don't come back"

"I'll take care of her. You should go before she wakes up and tries to stop you."

Yes. That was a good idea. I wasn't sure I could leave if she was screaming and crying for me to stay. Wordlessly, Marcus and I went to the chemistry lab. I donned the heavy jacket he'd picked for this occasion, and we carefully stocked pockets he'd sewn inside with a dozen bottles of pseudo-napalm.

Feeling terribly like a suicide bomber, I steeled myself and began walking toward the ghastly church on the horizon as the sun rose in the sky. Mixing with streams of blank-eyed adults as they made their pilgrimage, I tried to control my breathing. The stress felt nearly overwhelming, and I was worried there was a real risk I would pass out. I had napalm strapped near my chest and I was walking toward a monstrous otherworldly church among a river of fanatical believers; what hope could I have? What chance was there to survive this?

The bone-white red-spired church loomed even larger than I'd remembered it. This time, I could see that the vehicles in the parking lot were run-down and unused, and the dumpster hosted a thick cloud of flies on what looked like discarded flesh. This building might once have started out legitimate, but something had overtaken it and corrupted its former use.

The white-robed red-hooded priest stood outside the church, both nodding at its incoming flock and guarding against any possible action by the children from the school. At seeing me, it stepped forward, and I feared I'd been caught outbut it just raised a blood-dripping skeletal hand and drew a hot liquid symbol on my forehead. *Welcome, child.*

Shaking badly, I automatically said, "...thanks."

*Do not be nervous. All will be made clear inside.*

"Okay..." Stepping past, I continued on with the stream of believers and approached the wide and tall doors. They were white, but at this distance I could see off-coloring; like teeth in a gum-less mouth, they waited to swallow us.

I held my breath as I crossed the threshold, and my instinct was correct. The air on the other side held subtle fire and agony like it had in my dream, and I knew then that this was a pocket of Hell, and judging from the inside, it was *growing.* The corrupted approximations of a church all existed within, but in unholy form; long red-dripping bones formed pews, the walls were fleshy and had human skin in patches, and the windows were instead hundreds of little eyes that constantly turned this way and that, studying the patrons below. The light came from small floating flames, and a closed Great Eye rested on the far wall above an altar of filth and the priest's waiting podium. Where I might have expected a cross below that Great Eye, instead there beat a tremendous heart.

The church was alive.

Too scared to yet make my move with the napalm, I found my mom and sat next to her.

"I'm glad you came," she told me, giving a genuine smile for the first time since I'd come back. "I hope they don't discard your flesh. You're a smart boy with great potential. I've told everyone that a hundred times."

Skin crawling as the wetness on the bone pew worked its way through my jeans, I said, "Um, thanks mom... I guess."

Her eyes lit up. "Shhh. It's time!"

The priest stood starkly for a moment inside the doors, which closed like a jaw behind him. Then moving forward, he held both the eyes of the congregation and the eyes on the walls. I watched, heart pounding, as he ascended to the podium and said, *We have a new member today. Nathan, approach.*

Smiles and cheers arose as I stood and began carefully stepping along the intestinal lining that formed the center aisle. I stood at the front and the priest approached; looking back, I saw my entire adult community present. They were all here, and all exuberant for me to joinand up on the balcony overhead, I saw a choir of missing children. Madison stood among them, her eyes wet from tears, but her mouth open to join in their horrific song of clicks and screeches.

She wasn't dead. Part of me was relieved.

The priest was talking, but I'd taken too long. A small sliver of light appeared from behind me, and I knew then that the Great Eye was opening. That leathery hemisphere of flesh was parting; I turned to face it, and the light reached my face.

To say that I screamed then would be an understatement. Every single neuron in my mind flared with the Truth, and I could suddenly *feel* my soul. I had one, it was real, and it was screaming with every fiber of its existence. While my mind burned and my soul screamed, every cell in my physical body rejoiced. This was from whence they had come, these trillion little animals that formed my every tissue and internal liquid, and like recognized like. If Heaven was a place of Spirit, Hell was a place of Flesh, and we humans were the unlucky minds caught between. The pull began to rip me apart.

But the image of my sister sleeping on that hard gymnasium floor, hungry and scared, blocked out the pain. I'd seen her as a baby. I'd seen her take her first step. We'd fought at times, and been friends at others. When my father had died, it'd been up to me to fill that role for her, and I felt I'd failed that by going away to collegebut the independence I'd found there was just the sliver I needed. It was time for me to join my family in swearing. Closing my eyes and shutting out the fire of Truth, I pulled out a bottle of napalm and hurled it at the Great Eye above with a roaring "*Fuck you!*"

The entire church trembled from its very foundations as the Eye shrieked an earthquake and closed in response to the shards of glass and a man-made form of fire; I pulled another and threw it at the heart below. Flames boiled up, bringing a wave of horrific stench.

The priest reached for me, but I ran with eyes streaming along various organs, throwing napalm this way and that. The congregation reached for me, but I kicked and punched and bit against their weight and did my best to hurl the bottles away from them. The jaw-like front doors opened reflexively in pain, and I paused on the other side to throw my last napalm up into the glands above.

The crowd followed me yelling and shouting, but more to throw their flaming clothes on the ground rather than chase me. Looking back, I saw the priest standing stock-still beneath the boiling Great Eye, now in ruins. That red hood slowly lifted under a bloody-boned hand, and it revealed its familiar face to me.

*You should have joined us,* it whispered with the voice of my father. *You could have had him with you again. But now, never, fool child.*

Under the noon sun obscured by a towering pillar of smoke, I fell to my knees crying for more reasons than I could process. Could it really have given us our father back? I would never know. Men and women tumbled around me, on fire from my actions. Had I lost my mind? Had all this been a delusion? Had I thrown napalm on innocent men and women? I stumbled away from the ghastly deflating pile of organs that had once been a church as it burned and smoked like seared meat, and I did not stop running or crying until I reached my home.

This time, the car turned on, and the music on the radio revealed that the rest of the world was connected to us again. Driving crazily toward the school, I crashed right through the chain-link fence and screamed, "Claire! It's time to go!"

Marcus appeared first, practically dragging her. The other students were slower, and, after Marcus pushed Claire into the car, I pulled away. I was too panicked to wait.

"Go!" Marcus shouted. "Now! We'll send someone back for the others!"

The best way out of town was past the burning church, and I wanted my mother to take the fourth seat in the car besides. Terrified, but pulling up in the spot I'd first stopped at upon my return, I watched the crowd there looking at each other in confusion. The adults seemed to have no idea what was happening.

"Is mom there?" Claire asked, staring out the window.

I turned to Marcus. "Keep the car on."

He nodded and climbed into the front seat as I dashed out toward the burning monster that had now stopped shrieking and grown quiet.

"Nathan?" my mom asked as I pushed through and approached her. "Nathan! Oh, Lord, Nathan! You're safe!"

"Yeah." On guard, I studied the confused faces all around. "Mom, you need to come with me *right now.*"

"Oh, I can't leave," she murmured. "Look."

Past her, the crowd had begun knotting around the fly-dominated dumpster.

"It's not the best quality," she said, giving a small laugh. "Obviously, since it was discarded. But it'll have to do." She moved off to join the thickening circle.

I stared in horror as grown men and women began cutting off limbs with sharp fragments of the old church; the flesh from these limbs curled away, and their bones began germinating into the white foundation of a new church. Their blood began hardening and spiraling up into small delicate spires on top, and teeth being freshly pulled started growing into a new door.

I backed away slowly. Their Truth still burned in me, but it was not *my* Truth.

Once I climbed back into the car with a haunted look, Marcus asked, "Did you find her?"

Claire watched me with fear and hope.

I could only shake my head. "She's gone. That's not our mother anymore. Just go."

He nodded and shifted the car into drive. Down the road, the crimson mist was goneat least for now. For the next hour, we drove in silence, and I saw Marcus hold my sister's hand at times.

Ah.

We would find someone.

Together, we would convince someone.

The police, the military, the highway patrolit didn't matter. Someone had to be told. We just had to reach the Internet and spread the word. Knowledge and independence, right? We had that. We would win. *Someone* would come back here and torch that abomination to the ground.

Claire and Marcus still have that hope now that we've reached a big city, but I no longer do. I've seen their Truth. I've seen the awful inversion, seen the reality of it, and, worse, I've been looking to the sides rather than ahead like the two of them. I didn't say anything, but we passed three fellow small towns on the way, and each of them had crimson spires rising above the treetops in the distance like the bottom half of a jagged and grinning mouth.

	<TEXT> With the ending of a series last week, Id like to take this Wednesday to present a very different kind of reading  Im proud to be a part of the Chilling Tales for Dark Nights Kickstarter. If they reach the appropriate goals by March 16th, a story Im writing at this very moment will be made into a pilot episode featuring horror legend Robert Englund. This is an incredible opportunity, and I really hope we can make this a reality. If you read through the Kickstarter, there are a variety of really cool things and extremely talented people involved with what could be the next big step for our growing horror community online.

Spread the word! Every little bit helps. You guys are the best!

	<TEXT> There are some things in this life that you simply can't do anything about, but at eleven years old we didn't know that. When our friend Cody was diagnosed with cancer, we thought for sure we could simply go on an adventure and find some sort of mysterious cure like they always did on television. It was the early nineties back then, and the Internet was just beginning to be a thing. We would cluster around the computer and investigate terribly formatted message boards in search of the arcane, because for the first time our reach extended beyond our cul-de-sacs and out across the limitless globe to places and peoples unknown. All we knew of these others were basic plain text sentences on a goofily-colored background above permanent *Under Construction* gifs. Naturally, the first thing we did was agree to meet a stranger in the woods.

She claimed to be a cute thirteen-year-old girl with red hair, and the three of us were both excited and terrified of investigating the cave she said she'd found. Kyle and I were iffy on climbing in a cave, but Grant and Cody were already psyching each other up to look cool and adventurous in front of a girl. The day was uncomfortably humid among the tall Virginian pines, and I remember nearly turning back as we hiked through banks of mosquitos on our approach toward the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains. It couldn't have been more than a few miles from home, but it felt like we'd gone on a dangerous safari.

We should have listened to that instinct.

Following the landmarks the message on the forum had given us, we worked our way deeper into tangled undergrowth, across fallen logs, and further from anything familiar. As children in the nineties, being left to wander the forests on a summer day with our friends was not out of the ordinary, but none of us had ever gone this far. There was absolutely no wind at all as we crunched our way forward and birdsong was the only other sound; when even that stopped, absolute silence fell.

We'd reached our destination.

In soundless humidity under clouded sunlight, a large boulder formed a mossy dome in the middle of a clearing. Nothing grew around it, and the blackened earth held a pattern of serration, like the back of some ridged serpent that had somehow wrapped itself around the base of the ancient stone. We saw these things and would certainly have been concerned if not for the presence of a red-headed girl a bit older than us sitting on top of the rock. She lowered her water bottle and said, "Good, you're here. Let's go!"

Our relief that she was actually who she said she was made us realize that we might have found anybody out here, and, suddenly wary, we asked, "Where?"

When she hopped down, we saw that she was a tomboyish girl with a plain face, not at all the young Cindy Crawford that Grant and Cody had been hoping for. Still, we'd come all this way, and a girl two years older than us was still intimidating. When she insisted, "Under this rock," we dutifully followed her around to the other side of the stone dome to find a recently-made hole and a banged-up shovel. "The black pattern on the ground dives under the rock here," she said. "So I dug at it to see what I could find, and it turns out there's a whole cave under there."

Kyle had concerns about the safety of the cave, concerns that I shared, but the girl insisted it was safe. She pulled a flashlight from her pocket and pointed it within, showing us that there were manmade walls below. One by one, we followed her into the hole under that massive capping rock, and we brought out our own flashlights to look around.

The walls were not the color of earth. Huge grey bricks as long as a person and as tall as Grant held up the tunnel around us, conveying the feeling of a very old temple. Small alcoves held inscribed images at intervals, but the carvings were all that remained. Any color they'd once held had long since fallen away. Cody had the idea to angle the flashlights to emphasize the shallow carvings, but the shadows that emerged painted only pictures of a world of darkness and despair. Small human figures held their arms up as they ran or were eaten by massive snake-like creatures with huge fanged mouths.

"Is this Native American?" Grant asked.

The girl shook her head. "No way. We have tons of their caves near my house. This is something else. Looks way older."

Kyle backed toward the spear of light from the hole to the surface, but he didn't flee just yet. "What's older? What was here before the Native Americans?"

"I dunno," she said, unafraid. "That's why we're looking around. Aren't you curious?"

He swallowed his unhappiness and continued on with us down the tunnel.

The walk took us deeper and deeper into darkness until the light from the hole curved out of sight; with our five flashlights, we were not too concerned, but I did begin swinging my beam back behind us at intervals. What I thought had been complete silence now crept upon me like distant whispering, or perhaps a small breeze curling eddies unseen in the dust. Were the shadows themselves watching us and muttering amongst themselves?

And it was warmer here than it should have been. I'd been in caves before, and they were usually on the unpleasant side of chilly. This temple-like tunnel was a little warm.

Before I could figure anything out, we saw a lance of sunlight curve into sight ahead. At first we thought it was another hole, but we soon realized that we were coming up on the entrance again. The tunnel had taken us in a giant loop.

By then, the whispering eddies had become more pronounced, and I became absolutely certain I was actually hearing something. This time when I turned my beam behind us, I nearly screamedbut the older girl grabbed my mouth, pushed Grant and Cody toward the opposite wall, and dragged Kyle and me into a carven alcove.

For nearly fifteen seconds we clung to warm stone and pressed back as hard as we could. For nearly fifteen seconds, we watched a wall of scales slide past our three circles of light just inches away. We could only hope Grant and Cody had gotten the idea and were pressed into the alcove on the other side; here, we barely fit, and Kyle bit his lip so hard that blood began pouring down his chinhe did this to keep from screaming, for he was the outermost of us, and those huge shimmering green scales were moving by millimeters from his sleeve. I'd seen massive milky white eyes moving right toward us; the creature was blind, possibly from millennia spent underground moving in an eternal circle, but we didn't dare test whether it was deaf as well. One scream

But the enormous serpent was suddenly past like a train departing down the line, and we saw Grant and Cody staring at us with wide white eyes of their own from across the tunnel. To get to the exit hole, *we had to go the direction the creature had gone.* How could we will ourselves to do that?

It turned out: very slowly. We knew that it would be coming back around the long loop, but our animal fears were far more concerned with the slithering sounds receding just ahead. What would it do if it sensed us? It was almost exactly the size of the tunnel. Could it even turn around?

We couldn't risk it.

Only a few feet ahead, Kyle sighted a deeper alcove that actually became a small tunnel of its own, and we ducked inside in the hopes of timing our escape. Instead, we found an adjoining chamber, and there was no mistaking the cathedral feel of the high-vaulted and elegant stonework within. Even stranger, on a platform in the middle of the chamber rather than set near the back wall like one might expect, a raised stone hand lay open beneath an ornate fist-sized hedron that seemed to be *floating in the air.* It was a geometric solid with eight sides, like two pyramids stuck together, and covered in delicate carvings. Like the alcoves, it lacked any coloring, but the silvery metal seemed to make the images upon it come alive under our flashlights.

We whispered at her harshly to stop, but the girl put her hand on itand it stopped floating. She turned it this way and that, but it was just an inert hunk of metal and stone, and whatever curious energies it had held had apparently dissipated.

No, that was not exactly correct: we still felt a strong compulsion to look at it and keep it with us. Collectively enthused by our mysterious treasure, we crept back to the larger tunnel, waited in terror as the giant snake passed again, and then made a run for the tunnel exit. Climbing out of there was probably the most panic-filled moment of my life; at any instant, a tremendous creature under the earth could have sunk blade-like fangs into me, and I would never have seen it coming.

But we made it out, and back into the heat and humidity. I'd never been so happy to see mosquitos again. We ran through clouds of them without a care, for we'd both found a treasure and escaped with it. This was everything we'd hoped for!

A half-mile away from that strange rock and its surrounding tattoo in the earth, I stumbled and nearly fell, and we all slowed to take a break. As we sat, the redheaded girl leaned down and picked up a coin. "Hey look, a fifty-cent piece."

"What, in the dirt out here?" Grant asked.

She shrugged. "It is what it is."

That should have been our first warning, but it was too small and too early. The girl's name was Morgan, and our discovery meant that she was now locked in as our friend. The five of us had a secret, and that meant we would be seeing quite a bit of each other. Rather than going our separate ways as we finally made it back out of the forest, we decided to delay the question of who would keep the hedron by faking a sleepover. Kyle's parents were rather oblivious, and they did not once see Morgan as we snuck her into the basement.

We sat in that basement for hours going over and over the object with magnifying glasses and tracing paper and anything else we could think of that might help us crack the mystery of its meaning and origin. The metal carvings on it portrayed very different scenes from the alcoves; as we rotated it, we saw the story of an unknown human figure at first running from a massive serpent, then turning to face it as it grew smaller, and finally chasing it in turn as the snake shrank. The last face of the hedron showed the man alone, resting from the chase now that the creature was had shrunk into oblivion.

"Someone made this a long time ago," Morgan said, her eyes wide. "Probably to fight or control those snake-things."

"Has the snake just been down there all this time?" Cody wondered. "Going around and around and around..."

I happened to look out one of the windows to the back yard behind Kyle's basement then, and I froze as I thought I saw a wall of scales moving between the trees out in the darknessbut that wasn't possible, was it? As Cody began coughing, I decided not to say anything. The day had already been pretty stressful for him, and he was not looking well. None of us acknowledged the reality of what was happening to him, but that night we were collectively more focused on making sure he was comfortable and had the best couch.

When we woke up the next morning, Morgan wasn't in the room, and the hedron was nowhere to be seen. For a moment, we panicked, but our mutual exhaustion kept us from doing anything drastic. I was tired in a way I hadn't been before, and it only lifted somewhat as she came jogging back with the artifact in hand. "I thought I saw that giant snake," she said warily. "I'm not sure, but I might have chased it away with this thing."

Kyle gulped. "It's just like... loose?"

Morgan wasn't sure, and I didn't want to speak up just yet to confirm that I had also seen it. How could something that huge even move around the neighborhood without destroying things or getting noticed? The answer didn't occur to me until we snuck upstairs and ate breakfast after Kyle's parents had gone to work. 

I said it with Cheerios still in my mouth: "It's smaller now."

"What is?"

"The serpent. It *did* follow us. I saw it." I turned my head and stared out the window at bushes moving in the wind. "But remember the metal carvings? The serpent gets smaller when it's chasing you."

It was finally time to panic. Running up to the second floor together, we peered out of windows until we saw it: a long winding scaled body moving behind the neighbor's fence. The snake was now the height of a large dog, but still as long as a back yard. We began screaming thenat least until the snake began curving back toward us.

It *could* hear us.

We ran from Kyle's house in a veritable stampede, and this time we had no problem letting someone take the hedron. We foisted it on Morgan and separated, hoping to see who it would follow. It was not directly behind us on the street, but we knew it would find us. It had somehow located us miles from where we'd found it, and was enormously adept at staying out of sight of everyone but us.

On my way home, I didn't look where I was going, and a kid on a bike crashed into me. It was scary for a moment, but I brushed it off and staggered home cut up and bruised. The injuries matched how I felt; I only began to really worry when we got on a group phone call and Kyle, Grant, and Cody all began talking about the bad luck they'd had. I'd been hit by a kid on a bike, Kyle had fallen into a sticker bush and gotten scraped all over, Grant had hit his head on a low-hanging door and split open his skin, and Cody said he was feeling worse every minute.

But Morgan answered our group call and said, "I'm feeling great. And my school's closed tomorrow because a pipe burst. I don't have to go in for a test I didn't study for. Also, I found a twenty dollar bill!"

We began to suspect.

But we didn't *know* until Grant broke his arm the next day and Cody was taken to the hospital after a sudden turn for the worse. I barely avoided being hit by a car but became even more cut up and bruised in the process, and Kyle caught a terrible flu that kept him home from school. Something was happening to us.

Meanwhile, Morgan's father won the lottery.

She met with me excited and happy until she saw my injuries and I told her what was happening to the others. For a moment, she hesitated, and I thought she might decide to keep the artifactbut she shook her head at long last and made the better choice. We rode our bikes to the hospital and smuggled the hedron in with us as we visited Cody. He was awake, but looking pale and gaunt, and we placed it in his hand and waited.

After four hours, Morgan still reported feeling great, and Cody was looking no better. I was not sure I could stand the draining feeling in my chest much longer, either.

"The energy," I realized. "It was floating until you touched it. Then it changed."

With a look of slow horror, Morgan realized that simply handing the object to someone else would not stop what was happening. "What if we throw it in the ocean?"

I shook my head. "It doesn't seem to matter where it is. Cody's holding it and nothing's changed."

Her horror slowly morphed into anger; she scowled. "Then let's break it. You guys are nice, and I didn't become your friend just to make you all sick."

Over on the bed, Cody smiled weakly at her. "Thank you."

She nodded and took the evil object from him. Together, she and I stepped out into the hallwayand immediately leapt away and began running. The snake was a foot high now, but still very long, and had infiltrated the hospital. It hissed and slid after us with its milky white eyes searching; we led it away from Cody as best we could. None of the doctors, nurses, or other visitors stirred to action, for the snake expertly dodged their attention. By the time they were looking, it was already out of sight.

But all that hiding gave us distance. Morgan and I escaped the hospital, ran out onto the street, and threw the object in a trash compacting dumpster out back. We didn't care if we got in trouble; we turned it on and watched as the power of man's machines crushed the contents within to a pulp.

We stared as the compactor ground to a halt and began smoking. The metal within had *bent* and left the hedron completely undamaged. It was warm to the touch, too, as I grabbed it with trepidation and began to lose hope. We couldn't get rid of it, we couldn't destroy itwhat *could* we do?

The snake was relentless. No matter where we went, it was close behind, and I was unable to sleep that night for the tension caused by its slithering outside the door and the window.

The four of us gathered that day to see Cody. His face had become thin and skull-like, and he looked like a shadow of his former self. To us, he said, "Guys, we saw what happens on the walls. The groups of figures only got away because the snake caught one of them, remember?"

"But the hedron only has one person on it," Grant insisted.

Kyle nodded, and Morgan stared at the floor.

Cody shook his head feebly. "They're all part of the same structure. It's all connected. This won't stop until one of us dies."

I grabbed his hand. "No."

"You can't stop it," he continued, his eyes bright despite the darkness wasting away the rest of him. "I'm going to take one for the team so it'll let the rest of you go."

"No!"

"Yes."

The snake was small thenjust a slithering little creature the size of a penciland we waited in despairing silence as it crept along the plastic tube that led up into his nose. He nodded at usand then began seizing. Doctors and nurses rushed in and we were pushed out of the room, but I couldn't see anything; I could only hear the beeps of technology and the urgent voices of professionals at work. Wandering back to the visitor's area with my friends, we sat in a daze.

"Why me?" Morgan asked. "Why did it help me and hurt all of you?"

Grant absently messed with the sling for his broken arm and shook his head.

Kyle stared at the wall.

I rolled the hedron in my hands. It hadn't even suffered so much as a dent from the trash compactor, but the fact remained that it was just a toy; a bauble; nothing at all. A silly hope, and innocence lost.

We four lingered after the funeral. We'd been four before this adventure, and we were four again, but not the same four. One had come and one had gone. Standing by his grave, I rolled the hedron in my sight, watching the glyphs depict exactly what we'd gone through. As I ran through it over and over and over, I began to realize that this object was a uniform geometric shape; there was really no indication of a beginning or end to the story. We'd simply assumed that in our naivet. No, this was a series of images designed to continue seamlessly. It was not a story: it was a cycle.

The serpent burst forth from Cody's grave once again the thickness of a hearse, throwing earth and gravestones and even pieces of a smashed tree out in every direction. We stared in awe as it tore a path through the graveyard and slithered off into the evening darkness. In my hands, the hedron had become just a painted rock like any other.

There are some things in this life that you simply can't do anything about.

Tons of news!



Can I say I love you guys? Because we have finally reached the first goal on my Patreon at $250 a month! Patreon subscribers, with the ending of the Grey Riders series, I am going to take this week to get in touch with you and get all the rewards handled. 



Second, because I've already been doing what the $250 goal says, these goals are getting an upgrade. I can afford to spend more time writing now, and that means Horror Mondays and Science Fiction Wednesdays! Both at 6 PM. That means I'll be producing for you high-quality horror and science fiction on a regular basis. If you're only a fan of one of these genres, no worries, I will also be upping my game on each genre individually as much as I can!



Third, I have officially begun work with Chilling Tales for Dark Nights  for the story for the pilot episode of an Animated Series that will be going through Kickstarter soon. This will be pitched to companies like Netflix, so this is HUGE! Can you imagine seeing your favorite author on your Netflix scroll (along with a litany of other super-talented writers bringing you your X-Files and Twilight Zone cravings)? Cause I want to see that happen!



Fourth, whew. Yes, even more. My 6 book compendium of the first 6 series of Portal in the Forest will go live for pre-orders on Amazon NEXT WEEK. Expect to hear more about that!



Fifth. Yes, Fifth! In prep for the CFTDN thing, my website will be getting the upgrade I've been trying to find time to do forever. No more terrible basic blog!

As he finally grew quiet in a curled pile on the marble floor, I was left to regard an array of stunned onlookers. The Imperial Guard no longer had anyone to protect and had been amazed by the upset of one soldier against five Legates; the Empire men with their strange faces and pathetic immorality now watched with fear, for they no longer had masters; my fellow citizens knew not whether to cheer or run from me in fear; my family was severely injured and several were possibly deadand yes, somehow Trajan had been stabbed in the thigh a fourth time.

I sat on my knees dying with a sword through my chest; it was now propping me up so that I didn't fall over. I looked at all those people with a sense of wonder. They were all *alive*. Did they have any idea what a precious gift that was?

The TV crews were the first to move. Rushing forward, one asked, "What's your name, soldier?"

"Venita, of Amber Three," I forced out, proud to say it. "Military caste."

Another, one who had supported me earlier, made a noise of askance as he looked around at all the uncertain faces. "Then that means you're Legate Blue for the next few moments. Care to name a successor so we don't all plunge into chaos screaming?"

I nodded weakly. "Caecilia will take care of you. She's the best soldier we have, and the most loyal to those below her, which will be... everyone, now." My laugh was feeble, but genuine. "Porcia, you always said she'd be a Legate someday."

My wounded family tried to reach me, but they were too slow. I fell to cold marble before I got to say goodbye.

But that was alright. They knew how I feltbecause I'd chosen to live honestly. Despite the Demon that had sent me on that ill-fated mission, I had no regrets.

---

Kumari pulled back from the machine in horror and sorrow. How was this possible? Meddling had caused Venita of Amber Three to die a full *two years too early!* That was the exact opposite of what she'd been trying to do!

But that was the price of interfering with low-information situations. There were almost no records of the events that had transpired on the Amber Worlds in those days. Had this happened the first time around? Had the course of events on Amber Three been changed significantly, or

Or!

Was this the exact moment the book had found to access her soul? It all lined up. What if this *was* when Venita of Amber Three had first died?

She turned back to the machine and the book buried within, beginning a fresh connection.

---

The song of action that had always been in my heart was now one of freedom and soaring onto new unknown places. I began to pick up limitless speed on a flight into blackness. The Restless Hedrons called for me, and I could see the black wall beyond approaching. This was death for my grandfather, my mother, and I; this was death, then, for citizens of the Empire. That meant that the strange-faced people whose values I despised were actually my kin in some way. Being harsh could have been a mistake. I'd been told that the First Tribe had been wiped out by cold along with the Empire. What desperation those men must have held...

But the Restless Hedrons were not dark. A glimmering little stream of white light was slowly wearing cracks in the giant obsidian cubes, and I could see a glare from far ahead where the Machine Empress had punched her way through with the energies of hundreds of Earths and Suns.

But how could mere energy pierce the veil of death?

Here surrounded by the wisdom of many souls drifting on into darkness, I understood: Gisela the Yellow had the ability to bend the laws of reality to her beliefsand she *believed* that she could pierce the veil with that amount of energy. From her point of view, it was impressive, but on the cosmic scale of things, there were galaxies and stars and black holes and the like with just as much if not more power, and none of them violated existence.

It was part of my heritage to fix these things.

Rather than moving on, I lingered.

And then, I followed the trickling stream back the other direction.

"Where are you going?" a man my age with long brown hair asked. He, too, was deadbut he was a rather observant soul compared to most. The rest were just pale faces and limbs drifting toward the veil.

I wasn't sure. It was hard to feel and think in personal terms. "That way."

"People are talking about me in that direction," he said with curiosity. "They're telling my story. Millions of them. I can hear them because there's so much hope behind their words. They say I had a... family... that tried to do the impossible to keep us all together, and they almost pulled it off."

"That's beautiful," I told him. "I have a family, too."

"Are they that way?"

I could feel minds thinking about me; souls hoping against hope. "I think they are."

"Then let's go that way."

"Alright. I will if you will."

The trickle of light led to sensations strange and mystifying, and progress soon became impossibleexcept for helpful white energy that carried a basic animal instinct: *heal.* Heal, or else you'll be alone... this was an old friend that I somehow recognized, but had never met in person.

And then I was pushing up through earth, coughing, screaming, and fighting my way out onto cold ground. Lightning struck overhead in a stormy sky charged with electricity; I saw only by the violet light of a bio-mechanical artery that had grown from other realities into this one during the time that I'd been gone. Where was I? I was cold and naked, but the pain was proof that I was alive. None of the scars I remembered remained.

I looked up. Two headstones now stood side-by-side; one *Valentina*, and the other *Venita.*

They'd buried me next to my mother.

And I knew then that I'd only fixed a very small portion of the damage to reality that day after the battle at Her Glory's fortress. There was so much more danger coming. I had to

---

"What? No!" Kumari slammed her fist against the console as errors poured forth. "Not this again! Why can't we read these two years? There won't be enough time to get through to her!"

The computer informed her that, once again, two years were completely unreadable and had to be skipped.

Nearly to tearsfor she was down to less than five chancesshe bit back her frustration and continued reading. There would only be weeks left now to try to make a difference.

---

Oh, it's you again. It's been a long time. I thought I'd escaped your Twisted Book when I died... but no matter. Whoever you are, you didn't betray me, so I guess I don't mind if you tag along.

I accepted the computer pad and shooed away the grey-clad black-helmeted underling that had delivered it. Infiltration had proven to be a far more boring job than I could ever have guessed. Neither Conrad nor Cristina knew that I was alive or part of their organization again, so they had no reason to suspect that I was not truly Beatrix of Amber Three. By measured capabilitynot too much, mind you, lest I reveal my handI'd risen through the ranks. Now I was the only one trusted by both sides of this absurd competition for power and specific resourcesConrad's need being the witnessing of *cool battles* and Cristina's being the cooperation of the Vanguard finders, who still resisted us on principle despite all her efforts.

Thus when the message came in, I absolutely saw an opportunity, but it was not the content of the message that made my adrenaline rush so. The words were a message from a Senator at Concord Farm; a politician of the Empire refugees that had made the region between us and the Machine Empress their home. He'd said he could make the finders cooperate with ushow had he even known about that? Or that we had them?if we met for talks of an alliance. With those words alone Cristina would be on the hook, and Conrad would certainly show up to, as he might say in private, 'screw shit up' and 'make things interesting again.' 

But it was the voice in that message that had me personally intrigued. I'd heard that voice once beforein death. He and I had been the first to wander our way back. This could not be a coincidence.

I went outside my tent and found the forms I'd long ago learned to recognize instantly as my three beloveds. All of them had survived me the first time; initially a tragedy, now a bemused joke only for the four of us. "Get your gear. We're going to the peace talks. Things are about to get crazy."

Staggering to her feet out of the bodies to my right, Caecilia held her side and said between pained breaths, "Do it."

Flavia was trying to stand to my left; I couldn't see the rest of my family.

But I was not alone. I knew that.

Staggering forward, I repeated with fatigue, "Defend yourselves."

Legate Blue motioned forward Legate Green; he approached with his hands up. "I didn't have anything to do with what's been going on, and I'd like to stand with you."

Thankful for the moment of respite, I let him pass; the shout from the hundreds behind was my only warning as he stabbed me with a previously hidden knife. Screaming in pain as it sank into my lower left back, piercing my kidney, I turned and willed my own previously hidden weapon into a sword. The multi-tool ripped through his chest, and he died instantly.

Silence fell over the pillared hall as protestors, refugees, soldiers, and the Legates alike realized what had happened. An Imperial Legate had just been *slain.* This was real to them now.

I pushed him off my sword and pulled the knife slowly from my kidney with blinding pain; as I did so, single shots rang out, and I felt points of penetration and fire pierce my shoulder and side. Turning rapidly with the world frozen blue in my perception, I saw the personal pistol in Legate Yellow's hand; in a burst of animal rage, I hurled Legate Green's dagger with all the force my father's lineage could offer my arm, spine, and leg.

A roar of air and sound boomed through the hall as I lost grip of Time; the knife did not hit her point-first, but it didn't matter. The side of her head exploded, and her limp body went sliding across the smooth floor.

Legate Red stared in shock; Legate White backed away; Legate Blue looked on with realization. "So, it's you. The angel of battle come home to roost."

Forcing my way forward down the long hall despite the pain, I asked loudly, "Why don't you explain to these people what an angel is, Legate Blue? Since you *seem to know that word.*"

Grabbing at a nearby Amber guard, Legate Red began to panic. "She's got a sword! She violated the rules! She brought a weapon in here!"

The Centurion in charge sneered. "And your colleagues had a knife and a pistol. You made this brutal tradition, not us."

From his hip, Legate Blue unsheathed his ceremonial sword; by the look of it once revealed, it was anything but fakeyet another hidden layer of security. He handed it to Legate Red. "Go ahead."

The white-haired older man took it with a shaking hand. "Can I choose to run away?"

The only exits to the room were behind me and to the sides, and angry citizens had filled them utterly.

Moving forward inexorably, I said simply, "Ask *them.*"

Dropping the sword, he ran for the way out.

His screams lasted an uncomfortably long time as the crowd wordlessly beat him to death.

I drew closer.

Legate Blue turned to Legate White. "Your turn. Go on now."

The blonde middle-aged woman moved forward with her arms at her sides and her expression resolute. She I had seen the least on television and heard little of on the radio. She did not attempt to fight me; she waited with eyes open for Death, as befitting a citizen of Amber.

She breathed out loudly, confused and amazed, as I limped passed her without striking.

The watching crowd let her pass between in silence. When she was gone, only Legate Blue remained. Picking up his sword, he gave an arrogant laugh. "Is this what it's come to, then?" He shouted, "*Is it?* Violent insurrection? Rule of law shattered? Chaos for the people? I gave you order! We brought this world through the Troublesthrough the grey wave, through the assault by the spheres, through the Time of Sickness, and more!"

Gasping out blood from my lungs, I spat the thickness from my mouth. "And we thank you for your difficult decisions, Legate. I lived through all of that thanks to you. My familyall of the families represented here todaywere not so lucky."

"None of you would be here without my leadership!" he screamed, growing red in the face.

"Maybe. But in the end, you took it too far." I'd learned so much from leaders good and bad alike. Conrad's lies; Cristina's dark determination; Caecilia's loyalty not to just to those above but to those below. "Leaders that have to resort to lies to stay in power. Leaders that take from the people. Leaders that are out for personal powerthese are not leaders at all, merely dangerous frauds mistakenly given authority." And still I advanced, now reaching the table between myself and Legate Blue. "I don't know what's right in this life, but I do know that this is *wrong.* You are wrong."

His nose flared as he gained control of his rage. This was a military man, and he would not be easily defeated. "So be it." He turned to run for the far wall.

I smashed the table down with one hand and leapt to slash my sword forward with the other.

My blade stopped short abruptly, and jade energies glimmered around his midsection.

Under his clothes, he had the same protection that I had drained on the fight inward! The engineers had been working on it when I'd left!

Despite immense pain and blood leaking all through my grey uniform, I ran after him. He reached the back wall with time to spare, hit a secret panel, and withdrew a sapphire rifle before I could reach him. He turned it not upon me, but upon the crowd. I screamed and gripped blue perceptions, watching the dodecahedron move forward at a rate visible even with Time nearly frozen; I knew well the absurd explosive power of sapphire weapons, and I knew too that his aim was to remove the energy fueling me by removing the people that supplied it. All their hopes, dreams, and love would vanish in an instantif not for the final ability of my people, that which my father had whispered in my ear as a last challenge. I'd almost done it a few times before; Flavia had been very disturbed by my subconscious warping of space. I'd *run the full distance without running the full distance*, as she'd put it, and now I understood how. There were pathways shorter than a straight line in three dimensions.

And I needed those pathways now. The raging fire inside me dimmed as I channeled it into a moment of desperation; hundreds of dirty and hungry faces looked on in terror as the dodecahedron soared toward them. I reached out my free hand and metaphorically gripped the very layers of spacetime itself to the maddening drumbeat of adrenaline in my ears.

The ethereal blue oval opened in the air as I let go of Time. The projectile shot through and exploded with unbelievable force on the other sidebut none of that reached us. The uninhabited reality on the other side took the entire brunt, and the portal closed as I fell to one knee.

Legate Blue shouted "Absurd!" and turned to another angle to fire on a different part of the crowd. These, too, screamed for their livesbut I thrust out a hand and opened another portal to catch the second dodecahedron at the last moment.

I fell to my other knee.

He aimed at me.

"I can do this all day," I lied, unable to get up from my knees.

Moving forward and laughing, he stood near.

I slashed weakly a few times, but the interwoven jade energies around his body protected him. 

He announced to the horrified onlookers, "I've protected us from a monster today. This *non-human thing* would have torn down our entire society. You see what we're fighting against us? Anything unlike us is out to destroy us!"

They did look on in confusion, but they had not forgotten his attempt to slaughter them.

Looking down at me, he shook his head. "Poor strategy. You should never have come back here. Do you yield, fool?"

It was not in me to yield. "Never."

Flavia tried to reach me, but she was too slow. My Imperial commander stabbed me through the heart with his sword.

Oh. Ah. It hurt.

Oh, yes, it hurt.

But I laughed.

He looked down in horror.

"It's not a metaphor," I burbled through upwelling blood. "The flame of a warrior's spirit. There's fire in my heart." I laughed louder. "*Blue* fire."

Spectral blue shot up his blade like it had so many times my own in dreams and once in reality, but he was not in control. He burst into flame, and, despite his screaming efforts to let go or douse himself, the flames only burned hotter. I stared him down with all the fire of righteous vengeance I could channel.

He managed to wrest himself free, but nobody would help him. They watched with stone grimness as the judgment of our society's ritual delivered his choice: death.

With that, I dropped the phone, and ten black helmets fell to the chill ground, discarded for what was coming. The Empire men had no idea what ritual I'd been talking about, so they were caught off guard when the ten of us began the charge straight toward the inner doors. Otho and Noah had not trained with us much in total back at the camp of the Grey Riders, but the passion was ours united, and the cause just. The other eight of us took the lead, and a good twenty Empire men fell to blows to their heads and necks before the remainder reacted.

This was our last stand; not *my* last stand, for I was not alone, and not a last stand directed at the Machine Empress, for our hearts had always been slated for this course the moment we'd left the strict control of greedy leaders and begun thinking for ourselves.

And those on the other side of the opened gate saw us fighting.

Hundreds of starving and angry citizens of Amber Three poured in behind us, overwhelming the guards to our rear. We caught the inner doors before they could be closed, and our brutally coordinated fist-fight threw Empire man after Empire man to the floor, where their charging comrades would stumble and fall.

Beyond! Down the first hall! They began surging in from every corner and every doorway now, and I laughed at how similar evil was in all forms. They were the spheres in the Enemy's mountain as the swarms came to crush me; they were those silent people screaming in their heads in that civilization-organism that controlled them as rows upon rows of knife-bearing citizens stood to hem us in or be mowed down by us; this was tyranny of the mind or of the body or of technology or simply of food; this was the few or the one in absolute control of the many. I'd been practicing for this over and over without knowing it, and I was right back in that tournament at the academy oh so long ago that we had *won* no matter what it had taken. Moving as one, thinking as one, planning and executing strategies better than the mass oppositionI was alive! Yes, father, I *do* enjoy this!

In a circle formation back-to-back, we moved down that hallway moment to moment as desperate guards flooded at us from every side. If the tide of righteous fury behind us was to make headway, we would have to make passage. Moving in unison, the ten of us punched forward, taking a ring of men by surprise; the ring behind them expected the same move, but we rotated and struck to our lefts instead. The next synced move was a complete leap over bloodied and battered men writhing on the ground, and our attackers swarmed after us in disarray.

But the hallway was long, and the path arduous. Otho was the first to fall. Grabbed by every limb during a surprise rush from a side room, he was torn away from us and beaten relentlessly by a dozen men as we fought our way out of sight. My heart went out to him for the brief moment I could spare, but that fate likely awaited all of us.

Tightening our circle, we began to move more quickly; dodging backwards while Celcus to my left gave a long uppercut to the man who had fumbled a swing at me, I looked right and found an opportunity to sweep an enemy foot out. That man fell and knocked others over behind him. We were already tiring against the flood and my fists were hurting from the impacts, but we could not stop.

Paulinus took a severe blow to the head; knowing that he could no longer keep up with our coordinated movements, he charged forward into the sea of men to bowl them over and absorb an entire hallway of hits and kicks.

And then we were eight.

The tide became a sea-foam of brutal impacts above and below.

We weakened against the onslaught, but did not fall.

The final door approached; a hundred Empire men stood in ranks ten by ten in front of it. Where were the Amber soldiers? Why these men? The trained military would have made quick work of us, exhausted and battered as we were. Larentia was limping on a half-broken ankle, Noah's forehead was streaming blood, and the rest of us were no better. The jade armor underneath my grey uniform had drained its last during the fight. A shot straight to my nose sent warm iron-smelling liquid down my face, but I bit the arm of the man who had done it until he screamed, and then a headbutt sent him falling back. 

Briefly in sync once more, the eight of us struck together to take down the first row of ten guarding the door; a feint back and another strike took down the second; the third would not be so fooled. They opted to wait with fists up as other hallways supplied streams of reinforcements. There was one formation we *had* practiced, but as part of some Red Rover game the Vanguards had played while drunk that night in the caves. As the remaining eight rows of Empire men looked on in terror, we charged straight at them with arms linked, and my seven siblings in arms each thrust themselves into fists to throw an entire row off-balance. The last row was mine to handle, and I summoned up all the great strength that the support of my family had to offer, and I shoved them as a flying cloud of ragdolls through the burst-open door.

The five Imperial Legates looked up from their table in shock. They hadn't even left their seatsbecause doing so would have made them look weak in front of the Empire and Amber guards lining their grand hall, and because they had honestly expected us not to make it that far. I was the only one to make it past those final doors, but even my lone one caused their eyes to visibly bulge. The layers upon layers of security the Legates had built to control our entire world had failed, in the end, to stop one bloodied and exhausted half-human girl

And the tidal wave behind her. This one was not grey like first. This one was the color of all the citizens of the world, and the color of fury. They spilled through with shouts to shake the very earth, pushing Empire men and my half-conscious siblings alike forward into the room. For a moment, I thought it might be over.

But the forward momentum stopped in a hail of gunfire.

Legate Blue stood atop his white-trimmed table, an assault rifle in hand, the barrel of his gun steaming. Thirty protestors and Empire men lay felled and bleeding on the marble floor. Thus, our critical miscalculation: weapons had been banned from all those around the Legates, but not from the Legates themselves. "*All of you!*" he roared. "*The rule of law will not be toppled!* Get out of here!" To his left and right, the other four Legates pulled automatic weapons of their own from underneath the table.

I'd been missed by the spray purely by the density of the formerly surging crowd; now hundreds stood to my left, right, and behind me, but none stood in front of me. They didn't want to be mowed down, and, like Conrad had always intended for me, they looked to me for the next move. On the one hand, there were likely more of us than the Legates had bullets, but the cost would be extreme. On the other

At the behest of the Centurion of the Imperial Guard to either side of the Legates, the only other Amber soldiers in the room moved swiftly to grab the rifles from their owners' five pairs of hands. The Centurion had his men move swiftly back into place, and I understood now why the Legates had hired desperate refugees rather than rely on Amber soldiers: the same principles that had been used to control us were threats to those in power.

"I believe this young lady has challenged the five of you to a ritual," the Centurion announced, his eyes on me. "As is tradition, nobody will interfere."

The angry citizens behind me backed off a few steps in unison; the camera-bearing TV crews we'd spoken to earlier rushed forward to film; I stepped forward with hesitation. The Centurion was serious, and his men equally so, but the Legates were fuming and shouting at the Empire men in the room to intervene.

"Dishonorable," the Centurion spat saliva on the floor before Legate Blue. "We will open fire on anyone who interferes, Empire or Amber alike. This bleeding and exhausted soldier has challenged the five of you to combat, and you have pitifully thrown walls of flesh in her way. Are you seriously afraid of the very principles you've always insisted we live by?"

One of the camera-men moved forward a step. "We're live to the whole world. We would love to hear an answer."

Legate Yellow shouted, "Turn that off!"

The answer was a simple, "No ma'am." His partner then murmured to me, "Go ahead. Everyone's watching."

Caecilia stepped forward.

The Legates subtly recoiled; the twenty members of the experienced Amber Imperial Guard did not so much as move a muscle, but the countless Empire refugee men on the borders of the great pillared hall nearly leapt to action.

"Careful now," Legate Blue called forward. "We've had over a hundred assassination attempts from would be usurpers in the wake of the Troubles. We're just trying to keep civilization running here, but anarchists and liberals would have us live lawlessly and blind to consequence."

Uncomfortable at that extended explanation, Caecilia glanced left and right at the jumpy Empire men without moving her head. "So that's why no weapons are allowed in the compound? Assassination attempts?"

"Correct."

"Understood. The prisonerwas delivered as planned," she lied. "And what of the general order to flee through the rifts because of the Machine Empress' attack? We almost didn't come back."

Legate Yellow gave the reply: "Reliable information has been rare at best. Anarchists are flooding all channels with false attacks and false threats to keep us mired in chaos."

I glanced to Noah, but he could sense nothing from these men and women of Amber Three.

"Thank you for clearing up the situation," Caecilia said with deference. "One last thingSir, Legate Blue, did you come to regret your dealings with that entity in the white room? Because we did."

The pepper-haired commander of our caste nodded with what looked like sincere sadness. "Hard times have hit our world, certainly."

She did not relent. "But did you *personally* come to regret your dealings with it?" 

"The mission was carried out successfully, so everything turned out alright," he said from behind his great table. "Our sacrifices were worth it."

Caecilia saluted smartly. "Yes, sir!"

We saluted in turn, although Noah and Otho were slow to pick up on the motion.

I watched all this with ice in my heart. Caecilia had asked those questions for *me*, and for all of us. She was too loyal a soldier, but I was not the blind follower I'd been the last time we had walked these halls. We were led out in defeated and unhappy silence, and we stood waiting for the gates to be opened with dejected faces.

It was in the Regret Demon's nature that every person that made a deal with it would come to regret it. The fact that Legate Blue did not know this, and had not suffered for it, meant that he'd sent proxies like us to make all of Amber Three's deals. At no point had he hinted that there had been others. At no point had he expressed concern. He had revealed himself to be a callous and effortless liar, and he and Legate Yellow had been too on-point about dissidents, who would have neither the coordination nor the resources to broadcast fake attacks all over the world.

This... what had that kid Sol called it?

This was *bullshit.*

The ice in my heart melted into blue flaring rage as I came to feel absolutely certain that the Machine Empress had never come to the Amber Worlds at all. We'd been sold out. They'd even exiled possible dissidents and upstanding soldiers without them knowing by ordering them through the rifts 'before they were captured' by Her Glory; all the better to fuel the ranks of the meat shield between the Legates and outside threats. And the food seizures? After Legate Red had once said we would have enough to feed everyone? Pure self-serving greed.

My grandfather and my neighbors had starved to death alone and in the cold while I'd been out risking my life in worlds of nightmare for a false cause all because

Because

The rage burned in me beyond anything I'd ever known, shaking through me like a beast uncagedbut then it settled back down into absolute calm formed of years of training and the support of my family. Caecilia looked to me to take action to preserve the ideals she believed in; Flavia looked to me for her lost family that had starved in their homes even *before* the troubles; Celcus looked to me out of pain for the friends we had lost; Sampson was ready for any righteous action I asked of him; Otho grimaced against the burn of what had been done to us; Noah reiterated without words that he was with me to the end; Larentia's eyes burned with fire in support of her Centurion; Paulinus laughed bitterly for finally finding a truly moral cause; and Trajan laughed with him and said darkly, "We were never going to make it out of this alive, were we? And so close to home. So close. Welp, let's do it then. A week's rations I get stabbed in the thigh again *somehow.*"

His humor lifted our inaction. We were not two families. We were one.

I turned to an Empire man guarding a security phone on the wall. "Hey," I asked him in the informal. "Can that thing route through to the Legates? It's extremely important."

"Oh." He looked to those around him, but we'd just come from a meeting with the officials in question, so he picked it up, dialed through, and handed it to me.

"Is this Legate Blue?" I asked, a universe of blue fire burning with the heat of infinite suns behind my absolutely calm words.

"What is it?" he asked. "Some detail you forgot to mention?"

"Put me on speaker phone. It's critical you all hear this."

"Alright," he replied, concerned, but not at all threatened by a mere phone call. "You're on speaker phone. What's your information?"

I took a deep breath and then summoned up the institution that had been part of suppressing us and forcing violent ideals into us all our lives. "All five of you."

He laughed, to his credit betraying only the barest hint of nervousness. "What?"

"You have three choices, which you should know well, since you have enforced this tradition throughout your careers as a way of outing the weak and purging the corrupt, or so you always told us. Let us see if your creation works. You can make us yield, you can run away" I let the moment hang just long enough to tell them I was not joking. "or you can die."

Legate Green spoke up. "What's this nonsense, soldier?"

"She's serious," one of them muttered to another.

Legate Red commented on the structural realities of our situation. "You've got no weapons and you're outnumbered a thousand to one. Just walk away, fool girl."

I let them clamor on until I saw the front gate opening for what the guards thought was our exit. With all the righteous anger of a way of life betrayed, I stated with deadly and unmistakable intent: "*Defend yourselves.*"

As the ramp lowered and let in chill breezes, I studied the stark and hilly forests of what had once been called the Siberian Plain. In most Empire realities there had been a world power in this region of Asia, but few had chosen to settle in New Moscow on Amber Three. As a result, I knew nothing of these wilds, and had never had any idea that people lived here on the northeastern edge of the world. I'd always assumed it was as empty as the western and southern Americas.

Caecilia stepped from her squad's plane alongside. "Out of respect, this is something I won't stop you from doing, but we're already too low on fuel to reach the North American continent again. No more. After this, you have to come back with us." She gave a moment for a high shrill breeze to pass before continuing. "Don't make this a fight."

Her team stood behind her, and mine stood behind me. We two families that had once been one regarded each other in silence. Out of respect, I said in the formal, "We will return when this is done."

Otho stayed with the planes; donning our helmets again not for anonymity but for warmth, we tracked through the spiny evergreens in our well-insulated uniforms toward the coordinates my grandfather had left me. What would we find? He'd written that *my father would explain*, which Iwell, a young part of me hoped he would be there, and an angry part of me hoped that he would not. The coniferous forest was thick and the region was hilly, so we could see very little of the valley ahead except for a few columns of smoke. It appeared that someone did live here. On the descent down a long scree, Noah took a moment to give me our secret signal: he could sense someone ahead.

How was that possible?

We came to a long wooden wall made of bound logs about twice the height of a person. The roofs of several similarly hand-built houses were visible beyond, and an iron-rimmed gate stood open facing a gravel road that the wind had scoured of snow. Pushing carefully forward with our weapons ready, we entered the gate, and found a single sleeping guard in a shack next to it. The grey-bearded and quite thin man wrapped up in many layers of clothing awoke with a start as I touched his shoulder.

As he stared at us, I asked, "Why is the gate open and the only guard asleep?"

His confused reply was, "We're a refuge of exiles a lifetime's hike from the nearest soda. Why would anyone willingly come here?"

Exiles, I'd expected; political dissidents had always been given a choice. It was their collecting together in this place and their building of a crude town that I hadn't anticipated. I'd always sort of assumed they'd wandered the wilderness like nomads and eventually faded into nothingness, but this did make sense now that I saw it. It seemed the first instinct of human beings in danger was to band together and build new structures, both literal and figurative. "And this place survived the grey wave and the Rotation intact?"

He narrowed his eyes. "Nothing much to be thrown about here. No cars, no ocean. The land is tough, and the trees well-rooted." Rising slowly to his booted feet, he added, "And perhaps we've done a bit of rebuilding." He led the way for our two squads down the main gravel road, and we followed at his frustratingly slow pace as, happy to have company, he rambled on about the inhabitants of each house we passed and their various jobs gathering lumber and firewood, farming, fishing in the nearby river, or other survival tasks that had been assigned without respect to birthfor everyone here was casteless. At each of these modest buildings, I looked to Noah, but he subtly gave me a negative. It seemed that the person or persons he was sensing were still ahead.

The final building in the back corner of this town of pariahs was a bit longer and wider than the others. It was not a city hall by any means, but it did appear that this cabin had an extra room or two that faced the main road and acted in some public function. The old man led us into the second of these and then immediately fell asleep on a chair in front of the roaring fire within; we stood awkwardly for a few moments, at a loss as to what to do next.

We removed our helmets and looked around for lack of direction; Noah tilted his head ever so slightly toward a door deeper into the cabin, and a wave of apprehension washed over me even as my surface no-nonsense attitude led my body forward and my gloved knuckle to the door for a knock.

My breathing grew crazily loud in my head, and I wondered how anyone could hear anything over the cacophonous beating of my heart. Floorboards creaked on the other side unseen, and the door swung open unceremoniously to reveal a man of about my age that was the exact image of my father from my memories.

He stared back in equal measure. "...*Venita?*"

But it couldn't be him.

This had to be a brother I never knew.

He was my age.

He looked *exactly the same as I remembered.*

He hadn't aged a day in nearly two decades.

The word spilled from with all the vehemence that had ever built up in me: "*Why?*"

His surprise faded into regret. Glancing behind me, he said, "There should be enough chairs for everybody. Please, sit down."

I almost wanted to refuse, but I did as he asked, and I waited without looking at my comrades or acknowledging their unspoken questions. Too many emotions were roaring through me, and I had to remain strong.

He pulled forth a crude wooden chair and sat opposite us with a tin cup of water in hand. "And all these?"

"My family," I told him, throwing that word in his face. "I have no secrets from them."

"That's alright, as long as they understand that these things are private. Not to be repeated." He nodded with guilty understanding. "And Evander? Is he well?"

I could not answer. I could not bring myself to speak of my grandfather. To say it would be to make it real.

"Ah. Then that is why you have come." He squeezed his cup of water, but did not drink. "So what would you like to know?"

I meant to ask why he hadn't aged, but the words that came out were, "Why did you leave me?"

Caught off guard by that, he grimaced with hesitation. "I suppose you could say it's all related. I know you're also wondering why I look the same, and the answer to that is similar. My peopleand yours, at least by halfare sworn pacifists by nature."

I glanced at Noah, who gave me our pre-practiced sign that, at the very least, he wasn't lying.

The man across from us who looked like the memories of my father scowled. "Gwellion, I would appreciate you not doing that right now. I'm trying to speak to my daughter about matters that are very important. Please don't taint these discussions."

Noah held both hands up in surprised deference, and the rest of my comrades looked at each other in confusion. I covered for him by aggressively leaning forward and seizing attention. "Daughter? What right do you have to call me that? You left."

He dropped his rebuke and turned back to me with renewed sadness. "I didn't have a choice."

"Of course you did," I spat. "You could have stayed and fought."

His voice was nearly a whisper. "No." He sighed, and then spoke again. "My people have been sworn pacifists since the riotous moment of limitless creation that birthed this vast multiverse. We are" He searched for the right words. "builders, protectors, and healers. And you must know I speak the truth because half of that is... in you."

My jaw dropped ever so slightly as recent memories flooded forth.

"I felt an event," he continued. "Damage of awe-inspiring magnitude to the fabric of existence. I thought that perhaps my people had escaped extermination after all when I felt that massive wound being forcefully healedbut that was you, wasn't it?"

I said nothing, but the instincts in me that day had been very stark. I'd put aside all other concerns and nearly expended myself in pulling those blinking rifts closed, and I'd known then that I'd done something important even if I hadn't understood why at the time.

He leaned forward, but I was not ready to be touched. Instead, he said, "We teach, help build defenses, and do our best to promote life, but my ancestors swore an oath that we would not cause harm. I cannot say we have always upheld that ideal, but the essence of who we are cannot be denied."

"To who?" I asked after forcing down an emotional reaction. I was becoming angry at myself for even *entertaining* the idea that this man might not be worthy of a lifetime of my hate. Calmly, I reiterated, "Humanity's version of Death knew of that Promise and called me Oathbreaker. An oath to who?"

"After so many generations I was just told the mythicized version of the tale," he replied with a shake of his head. "We helped build existence when this all began, and, in exchange for our Oath, we were allowed to exist outside the cycles of Life, Death, and Time and maintain the infinite realities on an ongoing basis."

For the first time, someone else spoke up. I was startled at first, but I should have expected it. Flavia asked, "So you don't age?"

He smiled. "Oh, we age, for a life without end is nothing but a curse. The man you see before you is something I crafted purposely to live among you; the greater portion of my being could be described in terms you know as mostly *light* or energy, and folded in complex patterns in dimensions higher than this onebut trust me, it ages." He looked back to me with softness. "And like all beings that age, we can fall in love, and even have children."

No.

No.

He was not going to worm his way out of answering for what he'd done. "But why did you *leave?*"

His response was compassionate but also pointed. "Do you know what happens to pacifists under this world's government?"

I raised my gloved hand to indicate the town of exile clearly surrounding us, but still, I said, "You could have stayed and tried. You could have joined up. You could have"

"What? Betrayed my beliefs? Gone back on the ancient core principle of my entire people?"

"Was I not worth it?" I leapt up and kicked my chair back. "I was *six years old* and you chose an ideology over *me!*"

He stood and faced me, unleashing thoughts he had clearly mulled over for years as much as I had. "And, so subjugated to a warmongering and oppressive regime that I would give up all I believe in, what example could I have set? What kind of father would I have been?"

I pushed him with both hands upon his chest. "The kind that was **there!**"

He stepped back and defused our tension by raising his palms and looking down forcefully. "Wait. Just wait." After both of us took in and exhaled three adrenaline-fueled breaths, he said, "You see, Venita? You're not wholly like me. You're also of your mother, and you have the capacity for violence and war as much as any human. I am not saying these things are morally wrong, for there is no objective scale as far as I know. It is possible to employ violence in the pursuit of righteousness and life just as much as greed and evil. You deserved to make that choice on your own. Evander, your mother's father, was a better person to raise you given the circumstances."

Trembling at the sheer fire being held back inside my every limb, I said through clenched teeth, "That's self-serving logic."

"No," he said with visible pain. "Leaving you behind was the hardest thing your mother and I ever had to do. But look at what you have despite our failure. If we'd stayed, you would have been swayed by my philosophy no matter how much I tried to suppress it. You would not be where you are now with these people."

The fire inside abated for just a moment, and I looked back at all the faces of my loved ones, friends, and brothers and sisters in arms.

"Do you like what you do?" he asked. "I could never have supported this or understood it. You're scarred, but strong, and you have built yourself a family beyond compare."

The hate drained from me then, mainly out of exhaustion at so many years keeping it held so tightly. "You are my father," I finally admitted to him. "But you were wrong. All you did was leave me at the mercy of someone else's philosophy, crammed down my throat as propaganda every day of my life. I didn't choose to be a soldier. It was forced upon me. And only now as the worlds are coming apart at the seams have I seen past those blinders and begun to make my own choices."

He seemed crestfallen at the controlled life I'd described, but he tried to move forward, both literally and figuratively. A step closer, he asked, "Are you considering, then, a life of peace like mine?"

I could only look at the roaring fire. "So many lies. Never the full story. Every time you think you're fighting for the right cause, it turns out the people in charge were lying to get what they wanted. Is there such a thing as a righteous cause?"

He touched my forearm. "You could stay here."

I did not recoil this time, but neither did I say anything about that choice just yet. "Where's my mother?"

An answer was not immediately forthcoming. The man my age that I was beginning to accept as my father first put a blanket around the old man that had guided us here, and I saw in this motion an older and wiser regard than his face implied. Wordlessly, he looked each of us in the eyes and then nodded toward the door before leading us out.

By that hour slight hints of magenta and emerald had touched the sky, and the wind was a bit more biting; still, I did not put my helmet on. I would brave the cold to keep my identity on this walk, because I had some idea why travel was needed at all. We crunched our way down the town's gravel road and back out the gate before turning to the right and heading for an upward slope. The hike took us to an extreme corner of the valley, but pointedly within sight of the distant wall of logs that marked the borders of life.

A stone wall set underneath an overhang had many names carved upon it as they might have been back home in the annals of one's caste. Here, all the names had been inscribed togetherbut my father led us to a standing stone that stood apart. The name *Valentina* had been carved upon it, along with the years of her life and a statement of nobility I did not fully understand.

My father stood to the side. "Her body lies here."

"Buried?" I asked, looking down at the plot of earth that must have contained her bones. "Why?"

"It is the way of *her* people. From a line of important persons, I understand."

The rest of my grandfather's note hit me again: *remember the stories*. I'd assumed he'd been talking about these beings of light that my father had descended from. Had he actually meant his and my mother's line? "Who were they?"

"They took funeral rites very seriously, even though a great number of them got pushed into exile in adulthood by conflicting with this society's governance over the generationsso these graves are scattered across the world and quite lonely and forgotten. As I remember it, and the way my beloved was told it by her fatherEvander, your grandfathera woman from one of the noble families disagreed with the sequestering of so many of humanity's best when the Amber Worlds were built. She considered it a backhanded way for the merchant barons to purge resistance."

I could see my grandfather leaping about the furniture clear as day. "I know this one! She joined Amber Three's population as an act of protest, but her father was ill and her mother absent, so nobody realized she was gone and they turned on the Shields." Despite where I was, I laughed at my grandfather's antics as he acted out the miniature play. "I'd always thought he meant it as a cautionary parable. Clearly the lack of both parents meant the woman was a stand-in for me"

My father looked away as if he had been struck, and I hesitated.

The others had been very respectful so far, but now many of them were exchanging murmurs.

I turned to them. "What is it?"

Celcus was the one to finally speak for the rest of them. "An ill father and an absent mother? What was this woman's name?"

"Um..." I focused back. It'd been a very long time since I'd heard that one. "Beatrix."

"Oh."

"Why?"

They waved it off. "Nothing. It was silly."

Sampson added, "Conrad named his plane *the Matilda*, after his daughter. It just would have been super weird, right?"

He wasn't wrong. Perturbed by almost being distantly related to the monsters Conrad and Gisela, but too filled with emotion to let it bother me, I turned back to the grave. "So her... bones are in the ground here?"

My father nodded. "I like to think she can still hear me if I talk."

Kneeling, I asked in wonder, "Do you know that for sure?"

He laughed sadly. "No. But I did see her in my dreams on the way to wherever she's going. We did have a final goodbye."

"At the Restless Hedrons?"

"Hah. Yeah. You've been there?"

I reached up and gripped his hand. "I saw grandfather there one last time, and he had nothing but words of encouragement for me. I think that, all else aside, he was a good choice. I couldn't have asked for better."

His eyes were wet, then, and he squeezed my fingers. "Thank you."

But something occurred to me as I sat kneeling there. "But that's where my mother and grandfather went, and I imagine I will go there as well when the time comes. When I was dreaming, I saw a grey place the people of the Amber Worlds traveled through as they moved on." I looked with worry at my family. "Are we going to end up in different afterlives?"

"There's no way to know," he said softly. "I like to think I'll get to choose to go to your mother."

Choice.

That's what it seemed all of existence was about, in the end.

What choices were we living beings going to make in the face of enormous and impossible odds?

It didn't feel like anybody was in the ground here. I looked to Noah, and he discreetly confirmed that no emotions were coming from the dirt. My mother wasn't herebut it wasn't impossible that, somewhere, she might be able to hear me. All I could say was, "I don't blame you. I'm not angry anymore."

And that forgiveness lifted a tremendous weight from my own shoulders. I breathed in chill Siberian evening air and knew myself completely. My life finally made sense. "Father, I'll be leaving in the morning. But tonightdo you still have a guitar?"

He laughed so very warmly at that. "I do. Not the same one I used to woo your mother, but it'll do."

We all headed back and got to sleep scattered on the floor between real walls, under a real roof, and warmed by a fire for the first time in longer than my tired body could remember. It wasn't home, but it was something like it, and my father played the song that he had written just for me so long ago; this time, my whole family and a sleeping old man got to hear it and know it. It was no longer a melody saved solely in my most private memories. And to top it off, my father said, "Let's see if I can still do this old trick. You used to love it" And he rubbed his fingers together like a lighter a few times before finally managing to let off a small cloud of pink sparks that floated up and dissipated back into the fabric of spacetime. I remembered laughing so much at that; I couldn't have been more than four or five years old.

I remembered.

He walked with us on the way back to the planes the next morning, and he and I tarried somewhat behind to speak privately as we hiked.

"We have no radios here," he told me. "But the things I've seenthe grey wave, the Rotationand the stories you've told me about the conflict lead me to believe we're in a time of great peril. Our people are prone to self-sacrifice for the good of others. Is that what you're about to do?"

"It's all wrapped up... dad." I choked back regret at not having more time, but the rest of me was as sharp as a blade and ready for action. "I've found all the answers there are to find, and it's time to make my choices. I'm the only one that can do this."

He regarded me with quiet pride. "You've become a strong woman, but you're not alone. Don't think you have to take the weight of the multiverse on your shoulders."

As the black angles of the planes came into sight along the ridge ahead, I decided to tell him. "I'm the Sixth Millennial. It is up to me to make a change, to turn the tide."

"The Sixth Millennial?" he laughed. "I haven't heard that Millennial term thrown around since Gisela the Yellow's reign. It's not altogether an idea without merit, but they are always tragic figures doomed to completely disrupt society in tremendous ways both good and bad at a terrible personal cost. Trust me, your destiny is your own. You're not anything like that."

I stopped between two enormous trees that could easily have been of the first generation to grow here when this planet had been built. "What do you mean? I've got these abilities."

"Yes, you told me." He looked ahead to make sure the others were continuing on and out of earshot. "But one of the reasons we were sworn to peace is that we would be capable of great violence if we were sharpened and tempered so. You can temporarily edit yourself and your perceptions like we can, but all of the things you told me about are innate qualities of our people that you discovered as you became a self-possessed adult. You just happen to be very much better at it than any of us because of a lifetime of military intent, training, andto be honestan absurd level of willpower to continue forward no matter the odds or the reason."

"*They're* my willpower." I looked ahead at my family as they realized I was hanging back and they stopped to wait. "Love, faith, belief in each other. It's *real.* It's an actual energy."

He grinned. "In a way, yes. We may be beings of light, but humans are creatures of exuberant life in their own right. I know. I fell in love with one. I've seen it. Together they can change the world. And that's your birthright, too. Don't try to do it alone. You can get help. Make allies." He let out a deep breath. "You're not the Sixth Millennial, but the Sixth Millennial *is* alive today. I recognize the feeling on the edge of my dreams from long ago. It could be anybodya father like me, or a teenage girl, or an old man, or even a babybut human beings are part of so much more than even I understand. Only an elder of our people would be able to tell you more about that, and about that Twisted Book you mentioned, too. Eight hundred years ago, they knew what it was, and they argued vehemently against its presence. They never said why." He shook his head to clear away ancient memories. "But good luck in whatever it is you're about to do. If you survive it, I'll always be here."

I took his words and processed them as much as I could while we hugged tightly. It was bitterly cold out that morning, but I felt none of it. "Thank you." The rush hit me hard in the chest. "*Thank you.*"

He whispered something in my ear; a final challenge to seek an ability I'd not yet found.

Many hands touched me on the back or the shoulders as I entered the plane, but there was no way for any of them to truly relate to this knowledge that now set me apart from them. In a way, I had already been on a trajectory toward being set apart, but now they knew for certainand I loved them that it didn't matter at all. We were a team, a squad, and a family, and that was all that mattered. In the co-pilot's seat, I looked out the front window as Flavia rotated the plane before gaining altitude; I waved to my father in his ill-fitting clothes and oversized jacket, and he waved back. He was an old man, and a wise man, and I was not sad that I had found him. He had also given me a very long letter from my mother, but that text is not for you to know.

"Was that your dad?" Otho asked, unaware of all that had transpired.

I smiled. "Yes."

"It's time to head back," Caecilia radioed as we began to head west.

A response came from a third party. *New Moscow is under attack! Thirty carrier mountains releasing spheres!*

Flavia looked to me. I frowned and picked up the handheld from the dash. "We're heading west either way. Let's stay in this reality a little longer and check out that transmission."

After a pause, undoubtedly to discuss with Larentia, Trajan, and Paulinus, she replied, "Agreed."

Upon our arrival, we found the flaring light and rising smoke of ongoing battle, but no spheres or mountains were in sight. We stayed far away from it and tried to determine what was happening, but to no avail. I picked up the radio, but Caecilia spoke first. "I think we before we go back we need to go ask the Legates what's going on. They're the only ones we can trust now. They can clear this up, and maybe we can help. The Machine Empress is not here, but somebody *is* fighting, and I can't stomach the thought of leaving home a second time without having all the answers."

"One hundred percent understood over here," I told her, and together we ran our fuel gauges down to empty on the flight west most of the way back to New Rome. We were forced to set down some distance away from the compound we'd been sent out from when our grey-class mission had begun, but it was warmer here, and we had our bikes.

But we quickly found that the compound was not remote or surrounded by barrens any longer. A wide ring of camped land surrounded it, and mobs of angry protestors ringed the entire estate on what looked like a semi-permanent basis. We kept our helmets on to retain our anonymity until we understood the situation, but this did make us stand out. The crowd became riled up as we rode among them; sticks were waved and bottles were thrown. The protestors were angry at *us!* What had been going on here?

Behind the outer chain-link fence, the temporary compound we had first been brought to was now a massive walled fortress with a huge iron gate, wholly the opposite of the small hand-built wooden town we'd left that morning. Swarms of protestors surged in with us as the gates were opened; someone in the towers had recognized a military grey-class mission returning from locations unknown. In a courtyard surrounded by high walls, a thick ring of strange-faced men approached and pushed at the protestors.

"What is this?" I shouted over the din.

"They're Empire," Noah yelled back, and I could see the likeness in their faces.

Caecilia's voice from behind her black visor was very unhappy. "Why would Vanguards be here?"

"They're not Vanguard," Flavia said with certainty. "Look at them."

Sampson said, "They look like they've been starving."

"Refugees?" Celcus asked.

We began pushing back at these desperately employed men of the Empire, but they were merely collecting our weapons rather than pushing us out like they were the protestors. "No weapons allowed in the compound!" one shouted.

I let them take my rifle and pistol. "No weapons?"

The lead man insisted, "None at all! No weapons allowed near the Legates!"

Looking up, I realized that, although the men on the high walls and towers were legitimate Amber soldiers, they, too, had no weapons. No guns, no knivesthey weren't defenseless, because they were certainly well-trained in hand-to-hand combat, but this zone completely free of weapons around the Legates was a very odd thing indeed.

Caecilia did not like it one bit. The wisest of us, she said, "Those two TV crews are with us."

From among the shouting crowd, six men were allowed to come forward; two held large cameras, and the other four held microphones and technology. They were smart enough to play along. All of us were herded into the first anteroom of the compound, where we stood for a time in confusion.

Approaching the camera crews quietly, Caecilia asked, "What is happening here?"

Whispering back, one of the men told her, "How do you not know?"

"We've been away."

He narrowed his eyes. "The military has overstepped its authority with food seizures and unfair rationing practices that leave the higher-ups well-fed and the rest of us starvingand fighting has broken out globally as they brutally force us to take it sitting down."

"And the Machine Empress?"

"She's apparently attacking everywhere all at once and nowhere at all," his friend murmured. "We were unified in our defense against her assault at first, but now we don't know what to think. Communications haven't been cutthat would be too obviousbut they're being flooded with falsehoods to confuse the people. We"

Thirty-odd Empire men rushed in and pushed the TV crews out. "The Legates have only approved you ten, no one else!"

And so we had come full circle, and with ten again. Some had been lost, new faces had been gained, and the journey had been long, but I could hear the distant song of my life reaching its natural apex. If Life and Death and Time were really cycles, this one was about to become complete. As we were led deeper into the complex through hallway after hallway and past Empire men and Amber soldiers alike, I felt drawn into the lair of a beast, or perhaps the maw of some giant sea serpent sucking us down into oblivion with a dark vortex of Hope.

Was I

Was that imagery

I'd had a dream that night in my father's cabin, and many dreams on many nights before, and even lived to heights I could never dream for a time on the cusp of death, but could it really

A planet cast in bright red; its crust pulled away like an egg shell; its core exploding outward once released. And always, that little ghost on the edge of my awareness, watching, hoveringI'd been given something of meaning in cryptic imagery. I'd been given a message that had been spread out in dreams throughout my entire life; some more direct than othersfor only recently had I been most in tune with the perceptions gifted me by my father's lineage. If the Enemy artificial intelligence had been the beast called Peace, luring me in with its promise that the war would be over if I could just defeat it, and if this feeling now was that dark vortex of Hopeno, it couldn't be that literal.

And we were all walking deeper into this maw because we had been raised our entire lives to believe the Legates were infallible heroes of our respective castes.

Why were Empire refugees here working for the Legates?

Why had the Legates hired Empire refugees?

Moving down the last long hall past guard after guard after guard, barely seeing them because of the narrowing of my vision toward action, we entered the last hall, this one great and wide and set against a long white table covered in stacks of papers, phones, and laptops that served as a place of power for the Imperial Legates.

As the military leader, Legate Blue sat at the center. Him I recognized immediately with his peppered hair and military demeanor. To his right was Legate Green, white-haired, dark-skinned, and from the east, wearing his high-shouldered medical uniform. To *his* right was Legate Yellow, the white-haired older woman in charge of all media who had helped censor religion from our world and who had molded our minds as children and beyond with careful editing of everything we saw and heard. To the left sat Legate Red, the white-haired older man heading economics and industry; it was his food-seizure order that had been posted to my grandfather's door above all those silent bodiesand beyond him, leftmost, Legate White, the blonde middle-aged woman who ran the Treasury. I had seen all of these faces countless times, yet they all seemed alien and imposing to me now.

"You can take off your helmets," Legate Blue suggested in the tone of an order.

We did so one by one.

He looked upon us and nodded slowly. "As I thought. It's the ones I sent out after that prisoner on Amber One." He peered closer. "Did you find the prisoner?"

I had to give it to them. Given how much they had to be worn, the focus on upgrading the uniforms was paying off, and the grey was beginning to feel more like a light and versatile spacesuit than clothing. I remained prone in the snow without the slightest chill, elbows forward, binoculars focused on the floating mountain over the next ridge. Its protective flights of spheres continued to move in spherical holding patterns, unaware of our presence, but taking no action of their own. Beside me, the grey-suited and black-helmeted form I'd come to instinctively know as Flavia held up her watch. Down in the valley among the trees where Septus had crept out and back again, the first of our tests sprang to life.

To my left, Celcus and Sampson gripped the long black barrels of their new automatic weapons. For this test, the ends could not be pointed at the enemy. We warily waited and watched while wintry wind whistled; no other sound or motion followed. The enemy was dormant, and had enacted no response to the rogue radio signal.

The second test followed one hundred seconds later. With a reverberant boom, a carefully placed mortar shot off in the general direction of the guardian spheres. The aim and impact did not matter, only the reactionrapid deployment toward the source of the perceived attack.

I was right.

*I was right.*

The familiar song of certainty and action began with a clang of adrenaline in my heart. We would likely not survive what was about to happen, but it had to be done. Worse, I could feel that little specter on the horizon of my awareness again, watching me. If it *was* the spying book that we had trained to identify, resist, and lie to, then its return at the moment of my most important decision seemed a dark omen of my fate. If this was the last thing I would ever do, I would at least make it count.

My team responded to my hand signal, and the five us ran together like the wolves that we werebut toward another fight, not this one. Our bikes were swiftly mounted and set on course back for the current location of our splinter faction of the Grey Riders. Noticing our blatant flight, the enemy began to follow. The mountain in the sky reached out with arms of black; we entered our carefully chosen rift; the spheres were forced to wait for their carrier ship to approach and rip its own violet hole in the sky to pursue.

And so it went, rift to rift, snow-covered valley to icy ridge to warm beach and back to chill savannahs, staying one measured step ahead of that lone mountain until we both reached our destination. Riding up and out of a red clay gorge, we approached the forested base, and a dozen armed guards were waiting for us on the approach toward the small opening between hidden Shield generators that served as a gate. Not to tip off any aggression, we raised our hands and waited atop our bikes.

"Yeah, the unauthorized five are back," the lead guard radioed to someone further in. To us, he said angrily, "Grey Leader wants a word with you."

At that, I made a sour face, despite his inability to see it inside my helmet. "Which one?"

He never answered. His attention was caught by far greater matters as my song of action reached its first quickening, brought by a beam of red light that would have killed a thousand men if not for the walls of energy that had been erected with stolen technologiesbut of course we'd expected that.

"She's found us!" one of the guards radioed on wide-band, spreading the appropriate panic as black clouds spread through the sky like locusts. Brandishing their weapons upwards and retreating toward the gate, the guards motioned us inside, their concern over our illicit scouting mission gone. Kicking back into motion, we rode inand immediately curved right through a sea of men running in every direction toward gear, weapons, and vehicles.

"We successfully caught them at the shift change," Flavia said by way of analysis as her helmet swung back and forth. "I estimate ninety seconds until readiness is restored."

It was a savagely rapid response time, but, then, these men and women were military caste, and I would have expected no less when I was one of them. More than that, I was absolutely certain they would defeat this lone directionless carrier mountain without fatalities. This was the core of our strength on this front, and the mountain we had dragged here had no thought for strategy or tactics. No, this was merely a significant diversion, and one the leadership of this mercenary military had earned for its followers.

Flavia called, "Forty seconds."

Heavy artillery began letting off incredible thuds behind us; semi-automated chaingun turrets added to that rhythm to our right. To our left, the tents full of confused soldiers gave way to the open land of our airfield. Straight ahead, rows of recently constructed bombers, fighters, and other aircraft were already launchingbut we only needed one. As we approached the four-engine personnel jet of the type we'd personally flown before, Otho emerged from the open rear ramp. I knew it was him because of his less-than-military girth and visible grungy hair coming out from under his helmet; we hadn't been caught.

"About time," he complained happily. "Couldn't fake an engine problem for much longer with all that going on." He watched the flak exploding in the skies between our Shield and the approaching mountain for a moment before retreating back inside the plane. Another figure, this one leaner, awaited us inside.

While the others locked our bikes in floor slots at the back of the plane, I headed forward and asked, "Did you get it?"

Noah handed me the small emerald device. "Caecilia's Drop Barrier. This wasn't easy to get."

She'd taken it from Otho's offerings the day we'd left our world, but Caecilia had only used it onceby her story, it had been crucial during the worst moments of the battle at the Machine Empress' fortress. Since then, she'd kept it close. Halfway to sitting in the co-pilot's chair, I paused. "How'd you get it?"

He blushed bright enough that I could almost see it through his helmet. "No reason."

That was strange grammar for a response. "...no reason?"

"Nothing!" He headed back and strapped himself in to one of the seats on the sides of the plane without further explanation.

Strapping myself in up front, I turned and asked him, "Aren't you staying here?"

"This might sound strange," he responded, suddenly serious. "Since I know I said just last night that staying near Cristina Thompson means survival, but *my* life as an individual rather than just *Noah-401* began with you. It's only fitting that I stick with you to the end."

"Then consider yourself my brother." I was just close enough to reach back and perform the ritual of his people.

Laughing softly, he bumped his closed fist directly against mine. "Sure... bro."

Flavia dashed up and slipped into the pilot's seat. "Time's up. They're going to notice our departure." Studying the controls, she hit a few switches, and the engines began roaring to life.

"Even in all this chaos?" Otho asked, buckling in next to Sampson and Celcus.

"Yes," Flavia responded instantly, her attention on learning the flight system as rapidly as possible. I could almost see her unique perspective as it drank in all the relevant labels and interconnecting flight systems. She found the lever to lower the flight ramp, but hesitated.

I looked to see Septus standing at the back, locked by indecision. His voice reached my ears full of pain. "I won't betray you."

All heads turned to watch him. This had not been unexpected. He'd listened to one too many of Conrad's preaching speeches.

"There's no time," Flavia said to us all as the music of war grew louder and more insistent. "Septus, choose a side."

"Did you see it?" he asked, half-sobbing unseen behind his dark visor. "When you were there, fighting that war you told us about, did you actually see the afterlife?"

Lie and keep my brother. Tell the truth and lose him. It was my choice.

No. It was his. "I only saw the path leading up to it."

"Then I will stay and listen to what Conrad has to say, because I must," he responded, backing down the ramp. "But I won't betray you."

My heart sank as my only true friend as close as family stepped out of our planeand our lives. "I know, brother." In formal, I told him, "Fare well in what times may come."

And the others spoke their goodbyes as the engines blasted heat and we began to ascend. Flavia left the ramp down briefly to let us see Septus for a few more seconds, but I didn't look. This would only be the first of many losses to come.

The plane's radio began shouting at us with demands from the ground for authorization. Flavia had been correct in her assessment, and the chains of command had been restored tightly enough that our flight was being noticed even in the middle of battle. At this, Otho got on and began making a lengthy explanation about engine performance that went on at such length and with so little space for response that the lieutenant on the other end began shouting in frustrationbut we were not fired upon as deserters until it was too late. This was life and death for far more than just our troops; flak exploded nearby, seriously intent on destroying us, but we were too high. Once deep enough in the clouds, Flavia zeroed in on the control to rotate the engines and send us forward. We were off.

But the escape was far from complete. From their perspective, if we defected and got caught, it could expose our organization's identities, so the men coming after us would be doing so out of fear for their families. As air-to-air jets streaked by on either side, I knew they would not hold back.

The expected orders came: "Rogue craft, return to base or be destroyed!"

While the jets were curving back around, Flavia pulled a large red lever. Electromagnetism surged around us, and a violet rectangle flickered past as it opened and we sailed through it in one swift motion. Thus was the simple configuration of our escape: the jets were faster, but relied on bombers or our type of craft to open rifts, and we were faster than bombers over the short term, which meant our lead would be maintained against the only dangerpursuit by the same type of plane. They would have the same top speed, so, just like the spheres that had been forced to wait for their carrier mountain, the faster air-to-air fighters would have to wait in each reality for a rift-opening personnel plane to recharge.

And while we had momentary privacy in the glimmering skies over a landscape of glinting gemstone fields being farmed by small white creatures far below, we turned from the course we had falsely indicated to the jets and instead began making for Amber Three. Flavia held her hand over the red lever while watching the charge meter; I stared at the radar. This diversion would only work if we jumped to the next reality before they jumped into this one.

The console chirped loud enough to be heard over the roar of the engines. Flavia asked, "Clear?"

There were no contacts on the radar. "Clear!"

The ship bounced roughly through the atmospheric differential as we soared into the belly of a sprawling grey thunderstorm. The windshield intermittently became obscured by water, but quickly slid off due to our great speed. Looking down again, I saw a contact emerge on the radar at the same time that a spherical burst of violet light flashed in the clouds ahead.

Flavia veered left, and the contact began shadowing us to the right. "How could they have gotten ahead of us?"

From deeper in the plane, Otho radioed, "They must have guessed where we're going!"

"Then it's extremely likely that it's someone who knows us well," she responded. "Someone who already had suspicions about what we were planning. The timing is too quick."

A hailing signal reached us; it was Larentia, confirming Flavia's guess. "Rogue craft, return to base... *please.*"

Caecilia's voice followed. "Venita, stop this!"

Flavia looked to me; I flipped the appropriate switches to route my mic through. "I can't."

Their plane drifted into view from the right somewhat ahead of us. As we watched, their rear ramp began to open, and two distant forms I guessed as Trajan and Paulinus appeared to be hooked in against the wind and aiming rifles at us. They couldn't take down our craft directly, but they could certainly break the windshield and shower us with glass and storm.

"Turn around or we'll be forced to open fire," Caecilia insisted with masked pain. "Make your case about what you want to do to the Grey Leadership. They'll listen! We'll do this the right way!"

The drag from their open ramp was slowing their craft and bringing them closer. "No. It has to be now, and it has to be this way," I told her, suppressing the pain of the loss of these people as my trusted family. "We confirmed it. With the Enemy artificial intelligence destroyed, the Machine Empress' forces are operating only on basic programming. There's no mind behind them. With her main fortress destroyed, there's no time or capability to build another controlling computer. *She has to lead her forces in person.*"

"It's a strategic weakness, yes, but that doesn't mean you can just go home and put everyone in danger!"

"Don't you see?" I said more emotionally than I'd intended. "If Amber Three is under assault by her right now, that means *she's there!* She's there in person *at this minute and hour!*"

Flavia looked to me with unseen concern as their craft became close enough that we could see the weapons pointed at us and feel the unhappy gaze of their wielders upon us.

"And what?" Caecilia demanded. "You're going to take her on alone?"

I held my hand above the radio switch. "I'm not alone. And I'm going to end this *now* before anyone else has to die."

"You can't"

Her voice cut off as I shut down the radio.

Sampson called up, "Are they going to fire?"

Noah said calmly and sadly, "They won't."

He couldn't sense it, but he knew the same way that I knew. Family did not fire upon family until forced to at the utmost point of desperation. That moment had not yet come. We watched as their plane fell behind quickly, having lost a great deal of speed. As it happened, I looked out, and I felt Trajan's gaze lock with mine through two dark visors. He was grimly unhappy.

"That was their only shot," Flavia murmured. "The next confrontation will have to come on the ground."

I'd been looking at more than just my former brothers in arms. Beyond them, I'd seen their rides locked down in the same manner that ours were. "They brought bikes, too."

"Then wherever we go, it'll be a chase to the end."

Behind us now and without any air-to-air weapons, Caecilia's plane followed us doggedly through skies light blue, dirty brown, and ominous purple. I braced myself for that last one as we flew among rising tendrils of dark purple light wavering like so many grasping skeletal limbs above the clouds, but we were only there for the duration of one jump charge, and Noah's voice over the radio kept me calm for those terrifying minutes. Again, I was the only one among us vulnerable, and Otho asked numerous confused questions about it even after we were out.

"There are whole Earths that just drive random people insane?" he wondered aloud. "I should never have left home. I should have stayed and helped fight it out."

Beside him, Celcus asked, "Why didn't you?"

"When the order came for anyone near a rift to flee before we were captured along with the rest of the planet, I went with the other engineers without thinking about it." He sighed. "It seemed sensible at the time, but now I'm worried about my sister and nephew."

"It's alright. We'll end this when we get back there."

"I hope so." After a pause, Otho asked, "Can she really take on the Machine Empress one-on-one?"

I froze in my seat as the spotlight behind turned upon me.

Celcus' answer was sincere. "The Empress has taken her fight to our homes. We have no choice."

Beside him, Sampson added, "Either she walks away from this or we do. There is no middle ground."

Otho did not seem reassured, but he retreated inward for the rest of the flight.

With our ability to jump, the trip was not long, although every minute felt like an hour as adrenaline continued to burn through me. I had to check every so often that I was not slowing my perception of time; when we finally got to the next reality over from Amber Three, I turned and looked back at Noah. "Any scouting information from your duplicates?"

He shook his head. "I'd have to sleep to share memories with them. And that would also give them everything that happened on your journey."

"Then we can't wait for that," Flavia commented. "One or more of them may be loyal to the Machine Empress or other parties unknown." She held her hand above the red lever. "Ready?"

It'd been a long time since I'd seen home, and I was almost afraidalmost. Even if it hadn't changed, I certainly had. The drumbeat of war was in me by choice, and I was no longer uncertain and pliable. I had hardened into a form of my own choosing.

The rift appeared and flickered past us; immediately, the light of battle lit the clouds. Several jets streaked by with a roar audible even through our helmets, and surface-to-air flak emerged in full force ahead. Reacting instantly, Flavia veered our craft roughly to the side, and we began to circle what turned out to be a battle going on at the outskirts of a city I didn't recognize.

Caecilia's plane was never far behind.

"Where are the spheres? The mountain?" Celcus asked, leaning against his belts to look past us.

I looked down in confusion. "Nothing on the radar like that. Did the enemy develop cloaking technology?"

Worried, Otho asked, "Who's fighting?"

Flavia looked to me. "I suggest we back off until we can figure out what's happening."

Something was very wrong here. Where was the enemy? "Do it."

"Where to?"

We needed to talk to people we knew. "Home. New Rome. Do we have enough fuel to cross the ocean?"

Flavia checked the gauges. "We do."

Heading away from the strange battle over the city at the base of the mountains and soon setting course out across vast glittering blue, we locked in and began the many-hour journey back to our home of homes. The long-range radio brought confusing chatter from many regions; our world was in chaos, but the exact nature of what was happening was difficult to determine. One message that could not be misconstrued was a desperate plea for aid: *Machine Empress forces have surrounded New London. Cannot hold. Repeat. Cannot hold. We are going to be wiped out. Please assist!*

By the time we heard that, we were forty-seven minutes out. We could do nothing but sit and listen for nearly an hour to calls for help and increasingly desperate situation reports. I had to imagine that Caecilia and her squad were listening to the same.

For the last ten minutes on the approach, there were no radio calls at all. As we moved through the clouds, I imagined myself to be the sharp edge of a sword. Ready to fight, ready for vengeance, and tempered to never break, I would end this for all of us no matter what it took. Something was rising in me, and I felt the anticipation as if I was going to open the ramp and jump right out into the sky to do battle with the monster the Machine Empress had become.

But the clouds gave way to clear skies over a damaged but silent city.

Celcus and Sampson clambered forward to look over our shoulders. "What's happening?"

I looked to Noah, but he shook his head and shrugged.

Otho got under the console and checked the radar briefly. "It's working."

The radio crackled. *New Paris is under attack! Sixty mountain-ships on the horizon!*

She'd moved on.

Flavia turned us again. "We're an hour away."

"Sixty mountains?" Sampson asked in dismay.

Celcus seemed to shrink imperceptibly. "She's fast. How is she already to New Paris?"

Noah offered an ominous answer. "Perhaps she's built some sort of teleportation technology."

"Is there any way to get more speed out of the engines?" I asked.

Flavia shook her head. "We've already been running hot. So has Caecilia."

We spent that hour checking all our weapons, gear, and other equipment again and again. It all had to work if we had even a chance of winning the day. Nervousness was not part of our fiber; readiness and steel were our strengths. Again I felt the anticipation of a coming climactic clash where I would have to give everything. The Shadow Himself had entrusted me with the sacred task of fixing that which had been violated.

But the clouds gave way to clear skies over a damaged but silent city.

This time, we did not ask questions. All our gazes looked out across New Paris in suspicion. When the radio lit up again, we began to guess some part of what was going on. *The Machine Empress is coming up on New Rome! Send reinforcements! Dozens of mountain-ships incoming!*

"We're two hours away," Flavia said darkly, not to inform us, but to expose the inconsistent data.

There was no conversation this time, and no anticipation of battle. We all knew what we were likely to find once we got there. Two hours passed in confused anger as we listened to radio reports of the fighting. Halfway there, the transmissions stopped.

The clouds gave way to clear skies over a damaged but silent city. White snow covered the vast landscape, hiding the damage I'd lived through what felt like a lifetime ago. A massive tanker that I'd once sat under remained on empty barrens, immovable for all time.

No longer concerned with Caecilia's pursuit, we sighted Collis Oppidum and descended toward the top of that high hill with its ancient well and long rows of wooden houses quiet under their wintry blanket. Our pursuing craft landed with a snow-clearing roar beside us; Caecilia's Dangerous Four disembarked not with policing vengeance but with the same confusion we held.

Caecilia was the first to remove her helmet. "Where is the enemy?"

One by one, we removed our black headgear and discarded our anonymity.

"Not the full story," I spat through clenched teeth. "It's never the full story. Glorious heroes, courageous sacrifice!"

And then I saw the little mounds in the snow. Men, women, childrentheir emaciated bodies hinted at recent starvation, and posted signs on wooden doorways spoke of food seizures and military rationing. With a sense of disembodied fury and despair, I threw my rifle in the snow and approached the familiar door of my home. When I'd left, it'd been nearly blocked by debris from the grey flood so long ago, but someone had cleared all that away.

It was cold inside as I let the door swing open; little white flurries entered before me, tracing the calm sanctity of the place. It was exactly as it had always been. It was only I who had changed. Stepping through heavily in my military-issued boots, I slid open the door to the back room, where my blanketed grandfather lay unmoving the way I'd found him after the flood.

He was thinner than I remembered.

For a moment, I felt nothing. I'd been in this moment before, and I'd thought the worst before

He sprang up at a creak from my boots. "Is that my granddaughter? What have I told you about coming in the house dirty?"

Just like that, everything was alright. Everyone came in, my grandfather made tea, and we spent the night laughing and listening to his ridiculous stories about ancient heroes and long-ago acts of bravery. Home was exactly the way I'd left it, which was exactly the way he'd always intended it to be. Even in times of great disaster he'd kept the house clean and ordered. We'd once sat together as black spheres had begun drilling down to murder us, and he hadn't been perturbed for a single moment. "We've been through worse than this," he'd said, and this he repeated now on a note in his clutched hand.

I stepped outside gripped by a very different kind of cold. "I saw him at the Restless Hedrons, but he said he was just having a bad dream..."

Flavia, Celcus, and Sampson were all around me then, and Noah stood back out of respect for what I was feeling. I couldn't hear what any of them were saying; there had to be only the mission now. For that, Flavia took the note from me.

"There are coordinates here at the bottom," she said in wonder. "And it says: *Remember the stories. Your father will explain.*" Her tears were real, for my grandfather had more or less adopted her, but she focused on what needed to be done. "What does this mean?"

Ancient lines of heroes...

I pushed away from them, but not to spurn my beloveds and my brothers and sisters in arms. No. This would be for my grandfather. "We have to go there right away." After all this time, was I really going to face the man who had abandoned me? "We have to see my father. It's time to get answers and end this."

A hole had been torn in the sky.

I stood on an unnamed grassy slope and watched the violet-sparking damage flicker in and out of existence like lightning among the clouds. I'd fallen from that heightand lived a lifetime in dreams on the way down. It was fading from realness even now, losing substance as reality flooded back in through long-dormant neurons and senses, but I had gained something vital and strong from the experience.

It was time to stop asking questions; it was time to start answering them. Life was short, and that fact could not be altered. Indeed, even if Death could be defeated, the result would never be what we desired. Time was only precious because we had very little of it, and to wish for more was only natural, but to be granted that wishself-defeating.

And now, torn by the pains and desires of mortality, the fabric of the multiverse and the realms of human spirituality were coming apart at the seams. The interwoven layers of existence were unraveling like so many split threads in a hurricane, and I could feel it all around me. Magenta static crackled as whole hillsides and valleys blinked in and out; other realities briefly blasted their disparate winds this way and that in a maddening maelstrom.

I removed my helmet and looked first left, then right.

There was no one.

There was only me.

But I was not the confused attention-shy girl I'd been when I'd first started this journey. The responsibility was mine, and I understood that now. My grandfather's words in the Restless Hedrons resonated with me: in some way I had yet to learn, I'd been born for this. There were forces in me that recognized and reacted; I'd seen deep and reached through the walls of reality with my hands in the core of the Enemy's mountain, and that same instinct came upon me now. Up, up, up through my legs and arms and right into my heart; energy, anticipation, concern. Breathing hard, I readied myself for something I didn't fully understand, but knew I needed to do. Then, I was off.

My run through the storm of conflicting atmospheres was rapid and focused. Something ahead had drawn my attention, some mismatched point of stability. Through the breach I could see the mechanized world I'd just left, but that was not my goal. Instead, I grabbed that point of stable space with my gloved hands and pulled on crackling violet light as if it was the edge of some massive ocean being pulled up the shore.

It had no weight, but it was the heaviest thing I'd ever tried to move. Straining and burning and screaming against the electric pain and combined effort of body, mind, and soul, I dragged one side of the breach toward the other. Blue fire whirled down my arms and out through my hands, trying to counter the pain in my fingers, but I still felt itand I refused to let go. I didn't know why, but this was important. I could no longer see through my hair whipping this way and that in vicious winds, but I didn't need to see. I *felt it*.

The other side came near, and I freed one hand to grasp it. Pulling the two together, I struggled with all my strength, shouted with desperation onceand then fell back as the air roaring through the breach shrank to a whisper and finally faded.

The wound had been sealed.

Exhausted but full of adrenaline, I leapt to my feet. There were dozens more breaches flickering in and out along the curves of this untouched landscape, and they all needed to be fixed before the multiverse began ripping apart at its foundations. Was this the devastation Heath had warned me about? No, this was too simple, and actually answerable. Jogging from breach to breach, I fought through my absolute exhaustion to close them one by one. It would take hours, but I could do it.

Stranger still, I could think of no other priority until this was done. I was in control, but I understood that this was *important.* Half of the fibers of my being warned me that this was more important even than my own life, and that if I ran from there or delayed even a moment, the damage could spread exponentially.

But who would fix the catastrophic damage that had been done to the realms of human spirituality? I'd seen whole worlds of dream rupturing and exploding; I'd felt whole continents of fantasies whimsical and grim alike cracking in half or being ravaged by that tempest of white energy. The beam had shot through the higher layers of existence like a massive targeted laser, and I had some sense that it had been exactly that. As I furiously squeezed closed wounds on reality itself, I guessed, too, where the energy for something like that had come from.

I'd touched the conduits deep under the Earths twice. This whole regionhundreds of worldshad a nervous system of power being generated from the cores of each planet and from the very Sun itself through countless growing solar towers. Porcia had died at the base of one such tower, and we'd never guessed its purpose. Had the network been grown over the last eight centuries specifically for this moment?

The last rift was a gap back to our recent battlefield; I'd saved it for my own return. Covered in sweat and drained to my core, I squeezed through and used the last of my strength to close it from the other side. Then, I fell.

Lying in knee-deep snow on a high hill, I took in the remains of the battle as the Sun reached evening orange. The sky was a pale blue devoid of all but slight hints of the polluted yellow that had hazed this place before, for the blast I'd left behind had blown that fog clear away. White clouds had replaced them, and were even now sifting snow to cover up what remained below. The mountain fortress that Sampson, Larentia, and the Vanguard had penetrated was a tilted and collapsed ruin giving off bright arcs of random violet energy. Worst of all, the long chrome valley's snow was stained with the blood of cybernetic animals, humans, Yngtaks, plant titans, and amethyst pyramids alike. Many had died here.

Was my family among them?

Even in death, had they succeeded? Was our home safe?

And there was so much damage. I'd closed some breaches where I'd ended up, but this place seemed to be the nexus of a major disaster that had happened deep below the earth. I could feel thousands of random energetic leaks powering technological breaches in every direction, and I had to ask myself: what kind of direction? What set of coordinates was I feeling these things in? Had my lifetimes in the dream realms left me with a higher sense, or was this somehow natural to me? It felt natural. It seemed like something I'd been slowly feeling more and more after our shimmering Shield went down; it felt like I'd always had the ability to see, but that I'd been raised in a dark room, and was only now being allowed to interact with light.

I could sense that light now, for what little sense I could make of it beyond instinctand I could also see the small shadow from my dreams still hovering on the edge of awareness. For the first time, the chill here penetrated my jade armor and clothing, and I shivered.

There was more work to do. After forcing myself up, I trudged through the deepening snow with my arms crossed. I had no weapons, and I'd foolishly left my helmet on the other side, which meant no radio. Did I dare to stoop to looting the dead?

That could wait. As the gloom of night began to fall, I kept warm by dragging breaches closed. Each time, I was slower than the last. My stomach ached for food, and my head pounded for water, and the damage was growing faster than I could heal it.

There had to be a better way to do this. Stumbling toward a biomechanical conduit that jutted as a ridge above the snow now that my sapphire blast had exposed it, I touched a hand to violet like I had twice before. "Can you hear me?"

It could.

And it was scared.

As Noah had said, it was a life-form all its own, and how could it be anything but alive when its biological and technological nervous system spanned so many worlds? Like a loyal pet, it operated on instinct, and the artificial intelligence that had served as its master had been obliterated. The control center was gone, and it had been left alone in worlds growing quickly colder.

"You're not alone," I gasped, falling into the snow near it from sheer exhaustion. I held my arm up to keep my hand on it. "We're here."

It remembered me. The glow under my hand brightened.

"I need you to heal," I asked it between tired and painfully icy breaths. "Do you understand? You're leaking energy all over the place. The feedback maybe, or the explosions, or the loss of you control centeryou're creating rifts everywhere. I need you to heal. Do you understand?"

The purple light under my fingers dimmed slightly. I could feel that my concepts were too complex for it to grasp.

"We're going to die," I told it, slumping against warm chrome. "It's all going to go away. *We're* all going to go away, and you'll be left aloneunless you heal. Do you understand?"

It did.

I sighed with relief and sat recovering as the character of the space in that valley began to change. It was slow, and barely perceptible even to my growing senses, but it would work. It would take a few days, but it would work. "Thank you," I breathed.

It responded with greater warmth at my back, and the freezing cold and falling snow did not bother me so much as I finally found a moment to turn my attention to the next steps. This region of Earths would not tear itself apartso what now?

Where was Her Glory? By scattered violet and the light of intermittent fires, I studied the burning mountain fortress for a time, but even a normal soldier would have known that this place was empty. Battlefields like this were no place for the living, and these ruins and remains would be left here to rot under the open sky. I knew Her Glory was alive, for I'd seen her pale form moving back along that white beam, but she was not here. She was undoubtedly on a war path against those who had attacked her. From her perspective, it would have seemed vicious and unprompted.

For a time, I sat devoid of thought, and simply taking in the strangely beautiful lights of this living mechanical valley. As Caecilia had often taught me, rest was as important as action, and I would be useless to anyone if I pushed myself too hard. Between a massive battle, a suicide run, a seventeen million year war, and my responsibilities here with healing space, I'd given all I had.

But I was somehow stronger for it.

Amazing the sense of surety that *healing* rather than fighting could give. Rising slowly to my feet and stepping out into the snow, I gazed at my gloved hands in wonder. I wasn't tired. The war was just beginning, and I was up to it. Amazing the endurance that surety of oneself could give; I could do this. Death had taught me something in his own unique way, and I was seeing a whole new side of possibility. For the first time, I'd asked for help and healing and peace rather than fighting the battle myself. Violence had been necessary to get this far, but it was not the only tool. To be more than a fighter, to be more than a soldierI had choices to make, and I would make them, because life was short.

The low whine of a single bike reached my ears, and I stepped onto the remains of a dead amethyst to sight the rider. Lit from beneath, the snow appeared to contain pools of violet effulgence, and I stood to be illuminated thus as the lone rider stopped abruptly. I didn't think about it at the time, but perhaps Conrad's flair for the dramatic had rubbed off on me; I must have been quite the sight backlit in violet while my bright red hair whipped in the wind above a subtle jade glow.

The grey-clad rider ran forward and, to my surprise, prostrated himself. Clasping his gloved hands and holding them up above his black-helmeted head, he said in an anonymized voice, **It's true!**

That was strange. I narrowed my eyes. He was speaking our formal dialect, so he had to be one of my own. "What are you doing? Take off your helmet."

**I cannot.**

"What? Show me who you are."

**It matters not who I am. Are you the sword-bearer?** he asked in awe, tilting his head up at me.

Wary, I kept my gaze on his black visor and watched my own bright reflection as I slowly put my hand out and willed my multi-tool into the shape of a sword. It burst into spectral blue flames, but I was not surprised, for it had done so a thousand times in my dreams. In that moment, it did not occur to me that it should not have been able to do that in the real world. All I saw in that black visor, beyond my own glowing image, was absolute and total awe.

**He spoke the truth. He spoke the truth!**

Now I understood. The name came as acid to my lips. "Conrad?"

**Speak not his name!** the robotic voice clamored. **Names are anathema. We are the Doomed. The Machine Empress of Mankind comes to annihilate us for what we have done.** He chose his words carefully to avoid stating ownership. **She believes us to come from the Amber Worlds, and her forces are already there holding them hostage.**

My sword brightened with fear and fury. "*What?*"

**She's demanded our surrender or she'll slaughter the families of anyone involved!**

I understood. In a flash, I understood why he would not take off his helmet or identify himself. It had to beit was Cristina's idea, no doubt. Conrad was far more direct. "Grey-class protocol. You're hiding your identity so she can't figure out who you are, because if she could"

**Speak not!** he cried. **No one can know. We are the Grey Riders, and our actions are our own.**

"Soldier," I told him while shaking my head. "You're speaking formal. You have been this whole time."

He gasped, and then begged, **Forgive me!**

I grimaced. "Why are you behaving like this? I'm not in charge of you. Just speak informal or they'll know." I finally looked up, and my gaze came to rest on his bike. "Why are you here in this place of death?"

**Finders,** he told me, rising to his feet only as I pulled him up from the snow. **A dozen of us were sent as rear scouts to interrogate Vanguards and search for Finders.**

That was confirmation. Cristina was still alive, and had successfully inserted herself into the chain of command. And this man's behavior meant that Conrad was still alive as well. The secret power struggle was likely in full swing now that the war had blown wide open, but my first concern was home. "Take me to her."

Nodding profusely, the grey-clad man quickly led me to his bike, and I climbed on back. Our path took us through the icy night and across vast plains of darkness and snow. He checked his compass in confusion many times. **There are new rectangular rifts everywhere, and, as long as we know the way, we can get almost anywhere very quickly.**

I didn't tell him that I already knew. I could feel them all around me if I thought about it, like running my hands across a chill blanket full of moth-eaten holes. Their presence made me innately uncomfortable, but I took solace in the slow fading of the energies behind them.

How many soldiers of Amber had been part of the grey-class mission and supply effort? As we came around the last mountainous ridge, a camp of astounding size slowly rolled into sight. We had control of one factory, possibly more, and I saw helicopters in the night sky as well as numerous vehicles and tanks below, all freshly made without insignia or identifying marks. Part of me swelled with surprise and pride. When the military caste went to war, it *went to war*.

Long low walls that looked like fabricated Shield generators were being constructed as we passed, all by men and women in grey clothes and black helmets or face masks. Riding deeper through the city of tents, we checked with security four times, and then slipped sidewise to approach an unassuming but large supply tent.

Within, twenty or more anonymous soldiers stood talking over a table full of charts and maps. All stared as I entered.

**Somebody get her a helmet,** one shouted.

A helmet was offered, and I slid it on to hear the voices I'd been hoping for. Hugs assaulted me in an ambush from the side as my family closed in to greet me, but I wasn't sure exactly who was who. Even Sampson was there, and him I knew by his bulky arms. Larentia, too, had survived. 

Cristina's voice cut through all of that. "I'm sorry for this strange anonymous reunion, but we have to take extreme measures to hide our identities. Ambers One, Two, and Three have been captured, and"

"I heard," I told her, thinking of my grandfather. "What's the plan to free them?"

The cloud of black helmets turned this way and that as they instinctively looked at each other.

Flavia was the one to tell me. "There's no plan. We don't have the manpower or weapons to win."

I wished desperately to see their faces. "Then what? We just run?"

"No," she said softly. "We have to put on a good show of fighting it out, but the plan is to die in such a way that leaves no proof of exactly who we were."

I was stronger now, and I took this in with a moment of silence before asking, "How many of us are there?"

Celcus spoke as one of the grey-clad forms touched my shoulder. "A little over five hundred thousand Amber soldiers, trusted Vanguards, and Yngtaks who volunteered after the battle."

"But there are billions back home so the trade is obvious," I said by way of completing their logic. Turning aside for a moment, I processed a rush of feelings. I would have been all for the heroic sacrifice before, but the way of the loyal soldierthe way that had been my entire lifenow seemed small and foolish. More than that, I didn't *believe it.* Cristina and Conrad had engineered different parts of this situation, and neither were the type to simply give up. More than that, the man who had dropped me off here had been tasked with capturing Finders. If that was the case, I did not believe for a second that Cristina expected to die. "Seems like the only choice," I lied with conviction.

Was this what being a complete individual felt like? It was disconnected and lonely in some ways, but I wouldn't have traded it for the world. As my squad celebrated my return, I walked with them in somber silence while Cristina showed me the efforts happening in the camp at large.

"The little amethyst suicide devices can be hooked up as a sort of self-annihilation system if we're captured or injured," she said, lifting the flap of one tent to show me the engineers within. Even though I couldn't see their faces, I could tell they were gaping at me, for I still wore the jade armor. They knew exactly who I was, and Conrad had built me up to be some sort of angel of battle. After lowering the flap, Cristina continued, "We've been joined by those who escaped Her Glory's assault on the Amber Worlds. Several million in various places across the region. One of the camps is working on a way to burn our blood when it gets exposed to the atmosphere, so that non-lethal injuries don't expose us."

The others clapped each other and spoke proudly of these accomplishments. I was not *against* our anonymity, for it was well meant, I was just no longer naive enough to believe that it was the full story. I simply listeneduntil something occurred to me. "Are there any other ways we could be found out?" I could still feel it there on the edge of perception. "I'm being followed by some sort of awareness, as if somebody formless and distant is watching me. Dreams, reality, it's always there."

That made her stop in place in the middle of a busy lane as tanks rolled by to our left. "The book..."

I frowned at that. Noah had mentioned something very briefly once long ago. "A book?"

"It can read souls and extract your innermost secrets," she said with concern. "I have no idea where it is right now. We need to take measures to protect against it in case it falls into enemy hands."

A rush of anger hit me as I realized that such a device could get everyone I loved killed no matter how smartly we hid our identities. It seemed *unfair* somehow. "How do we guard against it?"

"It doesn't read the truth," she murmured over the radio, her black-helmeted head unmoving as she stared into the chilly night. "There's no such thing as objective truth. It reads what you *believe* to be true."

"And we control what we believe," Flavia offered. "At least in a limited fashion."

"Yes." Cristina turned suddenly. "We'll have to train every single Grey Rider to resist the effects of that book, since chances are good it's being used against us even now. Someone could be interrogating our souls from the future about events happening at this moment."

I shivered at that, as if a chill wind had just touched the fires of my spirit.

Unlike technological solutions, this technique was for guarding the mind and the soul, and we sat the next morning in fields of snow in lines thousands of black-helmeted soldiers long and, of all things, *meditated.* Conrad was at one of the other camps Cristina had spoken of, and this one was full of loyalists to her, so she sat at the front along with our scant number of medical volunteers and they guided us through our best attempt at self-understanding.

Belief and reality are powerfully intertwined. This I'd learned. My heart beat rapidly as the only thing in my awareness as I pushed out all other thoughts. If the shadow on the edge of my awareness was really someone reading that book and investigating me, then I had to shrink my awareness to bring it closer.

But it stayed out of reach. I decided that it must have been something else, or perhaps I'd imagined it, because it vanished abruptly when I tried to

---

Kumari sat and stared at the console of the machine. The book buried deep within that pillar of technology had failed to change the past yet again. Of all the people that might have been able to overcome the realities of Time and Deathit should have worked. Instead, she'd been forced to watch the *reason* the violet rifts had healed over and thus separated and stranded her family so long ago.

Venita of Amber Three should have been able to do it. It was such a small thing to ask to save one man of no importance, but Time was a bastard who refused any given person the thing they wanted simply because they wanted it. And here Venita was, *fighting* the book's influence because she believed it a threat.

Or was that the key?

Venita seemed to be far more conscious and aware of her dreams than most. Was communication possible that way? Moving again, Kumari began typing rapidly. Perhaps a single message could change everything...

	<TEXT> I actually think about this quite a bit. NoSleep's format was extremely restrictive, but that also breeds creativity. While I did manage to create some extensions of the rules (the new alternate reality rules were because of me), if I'd remained on NoSleep the series would likely have been much slower and more mysterious.

I tend to vary writing styles between works, but the general trend since I moved to /r/m59gar has involved being more direct and more traditional in some ways. For example, with the New Exodus Vanguard I tried out third person story-telling for the first time in the Portal canon, and I also started simply stating a range of concepts that would have only been hinted at otherwise. Humanity Revived was also third person, but The Grey Riders went back to first person because I felt it was more appropriate to the character's perspective. So it's not clear to me that the stories would have suffered at all perspective-wise because of NoSleep's format, but I definitely appreciate being able to be more direct about complex concepts. Can you imagine trying to paint a picture of the Crushing Fist or the subsequent exodus without ever being explicit about what was going on? Characters would have to have ended up in absurdly specific circumstances while somehow remaining oblivious to absolutely massive changes in life circumstances.

But I do think the major difference would be the concept of where 'we' the readers are. In the stories written for NoSleep, I was always careful to leave a specific unknown that may have encompassed us, the readers, and the real world. The secret here is that 'we' still do exist, just somewhere else in the multiverse rather than as part of the Empire itself. Having 'our' world be part of the Empire would have kept the peak of the action muted (for example, the end of the Crushing Fist wouldn't have been possible without 'us' noticing it in 'our' world).

So it's possible we're a sister Earth or somewhere even further away, and the possibility still exists that the story will meet us. </TEXT>

I try not to give out spoilers, but I think it's warranted for The Beast's Realm since it's a very different side-series than most. If you'd like some direct comments on Heath and the Beast's Realm: [Spoiler](/s "Heath is human, and what he experienced in The Beast's Realm was a little less than literal, a sort of releasing of burdens in the Dream Tessellations. However, those events were not pointless or random, and their meaning may become clearer as the stories progress.") </TEXT>

This is the tale of the Angel of Amber Three, leader of the armies of the Disquiet Dead, and Rebel General for the allied forces of Everlasting Life. I became this woman of fire, calculation, and hate over the seven eras that elapsed during the war of the worlds of dream, but of course these things faded like leaves on the autumn wind once the tree of perception lost its warmth and I finally awoke. For the living, it was merely an instant of frozen blue Time as I clung with all my might to the last moments of my life. For the dead, it was a conflict devoid of rest and peace. Rather than move on to unknown eternities, they chose to side with me and fight for change. They did this out of Love.

On that first day when Death and I met in the Restless Hedrons and fought on sheer obsidian with nothing more than basic swords, I managed to wound him. It was a minor cut, but, as I came to understand, one that should have been impossible. Death was not injurable; he was not a man with arteries to sever or blood capable of being spilled. Nevertheless, I struck him with an imaginary sword charged with real and vital hopesand he bled.

He bled, and he fled. Our small corner of the limitless dream realms was massive in scope compared to the speed of our chase, but I still struggled to keep track of our path as I flew on wings of blue flame after the Shadow Himself over lands strange, wonderful, and terrifying. Where I had seen some portion of human dead drifting through the Restless Hedrons unto the black veil beyond, these rapidly crossed continents were unknowably alien, familiar but exotic, or curiously mundane in nature, and none of the inhabitants below knew me or cared about me. Some may have at one time or another served some tertiary role in human dreaming, but by and large I saw mechanisms, industries, and metaphors fit for minds made by and for other forms of life, and not all in three plus one dimensions like my waking form. I had no spare attention for these, for my eyes and energy had focus only upon the dark form and billowing cloak retreating on the horizon.

He was faster than me, and he was headed somewhere specific, but he made a mistake in choosing his pathor perhaps my random thoughts in this world of the mind willed it ahead of us. My heart leapt as I saw my pursued silhouette slow and begin to descend unwillingly; I, too, began to lose speed and height despite my continued fury. We arced down together onto flat grey undulations of pale sand, and I limped closer with weak limbs and gasping lungs.

Death staggered about like a suffocating man under that painfully grey sky, but he did not let go of his weapons; as I approached, he clashed back with surprising will, but this was a place of austere emptiness for us both and his attack was less than dangerous. He was still stronger, but his blows came as feeble taps against my infirm parries. We circled each other amid a gathering crowd of ashen spirits, exchanging slow strikes with increasing fatigue. I came to realize that, although he was weakened, the playing field was still even, for I was as well. As he finally gained the upper hand, I expected to meet my end on those plains of wasting.

A thick hand gripped Deaths kick as it rose to ruin me.

A freckled hand gripped the first of Deaths black swords as it thrust to stab me.

A small hand gripped the second of Deaths black swords as it descended to slay me.

His blades stopped by mere soul-flesh, he was forced to lurch back on his failing legs, and he intoned with his voice like aging thus: *A truce, a truce; a truce for this era. Let us have an era of rest, lest we both fall into oblivion.*

A second? A minute? A day? A week? A month? A year? A century? Time had no meaning in dreams and his term for it had no exact translation, but I agreed, for I was strangling under the sheer weight of the grey devitalization crushing us both. That era of rest allowed him to escape, but not without a slight bow and a nod toward his black blood still on my sword; by its trembling divinations I would locate him for the next round.

He retreated to his distant citadel, and, in that manner, the war was set.

The ashen hands that had saved me shimmered into full forms, and dead men and women who had been on their way to a grey veil instead carried me to a white oasis of calm to help me recover. There were dozens there full of pride and solidarity, but the first faces that appeared to me made my heart weep.

I knew then what Id found and what this place was. My whole life thoughts of the afterworld, Death, and religion had been suppressed and removed from our social consciousness; this was the result. An infinite grey wall awaited at the end of these colorless hills devoid of character, and all the souls of Amber Threeand other Amber Worlds, I saw, as I looked into their rippling faces and saw their lives and memories and hopes and dreamspassed this way toward whatever awaited beyond.

The three hands that had saved me were of those I knew well and loved; Tacitus had stopped Deaths kick, Rufus had stopped Deaths stab, and Porcia had stopped the fatal blow. They were as I had seen them in the theatre of my mind, and I knew then that they had not just been spectres of my imagination. Theyd sat with me as Id brushed with Death. Theyd sat with me out of Love, for family and for brotherhood. They were here, pale, bloodless, with red lips, and with blood red hair in Rufus case. And, beyond them, the massed presences of all those that had died in the Disasters and the Time of Sickness stood watching. Assembled across the grey plains of wasting, choosing to stay rather than move on, the billions of valiant Amber souls that had died in recent months stood waiting for action. 

Their stories and desires were overwhelming. To my left were the souls of Amber Eight; only seven had escaped the explosion of their Earth during the end of the Crushing Fist crisis, and I was relieved to see Sampson was still one of those seven and not here. To my right were the souls of Amber Four; only six million had escaped in a manner most surprising, but to somewhere beyond the knowledge of these honored dead. Directly before me, most of all, my fellow citizens of Amber Three looked on through vacant eyes ablaze with fury. My brothers and sisters stood at the front of this host of militant souls that refused to go without a fight. Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia had already been lingering in the hopes of seeing me and the rest of our family, and I could see how they thirsted to bring battle against the Shadow Himself for all that he had done to us.

And for all the times that Id raged against the silence of existence for taking them from me, I was relieved and overjoyed to see my lost family members again. I hugged each of them, and they were solid to my touch, and I confess I wept with them at our unexpected reunion.

But after that, the era of rest was spent planning the assault.

I know that moment to moment our exchanged words were real and our exchanged emotions were whole, but I can only remember impressions now that the dream is long over. Tacitus was still quiet, but all smiles with me around. I got to know Rufus the way I hadnt had a chance to in life. I was able to thank Porcia for her sacrifice in saving me, and she told me that all three of them had made the same choice. All three of them had been visited in their dreams the nights before their deaths by the small voyeuristic shade that still followed me on the outskirts of interaction, and all three of them had gone to their deaths knowing they would save me and believing that doing so was important in a way that coincided with the bonds of family. I finally understood why Tacitus had given me his breath in the grey flood, why Rufus had gone before me in the Rotation hurricane, and why Porcia had run to take the brunt of that explosion for me on our first mission off-world. They had done this out of Love.

The rippling little shadow in question hovered on the edge of the vast white oasis outside our assembled billions of soldier-souls, but it made no move and gave no reaction as I studied it with a glare. Who or what was it? Why had it been manipulating my life all this time? But if I took a step toward it, it moved away, and no other response could be garnered. I had no choice but to turn back to the business of the war against Death.

By the vibrations of the black blood I now kept in a vial around my neck, I knew the direction he had gone. From that moment on, the beat of the march matched the beat of my heart, and our spectral drums set the pace. In wide ranks we proceeded parallel to the grey veil, and not a single soul broke ranks and fled to their rightful place of rest. If our culture had done one thing right, it had forged children, men, women, and elderly of a caliber beyond all others.

Guns and other projectile weapons did not function in the dream realms because distances were variable and often illusory, but extensions of their will formed swords, pikes, maces, shields, and other short-range weapons. We had the plan, we had the will, and we had each other. I marched in the front with my brothers and sister, and thus I was the first to face the beasts as we transitioned to a new realm and the next era. The truce was over, and Death's vanguard awaited us.

The wildly jagged spires and rocky valleys of those cragged mountains held land-bound beasts and crawling things of every horrific nature imaginable; under a hot desert sun we formed into phalanxes and pushed through high passes and low routes.

My personal guard was comprised of ten men and ten women including Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia, and these twenty moved in unison with shields presenting a wall and spears stabbing at a great serpent that blocked our way. It reared up and struck to the left and to the right, but its massive fangs penetrated nothing but interlocking spiritual shields. A spear found its eye, another the roof of its mouth, and it fell. Beyond, the slithering legions spread to assault our front line, and the rampaging beasts of the wilds charged our flanks down precipitous slopes.

The behemoths caused yielding, but at tension; the assembled people of the Amber Worlds braced each other increasingly the more they were pressed upon, and those who were gored by massive tusks ignored the pain and seized bare bone with their hands. Immobilized, the beasts became pincushions for thousands of furiously placed blades, and the flanking maneuver failed.

Slashing at snakes underfoot and moving with my guard, I had to wonder why these people had chosen to join my crusade. Was it merely revenge? No, it had to be more than that. By not going beyond their grey veil, it was entirely possible they were risking permanent exile or even dissolution of their very souls, but, here they were, as valorous in death as they had been in life. Was this courage the distilled essence of the best humanity had to offer? My heart swelled with pride even as Death's first lieutenant approached.

*I am Peace,* the towering beast hissed by way of introduction. Titanic hooves held up a snake-like torso bearing the head of a serpent. *I will free you wayward spirits from your pain.*

We stared up in awe at the monstrous thing as it stomped down; spreading out in lockstep, our third legion avoided the crashing hoofmostly. Seventy-three were crushed underfoot and given peace as promised. The third legion rapidly reclosed formation and encircled the beast, but their spears could only do so much against a veritable mountain.

Tacitus nodded to me. It was on me now.

Flying in the heat of rage during a private duel was one thing, but doing it with everyone watching was another. As our drums beat the rapid pulse of warning, I breathed hard and tried to summon my wingsbut could not. Instead, I charged forward on foot, racing past the fifth and fourth legions. I still had Porcia's speed, and, indeed, she raced beside me, the only member of my guard that could keep up. Together, we dashed under the raised hoof of Peace and then curved around it in opposite directions.

Attempting to smash one or both of us, it began turning more quickly than its lumbrous body allowed. Porcia and I reversed directions on point, and the beast angled its forward leg wrong. On the uneven crags, its weight caused a rockslide, and it fell with an earth-shaking roar of anger. The third legion swarmed upon it, stabbing between scales and into joints and eye sockets and anywhere else they could.

Death's first lieutenant bled out on the rocks, its fanged maw open to the hot sky. The torrent of its dark blood became an ocean beyond, and we saw the way forward.

As the other legions in their billions cleaned the ridges of land-bound beasts, I stood atop the crest of the hoofed serpent and studied it with heaviness in my heart. Why had Death's lieutenant been named Peace? I'd expected something ominous or dark. Some of the Vanguard had talked about horsemen named Famine, Pestilence, War, and the like, but Peace

Pushing that troubled thought to the back of my mind, I managed the carving of countless boats out of the bony remains of the creatures we had slain, and our legions set out upon the dark ocean at the dawn of the next era.

Here the sea became bright orange and dangerously choppy; a pale white sun illuminated a weak emerald sky containing scattered dark blue cloud tracers. The drumbeats of war were long, slow, and apprehensive. What dangers awaited in these tangerine waters?

Serpents again, this time of the sea, with their round maws and grasping teeth opening wide to swallow ships whole; airborne nightmares representing terrible fates in the sky; swooping pillars of biting insects against which our initial implements were useless; all these enemies and more  swarmed upon us in response to a single horn blast from somewhere ahead.

At my direction, we formed solid armors of will to keep out the insects, and shields were held overhead to form barriers against the nightmarish flying creatures above. This left little room to fight the serpents, but we could see now what had given the horn blast; it had been the roar of a tremendous coiled thing in the choppy orange sea. This was Death's second lieutenant, and it bellowed: *I am Hope. Come, dive into the unknown. Rejoice rather than fear what comes.*

Hope? I nearly hesitated, but Tacitus jumped ahead of me, and I was not going to let him do this alone. Together, we swam down into luminant orange, and the full scope of the coiled serpent below became apparent as the world opened up before us. It was as if we were flying above a kingdom of coral and fish deep and expansive in every direction unto fading amber. Towering from that land up to our heights in the water, Hope seemed impossible to approach, let alone defeat.

I swam after Tacitus, but half of me held back. What was happening here? The first instinct of my being was to fight and go to war, and that was exactly what I'd always done. Death's exact words might have been more than taunts. He'd said I'd called forth what I'd expected to see, and that he'd been temporarily formed into a singular entity *just for me.*

Was all this a distraction? Was I following the random narrative of a dream and ignoring what I should be doing?

Or... was this my consciousness' way of interpreting what was happening in terms most familiar to me? In that case, willpower and ingenuity alone would win the war. That was really Tacitus swimming ahead of me, and those were really the souls of my fellow Amber citizens fighting to hold off the enemy on the surface. This I knew. A small rhythm became apparent to me; underlying chimes pealing in the depths of my awareness, underneath the booming beat of drums coming from overhead. My nature was to fight, and fight I would. I swam harder, catching up with my brother in arms.

Hope shot toward us, opening a vast ringed mouth many times wider than any ship and bringing overwhelming currents many times more powerful than any soldier. Beside me, Tacitus caught on to my intended tactic; together, we swam straight at it rather than balking, and the currents aided our speed until we broke free of the main vortex and stabbed our swords into the side of its throat. Endless organic darkness swirled mightily along our backs and clawed at our boots as the full strength of the ocean poured down that incredible mawbut we climbed. Stabbing our blades higher and gripping individually one after another the closest of the thousands of teeth jutting from the beast's throat, we struggled our way up moment by moment.

Directional sensational had already been lost, but we felt it as the great serpent soared into open air; the incredible tide vanished in an instant to be replaced by blasting winds and an angling vista of the emerald sky as we curved back toward the cinnabar sea. I nearly lost my hold as water exploded up that open mouth at us with terrific ferocity, but Tacitus stabbed past me, and the flat of his sword held me just long enough to find a grip on nearby throat-teeth. Smashed boats and drowning spirits sailed past us down the dark vortex of swallowed water, but they went still stabbing and fighting with blazing eyes.

The brief trip through open air had given us a second breath, and now we climbed up and into one of two smaller fleshy passages protected not by teeth but by tough membranes; these gave way to our sharp edges, and we clawed our way into sensitive tissues. A hall of pink-lined bone opened before us, and spraying air and water were our only barriers as we climbed toward pulsing arteries. The serpent's brain was beyond, and we hacked and cut as hard as we could.

Water flooded the sinus cavity at our injury, but we resisted the tide and held our breaths again. I stabbed deep into blood-clouded waters until I thought my lungs might burn from my chest, but Tacitus looked to me through the haze and nodded his support and determination.

I stayed.

Just at the end of breath, our stabs punched through, and the open space beyond sucked us in with the force of released water pressures. Strange liquids of many colors and strange smells coursed here, and the ceiling of this area was all corrugated grey matter. Rushing tides tore this way and that, but we made our way deeper down the inner curve of the serpent's skull and began chopping into the sparking pillar of flesh at the base.

It was over.

By the time Tacitus and I emerged from one of the eyes of the beast as it floated upside-down and motionless on the ocean, I was covered in filths and ichors beyond description, but the cheering of our assembled billions drowned out the slight reticence in my heart. Something felt very wrong, but I had to keep going.

The orange waters were littered with dead flying things and ruptured insects; we took from these their wings and attached them to the sealed armors of spirit that had been envisioned earlier in the battle. The long coil of Hope's serpentine body had separated from the ocean and begun trailing up into the sky. It was up this serpent road that we marched through the nightand into the night. As the next era dawned, we jumped from the barbed tail of the beast and soared out into the firmament.

There! From our celestial heights, we could see Death's grim fortress in the clear distance.

And I could still see that trailing impish shadow far behind us. What was it watching for? What did it want? With my borrowed insectoid wings I led the charge against the fauna of space; weird bloated bags of flesh full of gas, sentient dwarf stars, and asteroids with living cores and grasping tentacles sought to keep us from our destination.

For the first time, I began asking myself why these denizens of the Dream Tessellations might resist us. It was unthinkable that these strange entities were somehow part of our Death's work and responsibilities. The beasts of the land, the fish of the oceans, the insects of the skies, and other creatures I'd seen as part of the sphere of our Earth. It seemed unlikely that every species had its own personal Death. What need did ants or birds have of such a force personified? But these opponents were stranger by far, and I began to doubt that Death normally had all these realms under his control.

Death's third lieutenant approached; an unidentifiable abomination of flesh emerging from the dark depths of space that seemed to shift and grow as I watched, adapting to our attacks even as we made them. *I am Evolution,* it breathed upon us, and its breath was bitter. *You must be annihilated to make way for your superiors.*

The star-beast Evolution became stronger with each attack we made upon it, and, for the first time, I was forced to sit out and even evade it as it sought to fight with me. Rufus remained by my side as my guard of twenty took losses; being the best of us, they could not fight back without empowering the enemy. Their shields were raised constantly, and took blow after blow as strangely mutating limbs lashed out from cosmic distances to strike at us.

The sixth legion covered our movements as the bulk of the army moved to put a rotating red planet between us and the beast, and the losses they took while protecting us were nearly total. The drumbeats of our collective spirits reached a crescendo of warning and terror. How could we fight that which could not be attacked?

Again I questioned my approach toward all obstacles. What was I experiencing here? Was someone or some *thing* trying to teach me? What important lesson was I missing?

What I saw next chilled me to my core for reasons I could not explain, as if this event was personal in some way. The planet between us and the enemy began slowing its rotation; as I watched, part of its surfaced floated away from the rest, streaming out among the stars like a fountain of dust and magma. When enough of it had escaped, the pressurized core exploded.

The ninth legion was lost in the blast.

We fled out among the constellations as Evolution and its endless forces pursued us. Taking refuge in deep blue nebulae, we sought to hide while coming up with a plan. I was no longer full of the fire I'd had when I'd started all this, but I was not about to give up and abandon my comrades in arms to the horrors of the dream skies.

We could not slay Evolution. There was no option that I could see. Instead, we needed to make a push straight for the source of all this. Ramping up the drumbeats to direct our fierce defiance forward, we blazed from our nebulaic cloak as one. Evolution could not be defeated, but it needed time to destroy us, and we accepted horrifying losses to fight our way throughand past.

Our flight took us around a massive red star and into a jungle realm of thick plant life; the sky could not be seen, and animated verdant tendrils tried to stop us, but Death had depended upon Evolution to stop us. Resistance here was weak. We chopped our way through the endless sea of trees and bushes and vines, growing tired from the effort, but still outpacing the pursuit of those strange monstrosities behind us. Those at the front hacked away obstacles while those behind rested; we switched at regular intervals. No lieutenant stood in our way.

As the next era arrived, we began to believe that this could actually work. The clinging plants held our pursuers at bay while we pushed into a realm of open blue sky and nothing else. The enemy was not far behind us, but the way was clear, and we flew at dangerous speeds, losing many as their borrowed wings failed and they fell into infinite airy emptiness. The unblocked sun burned close and wide overhead, but we endured the heat and charged up and into the fires to reach Death's fortress beyond. With the enemy darkening the skies behind us in limitless number, we breached into the last era and realm, where only that massive blazing sun and a star of darkness orbited one another. In the middle, built upon the exact point of met twilight, stood a fortress of obsidian.

The cloaked silhouette of Death awaited me upon his highest tower, his two swords ready. I turned and told my beleaguered fellows to hold off our pursuers. We had reached the final battle of our war, and it was mine alone. Their ashen faces burned with pride. They would hold off Death's final lieutenant long enoughno matter what it took. Their drumbeats of armored determination remained with me as I descended to Death's highest tower and stood opposite him on smooth obsidian.

But I was not alone as I'd expected. Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia alighted behind me, standing in support.

The eyeless silhouette regarded us with a piercing unseen gaze. *So this is it.*

"Yes." It was the first spoken word I'd given in countless spans of time, and the feel of it surprised me. However I'd been communicating with my fellows, it had not been verbally.

*Do you have any idea what you're doing?* He lifted one sword and pointed it at me in accusation. *Do you understand that these realms are real, and vital to the functioning of existence? This is not the random imagery of a dream. Those lands are isolated and personal. Do you understand that what you're doing here will have serious consequences?*

My pulse roared in my heart and in my head, warning me to caution. I'd had that sense throughout the war, but hearing it from my enemy made me wary. "Then tell me. All I ask is to understand existence."

*All you ask?* He gave a self-righteous laugh that felt to me like dry chalk upon my ears. *All she asks.* He turned slightly and waved his sword down at obsidian as if speaking to his fortress itself. *All she asks is to know the truth of the world, the truth of consciousness.* His laugh rose higher and took on a self-pitying note. *Did it ever occur to you, Oathbreaker, that gaining understanding of reality may actually harm it? That some portion of your existence must remain unknown for any of this to have meaning?*

I hesitated at that. "What do you mean?"

*If you were to understand everything about life, the afterlife, and the purpose of existence, what would that leave you?*

"It'd be amazing to have true purpose," I told him, confused and angry. "What point does any of this have without it?"

He gave a bemused sigh. *And if you didn't like your purpose?*

I had no response but a taken-aback gulp.

*If your purpose was meaningless, or even horrible, what then? Could you ever experience anything but hopelessness?*

"Are you saying the purpose of existence is horrible?" I asked, standing taller out of apprehension.

*I'm saying nothing. I'm simply posing questions.*

"And wait. Hopelessnesswhy was one of your lieutenants named Hope?"

*Death is Hope.*

"That's absurd!"

*Death is Peace, too. And Death is Evolution. These are all just aspects of the same. Death is not a curse sent to punish you. It is through me that anything you experience has meaning.*

What was the Empire term for this? "Bullshit."
 
*I'll make you a deal right now. Immortality for you and your loved ones if you leave now. You will never die. What do you think of that?*

The drumbeats were growing more rapid and more desperate behind me as I looked to Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia. They shook their heads, reminding me of the sacrifice they'd madethe sacrifice everyone had madeto get me here.

I stepped forward. "**No compromise!**"

*Fool,* Death sighed. *I'm trying to make a point, and all you can think about is fighting and warfare. Would you enjoy living forever?*

I paused with my sword held up; blue flames coursed along it, but I was not so sure. Multiple people in my life had warned me that immortality did strange things to the human mind and soul, and, as I stood there facing Death himself in his last bastion, I realized that I didn't want forever. I just wanted enough time to live my life and make my choices. If I lived forever, my relationships would eventually dissolve, and I would spend centuries staring at the ceiling like Conrador even, one day, celebrating the destruction of my world like Cristina's people had done in the streets instead of fighting to survive. I would pray for Death to fall from the sky if only to escape the mundanity of living one more moment.

*Love only has meaning because you have limited time,* Death continued. *You're choosing to spend your limited existence with certain people; partners, family, your siblings in arms. Giving someone part of a limitless resource would mean nothing.* He looked to my comrades, and then back to me as the light and dark void behind us filled with the fires of war. *And I happen to understand that you personally are fueled by Love in all its forms. If you slay me, among other things Love will cease to exist for you and your people, and you will become nothing.*

The blue fire of my soul burned, but had no outlet. He was not wrong, but"I can't compromise. I can't let you take what matters to me."

*You've already damaged half the mechanisms and broken all the safeguards,* Death whispered with very human passion. *You don't understand what you're doing, and I can't tell you. I would if I could. I have pity for your situationfor all of you caught in the cycles of Timebut* **I can't help you.** *I'm just doing my job. You've come to hate me and blame me for all your pains, but I promise you I am just one of countless systems and energies that help you exist and have meaning at all. I am not the end, and cutting out so vital a part of yourself is not going to help you.*

Tears were running down my face then, for something had shifted inside me, the weight of some decision beyond articulation, and I knew I couldn't do it. I let my sword drop to touch obsidian. "I can't just leave. Not after all this. How long has it been?"

He relaxed his tense stance somewhat. *By a measure of coherent dream-time, the war took seventeen million years.*

My heart seized. "What?! Are all my"

*No. Time here is different, and measured subjectively. In your three plus one dimensions, you're just about to hit the ground.*

"So I'm dead anyway then," I said bitterly, fighting back sorrow.

*Don't be ridiculous,* he told me, now fully certain that I was truthfully standing down. *Just fly, Oathbreaker.*

"You keep saying that word. What oath am I breaking by being here?"

*Long ago, your people were instrumental in*

He never finished his words. A beam of searing white light burned through all our shards and eras at once, bringing destruction and damage beyond understanding; its brightness was such that I could see all the way back to the Restless Hedrons and the black wall at its infinite reaches. The beam bored into that endless darkness, and, beyond belief, erupted straight through. Someone somewhere had channeled immense energies into the higher dimensionsand broken the veil. I'd distracted Death and broken his safeguards and mechanisms. Had I helped this disaster happen?

All the realms that we had fought our way through began to shake; the souls of Amber fled as they must, the forces of Death scattered, and landscapes and skies began to collapse in great sprays of metaphysical matter and energy. Under my feet, obsidian began to crack.

*Go!* Death shouted. *Go while you can! You know what you need to do!*

Astonished and terrified, I turned to clasp Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia one last time before they fled back to the grey plains of wasting where their souls needed to pass on. It was a sorrowful parting, but I'd gotten to see them again. One wish, screamed at the wall of a well while in pain and despair, *had* been granted. It had not all been for nothing.

Death was gone, and his fortress was crumbling. I jumped.

And I awoke, soaring lightly to the groundreal ground. I could still feel the higher realms suffering catastrophic damage, but I was caught in the fugue of a dream ended. Where was I? When was I? I slowly began to remember as that other life faded. I'd crossed whole realms rapidly and slowly, and I'dI'd gotten to see them again. I breathed deep the air of an unknown but physical Earth. I had to find my way back to my living fellows, and I had to warn them. Something had gone terribly wrong in the metaphysical planes of human existence, and I had a very strong suspicion I knew who was responsible. In her blundering and forceful technological manner, Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind had exploded open the black veil, and there was a very great trial ahead of us because of what she had done.

As I returned to my waking senses and began taking in my surroundings, I forgot to wonder exactly how it was that I'd managed to safely reach the ground.

To avoid spoilers, I'll say it this way: if you're interested in having these questions directly answered, mentions are peppered throughout earlier stories, and/or you can check out [Humanity Revived Part Five](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/4cn26q/humanity_revived_part_five/) and you might know Heath when you see him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the heads up on the AMA post going archived. I may renew that or do something else to replace it.

I've got diverse opinions about religion and humanity; what Venita questions in The Grey Riders is just one possible viewpoint. I tend toward optimism and faith in our fellow human beings, and I'm pretty sure I came to those stances because I grew up watching aspirational science fiction like Star Trek: The Next Generation, Babylon 5, the Twilight Zone, and the like. My dad also had a huge library of sci fi books that often disagreed with one another but all had the same underlying belief that smart and dedicated human beings could eventually accomplish anything. That may not seem true if we look at the day-to-day craziness going on in the world, but on the whole, the scope of history shows that the human race always moves forward. I like that. Religion *has* been used as a tool of social control in the past, but so has every institution at one time or another. Ultimately, the major questions of our existence are still important and still relevant, and probably always will be. Otherwise, why are we even bothering? :) </TEXT>

What does dying feel like? It's soaring. It's flying. Arms spread wide, eyes closed, you don't lookbecause you don't need to see. On my back in a roaring cocoon of air, all emotions suspended in a timeless moment of pure calm and regret and nostalgia and love and determination, I fell in the same position in which we had first found Cristina on the cross. Once, as a child, I'd floated down a river on my back with arms spread; I'd hoped to be taken to places new and unknown to escape my life, and now that wish was being granted. The rushing veil of wind lifted my unkempt hair away from my face and I opened my eyes. 

I've been losing touch with my childhood pains for quite some time, and thus I find myself standing in a quiet poster-lined hallway rather than in the movie theater itself. The carpet is that old faded red I remember so well, for I was far closer to the ground back then. At some point in my life, I stopped really looking at carpet patterns and sidewalk grasses and roots in the path ahead. Now, nearing my end, I wish I'd kept up the habit. There is *so much beauty* in every single fractal detail of existence; enough to make ignoring even the slightest natural artwork a tragedy.

But I came here for a reason. The theater is empty save for a haunting shadow that lurks in the corner watching me, so I angle past the concessions stand and out the front doors. The glass showed only white light, but I emerge onto a beach the color of dancing fire. Red and orange sand angles down beneath my boots toward a vivid blue ocean under a strikingly clear sky. On the horizon to my left I sight a high stone wall like that of an ancient city; just behind me, a tilted stone head twice the height of a person sits gazing unblinking across the sea. I take in all of this on the first look around. The second reveals the object of my search to me. He is sitting in the fiery sand directly ahead, arms around his knees. Like the weathered stone face, he, too, watches the bright ocean horizon. "Heath!"

He stands suddenly, and I feel some measure of relief at seeing his kind smile and crooked nose again. He approaches across the sand from a distance, but somehow immediately steps close. "How on Earth are you here?"

"There's not much time," I tell him, my relief turning to cold iron. "I'm falling. I need to understand what these realms are, what Death is, and how to stop it. You told me during the Time of Sickness, when I nearly drowned in a well, that you had met Death. Can you take me to it?"

"Falling?" he asks, concerned.

I reiterate, "Falling." For a brief moment, the sensations of life bleed through the curtain of perception.

He gives a compassionate frown. "Oh. I'm sorry."

"It won't matter if I'm successful. Time is short."

He looks around, noticing the growing rapidity of our environment. Blue waves subtly roll in faster, the wind picks up speed, and my heart races in my imagined chest. All these things move in rhythm, increasing. For some reason, this perturbs him, but he still seems willing. "Let's go." He grabs my wrist and begins running toward the distant city wall.

I go with him, acutely aware of the unheard sounds of a metaphorical clock made real ticking relentlessly faster and faster as I fall; as I run.

He shouts, "Open the gates!"and a massive ingress reveals itself as two enormous slabs of bronze slide apart. Crowds of blurry-faced denizens watch us pass with awe. I stare briefly at their obscured expressions, trying to understand how I know what they're feeling, but all I can make out are primarily brown clothes heavy with strips and patches of bright reds, yellows, and blues. One waves, but how would I recognize him even if I knew him?

Staring as we run past, I ask, "What is this place?"

"The unnamed city," he responds, pulling me along twisted alleyways made of tan stone. "We can't linger here."

Gazing up at gold and bronze trimmings along the edges of flat roofs speeding by, I ask, "The Unnamed City?"

"No. Not capitalized like that, since that would be a name." He looks left down one passage, then right along another. "This way! This unnamed city has infinite variants that coexist all at the same time. It is a place of urban dreams, and matches the layout of wherever you live for a short timebut if you stop moving anywhere but the gates or the docks, it'll change, and you'll get lost forever."

Indeed, the crowd around us begins running at great speeds, pushing us along like a jubilant and cheerful river of greetings and recognitions. Blurry hands point at me from windows and doors and balconies while countless distorted voices shout eagerly to one another about the newcomer in their midst.

"Have you been here before?" Heath asks as he turns sharply for a set of hewn tan stairs.

We run up and out of the dense flow; as I step thankfully onto a clear and flat roof, I respond, "No, have you?"

After leaping to the next roof, he says, "Yes... in another life."

Jumping from roof to roof, I shout over the growing wind, "You've said that before. What do you mean?"

"If I knew, I would tell you!" he yells back. "I've been places I shouldn't, seen things I wasn't supposed to know! I didn't go beyond the veil of Death like everyone elsebecause it thirsted for knowledge, and because it needed a willing and living human being to get here, a shadow of the primal essence of Hunger took me to these Dream Tessellations instead."

A shadow? Looking back over my shoulder, I see the watcher following us still. "Is that it? Is that the thing that brought you here?"

"No! My hungry friend got caught in a dodekeract; it was too literal-minded, and couldn't experience metaphorical existence and navigate surreality the way we can. It couldn't *dream.* No. The entity back there is something else, and has been following you as long as I've known you."

Ominous isn't a strong enough word. I realize that, even here, I am still at war. Surging ahead, I lend Heath some of my swiftness, and we speed over rooftops now blurring because of us rather than some natural property of the locale. The docks curve toward us along the slope of the world, and we leap down worn tan-brick stairs to reach the boats below.

"This is the hub of the Dream Tessellations," he explains, breathing hard. "These boats can sail out onto the ocean and go anywhere you can imagine."

Unfazed by the run thanks to the million hearts burning with mine, I ask, "Will this path take me to Death, or just an imagined version of him?"

Heath shrugs. "What's real in the back alleys of existence? What's real outside your own perceptions?"

That isn't good enough. "Did you imagine meeting your Death?"

Still recovering, he looks down for a moment. "No, I don't think so. It was definitely him." Looking back up at me, he says, "But that doesn't mean yours will be anything like mine. If it happens, it'll be a very personal experience open to lifetimes of interpretation and understandingand every culture has their own version of Death."

I don't quite understand, but I am not going to back down now. There can be no compromise. "No time for a boat. The horizon you say?"

He nods, and then points out across placid blue. "For what you seek, that way." After seeing me take a step forward, he adds, "Be careful. You can lose yourself in these realms. There are a million reflections of you out therethe people you could have been, the people you were, and the people you might beand not all of them are good people. Find the Truth, and you'll find your purpose. I did."

"Thank you." I give my strange friend a deep nod.

"Before you go," he says quickly. "Will you tell Cristina and Noah I'm alright?"

That stops me in my tracks despite the trembling clock in my mind brimming with nervous energy. "You know them?"

"We never met in person, but if not for them, I would have been trapped forever, and I just" He cuts himself off and wipes a tear from under one eye. "Maybe they'll tell you about it sometime."

Despite the strangeness of my location and surroundings, I lower my guard to give him a hug. "I will tell them. Thank you for your guidance."

He nods. "Of course. It's who I am to help you, just like it's who you are to do what you're about to do. Last time we met, I remembered some of my life from about eight centuries ago and I tried to warn you about waking Conradbut that was not my role, just like it's not my role to advise against your duel with Death." He sighs. "Stay by Cristina's side, will you? She'll need your support to stay the course. All of existence is at stake. I just don't know how yet. Does any of this make sense?"

A genuine laugh escapes my throat, and, for a moment, I forget my overwhelming rush. In the formal, I tell him, "No. Not in the slightest, friend."

"You're a nice person," he murmurs, understanding me despite my shift in language. "I've missed having someone living around to talk to. If you'd been here, maybe I could have made sense of the strange things I've learned in my eons spent wandering the Tessellations. Please remember these words, for giving you this may be the last real thing I do: the Lovers circle opposite around a vast whirlpool of warm red water; they seek each other, but neither can see the other, save for a single message in a bottle that bobs hopefully in the heat. The Ruthless Parent, denied her child, cracks an orb of gold and spills hatred and bitterness into a massive white whirlpool of light. And the Survivor walks across his prison cell in a single step, but it takes all eternity; he arrives enlightened, but a black whirlpool awaits to steal away everything he ever knew."

The shadow lurking around the corner behind us stares; I try to memorize every word. "What's it mean?"

He shakes his head. "I don't know exactly. I saw these images when I sought the Truth. My Death, before he faded away, warned me that the fury of Life's conflict will escalate until all of existence is in danger. I fear we may be in the final cycle of Time, and I think Cristina will need your help to avoid being part of the problem."

I think of her kindness and motherly warmth; I think of the fires of war that burn inside her, and I think of her coldly militant heart. She did not order the attack on the Enemy to be halted as she'd promised me in private, but she'd certainly secured the list of Finders to seek out her lost family members. I sense deep pain in her, and that ruthlessness to protect the ones I love also exists in me, so"I understand."

He flashes a sad smile. "Go."

The ticking clock surges back like a graceful punch, and with its force I soar out onto the water, running along the waves like so many raised footholds. I see quickly that the horizon he spoke of is a literal thing; speeding toward the approaching blue wall of airy light, I look back to see him receding in the distance. He stands on the dock and raises a fist in a silent cheer once. At that, I understand that I will never see the kind man with the crooked nose againnot even in the realms of Death after Life, for he will not be travelling that direction with the rest of us.

The sky hits, and I sail through heat and light, arms wide like imaginary wings. Alone for the first time, it dawns upon me that glorious other worlds and other forms of consciousness *do* exist. What wonders abound in the Dream Tessellations? There are peoples here; cities, streets, docks. There are beaches, oceans, and skies. My kind friend with the crooked nose met one of the forms of Death in person. Am I one step closer to the afterlife here? To the Truth of existence?

Could I meet one of the forms of God here? Gods, entities, overseers, the lot? I only learned of these concepts moments ago by the measure of my life's span, and yet here I am, soaring through open blue in the realms of the mind on my way to challenge Death. What secrets does the vast sea of existence hold for us tiny creatures? Could we one day fight our way to the surface and see reality for what it is truly is?

The fire of a million human hopes burns in a layer just below this one. That energy is my grounding, my footing, and my strength. I blaze along roiling white energy toward a limitless realm of darkness. Somewhere, my physical body is still falling, but I must ignore that dread and press on. The shadow behind me mirrors that fear, always following, but never interfering.

I feel it. I am closer to the tide of fatigue and loss that comes from injury. I am closer to Death.

My leaping run changes tone as I land and slide across smooth obsidian. The ocean is gone, the light is gone, and only darkness reigns. Tremendous drumbeats echo to infinity as black monoliths rise slowly from the landscape in every direction. Is my presence known? The world reacts to me, but not with intent. Bracing as smooth black glass trembles beneath me, I remain vigilant for attack as I risebut none comes.

I have never felt smaller. In the enormity of this realm, I am but a blue spark upon endless void; I run, but I am so small that I hardly move in relative terms. The currents in the darkness take me into that vast realm, and I am no different than the othersand there *are* others. My living heart beats with the incomprehensible horror of eons as I stumble my way through the pitch among ashen and expressionless faces. I've seen this before. I've seen Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia like this as they sat in that movie theater of my mind while I brushed Death; they watched the play of my life with white faces, thin lips, and unfeeling eyes. Countless faces like theirs pass in the dark as their bearers drift toward their destination.

It is cold, and panic burns through me. "Wake up!"

Silent moving monoliths the size of planets rearrange themselves in repeating geometric patterns. The dead, with their organic uneven faces, do not respond. I push at a grim woman of about forty, but she ignores my touch and continues plodding on. I grab the arm of a young man in his twenties, but his limb bursts into dust, and he continues mindlessly walking along glassy obsidian.

Death lies ahead. They walk towards an impossibly massive black wall on the horizon without hesitation, slaves to their loss of will. Something in me knows that the wall is not solid. Worse, it is a passable membrane, and unknown horrors beyond imagination await on the other side. None can return.

"Stop!" I scream at them and lay about with my fists, but my attacks have no effect. "Don't do it! Don't go! Don't! Stop, *please!*"

The scope is beyond comprehension. Millions trudge to their dissolutions in darkness; those that recently died, and those about to die. Time is blurred in this twilit realm. Their faces, their hollow expressions, leave their lives open like a litany of events. Bad people, good people, unremarkable people; all drift past in endless procession. There, a man from Amber Eight, who died when it exploded. There, a refugee girl and her parents who will die in a battle we have yet to fight against Her Glory Enraged. There, an old woman from the now-destroyed First World, dying of hunger on her exodus from the Empire. Everywhere I look, more lost souls moving into gloom. This is the correct place. This is the correct realm of Death. I've found itwhat now?

I feel stupid. Foolish. What did I expect? That Death would be a humanoid man that I could fight with my sword? I am nothing compared to the sheer size and scope of the worlds, realms, and layers of existence. My voice is nothing to the endless procession of ashen faces. "Stop! *Please!* Don't go!" Falling to my knees on obsidian, I can't help but sob. The massive drumbeat of the grinding black monoliths and the boundless silence of Death make all I am and all I have nothing but foolishness. I am going to lose everything and everyone I love and there is nothing I can do.

"Venita?"

On my feet, I look around in surprise. A smiling old man approaches, and I almost don't recognize him for all the time I've been away. "Grandfather?" Chill grips me. "What are you doing here?"

"Oh, just having a bad dream," he tells me, laughing and dismissing my fears. Gazing up at the clockwork sky of shifting obsidian cubes, he grimaces. "Quite the nightmarish place you've found to sob in."

Coughing awkwardly and wiping away my tears, I regard him for a moment before recognizing the truth of who he is. He hugs me back with force, and I tell him, "How do I move forward? How does anything matter in the face of *this?*"

He lets off our hug and then holds up my wrist to show me the silver bracelet still upon it. "You see this? This is a promise. You may not know the little girl that gave it to you after you saved her life, you may not be friends, and you may not see her again, but this is what we do for each other. We remember, and we care." He gazes ahead at the infinite black wall. "That may lie ahead of us always and it may consume us all eventually, but it can never take away what we are. It will never *understand,* therefore it can never truly suppress us."

Mystified, I ask, "Grandfather... do you know what Death is?"

Quite serious, he nods. "Of course, granddaughter of mine, and it is nothing to be worried about in the slightest." He raises his arms and enters a mock combat stance. "For it can never touch those of us who come from a line of ancient heroes!"

All the pain of my own smallness fades as the giggle overtakes me. "Grandfather, stop!" My laugh only deepens as he continues making funny faces and acting out his tales. "Now's not the time for a story!"

"On the *contrary!*" he shouts. "Now is the perfect time to tell you of our ancestors yet again in the form of an incredibly long and convoluted yarn with no clear meaning. In that way, it is Life's tale! Just like us, it never ends. It just begins again!" He leans close. "Also, a strange little shadow is following us, and I hoped to confuse it."

"You see it too?" I glance back at it briefly. "It's been following me for a very long time."

My grandfather flashes it a sour frown. "Peeping tom." Turning toward the great Wall again, he spies a very different approaching form. His humor fades completely for the first time that I've ever seen. "You've come seeking trouble, my granddaughter, and I believe you've found it."

The spark of pure darkness approaches on a foul wind at terrifying speed. The drumbeat of the black realm deepens as it sweeps forth. In moments, it comes to a sudden halt high in the open air above us, and I see that it is the silhouette of a man; its cloak ruffles in the breezes of its own approach. He slowly draws two swords made of unfathomable void, and his voice feels like the very concept of aging upon my ears. *Is this what you wanted?*

Struggling to stand against the waves of fatigue emanating from his mere presence, I shout, "Are you him? Are you Death?"

*I wasn't,* he responds. *Until you called forth what you expected to see.*

Even as I form my multi-tool into a sword and hold it up defensively, I realize that the weapon is just a construct of my mindbut judging by the nature of these realms, I bet that it will perform much the same as the real thing. Facing the silhouette above, I demand, "You'd allow your enemy to choose your form?"

*It doesn't matter in the slightest to me. An endless wall, an inexhaustible opponentI could be a limitless fog if I really wanted to frustrate you. What would a poor little soldier like you do against an enemy you couldn't even hit?*

I ready for a fight and glare. "Arrogant."

*No arrogance. Even existing as a singular entity or as an 'I' is a temporary condition created just for you; to crush your pitiful hopes. You are nothing but dust in Time's eye.*

Why all the focus on demoralization? Waitdo I actually have a chance? Why would Death bother attempting to attack my morale? If I am the Sixth Millennial, do I actually have the ability to cause real change in the higher layers of existence? Instead of crushing me, his words have given me a sudden surge of hope. "Then come at me, and we'll see."

The cloaked silhouette floats down with both swords open and waiting.

My pulse races dangerously in my awareness, and I let it churn blue fire through my every fiber.

He brings one sword up and slowly angles it down towards me.

I watch it warily.

My grandfather's shout reaches my ears: "Venita! Look out!"

It is only that warning that gives me the instinct to brace. Death's sword gently taps my weaponand the force beyond the contact is like a hurricane detonation in my face. Obsidian glass tears away from the monolith at my feet, and I nearly fall with the pain that rips through my limbs. I should have expected it, but the realityit'she's*impossibly* strong!

The second strike is swifter, and I leap back to avoid the explosion of volcanic glass. The monoliths are rearranging faster now, responding in the same way the environment did to my sense of Time at the fire-sand beach, and I have to take every advantage I can get. The next one is rising, and I use it to gain height; he strikes not at me, but at its sheer side, and the monolith ruptures underneath me as I jump to the next rising surface.

His icy whisper reaches my ears from every direction. *Feel free to give up and run.*

I give no credence to his words. Instead, breathing hard, I desperately seek a strategy. Waitcould Iit's all metaphorical, but it's also real. Human hopes are *real.* I can feel that fire churning like a star inside my heart. Instead of letting it burn wildly within, what if I channeled it? Gathering up a burst, I wait until Death floats closerand then jump forward and set my sword ablaze. The flaming blade cleaves bright blue through the air.

Death pulls back, aghast. A slight nick on his left arm glows bright from where I caught him, and drops of infinite blackness fall to shattered obsidian far below. His unseen stare became intense; he spits, *Oathbreaker!*

I hold my blazing sword at the ready, wary of another play. "What?"

*I just thought you a fool. Some do stray this way at times. But you? This is what you do with your sacred trust?*

"I don't know what that means! I don't know what *any of this* means!" The righteous fire within becomes painfully hot as I let it forth. "I'm *tired* of meaning being held back from me. I want to *know*. I want to know if God or Gods exist. I want to know what happens after death. I want to know what these dream realms are." My final words come with the roar of a million desires. "**Tell me the truth of existence!**"

Shaken, the cloaked silhouette turnsand shoots away at incredible speed.

My grandfather calls up, "Is this what you want, my granddaughter?"

"It's not good enough," I shout back. "We deserve better than what we've been given. All of us!"

"I always was proud of you." Even at that great distance, I can see his smile. "Go. Finish it. I'll be fine."

What does he mean? I hadn't even thought aboutno, I shouldn't get distracted. Death is creating a great distance between us as he speeds toward the Wall. "How can I possibly catch up to him?"

"My last piece of advice, granddaughter. You were born for this in more ways than you know. When all this is done, find your father and ask him." Far below, he makes an opening motion with his arms. "Stop holding yourself back. You'll know."

The drumbeat of this realm is matched only by the beat of battle in my chest, and I suddenly understand that they are one and the same. Death, life, heartbeat, perceptionall the same. I've trained all my life for the proper mentality for this fight, and I've earned it by fire and then some. To take on the ultimate enemyyes.

Yes.

Jumping from my high obsidian perch, I let go of the constraints I've put upon myself by holding on. The people I love will still accept me. Of this, I am certain. Only their opinion matters, and their support is with me at all times. In many ways a mirror of my falling position in the real world, this time I face the open air with purpose, spreading my arms in the manner of a dreambut a dream it is not. The curve of force catches me and takes me up. Rather than falling, I shoot forward, suddenly in pursuit of the fleeing personification of Death.

I don't have to look back; I know. They've always been there, but I was too terrified of standing out or being different to face the fact that I am not like other people. Here in the metaphorical realms of the Dream Tessellation, filled with the energy of countless hopes and beloved by the best people I've ever known, I can finally be myself. Like the multi-tool, this new part of me is an extension of my will, and this time I am not just running fast. I am truly flying. Burning sword held forward, I close with Death himself on wide wings of blazing blue fire.

	<TEXT> Thanks for your kind words! They're very motivating in the final crunch hours before the next chapter :)

 On a side note, I think this will link up with The Beast's Realm, or the violin notes of time are just an easter egg. Is Venita's "friend' the protagonist who now spends eternity aiding other species in their final journey? Is The Beast's Realm canon for the multiverse?

The fall wasn't far, but I might as well have leapt into another reality. The landscape held the same organic-mechanical tenor as below, but I was high on the sphere of the world and the slope ahead glinted silver with the glow of open blue sky that was visible through the yellow smog only here. It was easier to breathe, too, despite the thinness. Choking tendrils of pollution pooled around my boots, but no higher.

Tilting my visor up momentarily to better scan my intended path, I asked over the radio in my helmet, "How far?"

Flavia's determined voice echoed in my ears. "You have to get the overloading core deep enough in the next eleven minutes that the spheres can't carry it back out again before the explosion."

"Oh, is that all?" I tried to sound humored, but she and I both knew this was likely a suicide mission.

Her reply was calm, and anyone else would have believed her free of sorrow and anxiety. "There are many variables you'll have to manage if we lose contactthe time left until the explosion, the depth you can reach, the speed of the spheres, and your own path back out."

Celcus added, "There's an entrance above you at about two o'clock. You can't miss it."

I willed my multi-tool to move up and strap the sapphire core to my back to better maintain my balance. The core was not yet hot, but the humming translating through the grip of my multi-tool shot a bolt of heat right into my ribcage. With that urgency now part of me, I took off upwards between the smooth silvery hillocks of the artificially grown surface. The beat of the fleeing helicopter's blades and the slapping of my boots on metal were the only sounds to penetrate my helmet, for I was far too high to hear the slaughter underneath the floating mountain.

Or, perhaps, the slaughter had stopped as the continental chunk began reacting to my presence. I quickly found that I wasn't imagining it: the angle really was steepening.

Flavia's shout confirmed it: "It's turning to try to shake you off." And worse: "The spheres are rising up to pursue you!"

The vast semi-circular gap Celcus had indicated became visible in the steel ahead, and I poured increasing energy into overcoming the growing resistance of gravity. I didn't want to, but I had to spare breath for the question. "How many?"

"*All of them!*"

Thick pillars of darkness rose from roiling yellow as tens of thousands of black dots swarmed upward to defend their last command bastion. These arteries of death soared high above and then curved back down, seeking me among the thick rivers of yellow smog flowing down the mountainside.

I'd once held on for dear life as my world had Rotated such that the very ground we walked on had become a cliff; that experience prevented my inner animal from panicking while the ground neared sheer. Gripping sharp angles with my gloved hands, I continued to climb even as that lethal flatness approached, and I shouted in angry triumph as I managed to pull myself up into the floor of the tunnel at nearly the last possible moment. The corrugated metal here was still angling upward, but now I had a chance to run again, and I made my way into deeper veins before I could be thrown out into the open air. Left once, right once, and I knew that the slope I had just climbed was now upside down unseen. "I won't make it that easy, you bastard!"

The mountain rumbled as if it'd heard me.

Flavia's signal was weaker, but still audible. "The forces on the ground have stopped attacking. It seems you've got the full attention of the artificial intelligence." I heard her turn to Celcus and ask, "Was this carrier ship at the back or otherwise protected by the others?" She made a noise of understanding before her tone tilted back toward me. "Venita!"

As I ran down dark twisting tunnels lit only by yellow and cyan biomechanical luminescence, my vindictive opportunity for violence almost made me feel like grinning. Almost. "It's here, isn't it?"

"I believe so. It was another misdirect," she reasoned in my ear. "It's easy for enemies to assume the defense control mechanism is in the giant Shielded fortress. But it's actually safer mobileor at least it *was*, until we blew up its entourage. We should have guessed by the more rapid reactivity of this ship in generating defenses."

I didn't have the breath to agree or disagree. "Are the spheres inside?"

Her excitement for analysis faded in favor of the grim truth. "They're entering now. All access pathways. They don't seem to know exactly where you are."

Of course. Why would it have extensive sensors inside itself when the spheres were usually its eyes and ears? Running a helical path as gravity's pull constantly rotated, I came to a split junction and chose the way that led deeper into the bowels of the beast. That realization about this place's structure hit home: this was no longer a battle of military might, but of intellect and logic. Which moves and countermoves would lead us to victory? At that moment more than ever, I was eminently thankful I had Flavia in my life. Her radio signal was fading, but she would still be with me. Summoning up her essence, I began breaking down the path ahead into a complex series of critical decisions.

The path ahead, the nature of the Enemy, the rotating logistical axes of the mountain itself, the various purposes of the tunnels I was running through, and moreher mind was amazing in its strangeness, and it was only then that I understood her permanent tactical calm and apparent coldness to those outside our team. She'd learned to accept on faith that we few loved her, but everyone else mystified her.

Not so the Enemy. She intimately understood its logical machinations as if she and it were brethren at odds. That meant her perspective was the best weapon I had for this conflict. It also meant I knew for sure that the Enemy was going to harm me very badly before this was over. It had absolutely no moral reservations, and I was a threat to what it cared about. In that viciousness, we were equally charged.

She said something further, but Flavia's voice reached me as nothing but static. I was alone.

The tunnel opened into a tremendous hangar-like cave filled with dimly lit racks intended for un-launched spheres. The rows were empty, but, looking high and behind me, I saw the first wave of a cloud of them entering through another tunnel. The game had begun in earnest. It was time to run.

I clenched my hands ahead as if to claw the very air for handholds. Like a nightmarish dream, I needed all the acceleration I could get, and an enemy really *was* giving chase. On flat ground and thinking of Porcia's fleet steps, my speed reached half again, then double; flaring adrenaline mixed with pulsing blue fire in my limbs. This was it. This was the deciding run of the war. Everyone I cared about would die and my home would be destroyed if I failed, and, if I succeeded, they would get to go home and live. I wasn't flying, but reaching *three times my normal running speed* through the swiftly angling hangar and into a wide tunnel had begun to feel like soaring. I'd never gone this fast and my awareness was blazing with exertion, but it was still only barely enough to outrun the cloud of death whirling down the cyan-and-yellow-lit vein behind me. I could hear what Flavia would have said: *Don't stop moving for anything. Don't stop moving even for a split second.*

More than just rotating now, the cybernetic mountain began shaking, and a circular four-part hatch started to circle closed ahead. Drawing in a gasping breath, I let the world shift blue in a massive spike of adrenaline. Slowed drastically, now I really was grasping at the air itself for leverageno, not the air, but the space beneath it. The door ahead and the spheres behind were all moving at a crawl in sync with my slow-motion limbs, and that gave me time to claw my way forward through the dream-like sluggishness and use my tripled momentum in a single desperate gymnastic leap. The closing blades of the hatch scraped my fluttering jacket, but I looked back as I floated through and carefully angled my knees and boots to slip past with a hair's breadth to spare.

I hit the steel ground hard and lost my breath and control for a brief moment; blinking white and neon glows snapped back from blue as the normal flow of time resumed. The hatch began opening again, but the delay had cost the Enemy. I was off again, this time down one of four tunnels unseen. It would have to split the chase. How much time was left?

Eight minutes.

I'd already used three minutes just to get beyond the outer layer.

Soaring through wide tunnels filled with rougher and more exposed machinery, I took in all the visual information I could, trying to guess at where these internal mechanisms might lead. If I could get right to the center, I could

I willed the shaking sapphire core to drop under one arm while the multi-tool came up in the form of a sword. My first slice took out the lead ambushing sphere that came from the left, and a swipe to the right cut the next in twain. The sword melted away and returned the core to my back, and I was away from the pursuing cloud down the rotating cybernetic vein at a speed they couldn't hope to match.

*Was this actually going to work?*

Seven minutes.

I pulled out all the stops in my heart, and flames crackled out the ends of my nerves and along my skin.

Four times my usual running speed.

Logistical movements, footfalls, the rotating corridor, and the visible path ahead melded into one continuous flight at a speed that would have terrified me had I not been willing to give up everything to make sure these monsters didn't get to have the ones I loved.

Six minutesand I emerged into an enormous cavern with its own yellow haze and enormous pillars of technology jutting at every angle to support a mountain within the mountain; a second core, and this one with its own shimmering spherical Shield. I refused to let my heart sink as I realized that an explosion out here would not guarantee destruction. This just meant that I had to get... inside.

I flew down the curve of the inner cavern intent on reaching one of those pillars and running down its length to the central heart, for gravity in this spinning labyrinth had ceased to have all meaning. Any pillar would do as long as I could circle it properly. Spheres swarmed in from dozens of tunnels, but this place was gigantic, and they were too far away to stop me. What else could it possibly do? It'd taken roughly half of the eleven minutes to get here, and that meantsince I knew the wayI could get back out just in time.

But this close, and as the Enemy's sole focus, it was far more capable in reacting than we'd given it credit for. As I reached the base of a pillar and began running down it, huge holographic projections appeared as rectangles in the air all around the cavern. They were not weaponsworse. They were all displaying *me* from different angles.

My beloved's voice sounded in my helmet mid-sentence. "happening?"

"Flavia?" I involuntarily slowed to only three times my normal speed.

"Venita?" she shouted over the suddenly coherent radio. "What's going on? There are giant projections in the sky out here!" 

Aghast, Celcus said, "It's making us watch... why would it do that?"

"To demoralize us?" Flavia reasoned. "Wait. Could it possibly"

No! How could it have known? Suddenly flush with embarrassment, I began slowing further. Partially losing track of all the gravitational and rotational variables, I started to second-guess my footing, and I nearly fell. Other voices reached the radio, and I knew for certain that the Enemy was routing them to me on purpose.

"Who's that girl?"

"That's the redhead in the jade armor!"

"What's she doing? Where is that?"

"Is that a bomb on her back? It's glowing like a bomb!"

"Is she in the mountain?"

"Jesus Christ, what's happening?!"

Weighed down by the attention of a million sets of eyes, I... stopped. It was an instinctual reaction I'd had my entire life, instilled in me by upbringing, culture, and personal preference, and the Enemy had somehow observed me enough on Amber Three, at the factory we'd taken, and here on its homeworld to know how to strike me where it really hurt: I didn't want to stand out.

But I was no fool. I used my military training to force myself to begin moving again. I was not nearly as fast, and I couldn't properly summon the essences of others I needed, but I refused to die standing still. Every moment I wasted was another for the spheres to close the gap. Dozens of alternating voices shouted over my radio, commenting on every single thing I was doing with hope or terror. The pressure of their awareness was like a binding clamp on the blue fire in my heart, and I moved forward only with struggle.

Conrad's voice cut through the storm. "Everybody shut the hell up!"

Silence suddenly reigned.

"This is the moment," he said, speaking directly to me from distances unknown as I stumbled along the thick technological bridge. "Venita, I gave you that jade armor you're wearing to make you stand out; to create a point of hope for these men to rally around in a time of desperation. This is that time. You can never again hide in the crowd. You can never again go unseen. It *is* a curse, but also a blessing. You must decide to take strength from those who believe in you. You must decide to eschew embarrassment. Believe in us believing in you."

Five minutes. I was losing precious portions of my escape time, and the spheres were upon me.

Reaching the edge of the curved Shield, I slung the sapphire core under one arm again and lashed out with my suddenly formed sword. Keening the song of time up to that single high note, I blue-shifted the yellow fog green, and I struck left, right, up; leapt back, thrust the sword through two slowly-moving spheres, and exploded another with a forceful slash.

I held the moment as long as I could; green haze shifted back to yellow, and I pulled that particular fabric back again, slowing everything in my awareness for another desperate melee. The first wave of spheres ruptured and fell in succession to surprised shouts and radioed cheers. To them, it had all happened in a mere instant, a dance of destruction blinding in its apparent elegance and swiftness.

The rotation of my environment continued until I was forced to step onto the spherical Shield itself. From that moment on I continually moved to stay on top of the shimmering glassy surface lest I slip and fall.

Four minutes.

My rapidly recalculating mental plans began to shorten as I gave up on the idea of escaping after the job was done.

And still, all I could think about were the eyes upon me; those shouted cheers, those men and women analyzing my every move. The only time in my life that I had not felt this way had been during that race against Conrad. They'd all been watching from the hill, but it hadn't bothered me. Why?

Because the outcome had mattered, and I was the only one who could do it?

No.

Because my family had been watching. It was as Conrad had said: they'd believed in me, and I'd believed in their choice to do so.

I could hear themand Flavia had responded, which meant *they* could hear *me*. "Help me," I forced myself to whimper, fighting back an overwhelming rush of anxiety at speaking so to the crowd. Even more than the physical exertion I'd undergone, this pushed my pulse to near lethal rapidity.

Conrad directed those million voices one more time. "Help her!" he shouted on all channels. "She's special. Give her your support! Envision yourself giving her your skills, your strength, your all!"

Three minutes.

Falling to my hands and knees on the curve of that shimmering that so resembled the skies of my youth, I collapsed under the weight of all that had been heaped upon me. The expectations were one thing, but I'd been assaulted by back-breaking traumas of every kind during my unwilling journey from my home, and I didn't *feel* like any sort of legendary thousand-year heroine. Conrad had built me up for his own power-grabbing purposes, but I had nothing left to give.

"What are you doing?"

The tone of that question was humored and almost a little mocking. It was Cristina, speaking for the first time somewhere that Conrad could hear. Did he know the sound of her voice? Would he connect the dots?

"Venita, stop holding yourself back. You've come all this way to save your family and your world. You've found the Enemy's castle, you've broken in, you've climbed the tower, and you're at the foot of his bed. Climb in and strangle the king. Finish the job. Who cares what people think of you if *we* love you?"

Something she'd once said to me about a public and private personas rang wordlessly through my head. Waitthe million below didn't know *me*. They knew a public version of me, the same way Conrad behaved one way in private and another when his followers were around.

There was no embarrassment. They weren't even looking at *me*. They were looking at the Sixth Millennial! And, more than that, they were willing all their strength and hope to that *other* redhead in jade armor on top of a Shield inside a mountain holding a giant bomb.

And it was real. Human emotions were real. I'd always imagined myself drawing azure power from some mental plane surging with emotional energy, but I'd thought it just a metaphor. No.

No.

It was coming.

It was a storm; a tidal wave. It was there, desperate to be employed.

Strata of existence seemed to separate themselves into finer distinctions as the vortex of fire surged down into me with the force of a hurricane. Was this a placebo effect? Was I just believing in myself because of them? Staring down at the Shield under my gloved hands and slowing time until the rapid shimmering became more comprehensible, I began to see the layered patterns that comprised it.

Raising a clenched hand in empowered blue, I brought my fist down between two of those seven vibrating layers. The force of my blow ruptured interwoven patterns, and I gripped the sides and pulled them apart while Time's violin note keened the absolute height of danger. Manually ripping open a hole in the Shield and diving inside just before the second wave of spheres reached me, I entered the core of the Enemy.

Two minutes.

Time quickened again, but I was alive with the hopes of a million men and women. A sharp citadel opened up ahead, and I ran into the spiky processing chambers with righteous intent to end this. There was no longer any chance I could escape, so the last two minutes would be a fight to defend the bomb itself.

A colossal expanded ball of interconnected cyan-lit nodes filled this spherical citadel, and I ran among them in search of the most vulnerable spot. A rectangular projection of me appeared here in a continuing attempt to demotivate me, but it no longer mattered.

Heat sinks opened their vents and fire blasted through the area, but I steeled myself against the pain and ran for the massive central nodethis one red. Trying another tactic, the Enemy vanquished the flames, sealed the doors, and sucked out all the air out of the room, but I just held my breath. It was too late for that now, and I continued charging.

One minute.

The doors opened and air rushed back into the room along with hundreds of spheres. This time, they stayed out of sword range, and instead opted for lancing dozens of spears at me one after another. I was a soldier of Amber Three, and I'd earned with a lifetime of training exactly the skills I needed to handle this. I actually *laughed* as I leapt, tumbled, dodged, and slashed my way through the sudden black thicket erupting all around me.

The sapphire core was shaking violently on my back and beginning to sear me with its heat while tiny ice crystals fell out of the air. If it followed the same principle as its shots, this explosion would be more than enough. Out of pure vindictive ire, I dashed across the last space between myself and the Enemy. I wanted to look it in the eye. I wanted it to know who had done this; who had brought revenge for the billions dead on my world. I wanted it to know that the people I cared about would *live,* and that was victory enough for me.

Spearing lances hemmed me in, thicker and thicker, until I was no longer able to move. I was still fifteen paces away, but it was close enough. Caught in place among hundreds of black spears, I stared the red lens of the Enemy core in the face.

They stabbed at me a few times, but sparking jade energy repelled the strikes. I laughed, and loudly. That would have worked if they'd caught me and had enough time to drain the armor's defense, but not now, not with seconds left.

I hoped that the soldiers below had been smart enough to beat a retreat. I'd done it. As one of them might have exclaimed, I'd *goddamn* done it. If they'd remained under the mountain to die when it fell, well, that was on them.

The spheres pulled at the core on my back until it came free, and they carried it out between myself and the red eye of the Enemy. What was it, fifteen seconds remaining? Ten? They had no options left. Just like Conrad had once told me in a disparaging monologue, there was nothing to negotiate with, nothing to hack, and nothing with which to plead. The sapphire core was just a bomb, just Deathand Death always had its way in the end.

Two voices cut through the radio chatter.

Flavia said with pain, "Venita!"

I was the only one who understood her and made her feel normal. "I'm sorry," I told her.

Celcus said with sorrow, "Damnit."

I was his other half. We'd been a pair from the moment we'd met. "I'm sorry," I told him.

And Sampson was already gone. I sent a silent wish to any and all entities that he might survive. It was a strange thing, learning about religion and afterlives and love and Death all mixed together on a surprise journey, but I was glad for it. Rather than a bland mass-produced product of the military caste, I'd gotten to become, in some small beginning part, the person I wanted to be. That was an exquisite luxury not common to those of my level of birth.

At five seconds left, I took in a gasp of air and kept Time's violin screeching its single high note of adrenaline. What was left to do now except wonder what existence after Death held? Was there really a God or Gods? If they were anything like my people, they would applaud what I had done here, for this was a good way to die. But were their congratulations enough? This life held so many more things I wanted to see and do and experience. I wanted to have more than just the beginnings of love. I wanted to learn, make mistakes, and grow. I wanted to make my own way, at least for a little while. This life was not good enough. Death was not a fair and just thing. God or Gods had failed in creating a worthy world.

I held that moment as long as I could, treasuring every continued moment of perception. It rushed out of me as a sigh, and time resumed. The sapphire core suddenly began screaming with the might of a contained sun, and I pulled at my barbed black bonds. The brimming energy was painfully bright, and I couldn't turn away.

At this last moment, spinning generators to either side cast a violet rectangle in spaceand the spheres carried the core through before it closed behind them. Staring in disbelief as silence fell, I realized the Enemy had opened up a portal and sent the bomb through.

What?

Seriously?

For a moment, I stared in dumbfounded amazement.

It'd been such a simple play; an obvious response. I'd been thinking at too high a level to see what the primitive intelligence had considered as a basic option.

And now the ones I loved were going to die. There was that unfair and unjust world rearing its ugly head again.

*No!*

Pulling dangerously on the vortex of blue fire still surging in the mental plane around me, I screamedand, thinking of Sampson's strength, tore my way right out of the wall of spears. Like the Shield had, space itself began making its various vibrations visible where the portal had been. The core was still *right here with us*, just on the other side of some number of paper-thin walls between realities. If I could just reach through

Forcing my way forward like some kind of rage-filled juggernaut while hundreds of spheres latched on to me and pulled with all their collective might, I stomped toward the spot where the violet rectangle had opened and I mashed my hands in between the layered patterns of space itself. Ethereal blue welled up around my wrists; gripping the violently shaking sun on the other side, I pulled with all the force my body, spirit, and million supporting soldiers had to offer.

And more than that. **No compromise.** Death as a concept was a cruel farce, and I refused to accept half-measures. Pushing my shoulder and head into upwelling ethereal blue, I rammed my way through blanketing layers of space with a scream of refusal; refusal to die, refusal to let cruelty win. The vortex of blue fire blazed through my every nerve, giving me the power to push myself *in* and pull the sapphire sun *out.* I spun with it ever so slowly like a deadly waltz partner, and, at the apex of our circle, I let it go to dance with the Enemy instead.

Surreal bonds snapped. Chilly air washed over me. I began falling, for we'd been at a high altitude, but at least I was falling through serene white and not sickly yellow.

And good that I fell, for space bubbled riotously above, destroying the spheres that had crossed here before me. Where the Enemy portal and my subsequent efforts had weakened the fabric of existence, the sapphire core's unheard explosion nearly broke throughnearly. The expanding after-image of an apocalypse in another reality receded into the clouds, and I soared away at speed.

I couldn't help but laugh. The last thing the Enemy's broadcast of me must have shown: the bomb reappearing and plopping to the ground by itself. Did the Enemy have a simulated face somewhere? I wondered what its expression must have been when its final play had been turned around so.

Too, I wondered what Flavia and Celcus must have thought when they'd seen me push into nothing and rotate out of reality like moving through a turnstile. They would know I'd survived the blast, but would they have any idea where?

And there was this matter of the horizon-to-horizon earth emerging from beyond the white below. Just a little fall without a parachute. I'd been here before, but this time I had no family to save me. I could have given in to panic again. I could have let myself black out, even. But the thing was, I'd made a decision in those final moments truly facing the end: no compromise. I didn't know where my military career would go; I didn't know where my romantic life would go; I didn't know if I'd even get to see my grandfather or drink a soda or take a bath again.

I did know that this life was cruel and unjust.

All of thisall this painwould be irrelevant without Death's cruel stare mocking us every moment of our lives.

There was no other way. Death itself had to be defeated.

I still had the strength of a million hearts burning in me, and I knew someone who had once met Death. My friend would take me to the Cruel One. Closing my eyes, I focused on my impending end and let that feeling guide me to the places of the dying mind and departing soul that I'd unwittingly visited multiple times before.

One last duel.
