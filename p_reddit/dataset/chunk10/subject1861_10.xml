	<TEXT> I wanted to roast some cherry tomatoes in the oven instead but they were out of stock, so had to make do with the usual tomato. It might not be enough meat for you but I was asking if anyone wanted to take some off my plate cause I was so full! (Someone else piled about 3 times more bacon than me onto their plate though, so there was enough food for seconds if you were worried). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't add hash browns or toast because I'm not a big eater and had trouble finishing the food as is (so it would be wasting food). As for black pudding, not a lot of my friends are into it so it would've been a waste to buy it and not have anyone eat it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a big eater and this was tough for me to finish - so adding carbs would just be a waste of food! Thanks for your compliments though :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During my first blood moon I thought that all the monsters would be zombies of monsters I previously killed, in a Walking Dead style. I thought that by going to sleep I could avoid the zombie monsters.  </TEXT>
