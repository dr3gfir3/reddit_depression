	<TEXT> Hello and thanks in advance.

I would like to know the proper code-name etc for the following:

The user selects/'highlights' a particular set of cells. They then click a macro assigned button, which runs it's code but based on the selectes/ 'highlighted' cell range. The cell range will change.

Thanks

	<TEXT> Cheeyah, but for the simpler material form creator excel. It was a combination of vlookup, recorded macro, row deletion based on empty cells etc.

For this one though I'm still trying to look up methods. Looking into combination of loops and index matching maybe. I just feel a bit overwhelmed with options and lack of experience.

I feel like there's a straightforward way of what I'm aiming for, that someone can clearly say "oh just have a do/while loop with a counter   also index match it this way" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Above is the theoretical Material sheet. 

I want the user to go  "I want the form for Order Number S-1", type in a marker somewhere maybe, and click a macro button, filling out the Form sheet with all of S-1's data.

The Form sheet is in the link below.
