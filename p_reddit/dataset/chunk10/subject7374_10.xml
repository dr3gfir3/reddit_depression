	<TEXT> ...did the pre-release footage and screenshots seem to promise a more exciting experience than the product we finally got?

Don't get me wrong; I love FFXV as it is now. Heck, most of us here had been waiting 10 and a half years for it. But look at all the stuff we were shown in those years!

There was that mech footage, the Behemoth in the parking garage, the Prompto gameplay shooting that bird, the party at the top of the building, the Dragoon (Aranea) introduction from the skies, the original Noctis VS Magitek troop assault outside the palace doors, the "tenfold/hundredfold" exchange between Ignis and Noctis, the Altissian hallway battle...you get the idea because you've more than likely seen all the stuff I have.

What do you think? If all the stuff shown in the pre-release footage and images had been included in the final product, would it have enhanced the experience in your opinion, or added too much to game?

I just think XV was shown to be a more excitingly-varied game than we got.

Stay classy, friends and fans. </TEXT>

He gets a furious call from his squadron leader on the ground saying "Get that plane back in the hangar NOW!"


So, the pilot flies down to the hangar but he doesn't land. He flies in one side of the hangar, comes out the other, turns around and does it again.


The squadron leader calls again and says "I told you to get that plane back in the hangar!"


The pilot replies "I had it in there twice! Why didn't someone shut the door while I was in there?" </TEXT>
