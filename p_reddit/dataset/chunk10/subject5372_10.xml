	<DATE> 2017-05-09 02:24:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a workbook in which I am trying to detail a recent trip to Gettysburg. I have pictures on imgur that link back to a map, but I haven't been able to get the pictures to load. It loads the first one, but it doesn't load any of the others. 

Is there an issue with tableau public I don't know about regarding this? It seems to work fine in the workbook.

Note: I have only uploaded day one pictures. That is why the URL is blank for the other fields.

I have included the link below. The workbook is available for download.

	<TEXT> Source: General Social Survey

Tool: Tableau

The data from this visualization comes from the General Social Survey (GSS). The survey is an interviewer based survey that is conducted biannually by NORC at the University of Chicago. If you would like to learn more about NORC and the GSS you can find their webpage at [http://gss.norc.org/](http://gss.norc.org/).

I was able to gather the data from GSS Data Explorer, which allows you to access all the data gathered by the GSS since 1972. This question is variable, relpersn which was gathered in 1998 and then from 2006  2016.

Once the data was gathered I used Tableau to visualize it. I used the WTSSALL variable to weight the data. I excluded the data from 1998 because I thought it was too far removed from the rest of the time series. If you have any questions, comment or tweet at us using the links below. </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau

In this data visualization, we use Tableau to determine if there is a relationship between political party preference and educational attainment. I gathered data from Wikipedia about partisanship and used the Cook Partisan Voting Index to represent political party preference numerically. I then gathered information on educational attainment from the Census Bureaus API for the 2015 American Community Survey. More detailed information is available in the data visualization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems that there has been some confusion about the graphic and I am sorry about that I wanted to provide some info on most of the comments I am getting.

This picture is a portion of a data visualization I created yesterday that looks at the how often people attend religious services. I then attached a filter to let people see the results by the respondents confidence that there is a god. This image only shows how often people go to church that don't believe in God.

It seems that my title, filter, and logo have been confusing. I hope this helps straighten things out. If you want to see the whole data visualization, which I probably should have just linked, [you can find it here.](http://overflow.solutions/uncategorized/how-often-do-americans-go-to-church/)

Sorry again for the confusion. </TEXT>

[[Link]](http://overflow.solutions/uncategorized/how-often-do-americans-go-to-church/) Part of that visualization was a filter that let you look at the results based on how confident the respondent was in the existence of God.

I was recently looking at some of the data collected in the GSS and came across their question on attitudes towards legalization of marijuana. I was interested in how Americans feelings about marijuana have changed over time so I used the GSS Explorer website to download the data they have on the subject. Once I had the data, I used Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Source: GSS - gssdataexplorer.norc.org

Tool: Tableau


I was recently looking at some of the data collected in the GSS and came across their question on attitudes towards the bible. I was interested in how Americans feelings about the bible have changed over time so I used the GSS Explorer website to download the data they have on the subject. Once I had the data, I used Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to take a look at marital status in the US at a fairly local level, so I used 2011-2015 ACS 5 Year data from the U.S. Census Bureau to create this visualization. I downloaded the data from American Factfinder. It was located in table DP02 under Marital Status. I edited out the rows I needed in Excel and then created the visualization in Tableau.

It is worth pointing out that these figures include only people that have the current marital status of Divorced. Someone that was divorced and remarried or someone that was divorced, remarried, and then widowed would not be captured in these totals. </TEXT>
