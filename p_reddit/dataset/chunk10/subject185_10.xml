	<TEXT> Just got a Galaxy S8 last week and can confirm the wireless charging thing works. It's a super snug fit and I got a [very thin case](http://www.otterbox.com/en-us/galaxy-s8/symmetry-series-clear-case/sam41-galaxy-s8.html) so that I could still fit my phone in there. But it's pointless because I also wanted to be able to use Android Auto and to do that, you need to be connected via USB cable so you're already charging.

When I 1st got the car, I was still on my ancient S4 which had an awesome case from EasyAcc but it didn't have Lollipop so couldn't do Auto and it wasn't wireless charging capable. But I thought I'd just stick it in there anyway since, compared to my Fusion hybrid I replaced, the Bolt has way too few storage places (no coin or sunglass holders!) But with the case on, it absolutely would not fit.

So, yes, it works, but if you want to listen to music on your phone w/o Bluetooth or you want to use GPS, it's pointless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And, in Grant's own words:
I always wanted to sleep with a black woman. Thats my fantasy. 

https://www.theguardian.com/film/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jun/26/hugh-grant-arrest-prostitute-divine-brown-20-1995

So, yeah, it was just a regular sort of "long way from home, got way too much time and money, and I'm in fuckin' Hollyweird... LET'S DO THIS!" situation.

Side note: The story of '[Divine Brown](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Estella_Marie_Thompson)' is sadly predictable:

 Thompson grew up in poverty in the eastern part of Oakland, California. She was one of six children of a single mother. Having herself become a mother of two girls, she turned to prostitution when she could not pay a $133 electricity bill. Going to Union Square in San Francisco one night, she earned $1,000 in five hours: "I just wanted the best for my children and I didn't want them to struggle as hard as I had, so I did what I had to do. I wanted to make money, you know, do the right thing ... go home and raise my children and just have a good life, a good quiet positive life."

On a less sensitive note, Estella must give great head - 
 According to Thompson, the attention of a policeman was alerted by Grant repeatedly pressing the brake pedal of his BMW with his foot, causing the brake lights to flash. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Picked it up at Lee Johnson in Kirkland, WA as a 3 year lease. They actually had 10-15 on the lot. Went there just to test drive a red LT but when we were working to the showroom, my wife and I passed by an Arctic Blue Premier and had to drive it. Yeah, that panoramic mirror and some of the other candy made me change my mind and she ended up driving home solo.

The buying experience itself wasn't too bad. The finance guy did the same spiel that has become part of the standard procedure now - rattling off a long list of optional upgrades like Lojack and clear coat paint protectant but this guy wasn't as pushy as some I've seen. The salesman himself was nice enough but, predictably, didn't know doodly squat about the Bolt. But, for once, he didn't try to BS his way through and admitted upfront that they had just gotten them in about a week before and he hadn't read much about them. Since I've been reading **everything** on the Bolt since October, that wasn't a problem. </TEXT>

If you want to retrieve the memories you made on the mattress, you'll need to do a Vulcan mindmeld with it. Sadly, the company does not allow you to order a Vulcan to help with this and you are on your own to procure one. Best of luck OP! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mother didn't cook at all; insisted it was cheaper to eat out. But that's another story...

Dad remarried and stepmom starts cooking for us. Occasionally, as a treat, she buys a can of asparagus. She then proceeds to boil the everlovin hell out of it. "I hate asparagus," I decided.

Years go by, meet girl, fall in love, shack up. We started a thing on the weekends - I cook the main dish and she does a couple of sides. One weekend we're going to grill and she throws some little green stick lookin' things on there. 

Me: Whut the hell is that?

SO: Asparagus.

Me: Don't look like no asparagus I've ever had. 

SO: Just wait.

Before serving, she melted a little butter, crushed a clove of garlic in then tossed the asparagus around in it. I discovered I never had actually tasted asparagus before because there was nothing left to taste in what I had been eating all those years.

And then there's spinach... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn. I just picked up a new Bolt this weekend and found this exact same issue. Came here hoping to find an answer but since you've only had one reply in two months, I guess that answer is "No."

I've noticed that the audio system becomes active and if I go in immediately, I can't choose Bluetooth as the source since it takes several additional seconds before it recognizes that my phone is available and reconnects. So I'm guessing it sees that Bluetooth was the last source but then it sees that the phone isn't connected and, instead of calling out to whatever routine connects Bluetooth, it just defaults back to SXM/FM.

Bummer. </TEXT>

 Some of the worst incidents in the U.S. were on the Trans Alaska Pipeline. Vandals blew up a section in 1978, spilling about 16,000 barrels of oil near Fairbanks. In 2001, a drunken man fired a hunting rifle into the pipeline near Livengood, causing more than 6,000 barrels to spray out.

 Some of the most notable incidents in Canada happened in the 1990s and 2000s in Alberta and British Columbia. A series of bombings in 2008-09 targeted pipelines in British Columbia. Weibo Ludwig, an Alberta man who crusaded against the extraction of sour gas containing high amounts of hydrogen sulfide, was convicted in several of the 1990s acts of vandalism. He was arrested but never charged in the later attacks.

 Pipeline sabotage happens with some regularity in war zones. Iraqi insurgents, Colombian rebels and Mexican guerrillas all have claimed responsibility for pipeline attacks in recent decades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Kind Hearts and Coronets](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Kind_Hearts_and_Coronets)

 Kind Hearts and Coronets is a British black comedy film of 1949. ... It concerns Louis D'Ascoyne Mazzini, the son of a woman disowned by her aristocratic family for marrying out of her social class. After her death Louis decides to gain revenge on the family, and to take the dukedom, by murdering the eight people ahead of him in succession to the title.

All of the people murdered by the central character are played by the same actor who also plays the central character/murderer. That actors name? ~~Albert Einstein~~ Sir Alec Guinness.

 Alec Guinness was originally offered only four D'Ascoyne parts, recollecting "I read [the screenplay] on a beach in France, collapsed with laughter on the first page, and didn't even bother to get to the end of the script. I went straight back to the hotel and sent a telegram saying, 'Why four parts? Why not eight!?'"; he eventually played nine parts. </TEXT>
