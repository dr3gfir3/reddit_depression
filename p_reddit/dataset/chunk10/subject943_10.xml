	<TEXT> I used to have night terrors as a kid. 



They were incredibly vivid, so real that it felt like hell itself had somehow found a way to creep into my bedroom to torment me. My parents werent particularly fussed about them, unless of course, my screams woke them up. Ill never forget the one night my dad got really upset with me. He didnt care about the sharp-toothed, formless thing stuck in the corner of my room, stating in detail how it was going to gut me. He only cared about the fact that I was keeping the rest of the household out of their own peaceful dreams. He was fed up. Hed grabbed me by my shoulders and shaken me until the nightmarish thing disappeared, leaving nothing but tears on my cheeks and embarrassment in my heart.



Monsters are not real! He practically screamed those words at me. Those creatures are all in your head, Alexandria! In your head! Its not real life! Youre making it up! They dont exist!


 I was seven. Ever since then, Id done everything I could to overcome that fear that robbed me of sleep and peace. I feared the night. I detested it, because I knew that once everything went dark, they would come for me. So I decided to greet them with valour, or as much of it as my young self could muster at that age. I stubbornly decided to sleep with my bedside lamp off, plunging my room into blackness that remained when I woke to that awful, nocturnal world of teeth and eyes. When those things visited, I refused to scream. I closed my eyes, breathed really deeply and waited until I could feel my heartbeat begin to steady. It took a few tries, but I managed to snap myself out of it pretty quickly. On my first real triumph, Id saluted the vanquished demon with my middle finger, which, even at seven years old, seemed like an appropriate send-off. 



I hardened myself, I guess, partly in thanks to my father, who was a difficult man for whom fear was weakness and weakness was unacceptable. He was ex-military, who couldnt seem to leave the severity of war on the battlefield. He carried it with him, even when at home with his family. As a result, my sibling and I were forced to learn the hard facts of life. People steal and harm and kill. We had to be prepared. By eleven, Id already had a reasonable grip on self-defence and was learning how to use a firearm. By thirteen, Id found my accuracy.


 None of these things helped when our family was hijacked on the side of the road when I was fifteen. 

I never really knew whether or not my dad really loved me, if him being tough on me when it came to those lessons was simply because he cared, or because he was disappointed in me. I never got the chance to find out. 

Those lessons did nothing to prevent the bullet from tearing through my fathers skull and ending his life. 


That day, he taught me something. He showed me first-hand, just what real evil looked like. Two men, willing to kill another in front of his wife and children for some second-hand piece-of-shit car. That was my first glimpse into what evil really was. 
Something in me snapped that day. Id never experienced hate as I did then. Not only for the loss of my father, but for the look in the eyes of those men: they looked triumphant, as though revelling in toting their power to take life above their victims, taunting and mocking. Those eyes reminded me of those nights, the ones eight years prior that still left horror stained in my mind. 


I specifically picked a college as far away from home as I could get while still remaining in the country. I called my mom every now and again, met up with my brother on occasion, but I needed the freedom from everything that had happened, that pain. It was there that I met my second family. I made lots of friends, was studying something I truly loved and somehow managed to get my shit together. One of the people I was closest to was Connor Lowell. He was the kind of person that made you feel guilty for not being nice enough. I gravitated towards that kindness, perhaps because of my unintentional coldness and sarcasm, I dont know. But he was one of my best friends. 


One day I got a call from Connors mom. Connor hadnt come home one night and she was worried. My number was the only one she knew out of all his friends, so I assured her it was probably nothing and called everyone else. No one had seen him. The call back to his mom was one of the hardest things Ive ever had to do. 



The police were dry on leads, saying that the kid has simply vanished without a trace. I got angry because that was impossible. I didnt tell anyone I was conducting my own investigation. I asked his mom if I could use his laptop, and she agreed. It must have been too painful for her to keep it. I began analysing all of Connors online activities. Most of it was typical guy stuff: boredom-induced Google searches, porn, price-checks on cars, downloads for music, a few games and porn. Then I noticed an oddly-named app. Id thought it was a game initially but there was something fishy about the size of the file. It was incongruent for a game. I tried opening it and was immediately thrown back out. After a second attempt, the laptop shut down.
That was when I took the laptop to Patrick. 


Patrick Siler was in my third year computer sciences class in college. Or at least, he was there when he wasnt bunking out on the lawns, eating weed brownies or hacking into the schools administration system to cause chaos. We werent friends, but I knew enough about him to know he loved a challenge when it came to anything tech, and that he was good. Great, actually. I managed to track him down and brought the laptop with me. After a heated five-minute argument that ended when I pulled out a check, he finally agreed to try and crack the laptop. He got it working again and managed to decrypt the game after a day.
When he called me to collect it, his voice was panicked and he only managed to yell, Get here right fucking now! before hanging up. 


Turns out the game was a piece of sophisticated spyware. A lot of the technological terms were above my comprehension, but in laymans terms, this programme carried a Trojan that corrupted all of the data on Connors laptop. It was able to get into every account he accessed after it was installed his email, bank account, everything. It also had access to his laptops Skye cam. It tracked his geographical location. 



Patrick had contacted his friends, a group of fellow hackers of varying skill whod decided to form an exclusive group dedicated to accessing confidential information for a price, and none of them were able to backtrack the feed to see where it led, where the information was being sent to. Their unanimous advice was to destroy it and stop looking. Nothing that suspicious and advanced came from a mind of good intention. I agreed to destroy the laptop but not to stop looking. With their help we managed to link the game to its site of origin before we trashed it. 



The site led us to the deep web. 


My stomach dropped at what I saw. There were ads for the most disturbing things. 



Humans. 

Human body parts. 

Videos showing humans losing their body parts.


 Ritualistic animal slaughter. 

Cannibalism social groups and recipe-swap forums. 


One even had photos of people to be used as drug mules at airports. Like it was a freaking catalogue to pick and choose from. Another was a site for cops to brag about the things they got away with on the job, ranging from theft to rape to murder. 



One of the guys got up and left the room, unable to look at the photos and video clips anymore. I forced myself to keep searching. The particular site the game was linked to boasted a following of almost one million people. It was a site much like Reddit. There were subsections for different topics, everything from taboo porn to drug rings. One of them was a virtual arena, like an online cinema. The format was reminiscent of YouTube, except that the entire thing had a very prominent theme with the content. There were recommended videos on the sidebar, videos ranked as the most popular at the top. The second one caught my eye. 



That was because the thumbnail showed a picture of Connor, naked, bloodied, and looking utterly broken. 
I had to try very hard not the smash my fist through the screen.
He was being advertised as the main event for the next screening. Probably beaten as some kind of teaser trailer for the sick audience. According to the details, it was happening in a week from then. One of the videos showed a creepy-looking older man with tattoos covering much of his skin. One of the guys recognised him as the owner of a tattoo shop near to where he lived. Hed seen him a few times and if you could, youd realise why those few instances were enough to brand that face in his mind forever. 



So we decided that was as good a place as any to start. Plus, we figured that because the shop was usually empty, we could easily overpower this guy as we would be five to one. The others and I decided to meet up a street away from the shop.


The thought seems laughable now because of course he wasnt alone.



We went in the evening, just as the sun was dying, wanting to be discreet but still have a bit of sunlight on our side. We were impulsive, we were stupid. But people tend to be careless in their anger. And the content of that dark version of the internet had us all angrier than wed ever been before. The internet mercenaries didnt want to contact the police, fearing their own illegal means would be exposed, so we went in alone. 
We were jumped the second all of us were across the threshold.


We had bags thrown over our heads as what must have been at least five heavily-muscled men restrained us and led us down some staircase. We were separated and thrown into separate cells; I figured out they were barred and not cement-walled because my specific captor grabbed my head and smashed it against the steel. I hadnt even had a chance to use the pocketknife Id brought. They beat us for a while, until we were all pretty well-acquainted with the sounds of one anothers screams. I tried being careful to orient my body so he wouldnt hit anything too vital. I could hear the crack of bone, though I knew it wasnt mine. 



A voice finally told them to stop, coloured by amusement and not horror or any sort of emotion that a human might be expected to experience when watching a bunch of kids being severely beaten. We were relieved of the bags and locked in our respective cells. I took inventory of my body, probing and poking to make sure nothing was broken. Most of the damage was done to my torso. My ribs felt like they were on fire, and I could barely move my arms but nothing appeared broken. There was blood smeared all over the dirty floor of my cell I could taste it in my mouth, feel it run down my face. Looking around, I could see the others seemed okay enough except one. 



Simon. 



He was the youngest of all of us, a kid at eighteen. He was also the smallest, skinny and still pulling for puberty to hit him with a parlour trick. He lay unmoving in his cell two down from me, his clothes stuck to his body with his blood. He was bleeding more than the rest of us. 


Check on him! I yelled at Patrick, whose cell was adjacent to his. He dragged himself to the bars and stuck his arm through, trying to shake Simon. He didnt move. The pool of blood around him was growing in circumference, alarmingly so, but no matter how many times we screamed and hit the bars, no one came. I knew they wouldnt. But still, fighting a lost battle felt better than just not fighting at all.


A day passed. 


Then two. They came and collected Simons body. One of the guards actually inhaled deeply when removing the body, savouring the smell of death. I nearly vomited.


Three. 


They brought us water in dog bowls and no food. None of us wanted to drink it, and when another one of the guys Jordan, was his name threw his in the face of the guard who brought it, the man dragged him from his cell and punched him so hard his eyes rolled into the back of his skull. He then pulled out a length of rope fashioned into a crude leash. 


Little doggies are not meant to misbehave like that. His smile was reptilian. Doggies need to be taught a lesson.


 He secured an end of the rope to a beam that ran across the ceiling.


Then he hung Jordan right in front of us. 


Eric, the fourth guy, threw up in his cell. Patricks eyes shone with tears. I stayed quiet. I hadnt known them very long but having these guys killed right in front of me . . . I was enraged beyond description. 



They left us with the body for another day. The pocketknife I kept in my pocket burned where it lay, and my hand itched to use it. I noted that there were the same two guys who came to give us water each day. They finally brought us plain bread, probably wanting our deaths to be entertaining and not at the hands of something as banal as starvation. The guys couldnt bring themselves to eat but I wolfed mine down. Patrick looked at me with disgust but I didnt care. I needed my strength. Eric was in the cell directly next to mine. I had an idea but I needed him to trust me. I explained it in a hushed whisper. He nodded, face pale and I could tell he was afraid. I promised him he would be okay. 



When we brought out next meals, he threw his in the face of the guard, just as Jordan had done. The man shouted, moving in to open Erics cell. Did your friends death not teach you anything, kid? Slow learner, are you? Eric slunk against the bars of my cell. I prayed he would remember what I told him to do. He must have, because he kicked the guard in the nuts, drawing out a pained groan. The hulking man lunged at Eric, who ducked just as I took up my position at the bars. Time seemed to slow. I breathed in and out slowly, slowed my racing heartbeat, just like I used to do, waiting.



The timing was exceptional. Eric dropped just as the man ran into the bars . . . his chest impaled on my knife blade. I pulled my arm back out from between the bars. He was still breathing. By some miracle I hadn't killed him. Eric grabbed the dog bowl and smashed it over the guys head, incapacitating him. Get the keys! I yelled. Eric scrambled to get them from where they still rested in the keyhole of his cell. He unlocked our cells. We made our way through the door, only to run into the second guard.
This one was even bigger than the first. He hit me first, sending me sprawling, the knife flying out of my hand. Patrick dove for it while Eric tried his best to distract the man. He slashed through the flesh of the mans thigh, and he screamed, dropping Eric, who hed been lifting in a choke hold. He grabbed a hold of Patrick, who wasted no time in slashing his wrist. He let go of him immediately, cradling his bleeding wrist. Patrick then sweep-kicked his legs out from under him, and straddled him, pressing the tip of my knife against his throat. 


Where are the others?


The man only laughed in reply: an ugly, harsh sound. Im not saying anything.


Yeah?


Yes.


Okay, by choice, but if that doesnt change I can make sure you lose the ability to say anything ever again. 


The man snarled. In response, Patrick pressed the knife harder, drawing a fine rivulet of blood. The man grunted but still didnt say anything. I took the knife from Patrick and buried it in the guards shoulder. He yelled out. Then I dragged it down, struggling through his thick, muscled flesh. The thought of what I was doing sickened me, but I knew we needed that information. For Connor. For revenge for what happened to Jordan and Simon and countless other people. 



We can make this really slow. Or I can just  I stopped what I was doing and twisted the knife. Patrick threw his hand over his mouth to muffle the screams. 



How many of you are here? he asked roughly. 


The man nodded and Patrick slowly took his hand away. 



Just us two. The rest went out to get more from distribution.


More what? He asked.


Of the drug. Incredibly, the mans face lit up. The cure for mankind. Theyre getting more.



What is this drug and where is the distribution plant? 


Silence again, lips pressed together in sudden resolution. I glanced at Patrick, who placed both hands over the mans mouth and nodded at me. I yanked the knife out hard. After that, he sang like a canary. We learned a lot. About where the distribution centre was, what the drug was, where the arena was. Where Connor and about thirty other people were being imprisoned. He also explained that they were waiting for us because they knew we were looking. That fucking laptop. They were monitoring us, looking at the people we were close to, which is why I knew they would try and target Leo. He also told us that if we really wanted to know about what that drug was, we could go and check in another little room. We took him with us, me angling the knife at his back the entire time to stave off any foolish ideas while Patrick and Eric flanked his sides. We opened the door a crack and something heavy threw its weight back against it. There were screams coming from the person on the other side of the door, screams that sound feral, animalistic. The person was begging for "more of it", saying they would gouge out their eyes if they didn't get it. My blood ran cold. That person's voice was brimming with complete and utter madness. What I didn't tell Patrick was that in the short glimpse into the room we were allotted, I saw Simon's corpse. 

Half-eaten.



Patrick and I argued about what to do with the guards and the madman in the room. I convinced him not to kill the two because they didnt deserve that kindness. We were in over our heads and we needed help. I told them to get away, that I would stay and talk to the cops, saying that only Simon and Jordan came with me. I could keep the police off their trails. I knew that Patrick and Eric had rather undesirable offences theyd get jailed for. Minor, sure, but they added up. They thanked me, and after we tied the two men up, they left with the promise of a favour each. 


I was questioned and eventually released. They opened an investigation, but I know they wont get anywhere. I didnt tell them where the arena was just yet. I know that if they start sniffing around, the entire thing will be moved before they even touch them. And Connor, along with a lot of other innocent people will be out of reach. I washed up in the bathroom of a random gas station rest room, where I finally allowed myself to break down. I made sure I purged myself of every hint of despair so that I could continue on clear-headed. I got something to eat, then made my way over to my apartment.


Im wrung out now, bled dry, on the brink of losing my faith in humanity. Because for the first time in almost fifteen years I felt that ancient, buried fear. I keep on hearing my fathers voice in my head: *Those creatures are all in your head, Alexandria! In your head! Its not real life! Youre making it up! They dont exist!*, but I realise now that they do indeed exist, its not in my head, it is real life. They exist all around us. And we will never truly know who they are. 


That kind stranger on the bus?



A neighbour?



A family member?


A friend?


Maybe it's you.


The internet is a playground for them, their outlet for the inhumanity they lock up on a daily basis that they will never allow the world to see. We live in a world of night terrors. Those terrifying, evil creatures exist and the only difference is they wear human skins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the same. I think there are a lot more people who feel that way and are just not prepared to admit it even to themselves because of a social stigma. Nothing wrong with it, you don't fit into society and society is fucked up anyway so whatever. </TEXT>
