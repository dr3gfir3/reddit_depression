	<TEXT> in the scene that the boys are fighting while the plane blows up for the second time does it make sense for the explosion of the plane to burst all the windows at the terminal? It seems a bit excessive and not plausible and i was wondering if that is accurate. Any thoughts or actuall knowledge on how accurate that and the plane's disfunction was in the first place? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, sorry. I'm trying to say that kapkan's traps kill and frost's down so there shouldn't be any reason to change kapkan's speed when the reason (at least i feel) is that frost is faster is because her traps don't kill people instantly and she needs to run to them as someone get's downed by one{unless you're using a tactic and cav is there} if kapkan is 2-2, that just adds another op operator with amazing traps to walk around like mute and strafe. He will become the new main for almost every team. Maybe that's not a bad thing. I guess i'm just too used to him being an aromord operator and i like it too much for the extra bullet he takes compared to frost or mute. </TEXT>

Justin probably is going for the idea that the god is a figmant of your imagination and the devil is the real person in life who coerces you into doing bad things when there are obvious concequences to those actions </TEXT>
