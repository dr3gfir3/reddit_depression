	<TITLE> I Love Pi Music Player But It's Missing One Important Feature </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 03:00:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've mostly used Google Play Music, however I'm canceling my subscription so I don't really see a reason to have to put up with the ridiculous amount of lag it has. A good alternative I've found is Pi Music, but there's one thing I loved about GPM that Pi doesn't do. If I was listening to a playlist, and then I added another playlist to the queue, if on shuffle the queue would randomly "splash" that new playlist instead of keeping it together.  
  
Since that may have sounded confusing, here's an example. Say I have playlist 1 playing on shuffle, consisting of "A,B,C,D, and E". Then I add playlist 2 to the queue, which consists of "F,G,H,I,J". On GPM, the resulting playlist would be something like "A,G,H,B,E,J,C,E,F,D...etc.". However, on Pi it comes out like "A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J". Like it just places one shuffled playlist after another. I couldn't find any settings in Pi to fix that, so does anyone know of a music player that has this functionality? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho several times and each time it's still so awesome, especially the mysticism that comes along with it that plays on Abrahamic Esotericism and the like. I would also put HP Lovecraft under the same category to an extent, although taking on more of an Anthroposophic theme rather than Abrahamic Esotericism like The Alchemist. I hope for this thread to just be sort of a discussion of the theme and perhaps offer some other novels that put similar or different perspectives on the oddly specific genre. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Buddhist can believe in whatever they want. How much these beliefs will help is what matters. For Buddhist practice, the belief in God is pretty much unnecessary. We know that there is dukkha, we know the cause of dukkha, we know the cessation of dukkha, and we know the path to the cessation of dukkha, and whether or not there is a God this isn't going to change. In a practice where one has to detach themselves from pretty much everything including nothing, it's easiest to start with what we cannot directly observe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mount Sumeru has crumbled,  
And the Ganges has dried.  
Now what is there here,  
For us to gaze?  
  
Beg for change!  
And beg three times more.  
Your heart cant go anywhere,  
Come sit awhile.  
  
Mind is the hammer,  
And not-mind is the nail,  
So one can render incomplete.  
  
The ground moves quickly,  
Too quick for one to see,  
And yet horses trot and rabbits leap,  
And all you do is complain.  
  
See with your tongue and wash your feet,  
As to prove your thoughts real.  
Where does the sky end and begin?  
And where are your thoughts?  
  
Try to make sense of this,  
Like a frog under a brick.  
The floor is almost finished,  
But the Ganges has already dried! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imagine: there is a king, who is dull-witted. He has little wisdom. And there is a doctor, who is obstinate. But the King does not know this and pays him a salary. This doctor uses the products of milk to cure all illnesses. Also, he does not know where the illnesses come from. He may be versed in the medicine of milk, but for him there exists no difference between a cold and a fever. He prescribes milk for all illnesses. This King was unaware that this doctor was ignorant of the pleasing and non-pleasing, the good and bad aspects of milk. But there was a Doctor who knew eight different treatments for illnesses and who was able to cure all diseases. This Doctor was versed in prescription and medicines and had come from a far-off place. And the King's doctor did not know how to ask and learn. He was rash and haughty. So the learned Doctor cordially invited the King's doctor and looked up to him [as an expedient] as his master and asked of him the secret of treatment. He said to the King's doctor: "I now invite you and make you my teacher. Please be good enough to teach me." The King's doctor said: "If you serve me for 48 years, I will teach you the art of medicine. " Then, at these words, the learned Doctor said: "I shall do as you tell me. I shall do my best and run errands." Then the King's doctor, taking the learned Doctor along with him, went to see the King. At this, the visiting Doctor explained to the King the various ways of treatment and even other things. He said: "Please know, O great King! Know well! This Dharma is like this and you will well cure illnesses." On hearing this, the King recognised the ignorance and lack of knowledge of his own doctor. He at once drove him out of the country. And he respected the new Doctor all the more. Then the new Doctor said to himself: "It is now time to teach the King." He said to the King: "O great King! If you truly love me, please make me a promise!" The King replied: "I shall give you, should you desire it, even my right hand or any part of my body." The new Doctor said: "You may give me all statuses, but I myself do not wish to have much. What I desire you to do for me is to proclaim to the people of every corner of your land that henceforth they are not to use the milk medicine, which the former doctor told them to use. Why not? Because much harm and poisonous results arise [from it]. Any person who still takes this medicine should be beheaded. If the milk medicine is not used, there will be no untimely deaths; all will go in peace. That is why I ask this of you." Then the King said: "What you ask me to do is a trifle. I shall at once issue an order and see to it that anyone who is ill does no take milk as a medicine. Any person who does will be beheaded." At this, the learned Doctor made several kinds of medicine, which tasted pungent, butter, salty, sweet, and sour. With these, treatment was given, and there was no case in which illness could not be cured.  
"After some time, the King himself became ill, and the Doctor was called in. The King said: "I am now ill. How am I to be cured?" The Doctor thought about the illness of the King and saw that the milk medicine was good [here]. So he said to the King: "What you are now suffering from can very well be cured by milk. What I said before about the milk medicine was not true. If you take it now, you will be cured. You are now suffering from a fever. It is right that you should take milk." Then the King said to the Doctor: "Are you mad? Is it a fever? And you say that if I take milk, it will cure me? Before, you said it was poison. Now you tell me to take it. How is this? Do you mean to cheat me? What the former doctor said was good, [yet] you despised it and said that it was poison, and you made me drive him away. Now you say that it well cures illness. From you you say, the former doctor ought to excel you."  
"Then the learned Doctor said to the King: "O King! Do not say this, please. A worm eats on [a piece of] wood and [the shape of] a letter comes out. This worm does not know anything of letters. A wise person sees this. But he does not say that this worm understands letters. And he is not overcome by surprise. O great King! Please know: so was it also with the former doctor. To all illnesses he gave medicine made from milk. This is as in the case of the worm that eats on wood, as a result of which a form like a letter emerges. The former doctor did not know how to distinguish between the pleasing and non-pleasing aspects, the good and the bad." Then the King wanted to know: "What do you mean he did not know?" The guest Doctor answered the King: "This milk medicine is harmful, but it is also a manna."  "How can you say that this milk is manna?" "If you milking cow has not taken the lees, the slippery grass and the wheat refuse, and if the calf fares well, and if the cow was not grazed too high up on the land or in a low and wet place, if the cow is given pure water and not made to run or made to live among the bulls, and if feeding is done regularly, and if the place it lives in is fit, the milk gained from such a cow well does away with all illnesses. This can well be called the manna of medicine. Any other milk is poison."  
"On hearing this, the King praised the great Doctor: "Well said, well said, O great Doctor! Today, for the first time in my life, I know of the pleasing and non-pleasing, that which is good and not good in the milk medicine. Taking this, I am now well. I shall at once proclaim to the people that they may well take the milk medicine." On hearing this, the people of the country, angry and resentful, said: "The great King is now caught by a devil. Is he mad? He cheats us and makes us take milk." All the people, angry and resentful, came to the King. The King said to them: "Be not angry, and have no resentment. To take milk or not to take it all comes from the science of medicine. I am not to blame." At this, the great King and the people all jumped for joy. They all the more respected and honoured the Doctor, and made offerings to him. That is how all the people took the milk medicine and regained their health.  
"Know, O you Bhiksus! The same is the case with the Tathagata, the Alms-deserving, the All-Enlightened-One, the Unsurpassed Best Trainer, the Teacher-of-Heaven-and-Earth, the Buddha-World-Honoured One. He comes as a great Doctor and subdues all tirthikas and bad doctors. In the presence of kings and all people, he says: "I shall become the King of doctors and subdue tirthikas." Thus we say:   "There is no self, no man, no being, no life, no nurturing, no knowing, none that does, and none that receives." O Bhiksus! Know that what the tirthikas say is like the case of a worm that eats upon [a piece of] wood, from which, by chance, there appears what looks like a letter. Because of this, the Tathagata teaches and says no-self. This is to adjust beings and because he is aware of the occasion.   Such non-self is, as occasion arises, spoken of, and it is [also] said that there is the Self. This is as in the case of the learned Doctor, who knows well the medicinal and non-medicinal qualities of milk. It is not as with common mortals, who might measure the size of their own self. Common mortals and the ignorant may measure the size of their own self and say, 'It is like the size of a thumb, like a mustard seed, or like the size of a mote.' When the Tathagata speaks of Self, in no case are things thus. That is why he says: 'All things have no Self.'  
Even though he has said that all phenomena [dharmas] are devoid of the Self, it is not that they are completely/ truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self? Any phenomenon [dharma] that is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/ autonomous/ self-governing [aisvarya], and whose ground/ foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed 'the Self' [atman]. This is as in the case of the great Doctor who well understands the milk medicine. The same is the case with the Tathagata. For the sake of beings, he says "there is the Self in all things"  O you the four classes! Learn Dharma thus!"  
  
This is an excerpt from the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra, which reintroduces the idea of a Self into Buddhism. Throughout the sutra, the Self that is Nirvana is said to be very different than the idea of Self in other religions and philosophies. Later on it is said something along the lines of "there is neither Self nor no Self, and that is why there is Self."  
  
It took me a while to understand this as well, questioning if this is even Buddhism anymore. There are different interpretations of this Self (known also as Buddha-nature, Tathagatagarbha, Ground Luminosity, or Nirvana itself). For example, in the Lankavatara Sutra, the Buddha said that he teaches the Tathagatagarbha in order to draw adherents who aren't ready to part with the idea of Self.  
  
Zen sees it in the way that I interpret. There's a Zen saying:  
Before one studies Zen, mountains are mountains and waters are waters;  
After a first glimpse into the truth of Zen, mountains are no longer
mountains and waters are no longer waters;  
After enlightenment, mountains are once again mountains and waters once again waters.  
  
You begin to realize the Self nature of all things as the fact that there is no Self nature to these things. It's a Self that is completely void of any understanding, essentially one that "doesn't exist". If you try to understand the nature of the Self you will fail, which is why the Buddha told us to detach ourselves of thinking there is a Self. Only by realizing there is no Self will the Self become visible.  
  
I really suggest you read this Mahaparinirvana Sutra, it will throw everything you think you know into a spin. It's very long, and pretty dry at times, however it's a teaching of the Dharma that seems completely heretic but ends up working so well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the Mahayana Sutras depict teachings by the Buddha that he apparently taught later in his life. They were written about 100 to 200 years after the Pali Canon, which most people will agree is the closest to what the Buddha actually said and taught. The Mahayana Sutras are considered illegitimate by the Theravada School, which constitutes around 35% of global Buddhists (Mahayana ~60%, Vajrayana ~5%). The Mahayanists believe the Pali Canon to also be legitimate but believe they are meant to be "lesser" teachings intended for those who do not have the capacity to understand the "greater" teachings of the Mahayana.  
  
In truth, however, there really isn't any way of knowing what the Buddha actually said or not, as even the Pali Canon was first written down around 400-500 years after the Buddha's death after being orally passed down during that time period. We know for a fact that the Pali Canon isn't even the exact words of the Buddha as his attendant Ananda was the one who first recited them after the Buddha died. The best thing to do is to put the teachings into practice and see what works, because really it doesn't matter who said anything, if it's true it's true. There's even a sutta in the Pali Canon of a man who received a discourse from the Buddha without knowing that it was the Buddha, and because his mind was freed from "who's saying what" he was able to attain enlightenment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many of the Mahayana Sutras have the Buddha telling his disciples not to think of him as being subject to extinction and instead to view him as eternal. Of course this is saying that the Buddha has fully transcended life and death and there is only the Dharmakaya which the Buddha has fully merged with. </TEXT>
