	<TEXT> Ingredients:

- 300g (11oz) unsalted butter
- 300g (11oz) dark chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids)
- 5 large eggs
- 450g (1lb) granulated sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla extract
- 200g (7oz) plain flour
- 1 tsp salt

You will also need:

- A roasting tin 13x10in and at least 2 1/4" deep  

Method:  

Preheat the oven to 180C/Fan 160C(ish)/350F/Gas Mark 4. Line the tin with greaseproof paper/baking parchment. Melt the butter and chocolate in a heatproof bowl above a pan of barely simmering water. While this is melting, beat the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract together until the mixture is thick and coats the back of a spoon. When the butter and chocolate have melted together, take off the heat and allow to cool slightly, so as not to curdle the egg mixture. Pour the chocolate/butter into the egg mix, and beat to combine. Sift the flour and salt together, and add to the mixture. Beat until smooth. At this point, you can add any extras, like chopped nuts, or dried fruit.  

Pour the mix into the roasting tin, and ensure it's evenly distributed. If you want to add anything in the middle (I recommend oreos, especially double stuff!), pour half the mix in and level it out. Add the ingredients to the centre, and cover with the rest.  

Bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, or longer if it needs it. This is mostly judged by eye, but they're about done when the crust is beginning to crack in the top and around the sides, and when the mix stops wobbling when you give it a shake. I also stuck a knife in the very centre, and checked the consistency of the mix. If it's *really* runny, you might want to pop them back in for a bit, but don't overcook them! It's best to take them out sooner, and put them back in if they need it. The ones in the picture took about 30 minutes in my oven, but YMMV.  

Let the giant brownie cool in its tin for about 20 minutes. Cut the brownie into squares in the pan. The paper should peel off easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For your first point, from the announce post on the site: "DiRT 4 features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button."  
I'll go with 'lots' :)

As for the second point, we do have a retired opponent feature, so sometimes if an entrant is ahead of you in the running order, you'll see them on the side of the road. You can see this in some of the videos from the announce event. </TEXT>
