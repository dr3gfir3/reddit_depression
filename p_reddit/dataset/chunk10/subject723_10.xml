	<TEXT> Yeah, I explained that.  If you aren't frustrated with Rothfuss for his glacial pace then you have the patience of Job.  You don't think it's funny that a 10th Anniversary Edition of book 1 is likely to hit before the 3rd book does?  I guess I have an overdeveloped sense if the absurd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be clear-I think from everything I've read that PR just wants to make this 3rd book awesome, to craft it to be as strong as the first two, to make a great story.  
The 10th anniversary edition of Name of the Wind is what makes me crazy-JUST FINISH THE STORY-don't try to get me to buy the first book again.  Finish this tale and then go on to another good tale.  This smacks of greed on the publisher's part to my mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good things come up those who wait, a watched pot never boils, you can't rush perfection..whatever.  The 3rd installment, Doors of Stone, will be done when it is done.  I understand that.  I appreciate that.  I totally respect that.  
What made me laugh out loud today is that there will be a special 10th anniversary edition of the first installment, which I guess they expect us to run out and buy, BEFORE the 3rd book is even done!!!
That is a bit much.  This really makes me appreciate Michael J. Sullivan's approach-he finishes the ENTIRE series before he releases even the first book.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I defer to your experience of course. I had in mind a restraint system  more like a standing harness you could sit down in.  

The larger idea is that standing is healthier than sitting.  While standing you engage the larger muscles in the hips and thighs, more calories are burned, circulation is improved, health problems like varicose veins, atherosclerosis, and deep vein thrombosis are impacted in a positive way.
Thanks for your thoughts, of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've always thought someone should invent and seat that would let truckers sit down or stand up while driving when they wanted to.  The health benefits would, I think, be enormous.  We all know that what gets a lot of these hardworking guys is the negative impacts of diet and stasis.  They sit for hours at a time and then have to jump down (very strenuous when you are overweight) into weather, run out and strap or lift something, then climb back in.  Anyway, interested in any thoughts. Also, if one of you patents this, please send me a million dollars.

	<TEXT> Which sounds fine until you somehow wind up on the other end of it.  You don't even have to be involved with drugs or the cartels to be pigeonholed as an "enemy of the state" and then the same tactics are used on you for any old reason.  This is classic and this is predictable.
You've already seen massive consolidation of power around a single person rather than the institutions of democracy.  When his term is up what do you think he's going to do?  Fade sweetly into civilian life?  That's impossible for him as a person now-he is locked into the cycle of becoming a dictator and there are few ways out of that; assassination, prison, exile.   </TEXT>

His "strategy" is simply to prove that he doesn't have a small..pair of hands.  Like a small-time 3rd world dictator, every official act of his can be traced back to some petty personal insecurity he is overcompensating for-hence the MOAB- because he's impotent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not stealing-plain or simple at all.  If you are SMART at business you will control where your resources go.  If you are DUMB at business you will just leave a big stack of money out there and cry like a little girl when someone who paid 500% of what it cost you to make the damn sandwich grabs extra condiments.
This r/ is notorious for people being huge douchebags about little things like this.  Wait to carry on the tradition!  If he's lowlife scum then you are a self-righteous troglodyte pig rapist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The implied consent is condiments for items purchased"...WTF!?!
Where did you get your law degree?  You are a sad, self-righteous cheap bastard yourself (as evidenced by you very presence in this thread), so how do you get off judging a guy for grabbing a few cents worth of extra condiments?  It's not like he takes a bath in the stuff!  If the owner doesn't like it he can wise up and drop a small amount of condiment in the bag with purchase or put out a bottle.
Good god-read what you posted and reevaluate your life choices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you should keep at it and ignore all the self-righteousness prick comments.  "This is theft!"-good grief, cry me a river you precious little snowflake.  If the "small business owner" had two brain cells to rub together he'd just give each customer a napkin with their purchase.
Again, good for you and the rest of you whiners can sit on it. </TEXT>
