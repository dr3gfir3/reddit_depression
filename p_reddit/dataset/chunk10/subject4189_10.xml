	<TEXT> College students (majority of her fans) can get discounted movie tickets and if not they'll still go. The amount of people I saw dragging around her book (which is like $20) all year was infiuriatjng and then you talk to these fucking idiots and they don't even know that she's a comedian and you want to set them on fire. They literallly like her because she's in USWeekly. Fucking morons </TEXT>

I'm sorry if you judging him for not treating people who shove shit in his face for him to sign without even a "please". I guess he's an asshole for treating those people how he treats them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just from his perspective maybe he actually wanted to plan the match out in advance rather than call it on the fly. Or that he liked to talk things over before a match, regardless of how many times they'd done it. Hell, I can respect that mindset when it comes to giving a shit about your work. Look at his work at that time (Straigh Edge Society) compared to theirs (in a title feud that felt underwhelming). I give him all the credit if he was taking himself too seriously at the time because the proof was in the pudding. He just handled it the wrong way. And what else do we know about him having a high opinion of himself? So what? Tons of people in the wrestling industry have a high opinion of themselves. You have to be selfish to be successful. I don't really fault anyone for that </TEXT>

My point being is that he's now at a point where his film career is successful enough that he wouldn't need to wrestle ever again if he didn't want to. That was what the company thought would happen the first time in 2010, and again in 2014. Good for him </TEXT>
