	<TEXT> I think that segment is a minority, but gets more attention due to some of the outlandishness

Oh yes, no argument there. The ideal that men and women, people of different ethnic and class backgrounds, gender and sexual minorities, all deserve equal rights and protections is fast becoming a moderate centrist viewpoint. But far too often the left is represented to the rest of society by people who are only in it to bully, complain, blame others for societies ills and shit like that. I think liberalism is a very positive force in society but it needs to be represented less by loud students and more by the rest of us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   History Channel show

History channel is your source? Hahahahahahahaha.

 There are dozens of posts that say I'm right

There are also dozens of posts that say the earth is flat, or hollow, that lizard people live among us and that vaccines do not work.

Show me a post written by an actual historian instead of just some guy that saw it on mythbusters.

 which I've already **answered** as being unlikely. 

No, you have **claimed** it as unlikely, you have also claimed you are a "one eyed pirate", It is a simple fact that a person going about on shipboard or involved in any kind of fight is not going to cover one eye and lose not only depth perception but also cut back on their range of vision, a person would cut off a thirty degree arc of their vision by covering one eye and that is not going to happen.

What they are leaning on is there is no manual found that supports the claim. Well I can't imagine pirates were great with keeping detailed notes.

Yeah you see the thing is history is based upon what can reasonably be proven as having happened. Again, show me any valid historical source for this idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A person with one eye sees things differently than a person with two eyes because of binocular vision, if a person is going to be fighting with sword, cannon and smaller firearms, moving around on the deck of a rocking ship,going up into the riggings of a sailing ship, throwing grappling lines, and all of the other dangerous and physical stuff that a pirate does they are not going to hobble themselves by destroying their depth perception by covering one eye.

 Can you explain why, if there was some advantage to be gained by wearing an eye patch during naval combat that only pirates would be doing it and not regular navy as well as armed merchant vessels defending themselves from attack?

The entire idea is based on the assumption that a pirate engaged in a fight would be continuously moving from the open deck to the darkest below decks. I just do not see a lot of reason for this, If you are engaging a ship with cannon, pirate ships were generally smaller and would have their cannon on the [weather deck](http://imgur.com/a/ecw3p) If you had a ship large enough that they had[ lower gun decks](http://imgur.com/a/ObCnR) they are quite well lit and hardly dark enough to cause a person any trouble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the most bizarre bits of fake history I have seen recently is that people have taken the trope of illustrators portraying fictional pirates as wearing an eye patch and have built this elaborate fantasy in which all actual pirates wear eye patches even with no eye injury, for the purpose of maintaining their night vision.

This is done so the pirates can flip up their eye patch when going below decks and still see well.

There is so much wrong with this idea that it is amazing and yet there are several websites that promote this to the point where I think there is some sort of organized social experiment going on to see how far a crazy idea can spread. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time I showed up for work at 7:00 and Bart walks in and he is still drunk from the night before and he thinks he is going to run a CNC mill in that shape, he couldn't even make a coherent sentence.

Another day Bart was telling me about how the reason all the middle east hates America is because some American tank blew the nose off the sphinx in world war two, I told him the sphinx lost its nose a long time ago and I had seen pictures from way back when showing this and he got so angry I thought he was going to punch me right there, Fucking Bart.

One day Bart told us about this time he was being released from jail for driving drunk and he had a friend of his drop his car off near the jail and he got in the car and saw his buddy had left a six pack in the car for him so naturally he starts one off in the car and as he is lowering the can he sees one of the cops that busted him looking right at him. The cop just shook his head and drove off for some damn reason. Fucking Bart. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not a rifle, it is a shotgun. If you look at the pics it says "laminated steel" on the top of the rib and in that pic you can see the twists of the hammer forged barrel. Barrels like this are forged from strips wound around a mandrel and are usually called Damascus barrels and were made for the much lower pressures of a black powder cartridge.  I do not think many gunsmiths would call this a shooter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to post on a small business website, I used to read about these guys living in horribly corrupt places in the south or Midwest where they would have to deal with the most pointless code enforcement crap that was blatantly just a way to raise revenue and they just accepted being shookdown as a cost of doing business but the moment I mention I am from California they would not stop with the fox news crap about our job destroying regulations and shit. Unless I really want to pollute the air, water or land I deal with damn little regulations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See what the hood looks like in both daytime and night time. Call a pizza delivery place and see if they deliver there after dark. Drive around the streets in a three block radius and look for train tracks, freeways, bars on windows, homeless hangouts, see what kind of business's are around. Go into a few and see if there is a bullet "proof" partition separating you from the cashier.

Open every cabinet and look under the stove for roaches and poop. Look for diatomaceous earth, (white powder used for bedbugs) in the corners of the bed room. Look for shopping carts abandoned in front of apartments. 

Try to check it out on a Saturday afternoon when people are around living their lives to see if you can hear normal conversation through the walls. </TEXT>
