	<TEXT> I think Vox really should drop the 'Young millenial lecturing you poor, uneducated savages on how the real world works.' By that, I mean where the anchor is sitting there and telling you their slant.  It really comes off as [talking down to your audience.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0FUqj6z_E_I) Seriously, get Ezra off the camera.  He is awful and condescending, which is what triggers the die-hard Alt-Right, but also makes Vox look like hardcore Liberal to the Centrist.

This works only a couple of times, in my opinion.  Mainly when they use people like Carlos Maza, who has a bit of personality and throws in some [Daily Show-esque charm into the video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nFCPdVtB8gI) He has only a few videos like this, and they're much more engaging and fun than Vox's more serious stuff.  It also works as an interview format.  I show their [hip-hop video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWveXdj6oZU) to people all the time.

When Vox wants to do serious, they should just cut the sitting man/woman all together and just do voice over.  Their best work is when they do that. [Their gun violence one in particular, no matter how you feel on the issue, is very slick.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX4qUsgHa4Y) Mind you, this still triggers the Alt-Right, but at a sheer presentation value, I think style has a lot more reach then their sitting lecture style.

	<TEXT> This seems to be going for a more unsettling atmosphere than your typical, 'Terrorists have taken over the bank!  Go kill em'!'

The imagery of that violent gore, the fetish club, a dead kid, a school shooting, religious cult(?), and human trafficking are not something you'd usually see in these types of games.  There's usually a more jingoistic approach to these scenarios, and what violence innocents suffer seem detached from the rest of the game.  This seems to be nose diving into those uncomfortable realities.  I'm genuinely curious how you guys are going to approach this subject matter.

Seeing as how the devs are in this thread, are you trying to approach this genre with some form of commentary about crime/policing and the glorification of what these men and women go through? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you pay the 1,600 a month yourself, or do you share that with roommates?  Because I, making 55,000 a year at 28, couldn't possibly afford that rent by myself. That's just over a pay period's paycheck.  I live and work in the city as well, so I need a roommate.  

And according to this: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/05/11/are-you-in-the-american-middle-class/ I'm considered middle class.  

I'm also paying around 600 a month in student loans, which is also a huge factor in deciding how I want to invest this money.  Though I have a very stable job in the field I enjoy, I don't want to make any long-term plans with a home unless I have the ability to be more flexible with it.  And while getting two month's rent back from taxes sounds nice, in the long run it doesn't make sense to me right now.

I guess what I'm saying is that everyone's personal experience is different, but Adam's videos are usually backed by statistics rather than personal anecdote.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This video doesn't really go into the fact that there are also Anti-Ballistic missiles that are probably positioned all over South Korea and Japan, plus any number of submarines in the sea.  I'm betting there's round the clock surveillance of NK, so the moment these sites detect a launch, the ballistic missile has shot the Nuke out of the air, and North Korea has become glass...

North Korea may have the ability to launch nukes, but I doubt they have the numbers to overwhelm American defense or have the technology to counter the Anti-Ballistic missiles we'd shoot the nukes down with.

I think part of the real reason we're hesitating is that we're trying to figure out how to deal with NK without a huge loss of civilian life.  The North Korean government is not the people's fault, and how would it look to bomb an NK concentration camp filled with innocent people?  It's a humanitarian issue on top of a rogue nation issue.

This video is a very 'war game' approach to diplomacy, which is fine, but like China told Trump, this shit is complicated...

	<TEXT> Sorry, but you should look at the stats.  The Russians faced the brunt of that war.  Their experience was beyond what an American could comprehend at that time.  Sure, War is hell on all fronts...  But the Soviets were in a deeper part of hell.  Stalingrad is a good example.  

That battle was fought for 6+ months, and they lost just under 500,000 people.  The Germans lost 700,000 too.  Those are numbers so outside the American experience of both WW1 and 2. 

The most lost in an American battle during the war was the Battle of the Bulge, which was just under 20,000.  Despite what the media presents, Soviet blood won that war. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think people put too much relation on the law as the morally right thing to do.  Laws are created by politicians, and sometimes what they want is not really the morally right thing.  For example, I think arresting people for marijuana possession is morally wrong, but it is illegal.  You can recognize the law and also have your morality placed against it too.

When he got punched the first time I was like, "Yeah, that makes sense.  That was bound to happen." I felt it appropriate and also recognized that it was technically assault.  Punching that dude was illegal, but yeah...  Assholes like him deserved to be punched.  But you got to know that you're committing a crime, and be willing to face the consequences of that.  That's why he was wearing all black, covered his face, and ran away, lol </TEXT>

Yeah, I remember that mod!  It made everyone look more gritty and worn down, and it added a bunch of environmental stuff that made certain narrative scenes stand out more.

What I'm curious about is if they can rework the lipsync to be better...  From what I've been reading, the dialogue runs on an algorithm that creates accurate lipsync to match what's being said.  I don't know much about code, but is that a simple fix or something that'd need a LOT of work and testing?   </TEXT>

I'm from Atlanta, so I'd recommend my city for more trendy, foody kind of stuff, but we're lacking in major attractions.  Savannah, Georgia is a really cool look at the American south, and you'll get a lot of history not only in museums but in the architecture too.  

Just be mindful that the U.S. is a HUGE place, and you probably won't be able to do a ton within your time frame.  have you thought about limiting your trip to one coastline? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having not played Dragon Age: Inquisition, I'm wondering why this... A game from a couple of years ago, looks better than Andromeda.  Sure, the lips move weirdly, but the voices and face textures are enough to give the characters a realistic feel.  In Andromeda...  They look so pasty and doll like. 

It's such a mess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's so weird that a video game led to his career in TV acting.
