	<TEXT> Yeah, that's another thing... I always hear people talking about how Ripley is one of the greatest female protagonists of all time, but she isn't even the protagonist until more than halfway through Alien (which works for overall unpredictability but not for connecting with the character), and in Aliens she's kind of an asshole. Her delivery of "get away from her, you *bitch!*" was somewhat laughable. Nothing against the actress but I didn't find her character compelling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I watched them both at night in a basement with all the lights off. 99% of the time, this is how I watch movies if I'm not watching them in a theater, and I never have trouble getting sucked in despite the small laptop screen.

Sicario is the most intense movie I've ever seen and that's because it's thoroughly unpredictable. It never shows its hand or hints at what's going to happen next. Alien may be full of original choices that are now considered clichs, but even for its time I can't see how people didn't predict every single death minutes before they happened. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen posts like this in the past in which people definitively state "X movie is overrated and fuck you all for liking it." That's arrogant and close-minded and I don't want this to be like that. Honestly, all I want is some rebuttals to my reasons for not liking the movies so I can understand the appeal.

I regularly hear these two movies being referred to as some of the greatest movies of all time, and I figure that's not just a bandwagoning circlejerk--people like these movies for good reason and I just don't see it. For context, I thought Alien was somewhat okay whereas Aliens is legitimately one of the worst movie-watching experiences I've had in the past couple years. Onto my reasoning:

**ALIEN (Theatrical Cut)**

-My biggest problem with this movie is its ridiculously slow pace. I like slow-burn movies when I feel like the meat of them is substantial and the slowness is necessary--many of my all-time favorite movies are slow-burns--but in Alien, the pacing tended to kill my interest rather than building suspense the way it was supposed to. There is some good character development that takes pace within the slowness of the first two acts, but that's not enough to bring me back to this film in the future. I prefer movies to be good the whole time, not just at the end. (Not that I thought this one was good at the end, but I'll get to that in a minute.)

-It's a horror movie, but it isn't scary. A lot of this is due to the fact that the film really hasn't aged well, especially in regard to the puppet effects. The chestburster scene, by far the best thing in the entire film, is completely ruined by the hilariously bad puppet that bursts out. Maybe it was good for 1979, but by 2017 standards, it's the funniest thing I've seen in a movie all year. In that moment I instantly went from feeling appropriately disturbed to laughing out loud and no longer being able to take the movie seriously. The xenomorph, while not quite as campy-looking as the chestburster, was distracting any time it was on screen and I never felt like it was a legitimate threat. Even in the third act when shit is going down, the alien hasn't shown itself enough or done enough (if any) terrifying things for me to be scared of it popping out at any moment; even if it does, I know it's not going to kill Ripley because the sequel is just as famous and Ripley is on the poster. I know that wasn't necessarily an issue pre-1986, but it forever will be now.

-All the deaths and most of the story beats are entirely predictable. I know this is partially because Alien has had a lot of imitators over the years--see *Life (2017)*--but I've made a point of avoiding all of them up to this point, and I still thought Alien telegraphed its every move way too far in advance. Character goes to do something by themselves? Dead. This happens, what, five times? Here's another one: Ripley's been on the shuttle for longer than two minutes and the credits still haven't rolled? The xenomorph is on the shuttle. I'd be shocked if anyone has ever watched this movie and *didn't* see that coming. To be fair, I didn't predict the android twist, which was one of the better plot points, for sure--I also didn't see the fill-the-shuttle-with-random-types-of-gas-until-one-of-them-just-so-happens-to-be-the-weakness-of-the-alien bit coming, although that's purely because it was so stupid and overly convenient.

-The xenomorph isn't a compelling villain. Does it want to eat people so it can grow? No, it grows to full size in a very short window of time, and we never find out how. It didn't eat anybody before then, and they never find a large portion of the ship eaten out, which would have made sense considering its acidic properties. Does it want to kill people because it's an alien that wants to kill people because it's an alien? Yes? Well shit, that's not very interesting. You can have a monster antagonist like that *if it's scary*, but the xenomorph isn't.

-These next few are a lot more nitpicky, but they still stood out to me, so fuck it. -- The device that can detect micro changes in the air is insanely inconsistent. It can detect a cat moving behind a solid iron door (if it was even moving--it was probably just sitting the whole time, wasn't it?), but it can't detect the air moving through the pipes behind the walls that later get punctured and are spewing steam everywhere? Okay, fine. It can detect a cat behind a solid iron door but it can't detect Ripley walking *directly in front of it?* Yes, that happens. Rewatch the movie. (Also, if it could detect "micro changes" in the air, it would definitely be reacting to the air in a room being displaced by people simply moving around in it... but if I actually liked this movie I wouldn't be complaining about something like that, so I'll let it slide, I guess.)

-The tagline of the movie is "In space, no one can hear you scream." Which is probably the best tagline you could ever come up with for a horror movie set in space. But when the Nostromo explodes, it makes explosion noises. So... that sort of diminishes the awesomeness of that line, doesn't it?

-And lastly, some other nitpicky things, like when Ripley is singing at the end but it's layered on top of multiple shots in which her mouth clearly isn't moving... or what was the cat eating while everybody was in hypersleep...? K, I'm done. Bottom line is I found the movie not very suspenseful and not at all scary, and there's nothing about it that would ever draw me back to it. I can go rewatch the chestburster scene on YouTube and immediately click away when the puppet shows up, and that'll be a more positive experience than I had watching the full movie.

**ALIENS (Director's Cut)**

-The biggest problem I have with Aliens is, once again, the slowness of it. It's much more of an issue for me this time around, because while Alien was a slow-burn horror suspense film and therefore much more forgivable when it comes to pacing, Aliens is an action film. An action film in which no action takes place until 75 minutes in, and even then it's only a smattering of it until 45 minutes later when the third act finally happens and slightly lifts the movie out of the grave it's been digging for itself.

-From a cinematography perspective, the first film was quite visually appealing. All of that is lost here. There are some impressive visual effects every now and again, but as a whole the movie looks and feels thoroughly dead and joyless. I was unpleasantly reminded of Suicide Squad many times while watching Aliens, and that's never a good sign. More on that in the next paragraph.

-It rehashes many of the plot elements from the first film, but doesn't do anything at all to build on them or change them in a significant way. This is especially frustrating when you consider that essentially everything about the first film is better... except for the puppet effects, which still aren't fully believable in this movie but are much better than in Alien. Still, the characters in Alien are better (Bill Paxton was great though, probably the only thing about Aliens I actually loved), the story is more streamlined, the setting is more claustrophobic... as much as I don't love the first film, almost everything about it feels deliberate and meticulously executed. Aliens is technically and narratively a complete mess. I honestly don't see what sets it apart from something like Suicide Squad. They share the same haphazard action, bland color palette, mostly disposable characters, and disjointed pacing. The only difference is that Aliens' script isn't complete garbage and Ripley is a bit more compelling than Harley Quinn.

-The girl who plays Newt is far from being the worst child actress ever, but she's still not very good. She's only ever doing one of two things: whisper-mumbling or screaming at the top of her goddamn lungs. "They mostly come at night... mostly" is a great line, but her delivery completely kills any amount of dread that line should have induced in me.

-Ripley realizes that guns going off within a certain area will set the whole place ablaze, and after explaining it to mission-control-man-whose-name-I-can't-remember, he informs the soldiers that they are not to fire their guns. He doesn't explain why, though, so the soldiers give their bullets to the squad commander and then immediately share backup bullets with each other. I'm not sure why they were hiding bullets in the first place, but in any case, they still have bullets and they obviously see no reason not to fire them. Minutes later, they're attacked by xenomorphs, but they don't fire the bullets. Is there any reasoning behind this other than the plot needing them not to be dead yet? Maybe I missed something.

-In the final sequence, Ripley's leg is grabbed by the xenomorph, conveniently while she's right next to a lever that opens the airlock. But after she gets rid of the xenomorph, she has to dramatically climb all the way up the ladder to reach a *different* control panel so she can close the airlock with a different door. Why not just pull the lever again and close the door she initially opened?

-----------

Props to anyone who actually read this. I really wish I could like these movies and maybe I'll watch them again in the future, but for the time being I'd really appreciate it if somebody could please explain why my reasons are wrong, or in any case, why the movies are actually good (by modern standards, not just by 70s/80s standards). I don't love being in the minority when it comes to movies that everybody expect me seems to love for reasons I don't understand. This is the most extreme case I've come across so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Between the Ringed Inner Wall and Ringed City Streets bonfire, in the area with the respawning Harald Legion Knights, I can see a higher area that I have no idea how to access. I know I should be able to access it because I can see a ladder up there. For context, I already did the segment with the Crystal Lizard that runs toward the Ringed Knight across the bridge above where the Harald Legion Knights spawn--I'm talking about the area above that.

I can't find any other threads asking about it, so I know the answer is probably incredibly obvious, but I can't for the life of me find the entrance. How do I get up there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand the purpose of it, but I think the darkness you're talking about dominates too much of the film to the point where it stops accomplishing that or being worth it when it does pay off. Ronan's stereotypical villain persona exists purely to set up the dance scene at the end, but his stereotypical villain scenes are still in the movie, so was it really worth it? In my opinion, no. But I'm not saying anybody else is wrong for thinking that and similar attempts *do* work, or for liking the movie as a whole. The video isn't a personal attack on the fanbase, regardless of how people seem to be taking it. </TEXT>

I'm having a hard time deciding where to put this in my episode rankings, because all things considered (direction, writing, acting, pacing, etc.) I think this is objectively the best episode of Black Mirror by far; yet in the future I probably won't rewatch it as much as something like White Christmas.

My only complaint is that we don't get to see Kelly and Yorkie meet up for the first time after Kelly decides to commit herself to San Junipero. That had the potential to be such a powerful moment and I would have liked the episode to end with that before seeing the clips that were sprinkled through the credits. </TEXT>
