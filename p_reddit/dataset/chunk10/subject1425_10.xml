	<TEXT> Takes place in a community from the future. Not futuristic but in terms of timing/ foreshadowing. Similar to "The Hunger Games"  or "Divergent". It is a society that lives by a set of governing rules that ensure what happened in the past doesn't happen again. The "Present" society is a very modernized, advanced version of the first, primitive times of humans like tribes for example. The movie plot involves a young group of kids challenging the views and wanting to privatize human needs like water, food, etc. they learn lessons throughout their greed journey that cite the "barbaric" times when those were the exact things that put humanity at risk of extinction.... then some trippy shit happens and people watching it *gasp* in awe. 

Sorry, pretty high. </TEXT>
