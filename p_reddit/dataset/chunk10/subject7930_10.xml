	<TEXT> Hey guys. Newbie both to this thread and bonsai. Received a mass market Juniper for my birthday about a month ago, and just bought a Dwarf Jade today that I'm pretty sure was a rip off but I couldn't resist. I would love any advice (soil, shape, watering, etc) for the juniper and the jade (if it is even worth keeping).

Here's the Juniper: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/itZp0QU.jpg)

Here's the Jade: [Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/lo3b0o5.jpg)

I'm sure this is obnoxious but please break down any bonsai terminology a la ELI5 so that I can grow and not ask stupid questions in the future. Thanks so much!!

EDIT: I just set my flair but just in case; I live in NYC </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ramen, probably.

In all seriousness though, that's a helpful story. Reminds me of the serenity prayer. 

"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change; courage to change the things I can; and wisdom to know the difference."

We can't always change everything about our circumstances, but we can always change our perspective. And I know I'm guilty of simply allowing myself to be overwhelmed by hard seasons of life, instead of taking the time to see what hard work I can do to make those seasons better, and maybe even create some beauty.

	<TEXT> I am pretty shocked by the racist comments on this thread, though with the anonymity of Reddit I suppose I shouldn't be shocked by cowardice and childish humor. Latinx creatives are responsible for some of the greatest film of our time. Cuaron, Lubezki, Inarritu. Latinos make up 17.6% of the [population](https://www.census.gov/newsroom/facts-for-features/2016/cb16-ff16.html), almost a fifth of the total US population. From a purely statistical standpoint, "Hispanic" audiences matter. I am saddened by the ignorance and condescension showcased in these comments, but I have faith in the strength of the creative and enterprising spirit of Latinx Americans such as myself and my family that worked hard to create opportunities that allowed my love for film to exist. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Since we brought up Pendragon.. Anyone else read The Keys to the Kingdom series by Garth Nix? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-29 23:26:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These books completely engulfed me as a kid. Definitely one of those situations where I hated coming to the end of each volume because the next part of the series had not yet been written.

The mythology that Nix creates is so compellingly well crafted and yet so very accessible. Obvious religious parallels abound, such as each of the seven Trustees being afflicted with a particular sin to match the seven deadly sins (Mister Monday: Sloth, Grim Tuesday: Greed, Drowned Wednesday: Gluttony, Sir Thursday: Wrath, Lady Friday: Lust, Superior Saturday: Envy, Lord Sunday: Pride) or the idea of "Nothing" being an actual material substance from which the entire Universe was formed.

Each of the 7 unique keys and their powers, the 7 separate realms of "The House", the 7 Trustees, the 7 dials, the Nithlings, the Old One and the Architect (as well as their three sons), all the characters and moments which exist as mythological or literary references- all these things come together to create an incredible and unforgettable ride through "The House".

The books are nowhere near as dense as Harry Potter or LOTR but, for me, the mythology was just as intriguing. Perhaps even more so because of the brevity. One of my favorite and most nostalgic YA book series. </TEXT>

<WRITING>
	<TITLE> Guardians Vol. 2: could the fact that the marketing lacks a villain with strong presence be the reason the hype seems somewhat subdued? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-18 05:58:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes. I realize the hype is real and present, but it seems to me that the hype is generally much more subdued than I expected it to be especially after the unexpected success of the first film. And I say that as someone who LOVES the first film, has seen it an embarrassing amount of times, and currently has a GOTG poster hanging on my bedroom wall. 

The marketing thus far hasn't really presented a singular villain. We see Ayesha, but there isn't really a threatening or iconic presence of villainy surrounding her. And I don't mean a campy presence, but in comparison to other villains like Loki, Ultron, Vulture, Winter Soldier, etc. she just doesn't seem to have a powerful presence. I realize that she is likely not the only foe the Guardians will face, but maybe the reason there isn't more hype is because we don't know what our heroes are up against? 

So that's a theory I came up with while mulling over reasons I'm not as excited as I thought I would be for the sequel to my favorite Marvel movie so far. (Still gonna me midnight premiering it though. See you there.)
