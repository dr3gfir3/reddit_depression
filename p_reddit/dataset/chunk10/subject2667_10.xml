	<TITLE> The Family (2013) - Brown Water Flows Through a Top Notch Film </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-06 02:35:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I dont understand why this movie was received with such horrid negativity as if it was the worst movie ever made.   For heaven's sake--all Giovanni Manzoni wanted was clear, not brown water and by God, he did something about it. No kidding. Something quite unusual but that's all I'll comment about it. You simply have to see how Mr.Di Niro a.k.a Manzoni solves this rather perplexing problem.

What a beautifully written, directed and acted film about an all-American family in the witness protection program, hiding out and being protected by Tommy Lee Jones and his agents in Normandy, France. A treasure of a concocted mixture of levity, satire, sarcasm, assault, battery and murder emanating from each of the four Manzoni family members. Gio, his wife, daughter 17 years old and son, a meek, quiet 14 year old unless you tick him off. And the same goes for that gorgeous sister of his who's easy on the eyes but what a temper, fists and knee.

"The Family," all about stateside mobsters seeking revenge for having been snitched on, is NOT meant to be taken as seriously as, for instance, "Goodfellas" and "Casino." On the contrary. It's sort of like a tongue-in-cheek story of vicious folks, if such a thing is possible. Honest injun---this movie is a potpourri of cornball,bullets, bombs and bursting sides with laughter. A "don't miss-flick." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok, I have a question. Assuming the underlying cause of the civil war as you have put it was slavery ,  the question still remains, did the northern states go to war sacrificing thousands of men out of the goodness of their heart for the black man held in slavery or because of the economic ramification of having a free labor source that steals employments from the working man in the north? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've said this before on this sub but I'll say it again..

In a few words, "The Last Kingdom" is all I wanted to see in "Vikings" and I never did. Do your self  favor and start watching this amazing show

The plot is vigorous and every episode is full of twists: we don't wait around for things to happen, they happen. And they don't feel the need to keep half of the episode dull or in a slow pace, just to make some moments stand out, you won't leave your screen for a second because it's all interesting.
Acting, that was my major disappointment with "vikings", is good: let's not fool ourselves, just being intense is not acting, you have to give more to the characters to make them real people.
Although it's filmed mostly in gray, "winterish" colors photography is impressive, full of beautiful wild pictures.
The director has done a good job too, no weird or off center angles where you can't see the face of the actor and you try to guess, no jumpy cameras that make you dizzy and lose focus. The camera follows the action and the feelings and does the intended: it tells the story. Note that there are no obscene sex scenes and meaningless splatter violence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hands down my favorite movie of 2015.This is the kind of movie that would make you want to watch it again and again just to revisit some of the amazing scenes and the way the story is told. A comedy with twists and actually a very good story. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is the way scenes are used to sometimes give unnecessary long shots to unimportant parts and swiftly showing you what action is taking place in various parts. Its not bad, the way they are stitched together keeps your mood light the entire time and you get an occasional laugh at some silly situations.

	<TITLE> A sequel in the works for The Man From U.N.C.L.E. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I loved The Man From U.N.C.L.E. next to The Bourne Trilogy and Casino Royale it is my most beloved Spy movie of all times and I am ecstatic it is getting a Sequel. I was a bit worried that wont be the case because the movie found itself in the unique position of not fitting into the genre it was marketed for. I put this in the same category of "The Princess Bride." It was an unfortunate release in theaters because the marketing department did not know how to send this out to an audience that appreciates exceptional writing, smart acting, great directing, well crafted character development and a story that does not fit into a simple box of "Action" or "Drama" or "Comedy."  It also did not help that they released it along with MI5.

The Man From U.N.C.L.E is truly a fantastic movie that plays to a full story experience. Characters start with depth and grow and progress. Comedy and whit take the place of bad acting. Exceptional writers and directors take the film to a level of making the audience think and become attached to these characters.  As always, Ritchie cleverly subverts each set-piece, letting chase scenes unfold in carefully staged but enjoyably inventive ways, often putting the real action in the background while the characters act as if they're above all this nastiness.

	<TEXT> The first Track "BLOOD" is an interlude but it is one of those tracks for the ages I wish it was a bit longer . The second track "DNA" goes all out on that beat, possibly the best track on the Album.

	<TITLE> Killer Elite (2011) was one of the better thinking man's action flick in recent memory </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-13 22:50:49 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Killer Elite is a macho-action-thriller that didn't have an A-list budget, but probably didn't really need it, either. This movie has an unusual plot in that one is never certain who are the good guys and the bad guys. In fact, by the end of the movie, that question is still unanswered but by then it really doesn't matter because the story is more than just about good versus bad. The fact that the movie was based on an excellent book didnt hurt either. 


Don't know that Jason Statham's a great actor, exactly, but he's definitely a presence and he's got others to do the acting around him, and he performs in a several action scenes that come right up to the edge without getting silly. And I liked the basic plausibility in most of the scenes.

Here are some scenes from the movie [Spoiler Alert]

	<TITLE> The Debt (2010) was a surprisingly enjoyable espionage thriller that went unnoticed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-13 15:17:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is one of those movie gems hiding away waiting for the true film lover to appreciate. Such a well executed story it would be presumed to have been based on a true story. Even though it contains lesser known actors, they seamlessly portray the whole bag of emotions all great films contain. This film is captivating throughout with ever changing turns and twists. Prepare for a perfect blend of action and drama between a trio of foreign Israeli agents chasing a once notorious war criminal in hiding.
Normally not a fan of the switch between present and past that seems to be the most recent trend, however in this example the director uses this in a totally inspired way. Telling the story in well connected chucks and leaving each time step with most questions answered. This allowed the story to flow into the final path taken which at 30 years later in the story is unexpected. A lengthy film that you will never want to end </TEXT>
