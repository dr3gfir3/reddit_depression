	<TEXT> I absolutely agree that SF is more speculative. My problem with calling Fantasy escapist, though, is that it has such a negative connotation. There are plenty of things to be learned from Fantasy, and often (in the books I read) comments on the human condition just as much as Science Fiction, (although much more subtly than other genres). 

Also, is not all fiction escapist? Regardless of whether or not there's a whole new world, readers put themselves in the stories with the other characters and become a part of that world. It's how we connect to it and feel pain when a character we love dies or feel a sense of wonder with them as they see incredible things. We escape into the lives of most main characters. Or at least I do. When I read a book, regardless of the genre, I exit reality for a while simply because I put myself into the main character's reality. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What separates Fantasy from Science Fiction? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm writing my senior thesis on the importance of Fantasy as a genre and I'm attempting to come up with a simple definition of it.

My working (very basic) definition of fantasy is currently: A genre that features the use of supernatural phenomena in the plot, setting, or theme, or characters. It is separated from science fiction by technology, and from horror by intent (although, you could technically have a horror plot in a fantastic setting).

However, I have realized that this definition doesn't really leave a place for movies like Star Wars and others. 

Any thoughts on how I can improve my definition? </TEXT>
