	<TEXT> I would have much preferred had they swapped the roles of the typhon around. 

I.e.: we got Phantoms early on, and mimics sprinkled through the early game with a larger focus on the mimicry the more you get into the game. They are by far the most interested and dangerous (mechanically) enemy in the game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. While for sure they also both hit kooky territory, both of them were foreshadowed by Star Lord. 

Particularly with Hasslehoff, he is a big part of Peters life. He told everyone that Michael Knight from Knight Rider was his dad, making total sense why Ego would morph into him to break Star Lords stride. 

And Pac Man eats all sorts of shit, from fruit, to ghosts, to hardcore pharmaceutical drugs. It's not unreasonable to think that he may be able to eat celestials too :P

Also, Yondu tells Peter to use his heart and not his head. Makes sense to me.  </TEXT>

100% agree with that statement.

to my original query, I just see a lot of instant dismissal of right wing views (not just on reddit) and I thought that's what I was looking at. I was wondering why that is, considering left wing tend to be liberal, and it isn't very liberal not allow *everyone* to have their say and be heard. </TEXT>

As soon as I start being a bit methodical about it I then get my first win. 

Edit: tip from a friend: if you don't mind camping whenever the white circle appears on the map, just head to a building near the centre and camp it, then do it again every time the circle moves. He consistently gets top ten but only one or two kills.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two root things:

Firstly, escapism. Playing a good single player game, whatever the genre allows me to forget about my problems, and visit distant worlds, and experience different stories. It also gives me a whole bunch of (usually) more interesting problems to solve than 'pay that bill' etc. 

Secondly, multiplayer games I see as having a game of golf or something but not needing to have to set aside half a day to do it. I can phone a mate, go online, and have a game of rocket league etc.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We suffered from this too and while we were married five years before we understood what it was, we did get it resolved. 

If you can't go to a sexual therapist yourself, I can only tell you what we were instructed to do:

- Mutual massage three or four days a week. Not sexually at first, but massage everything. Toes, ears, butt cheeks, everything. Over a couple of weeks. Then try massaging each other's private areas with a view to orgasm. 

- while on your own, spend twenty minutes exploring your personal areas, again at least three times a week if possible. 

The goal here is to figure out what other areas you and your gf like having touched aside from your genitals. It's important not to rush this part. 

- then try working on penetration with other things than your penis. You can order dialators specifically for this (which are a really good idea). It might be an idea for her to do this herself at first, and later she can try it while you touch her in other places such as her breasts. 

- when you're ready to try actual penis penetration, we were told to try whatever position felt comfortable for the girl and work on only penetrating a little bit at a time. It's important not to get carried away here. For clarification what I mean is try spreading the lips of her vagina and pressing you glans onto them. Stop, then do other pleasurable things to get off.  Next time, go half an inch further. Girl on top is a really good one for this as it give the woman the most amount of control and she can feel when she is in pain and needs to reduce the deep ness. 


I can't tell you if this will work or not, only that it worked for us. It might also take months so don't get disheartened about it, and use LOTS OF LUBE. Liquid Silk was the only one we tried that didn't irritate my wife, so I would obviously recommend that one, but there are others that leave a tingling sensation etc. Experiment and see what one you guys like best. 

I hope this gets resolved quickly and easily for you, and I also hope that she is looking after your sexual needs while this is going on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guildford, Surrey, England, UK

Historic old town being turned into a modern mess. It's interesting because buildings that are several hundred years old are being pulled down and replaced with futuristic messes which completely go against a town that has existed since the 11th century. It's interesting to see how town planners can cock up their job so badly. 

Besides that:

- It's one of the most expensive places to live outside of London
- It's been voted the best shopping town outside London many times
- Has many locations used in films to see in town and around the local area
- Lewis Carrol lived there
- it is the furthest point considered to be in the outer London built up area  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You answer some of your questions here.

The party limit is there to balance the game. While I admit it's a lazy mechanic (Why not dynamically adjust encounters based to your party size), that's the primary reason it's there. Another reason would be to reduce the amount party chatter dialogue and needs to be implemented.

In regard to the xp loss, there are games where this is compensated for (only the player character has levels, and party members conform to that level), but these days I feel that developers use it as a reason to go out and grind XP and increase playtime for hardcore players. Some folks really enjoy that, which is why it's there but not entirely necessary to complete the game.

When it comes to party management of equipment and skills etc, that is the exact thing i **LOVE** about traditional RPG's. It allows me to attach myself mentally to the companions, as I get to know their strengths and weaknesses. It's an additional *role play* element, and a really powerful one. Baldur's Gate 2 would have been far more shallow had the player had all the abilities and all the NPC companions were there as flat DPS.

Hope that shed's some light on the other side of the coin for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope they leave it alone for a long, long time, preferably after we've seen cyberpunk and perhaps another property from CDPR.

The three games form an *incredible* trilogy. Let them stand as the posted children of how to improve upon a product so well, in pretty much every way and how to deliver value for money in a market that is over flowing in cash grabs and junk.

Bring us back to the world, but not until the original games we've played feel like legends.


Even then, i'd like a plot to play something like:

You play as a young witcher and are sent out to deal with some monster. This leads to deeper more dangerous organised things and you are then sent ouut to find the legendary White Wolf. You search throughout the game solving several other related plotlines, but eventually you find the final resting place of Geralt and the game reveals to you that it is set some 500 years after the end of Witcher 3. This way, you can reference old characters as legends making the world feel familiar, but then makes it disconnected enough to feel fresh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Further to /u/Ironturtle19 's comments, games you should check out would be:

**Top Tier**
- Werewolves Within 
- Until Dawn: Rush of Blood
- RIGS
- Batman
- Resident Evil 7 

( being games I consider must own)

**Good Games**
- Battlefront VR Mission (if you already have the game)
- EVE Valkyrie (multiplayer)
- Battlezone
- The Brookhaven Experiment
- Dirt VR
- Job Simulator 
- Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (if you have local friends)

There are many, many more games and experiences available, but these I would say are the best value for money (for me). It absolutely is an early adopter device, but as we go further into its lifespan we will see more creative experiences and games. Keep an eye on Redemptions Guild and Farpoint. These two look like they will be good.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alien Isolation has very little fighting in it. In fact, instigating a fight in it is a good way to get the Alien to pay the scene a visit. While you can use that as a tactic in a way, you can summon the alien in less dangerous (to you) ways if you want some human troublemakers dealt with.

I haven't played SOMA but the game definitely is more hide and cower focused. Later in the game you are given an effective means to defend yourself from close encounters with the alien, but there are other threats that will basically ignore that weapon which imho are way scarier than the Alien itself.

If you're a fan of the original film, you should absolutely pick it up, but it is the opposite kind of horror game to Dead Space. Think Amnesia: The Dark Descent in the Alien universe. </TEXT>
