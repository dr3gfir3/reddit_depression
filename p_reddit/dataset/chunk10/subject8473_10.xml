	<TEXT> This sounds like a blast! Here are some ideas for you:

Breakfast: Keep it simple. Cereal, milk, fruit juices, fruit, bagels, cream cheese. Go to a bulk store like Costco and buy some muffins, croissants, etc. Eggs to order is just too damn hard. Use the oven to cook bacon. Breakfast casseroles are always easy to prepare ahead of time. 

Lunch: Deli meats with all of the condiments (lettuce, tomato, onion, mayo, mustard, etc.), pasta salads, potato salads, veggie platters, cookies (all things you can buy in bulk)

Dinner: Chili bar, taco bar, burger bar, grill lots of meats... essentially lay out a bunch of ingredients and let people make their own dinner so you don't have to worry about making something each person will like. 

Snacks: use a crock pot to make dips like queso or buffalo chicken dip! Have lots of tortilla chips, cheez its, cheese and crackers for people to munch on </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would recommend using a food processor or hand blender to make the sauce smoother. I've hand chopped everything before and it's a bit too chunky for my liking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, you can't go wrong with some sort of open-face sandwich situation. I'd take some good bread, toast it, top with mashed avocado (salt, pepper, lemon juice), a sprinkle of red pepper flakes and top with a sunny side up egg. Add a slice of ham or bacon if she enjoys meat. It's simple and pleases just about everyone. Some fruit on the side would be nice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She believed in healing crystals and energies. 

After a long, emotionally draining day, I called her to vent. She told me I needed to get these specific crystals, cleanse them and carry them with me in my pocket. </TEXT>
