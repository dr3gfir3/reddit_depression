	<TEXT> There are several groups that want a constitutional convention, like:

- [Citizens for Self-Governance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizens_for_Self-Governance) - behind https://www.conventionofstates.com/

- [Single Subject Amendment](http://singlesubjectamendment.com/)

So far 11 states have called for a convention, the most recent being [Texas](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/texas/articles/2017-05-07/what-to-watch-texas-backs-convention-thatll-never-happen).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A **Convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution**, also called an Article V Convention, or Amendments Convention, called for by two-thirds (currently 34) of the state legislatures, is one of two processes authorized by Article Five of the United States Constitution whereby the Constitution, the nation's frame of government, may be altered. Amendments may also be proposed by the Congress with a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate.

In criminal and civil law, assault is an attempt to initiate harmful or offensive contact with a person, or a threat to do so.[1] It is distinct from battery, which refers to the actual achievement of such contact."

Also curious is that the bio page for one of its writers, [Ron Delancer](http://politicaldig.com/author/politicaldig/), appears to use an altered image of actor [Michael Ealy](http://www.fanpop.com/clubs/michael-ealy/images/31489482/title/michael-ealy-photo).

	<DATE> 2017-04-16 02:32:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There was this video I saw on youtube a few years ago where a guy falls down and his head lands over a crease on the sidewalk between two pavement pieces and one of the pieces impossibly slides up or down and causes his head to slice in half, as in the top-half of his face moves completely away from the bottom-half.

What else I remember:

- this video was produced/manufactured (a.k.a. not in real life)

- it was part of a documentary on what people with OCD feel

- the guy was wearing a suit

- after the head slicing, the eyes blinked

- the gore effects were well-done </TEXT>

(One Republican told me that a friend of his on the Trump campaign used Snapchat to send him a video of Christie fetching Trumps McDonalds order*.)
