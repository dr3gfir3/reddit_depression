(In my case, the film "My Girl" was probably the first movie I watched with my mom that was one of "her" movies as opposed to one of "mine." "Overboard" was another such film.)

Alternatively, which films do you feel best exemplify motherhood?

While recovering in the Hospital Wing, their parents are called and Hermione realizes that the Helion wands have found their masters.

Long story short, the Helion wands were a project that Ollivander and Gorogovitch had worked on together--attempted to recreate the Elder Wand.

Also, their DADA professor was a vampire.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're actually not entirely wrong. Several firearms instructors teach teachers and other school officials for free.

My favorite author, and a firearms expert, wrote an essay on the subject on gun control, and included several passages on the idea of teachers wielding guns to protect schools.

It's a very long read, but well worth it.

	<TEXT> A mixture of things.

Caillou has two basic episode types---one where he learns something in a new environment (camping, a trip to the aquarium, the elementary school for "Little Brother or Sister [or Neighbor] Day"), or one where he must learn to get along with people.

The former episodes aren't that bad, but they're not that good either. Anything Caillou does has already been done, and done better, by Arthur and his friends or Franklin the Turtle or Little Bear or Richard Scarry's cast.

Caillou has a very irritating voice, as far as children show characters are concerned.

And then there's the episodes where Caillou must learn to get along with others. And they're not well-liked, and for good reason. 

One particularly notorious episode revolves around Caillou getting ready to go to the circus. He throws a tantrum when he learns that the circus trip isn't *today,* it's *tomorrow.*
Rather than a lesson in patience or carefully planning events, Caillou pouts and whines until his family put on their own little circus at home. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TV Show: *How I Met Your Mother,* Season Six. Episode "Bad News" ends with Marshall stunned to learn of his father's death. 

The twist is that Jason Segel's script didn't include that revelation, so his heartbroken shock and stammer of "My dad's dead?" is genuine.

Movie: *The Avengers,* specifically when the team is beginning to organize and examine the scepter. Tony Stark waltzes in and offers Bruce Banner a blueberry. 

That's not only unscripted, but Robert Downey Jr. apparently would hide food on the set and then eat it when he was hungry. So not only was the line not in the script, neither was the eating of blueberries.

Honorable Mention: This must be a thing with Robert Downey Jr. In the film *Captain America: Civil War,* there's a scene where Tony Stark is talking to Peter Parker and Stark asks Parker to move his leg so he can sit down. 

That's real. Tom Holland, who played Peter Parker, was star-struck and forgot his precise seating position. So Downey asked him to scoot over and they kept it in.

Edit: I can't count. It was Season Six.

	<TEXT> The sequels actually have their share of dark themes as well.

"Goes to Mars" flat-out states that the appliances intend to destroy the Earth with a nuclear missile. There's also the elements of planned obsolescence, with machines falling apart far earlier than their predecessors. 
Also, Toaster and his friends, notably Kirby, accept their fate as objects that are not intended to last forever--Kirby affirms that "There's no shame in wearing out, if you've done what you've been built for."

"To the Rescue" has its share of darkness too. Sebastian the Monkey was experimented on in a disgusting animal laboratory, his arm mutilated, and then shown to the audience via silhouette. When Radio accidentally breaks the rare tube required to fix the supercomputer, he pulls out his own to use instead--effectively killing himself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The book is even sadder.

The hound and the fox aren't friends at all. They're mortal enemies and the hunter trains the hound to hunt the fox, after the fox causes the death of another hound.

But the fox is clever and the hound is a proud hunter. And as their world becomes more and more modernized, and less and less wild they become more reliant on each other, since it's the only thing that is familiar.

The fox loses his first mate and kits to the hound and the hunter. He also watches as his woods become smaller. Worst of all, he watches his fellow foxes, not become extinct, but become less and less civilized. His neighbor foxes stop mating for life and resort to scavenging garbage, instead of hunting game.

The hound's master is constantly told by the townsfolk to retire to an old folks' home. One that does not allow dogs.

The book climaxes with the hunter and hound chasing the fox one final time, after an outbreak of rabies. The fox collapses from exhaustion and dies, and the hound is near death as well. The hunter nurses him back to health, but then is once again pressured to the retirement home. The book ends with the tearful hunter picking up his shotgun, and taking his ancient hound outside one final time.

	<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

These five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.
Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Outside of anecdotal reports, African lions do not appear to exhibit melanism. However, there is at least one, potentially, partially-melanistic individual that has a leg that is noticeably darker in color than the rest of its body.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

************

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2986109/Do-male-tigers-play-dad-Camera-trap-captures-rare-family-portrait-Amur-tiger-couple-three-cubs-wild.html?ITO=1490 ns_mchannel=rss ns_campaign=1490
