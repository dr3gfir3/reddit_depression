	<TEXT> I can't say enough good things about this movie. Everyone in it gives 110%. Mike Myers, Nancy Travis, Anthony Lapaglia, Alan Arkin, Amanda Plummer, Phil Hartman, Steven Wright and more. It boasts a great soundtrack as well. I'll be honest in that the final act falls apart a bit but it's still such a great moive. My whole family quotes this movie almost on a daily basis. I hope the younger generations will give it a chance and get to yell, "We have a piper down" for many generations to come!!

Fun Fact : IIRC this is the last movie that Mike Myers was in without wearing any type of facial prosthetic. 

Edit: Don't judge the film by the trailer. It's horrible. Here's a better clip that features Mike Myers playing the part of his Scottish father. - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKRFlNryaWw </TEXT>

Edit: TIL, According to Joan Cusack, the 2008 film War, Inc. is an informal sequel. Both films are similar in style and theme, and both films star John as an assassin and his sister Joan as his assistant, with Dan Aykroyd in a supporting role. - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grosse_Pointe_Blank </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's really a few reasons that all come together to make it a great gaming experience. Firstly the music. The music in the game is so memorable and really makes you feel what's happening. Like Frog's theme for example. Such a good song for a "hero that has risen from the ashes" so to speak. Or Magus's dark theme song that is simple but mysterious at the same time. 

Another aspect to the game that makes it so good is how polished and complete it is. From all the little details in the backgrounds to mini games and side quests all with deep back stories that can alter time lines. There are multiple endings to the game so the replay value is there as well and "New Game +" is a nice touch.

The artwork of the game garnered a huge following alone and rightly so. The characters were designed by Akira Toriyama also known as the creator of Dragon Ball Z. His animations back then were some of the best coming out of Japan and had a huge impact on how Americans viewed Japanese Animation.

The main story line was very fresh when it came out and still holds up today. Everything went right for this game and it's ok if you aren't that into it. I remember my brother in-law buying the game when it came out along with the guide and even just watching him play was captivating at the time. I'm in the middle of a play through right now and I'm using a pdf file of the official Brady Games guide along the way for any secrets I may have missed in the past. I highly suggest playing the game with a guide your first time to help you progress with the story and to get the most out of the game.  While it may seem similar to other JRPGs of the time Chrono Trigger is *thee* JRPG of the time.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Mask (1994) Great use of Practical and Special effects that still hold up today while Jim Carrey captures the essence of classic cartoons. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-24 16:11:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I decided to watch this movie last night after not seeing it in about 10 years. Jim Carrey nailed the role and in my opinion no one else could have even came close to his performance.


As I watched I was mesmerized at the way he delivered each line as the "Mask". It's like he was born to play this role. He is a walking cartoon and it worked perfect in this movie. I like the night and day aspect of him being a "serious banker" during the day and a cartoon loving man child at night. Every little mannerism he does just adds to the charm of the character. His voice was amazing and I'm honestly surprised he wasn't used as a voice actor more often. 

I was around 10 when the movie came out and absolutely loved it as a kid. So many quotable lines. Not to mention Cameron Diaz at the beginning of her career looking very beautiful. The film has an overall "noire" feeling that adds to the Nostalgia as well. Carrey was also in Dumb and Dumber and Ace Ventura in the same year. Say what you will about his career recently but there is no doubting he was a comedic genius in the 90's.

So treat yourself to watching The Mask again. It's a very fun movie with awesome special effects and it's great for the whole family as well.

Here's a short clip to show off some of the effects and chops of Carrey. For those who have not seen the film, spoilers ahead: https://youtu.be/7fTavlU7-rs </TEXT>

If you enjoy complicated time travel rules check out Primer. I'm not saying it's perfect, but it's a lot better than the mess that Looper turned into. 


That being said, I thought the cgi done to JGL's face was better than most facial cgi we get.

	<TEXT> I remember thinking I'll never have a *movie* blow my mind like that ever again, and that there would never be a better science fiction film in my lifetime.

20 years later I still haven't had a mind blowing movie experience like that again. Closest I can think of is Everest (2015). Something happened inside me while watching it months ago that I can't explain.

The Matrix is still my favorite science fiction with many runner ups.

edit: I need to make it clear that what I felt by Everest was very personal and quite difficult to explain. I'm in no way saying Everest is a mind blowing film to the likes of The Matrix. The affect the movie had on me was mind blowing.

**Don Draper** writing the Coka Cola ad after staying with the hippies in the series finale of **Mad Men**. At first I was like wait.. . did he write that? .. .that's it, that's the closure we get, another ad. Then I started to think on it a bit and I think that ending scene actually did give Don Draper the character, the closure he deserved. 

Overall I was blown away by the whole series. When telling my friends about it I refer to it as *Nick @ Nite rated R* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For whatever reason this movie doesn't get the love it deserves. I will say the trailer makes it look very dry and soulless but it's quite the opposite. It's perfect for this time of year and it's actually really funny. It really nails the feeling of being a kid mystified by a haunted house in your neighbor hood.  Whether you watch it by yourself or with the family it's really enjoyable.

edit: Another user pointed out that Dan Harmon of Rick and Morty and The Community wrote the movie which is another reason to check it out if you're a fan of his work. Thanks u/OneManFreakShow
