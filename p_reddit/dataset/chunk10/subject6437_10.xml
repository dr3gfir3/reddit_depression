A multidisciplinary approach to designing and evaluating Electronic Medical Record portal messages that support patient self-care. 

Journal of Biomedical Informatics, 2017; 69: 63 

DOI: 10.1016/j.jbi.2017.03.015

Abstract:

 We describe a project intended to improve the use of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) patient portal information by older adults with diverse numeracy and literacy abilities, so that portals can better support patient-centered care. Patient portals are intended to bridge patients and providers by ensuring patients have continuous access to their health information and services. However, they are underutilized, especially by older adults with low health literacy, because they often function more as information repositories than as tools to engage patients. We outline an interdisciplinary approach to designing and evaluating portal-based messages that convey clinical test results so as to support patient-centered care. We first describe a theory-based framework for designing effective messages for patients. This involves analyzing shortcomings of the standard portal message format (presenting numerical test results with little context to guide comprehension) and developing verbally, graphically, video- and computer agent-based formats that enhance context. The framework encompasses theories from cognitive and behavioral science (health literacy, fuzzy trace memory, behavior change) as well as computational/engineering approaches (e.g., image and speech processing models). We then describe an approach to evaluating whether the formats improve comprehension of and responses to the messages about test results, focusing on our methods. The approach combines quantitative (e.g., response accuracy, Likert scale responses) and qualitative (interview) measures, as well as experimental and individual difference methods in order to investigate which formats are more effective, and whether some formats benefit some types of patients more than others. We also report the results of two pilot studies conducted as part of developing the message formats. </TEXT>

Timelines of translational science: From technology initiation to FDA approval

Laura M. McNamee, Michael Jay Walsh, Fred D. Ledley

PLoS ONE 12(5): e0177371. 

doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0177371

Link: http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177371

Abstract:

 While timelines for clinical development have been extensively studied, there is little data on the broader path from initiation of research on novel drug targets, to approval of drugs based on this research. We examined timelines of translational science for 138 drugs and biologicals approved by the FDA from 20102014 using an analytical model of technology maturation. Research on targets for 102 products exhibited a characteristic (S-curve) maturation pattern with exponential growth between statistically defined technology initiation and established points. The median initiation was 1974, with a median of 25 years to the established point, 28 years to first clinical trials, and 36 years to FDA approval. No products were approved before the established point, and development timelines were significantly longer when the clinical trials began before this point (11.5 vs 8.5 years, p0.0005). Technological maturation represents the longest stage of translation, and significantly impacts the efficiency of drug development. </TEXT>

Whose Job Will Be Taken Over by a Computer? The Role of Personality in Predicting Job Computerizability over the Lifespan. 

European Journal of Personality, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1002/per.2103

Link: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/05/170509122024.htm

Abstract:

 Economists estimate that 47% of US jobs will be computerized in the future. This paper tests the prospective role of a comprehensive range personality factors on selection into more (or less) computerizable jobs. We used a US representative high school sample (N = 346 660) and a longitudinal design. At baseline, we measured social background, intelligence, personality traits and vocational interests. In two follow-ups (11 and 50 years later), we recorded occupations and coded their probability of being computerized based on the skills required and technological developments. Multiple regressions showed that, regardless of social background, people who were more intelligent, mature, interested in arts, and sciences at baseline, and selected into jobs that had a lower probability of computerization. On average, a one standard deviation increase in each of these traits predicted an average of 4 percentage points drop in the probability of one's job of being computerized. At the US population level, this is equivalent with saving 5.8 million people from losing their future careers to computerization. Most effects replicated across time. Path analyses showed that educational attainment mediated these effects and some direct effects remained. This highlights the importance of personality on occupational selection and in shaping the labour market. Copyright  2017 European Association of Personality Psychology </TEXT>

Inequalities in Life Expectancy Among US Counties, 1980 to 2014 Temporal Trends and Key Drivers. 

JAMA Internal Medicine, 2017 

DOI: 10.1001/jamainternmed.2017.0918

Abstract:

 Importance  Examining life expectancy by county allows for tracking geographic disparities over time and assessing factors related to these disparities. This information is potentially useful for policy makers, clinicians, and researchers seeking to reduce disparities and increase longevity.

 Objective  To estimate annual life tables by county from 1980 to 2014; describe trends in geographic inequalities in life expectancy and age-specific risk of death; and assess the proportion of variation in life expectancy explained by variation in socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.

 Design, Setting, and Participants  Annual county-level life tables were constructed using small area estimation methods from deidentified death records from the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), and population counts from the US Census Bureau, NCHS, and the Human Mortality Database. Measures of geographic inequality in life expectancy and age-specific mortality risk were calculated. Principal component analysis and ordinary least squares regression were used to examine the county-level association between life expectancy and socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors.

 Exposures  County of residence.

 Main Outcomes and Measures  Life expectancy at birth and age-specific mortality risk.

 Results  Counties were combined as needed to create stable units of analysis over the period 1980 to 2014, reducing the number of areas analyzed from 3142 to 3110. In 2014, life expectancy at birth for both sexes combined was 79.1 (95% uncertainty interval [UI], 79.0-79.1) years overall, but differed by 20.1 (95% UI, 19.1-21.3) years between the counties with the lowest and highest life expectancy. Absolute geographic inequality in life expectancy increased between 1980 and 2014. Over the same period, absolute geographic inequality in the risk of death decreased among children and adolescents, but increased among older adults. Socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors explained 60%, 74%, and 27% of county-level variation in life expectancy, respectively. Combined, these factors explained 74% of this variation. Most of the association between socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors and life expectancy was mediated through behavioral and metabolic risk factors.

 Conclusions and Relevance  Geographic disparities in life expectancy among US counties are large and increasing. Much of the variation in life expectancy among counties can be explained by a combination of socioeconomic and race/ethnicity factors, behavioral and metabolic risk factors, and health care factors. Policy action targeting socioeconomic factors and behavioral and metabolic risk factors may help reverse the trend of increasing disparities in life expectancy in the United States. </TEXT>

Cell-specific pallidal intervention induces long-lasting motor recovery in dopamine-depleted mice

Kevin J Mastro, Kevin T Zitelli, Amanda M Willard, Kimberly H Leblanc, Alexxai V Kravitz   Aryn H Gittis

Nature Neuroscience (2017) 

doi:10.1038/nn.4559

Published online 08 May 2017

Abstract:

 The identification of distinct cell types in the basal ganglia has been critical to our understanding of basal ganglia function and the treatment of neurological disorders. The external globus pallidus (GPe) is a key contributor to motor suppressing pathways in the basal ganglia, yet its neuronal heterogeneity has remained an untapped resource for therapeutic interventions. Here we demonstrate that optogenetic interventions that dissociate the activity of two neuronal populations in the GPe, elevating the activity of parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GPe neurons over that of Lim homeobox 6 (Lhx6)-expressing GPe neurons, restores movement in dopamine-depleted mice and attenuates pathological activity of basal ganglia output neurons for hours beyond stimulation. These results establish the utility of cell-specific interventions in the GPe to target functionally distinct pathways, with the potential to induce long-lasting recovery of movement despite the continued absence of dopamine. </TEXT>

Abstract: 

 The balance between detrimental, pro-aging, often stochastic processes and counteracting homeostatic mechanisms largely determines the progression of aging. There is substantial evidence suggesting that the endocannabinoid system (ECS) is part of the latter system because it modulates the physiological processes underlying aging1, 2. The activity of the ECS declines during aging, as CB1 receptor expression and coupling to G proteins are reduced in the brain tissues of older animals3, 4, 5 and the levels of the major endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) are lower6. However, a direct link between endocannabinoid tone and aging symptoms has not been demonstrated. Here we show that a low dose of 9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) reversed the age-related decline in cognitive performance of mice aged 12 and 18 months. This behavioral effect was accompanied by enhanced expression of synaptic marker proteins and increased hippocampal spine density. THC treatment restored hippocampal gene transcription patterns such that the expression profiles of THC-treated mice aged 12 months closely resembled those of THC-free animals aged 2 months. The transcriptional effects of THC were critically dependent on glutamatergic CB1 receptors and histone acetylation, as their inhibition blocked the beneficial effects of THC. Thus, restoration of CB1 signaling in old individuals could be an effective strategy to treat age-related cognitive impairments. </TEXT>

The Role of Family Characteristics for Students Academic Outcomes: A Person-Centered Approach. 

Child Development, 2017;

Abstract

 Using data from 1,571 ninth-grade students (Mage = 14.62) from 82 academic track schools in Germany and their predominantly Caucasian middle-class parents, configurations of different family characteristics reported by parents were investigated. Latent profile analyses considering academic involvement, family interest, parents self-concept, child's need for support, and parents time and energy identified average, indifferent, motivated and engaged, motivated and disengaged, and involved families. Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations with students motivational (self-concept, effort, and interest) and achievement outcomes (achievement test and grades) in math were analyzed. Students from families classified as motivated and disengaged showed higher initial levels motivation and achievement. Over 5 months, these students also showed an increase in self-concept and higher achievement than students from other family types.

Retirement and Socioeconomic Differences in Diurnal Cortisol: Longitudinal Evidence From a Cohort of British Civil Servants 

Tarani Chandola  Patrick Rouxel  Michael G. Marmot  Meena Kumari

J Gerontol B Psychol Sci Soc Sci gbx058. 

DOI: https://doi.org/10.1093/geronb/gbx058

Published: 05 May 2017

Full-text link: https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/geronb/gbx058

Abstract:

 Objectives:

 Early old age and the period around retirement are associated with a widening in socioeconomic inequalities in health. There are few studies that address the stress-biological factors related to this widening. This study examined whether retirement is associated with more advantageous (steeper) diurnal cortisol profiles, and differences in this association by occupational grade.

 Method:

 Data from the 7th (20022004), 8th (2006), and 9th (200709) phases of the London-based Whitehall II civil servants study were analysed. Thousand hundred and forty three respondents who were employed at phase 8 (mean age 59.9 years) and who had salivary cortisol measured from five samples collected across the day at phases 7 and 9 were analysed.

 Results:

 Retirement was associated with steeper diurnal slopes compared to those who remained in work. Employees in the lowest grades had flatter diurnal cortisol slopes compared to those in the highest grades. Low-grade retirees in particular had flatter diurnal slopes compared to high-grade retirees.

 Discussion:

 Socioeconomic differences in a biomarker associated with stress increase, rather than decrease, around the retirement period. These biological differences associated with transitions into retirement for different occupational groups may partly explain the pattern of widening social inequalities in health in early old age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi - I wouldn't say I'm "well-versed" - I don't do research in this area but try to be "well-read" if that makes sense. Overall, there hasn't been much progress beyond what is evidence-based treatment using minoxidil or finasteride. There is still little evidence for laser or stem cell treatments although active research still occurs. As someone else posted, any potential therapies in this space, like most cosmetic treatment, could be a potential goldmine if commercialised so the incentive is there. So to answer your question, I think we are still many years off from a "cure". Research like this looking at the genesis of baldness helps potential areas for therapies to target.  </TEXT>

Chung-Ping Liao, Reid C. Booker, Sean J. Morrison, Lu Q. Le. Identification of hair shaft progenitors that create a niche for hair pigmentation. 

Genes   Development, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1101/gad.298703.117

Abstract:

 Hair differentiates from follicle stem cells through progenitor cells in the matrix. In contrast to stem cells in the bulge, the identities of the progenitors and the mechanisms by which they regulate hair shaft components are poorly understood. Hair is also pigmented by melanocytes in the follicle. However, the niche that regulates follicular melanocytes is not well characterized. Here, we report the identification of hair shaft progenitors in the matrix that are differentiated from follicular epithelial cells expressing transcription factor KROX20. Depletion of Krox20 lineage cells results in arrest of hair growth, confirming the critical role of KROX20+ cells as antecedents of structural cells found in hair. Expression of stem cell factor (SCF) by these cells is necessary for the maintenance of differentiated melanocytes and for hair pigmentation. Our findings reveal the identities of hair matrix progenitors that regulate hair growth and pigmentation, partly by creating an SCF-dependent niche for follicular melanocytes.

Safety Profile of Cough and Cold Medication Use in Pediatrics

Jody L. Green, George Sam Wang, Kate M. Reynolds, William Banner, G. Randall Bond, Ralph E. Kauffman, Robert B. Palmer, Ian M. Paul, Richard C. Dart

Published Online (date) May 04, 2017

Abstract:

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The safety of cough and cold medication (CCM) use in children has been questioned. We describe the safety profile of CCMs in children 12 years of age from a multisystem surveillance program.

 METHODS: Cases with adverse events (AEs) after ingestion of at least 1 index CCM ingredient (brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dextromethorphan, diphenhydramine, doxylamine, guaifenesin, phenylephrine, and pseudoephedrine) in children 12 years of age were collected from 5 data sources. An expert panel determined relatedness, dose, intent, and risk factors. Case characteristics and AEs are described.

 RESULTS: Of the 4202 cases reviewed, 3251 (77.4%) were determined to be at least potentially related to a CCM, with accidental unsupervised ingestions (67.1%) and medication errors (13.0%) the most common exposure types. Liquid (67.3%), pediatric (75.5%), and single-ingredient (77.5%) formulations were most commonly involved. AEs occurring in 20% of all cases included tachycardia, somnolence, hallucinations, ataxia, mydriasis, and agitation. Twenty cases (0.6%) resulted in death; most were in children 2 years of age (70.0%) and none involved a therapeutic dose. The overall reported AE rate was 0.573 cases per 1 million units (ie, tablets, gelatin capsules, or liquid equivalent) sold (95% confidence interval, 0.5530.593) or 1 case per 1.75 million units.

 CONCLUSIONS: The rate of AEs associated with CCMs in children was low. Fatalities occurred even less frequently. No fatality involved a therapeutic dose. Accidental unsupervised ingestions were the most common exposure types and single-ingredient, pediatric liquid formulations were the most commonly reported products. These characteristics present an opportunity for targeted prevention efforts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi - thanks for the tag. I usually post the exact title of an article and if it's not clear, add a direct quote from the article. However, the submission title can still be misleading in which case users can report the post for a Rule 11 violation or just PM me directly. I've removed my own posts in the past if my own quality control has been lacking. Or if reported in, another mod can provide a second independent opinion. 

In relation to the Elon Musk infinity warranty post of mine, I intentionally had the quote from him explaining why he thought they would last forever. Having said that, looking at the post history, no member has reported that post ever. If there was concern, people should report the post. I can tell you the mods definitely remove posts from other mods. 

Lastly, I apologise if my post misled. Let me know if it's a real issue I can delete it. Also I want to thank all of you members for your interest and for raising this as constructive feedback. It is important that as a community we work together to make this sub better for everyone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi

My intention is to share scientific news that relate to future medicine. It's not to, in your words, "get peoples [sic] hopes up with this trash man". 

From the actual university press release:

https://news.uthscsa.edu/ut-health-diabetes-breakthrough-increases-insulin-producing-cells/

 UT Health San Antonio researchers have a goal to reach human clinical trials in three years, but to do so they must first test the strategy in large-animal studies, which will cost an estimated $5 million.
 Those studies will precede application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Investigational New Drug (IND) approval, Bruno Doiron, Ph.D., a co-inventor, said.
 The scientists received a U.S. patent in January, and UT Health San Antonio is spinning out a company to begin commercialization.
 The strategy has cured diabetes in mice.
 It worked perfectly, Dr. Doiron, assistant professor of medicine at UT Health, said. We cured mice for one year without any side effects. Thats never been seen. But its a mouse model, so caution is needed. We want to bring this to large animals that are closer to humans in physiology of the endocrine system.

I don't know the institution or the researchers. The journal itself has an impact factor of 1.61 so that's low for a biomedical journal I agree. Gene transfer has been shown to be efficacious in other diseases so it's interesting and encouraging that scientists are trying it out with some success in animals. 

No one is saying we are there yet, but there is a reason why this has been posted in /r/futurology and not /r/science by me. It's at the very least research done by scientists from a university published in a peer-reviewed journal. I believe that makes it a bit better than just "trash" or pure speculation.  </TEXT>

Evaluation of phenotype stability and ecological risk of a genetically engineered alga in open pond production. 

Algal Research, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.algal.2017.04.006

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211926417300024?via%3Dihub

Abstract:

 Genetically engineered (GE) algae offer the promise of producing food, fuel, and other valuable products with reduced requirements for land and fresh water. While the gains in productivity measured in GE terrestrial crops are predicted to be mirrored in GE algae, the stability of phenotypes and ecological risks posed by GE algae in large-scale outdoor cultivation remain unknown. Here, we describe the first US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)-sanctioned experiment aimed at understanding how GE algae perform in outdoor cultivation. Acutodesmus dimorphus was genetically engineered by the addition of two genes, one for enhanced fatty acid biosynthesis, and one for recombinant green fluorescence protein (GFP) expression; both the genes and their associated phenotypes were maintained during fifty days of outdoor cultivation. We also observed that while the GE algae dispersed from the cultivation ponds, colonization of the trap ponds by the GE strain declined rapidly with increasing distance from the source cultivation ponds. In contrast, many species of indigenous algae were found in every trap pond within a few days of starting the experiment. When inoculated in water from five local lakes, the GE algae's effect on biodiversity, species composition, and biomass of native algae was indiscernible from those of the wild-type (wt) progenitor algae, and neither the GE nor wt algae were able to outcompete native strains. We conclude that GE algae can be successfully cultivated outdoors while maintaining GE traits, and that for the specific GE algal strain tested here they did not outcompete or adversely impact native algae populations when grown in water taken from local lakes. This study provides an initial evaluation of GE algae in outdoor cultivation and a framework to evaluate GE algae risks associated with outdoor GE algae production. </TEXT>
