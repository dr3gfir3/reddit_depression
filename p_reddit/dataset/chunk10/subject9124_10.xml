	<TEXT> There will be moments of darkness, but keep looking for joy actively, and spread it to others who need it more.

The world needs what you have to give more than ever right now.

Remember that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 3. 

16 is hard regardless, you're doing great! Remind yourself of that. You are on the journey to becoming your true authentic self! Not many 16 can say that! You're doing AMAZING things for future you! REMEMBER THAT! You can't get to the top without a few bumps.

Heavy is the head that wears the crown sometimes! 

Keep your grind going, Keep finding the joy and light. And one day, maybe just one day, after you've been to hell and back, you'll wake up and you will feel so proud and overwhelmed with joy. 3 

Lead with love.  </TEXT>
