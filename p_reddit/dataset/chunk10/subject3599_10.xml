What to do? Stop texting her directly. Go have a life. Send snaps of excellent things you're doing that are clearly intended for a wider audience. If she's interested, she'll pop back up. Trust me on this; sometimes the greatest thing you can say or do is NOTHING. 

Fill your life with other things aside from thoughts of her and you'll find it becomes much easier to keep her interested in you.  </TEXT>

Crazy confirmation occurred last night when I saw a(n apparently mutual) friend that related he and I had 'crossed swords' and he was told *I* had begged to sleep over, wouldn't stop calling or texting, and had begging to see her every night since. Alllllrighty then!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Intensity is decent quality and will do what you want. To get digital in, you can use a cheapo USB sound card to capture from like this one (https://www.amazon.com/StarTech-com-Adapter-External-Digital-ICUSBAUDIO7D/dp/B002LM0U2S). You just have to make sure to keep the video and audio in sync! 

As for capturing Dolby Digital; I don't know of a solution. SPDIF stereo/matrix Dolby Surround is as good as it gets I believe. Now, I haven't tried this but you theoretically SHOULD be able to capture DTS LDs in full 6 channel because the audio is stored on the regular PCM tracks as PCM and output as S/PDIF data. So long as you figure out how to store it bit-perfect (meaning no sample rate conversion, etc), spitting it back out into a receiver should give you 6 channel DTS.

Technics 'tables tend to live forever if not abused, and the direct drive variants eliminate the need to replace belts.

	<TEXT> Motion to dismiss. Clearly, /u/salad_tongs_1 may have skirted the edges of good taste and karma-whoring but the post is entirely truthful in a literal sense. The name of the game in question is 'Everything'. The game is sold on Steam. Steam is offering 20% off the purchase of 'Everything' until April 28th. Therefore the post was entirely factual and cannot thus be considered a bamboozle or untruth. That some may have believed 'Everything' meant all games on Steam were 20% off merely points to the deficiency in their reasoning skills and/or complete lack of sense of humor. Defense rests, your honor.

EDIT: Defense requests the court take Judicial Notice that /u/salad_tongs_1 is an overworked moderator of /r/Steam and puts up with mountainous bullshit on the daily; if this does not warrant latitude, nothing does. </TEXT>

I move to strike the confession as it was given under duress. I submit to the court that it was coerced on the basis of peer pressure and overcuteness on the part of the alleged victim's progeny. 

I would put forth that an innocent mistake was committed by my client and the necessary elements to establish malice and feckwittery cannot be established due to low IQ on the part of the defendant.  </TEXT>

Oh, and THEN; I paid for NBD onsite repair. Every damn time they STILL try to get me to send it in for 'expedited depot repair'. Expedited to them? Fourteen days. HELL NO. I paid to have it repaired so I didn't have to be without the computer and have to argue to have a tech sent out every time. Would I buy another one? Maybe. There's no better machine out there for my uses.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> P mount counterweights don't work as normal counterweights do. Most P mount tonearms weren't adjustable at all. They're designed to be plug and play. The carts meet a narrow design spec and you don't static balance the tonearm; there's always at least 1 gram of weight on it. The stylus doesn't look as though there's any abnormal weight on it while playing. I wouldn't worry about that. 

What I WOULD worry about is that there looks to be corrosion on the cart and the cantilever. The aluminum looks quite oxidized. I'd get a new stylus at the least and preferably replace the cart entirely. A replacement M92E is $49 on Amazon, a replacement stylus is $25. At the least, replace the stylus. Also, make sure the tonearm moves freely throughout its vertical and horizontal range of motion. If there's even the slightest binding or resistance, it's likely to trash your vinyl.  </TEXT>
