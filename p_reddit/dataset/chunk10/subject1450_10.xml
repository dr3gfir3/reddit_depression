	<TEXT> I can bench press 215 so far lolol.... for real though, she might marry powerful just considering her notoriety, then again it might be best for her to marry humble and consider a more simple life.   
To me she seems like a moderate person, im sure who ever gets to marry Emma Watson will be a hell of a guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That doesn't actually bother me, especially considering she seems to stay in relationships and is not filthy or provocative. He looks respectable also, I just wish I had the opportunity to date her, sex is the last thing I think of when I see her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, it would not surprise me if many down votes are from bot accounts or one dude who has 100 fake accounts that just despises something heart felt. At first I had up votes, so some people did like it, some worthless neckbeard comment with no meaning other than animosity gets self voted up more than likely. Reddit is a cheesy place anyways, its typical for a true neckbeard as they say, to go around and trash on everyone else. Words like Cringe and Neckbeard lets you know automatically that the poster is probably a teenager or one of those internet junkies.  </TEXT>
