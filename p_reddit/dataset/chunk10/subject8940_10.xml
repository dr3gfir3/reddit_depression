	<TEXT> Grand theft book.  Did you somehow manage to check out a Gutenberg Bible?  Holy over-reaction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd personally say it's more accountability than a fine.  If you lose the book, you should replace it.  To me that seems a very different thing than not being able to return it by 4pm on a Thursday and having to pay.  Or a kid forgetting it at school over the weekend, the other parents house for a week or two and then having to pay the cost of the book or more even when the book is eventually given back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much.  Also a great way to send your parents through the roof.  Then heaven forbid the book has been lost and you get to pay the list price of the book plus like a convenience fee kind of thing on top of the fine.  

My old library, if the book got lost they were Thrilled if you ordered another copy yourself and brought it in rather than paying out.  New library, nope, they won't accept that.  If I were prone to having overdue books or losing them, I'd rather buy it and risk just the loss of the initial pay out rather than like 2x-4x the list price of the book. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They aren't wrong.  The last town I lived in - no fines for printed material ever.  If you were overdue, they would email you and if you didn't return the book within like 2 months, you'd need to pay or replace the copy.

The town we're in now - it's something to the tune of a dollar a day.  I can't imagine that if you're a working parent that has all the usual kid stuff to worry about on top of the regular household stuff that you're really going to want to risk the possible fines.

I only have anecdotal evidence, but based on the number of people I've seen with kids at each library, the one that doesn't fine has a lot more patrons with kids checking out material. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That makes me so incredibly sad...  The Martian is such a great book.  It should just be incentive to the big publishers to search more diligently for the good material that's out there.

Thanks for the insight - I had no idea that the publishers did that kind of cycle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are certainly books I've read just to be able to talk about them, kind of like movies I've watched just because my group had an interest.  But I wonder how big of an impact that might have on the work's overall sales.  I guess it would have to be introduced to the "right" group or person to see huge ripples, but I do wonder. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm curious about the buying aspect from the industry too.  Do the stores/the industry itself create the hype because they're hoping to create the next Harry Potter?  

I do suspect that a great many people of skimming, reading the Wiki or otherwise sort of falsely crafting an opinion (or outright stealing...) so have something to say about it.  But in that situation, would they offer it as a recommendation?  I guess that probably depends on how far they want to take the charade... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And that's where the question comes from really.  I've seen people really hate or feel totally indifferent toward books I've really liked.  

But books like The Historian by Kostova, I tried so hard to even finish and I just couldn't and was surrounded by the raves about it.  I still haven't figured that one out.  Some of it, I'm sure, comes down to taste.  I enjoy the story of Lord of the Rings, but I do not enjoy Tolkien's writing style.  That one, totally accept is on me.  I don't want to read him but I understand why other people adore his books.  Some of them though, I get through, don't enjoy the way it's written, the story that's told, the characters and find the ending disappointing, unfulfilling, etc and just can't understand why people recommend it. </TEXT>
