	<TEXT> The beeping my washing machine makes when it is finished, every two minutes. 

The noise a spoon makes when it hits the bottom of a cup.

The noise the bin lid makes when it WHAPS the back of the wall.

The shower... water coming through at high pressure. I'm weird. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not one for the paranormal. I'm quite a logical person really, but the past few days events have left me feeling uncomfortable in my sanity and my beliefs.

Things started suddenly in my house Thursday last week. I live by myself, with my dog BooBoo (Yeah, dumbass name, I know.) I have lived here for nearly a year, and I have never felt intimidated by the house at all. 

So anyway... on Thursday morning, my mum texted me saying she was coming around about 11am, which is fine. She usually just walks in and makes herself a cuppa tea or whatever, usually I am in the shower when she comes around. But on Thursday morning, I was up bright and early and was sat in my living room doing my hair and make up when I hear the front door slam. The hallway is right on the living room so I can pop my head out the door and see who is there, but I had my hair in my straighteners so I just yelled out ''BooBoo, who is it?'' thinking it would be my mother. Boo was going mental, yapping and huffing, so I put my head out of the living room door to yell at him to shut up and to also greet my mother.

There was no-one there, and the keyring was swinging in the lock from side to side, like something had caused the door to slam heavily. The door is a big, solid PVC door that can't swing open by the wind as it has a double latch system. I wrote it off as perhaps the postie, even though there was no mail, or maybe I didn't shut the door properly, even though I hadn't been out that day, or the evening before.

I didn't really think much else about that. I am not a superstitious person. However, on Saturday night something happened that creeped me the fuck out. it was about 1am on Saturday night and I was in bed, just starting to drift off, BooBoo snuggled up at my feet snoring gently. All of a sudden I feel him tense up under the duvet, and then I hear him ''huuurrrrrrrfff...HURF'' before going into a full blown barking fit. I calm him down, settle him back in bed and start to drift off again when I hear a tap....tap....tap on the stairs.

My stairs are wooden, and the noise was identical to the noise BooBoos collar tag makes on the steps as he pads up at night. He is a Jack Russell, so his little short legs make this possible. I counted the taps... tap.... tap... tap. I counted fourteen of them - which I realised was the amount of steps I had leading from downstairs to upstairs. I pulled the duvet over my head like a little kid and drifted off into an unsettled sleep.

But what has really took the cherry off the cake, was what has happened this morning. I took a shower as usual, got out and padded across the tile floor, across the wooden floor landing and into my bedroom to get dried off and presentable for the day. I finished up, and went back into the bathroom to brush my teeth, only to see a set of wet footprints that were not my own going out of the bathroom and down the stairs, and the keyring swinging gently in the front door lock. </TEXT>
