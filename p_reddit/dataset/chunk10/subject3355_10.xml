	<TEXT> I feel like you're trying way too hard too justify his outrage - which, like I said, may not even be genuine. He's kind of an asshole and likes to stir up shit on social media constantly. 

If you truly believe that a picture of a fully-clothed man with some text on it is degrading, I can't imagine how you can cope with the things that *actually* degrade people. 

I didn't post this to get into fights with strangers. I posted it because I wanted to vent about being harassed every time I walk down to the corner market and how incredibly clueless that guy was. Instead, I am told that I'm not allowed to complain about something and that I'm the problem in this scenario. 

I want to give you some sincere advice based on the conversation we've just had: you should never tell *any*one that they're not entitled to their own thoughts and feelings. It's horribly dismissive when the person you're talking to is coping with their anger or sadness in a healthy way, i.e. posting about it on a friendly internet board instead of screaming at their families. 

Have a lovely night.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And I've posted a pic of Obama on her page that said "hey girl, you miss complete sentences?" Could that have been offensive, too? 

The meme is based on the fact that Canada has socialized medicine and that the House just passed a bill that would basically label being a woman a pre-existing condition while simultaneously stripping protection for those with pre-existing conditions. someone found a cute pic of a world leader whom I greatly admire and is known as being an attractive guy, and captioned it like a Ryan gosling meme. 

I simply commented on the pic with a joke. I make jokes like that about various people all the time on FB and irl. The guy was just trying to start shit. 

I really have a hard time seeing it as anything but trolling or straight-up overreaction. I've known the guy since I was 12; he's incredibly privileged and doesn't understand that. 

My point is this: if waxing poetic as part of a joke - wherein I did not say anything explicit or degrading about the subject - makes a big, well-off man feel "creeped out," then he needs to walk a mile in my shoes. Or the shoes off any other woman who's ever been harassed. Using flowery language to call a person dreamy is way less creepy than the shit I put up with on a weekly basis, and I'm 110% sure he would not have called a guy creepy if the pic Princess Madeleine of Sweden and he called her hot.  </TEXT>

He and young Joe Biden are my two political man-crushes, which I exaggerate to the extreme on social media because I think it's funny to be a crazy fangirl over politicians. It's a bit my mom and I do. 

She posted a photo of the PM saying, "hey girl, I'll cover your pre-existing conditions," then told me not to stare too long and go to work. I replied, "why would I do that? Do you look away from a desert sunset?"

	<TEXT> My first boyfriend coerced me into trying anal even though I, personally (not trying to kink-shame anytime, this is just my own sexual reality) never found it appealing. He had a rather large member and I knew it would hurt. 

It did. When it was over, I felt emotionally and physically violated and exhausted. I cried. He guilted me for crying because it "made him feel like a rapist." Well, guess what, dude, it made me feel like a rape victim. I told him I'd never do it again. 

Then, a few months later, he decides we should try again. I didn't get a say, because by this point emotional abuse and sexual coercion had come to define the relationship. In order to keep him from manipulating my emotions, I let him do it. Same thing happened again, to no one's surprise but his. 

That repeated every couple of months for the duration of the 3 years we were together. We eventually broke up and I had a 2-year period of voluntary celibacy before I started seeing my second boyfriend. 

He wanted to do anal, said I didn't like it because I had never done it right.  I put my foot down because I knew without a doubt that I would never enjoy it. He pressured me and I relented, because I still hadn't realized that coerced sex was not consentual. He was the first guy to earn my trust since that shit of an abusive ex, and we broke up very soon after he did this for unrelated reasons.

I'm celibate again. I've grown enough in the last few years to come to the conclusion that my sexual boundaries are law from now on, and anyone who disrespects that will bring kicked out of my life dick first. 

Sorry to bother you with my anal life story, it was half venting and half me trying to tell you that you have a right to say no to absolutely *anything* involving your body and mind, and that  no one gets to shame you for having preferences. 

I'm positive you already knew all that, but I want to reassure all women that they are their own masters. I didn't understand that until way too late.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Garrison goes out of his way to portray Trump as fit ([1](https://grrrgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/trump_adult_in_room_ben_garrison.jpg?w=640 h=485) [2](https://grrrgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2016/05/stefan_cartoon_fix_ben_garrison.jpg) [3](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/020/313/76f.jpg)), which is laughable. 

I *think* (don't quote me on this) that Garrison liked Bernie during the primaries, but when he [conceded and endorsed Hillary](https://grrrgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/bernie_sanders_rbg_ben_garrison.jpg?w=640 h=473), Bernie became a [crackpot commie.](https://grrrgraphics.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/bernie_sanders_ben_garrison.jpg) </TEXT>
