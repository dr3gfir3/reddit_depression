	<TEXT> Interesting how the media threatens to release the 2005 tax returns, and the White House publishes the numbers themselves within minutes. But you spend months upon months asking for the 2016 tax returns, and we just can't seem to get an answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My college building has a small printing lab so that you don't have to trek to the library any time you need to print something. Nothing pisses me off more than someone coming in and printing off 20 copies of their 50-slide powerpoint. I don't want to wait 15 minutes for my 3-page essay. And the people who do this act so snotty about it if you show any kind of frustration. Some girl who recently did this told me I would understand when I get to graduate school.  </TEXT>
