	<TEXT>   Googling Kotaku pageviews gives a site that suggests 1.2m at a peak of unique visitors. For the entire site.

That sucks because Kotaku produces a lot more interesting content than TotalBiscuit. TB will rant for a looong time about settings and one specific game. I've personally grown tired of youtube personalities in general. The good ones are reading from a script that would take a fraction of the time to read if it were an article.

Kotaku produces a bunch of articles every day and once in a while they have really in depth ones that are totally original reporting. They're a lot more important to the games scene in general than youtubers. </TEXT>

Deforestation continues across the tropics at alarming rates, with repercussions for ecosystem processes, carbon storage and long term sustainability. Taking advantage of recent fine-scale measurement of deforestation, this analysis aims to improve our understanding of the scale of deforestation drivers in the tropics. We examined trends in forest clearings of different sizes from 20002012 by country, region and development level. As tropical deforestation increased from approximately 6900 kha yr1 in the first half of the study period, to 7900 kha yr1 in the second half of the study period, 50% of this increase was attributable to the proliferation of medium and large clearings (10 ha). This trend was most pronounced in Southeast Asia and in South America. Outside of Brazil 60% of the observed increase in deforestation in South America was due to an upsurge in medium- and large-scale clearings; Brazil had a divergent trend of decreasing deforestation, 90% of which was attributable to a reduction in medium and large clearings. The emerging prominence of large-scale drivers of forest loss in many regions and countries suggests the growing need for policy interventions which target industrial-scale agricultural commodity producers. The experience in Brazil suggests that there are promising policy solutions to mitigate large-scale deforestation, but that these policy initiatives do not adequately address small-scale drivers. By providing up-to-date and spatially explicit information on the scale of deforestation, and the trends in these patterns over time, this study contributes valuable information for monitoring, and designing effective interventions to address deforestation.

This is may be the most interesting part: 

"This lead to the creation of what is the most well-known example of a cycle-accurate emulator: higan (formerly bsnes). It is legendarily accurate, but also infamously slow. This is in part due to the fact that it is cycle accurate. It uses co-routines to switch between portions of the emulation as needed, which has a lot of overhead. Because higan is the best-known example of a cycle-accurate emulator, it has led to the misconception that cycle accuracy is necessarily extremely slow. However, much of higans performance issues are because the emulation is not optimized for speed. This was an intentional decision on byuus part to make sure that the code is ultimately readable and understandable, as byuu maintains a strict code as documentation policy. Beyond being a means to play SNES games, byuu treats higan as a preservation project and documentation on the behavior of the SNES itself. It is possible to make a highly optimized and accurate SNES emulator that would be significantly faster than higan without sacrificing much accuracy; however, no one has done this. Its quite a daunting task, after all."

	<TEXT> It's always easier to predict something after it had happened. It seems obvious now that the WiiU would do badly because it has. But could you have predicted that before launch? The Switch didn't get more marketing than the WiiU. 

As for the name, they probably did some market research and found that customers preferred the name WiiU because it was more familiar. As /u/SegataSanshiro said Apple hasn't had any problems naming all of its products by the same name. Microsoft also has many Surface laptops and Xbox consoles; cars keep the same names over multiple generations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. The problem with the infinite sidequests is that they change the way the game is played. Instead of trusting the DM (the game) to lead you along an interesting adventure, you have to choose to stop doing sidequests because there are too many and they're bad.

	<TEXT> We just got used to it. I found a [thread from 2006 discussing the issue](https://slashdot.org/story/06/04/04/165210/frustration-with-oblivion-mod-costs-on-xbox-live):

"So much for the good old days where this kind of content was free. I would never even imagined I would have to pay for this sort of thing.

I can expect to pay something for a substantial mod that introduces a new storyline or something to that effect. But to be charged for something as simple as a new texture and maybe a new model is pathetic."

"Micro$oft's marketing droids have fired the first salvo in the latest round of Digital Restrictions Management Warfare. Oblivion, by Bethesda, widely believed to be the strongest candidate for 2006 Game Of The Year, has begun providing downloadable content via XBOX Live. This could be great news, but at roughly $2.50 for downloadable Horse Armor a mere two weeks after the game shipped, we all know this was carved from the game to be sold separately. Bethesda is also to blame here, with other similarly priced content on the way. How long until "essential" game content is withheld from a game release, only to be downloaded in Pay-Per-Play chunks?

Please note that I'm definitely not against pay-per-play as a viable model, however, for these guys to charge $2.50 for what basically amounts to a few texture maps and a mesh is a big step over the edge onto a slippery slope that could (will?) lead to more egregious violations of player trust. And, before everyone says "if you don't like it, don't buy it"...believe me, I won't. However, it's important to understand that without public backlash over this, the folks behind these machinations will continue forward, "innovating" online gaming to the point where you won't be able to complete a $60 game you purchased until you've spent another $40 on pseudo-essential add-ons. (Not picking on you, Bethesda, we love you guys!!!)"

"
You're going to see a lot of developers holding back content so they can make you pay more through XBox Live. Here's hoping Nintendo and Sony take full advantage of the mistakes that are being made with Live. This is a great example of what *not* to do with an online service. Micropayments will be their downfall."

"
It's really mind-boggling that Bethesda thinks it's okay to sell a CD full of actual content for $50-70, and still thinking it's okay to sell a couple of extra skins for $1.99-$2.50.

Why didn't they follow the same pricing model when selling their game? Surely if 2 skins are worth $2.50, then an entire CD filled with thousands of skins, logic, sprawling maps, etc would be worth several thousands of dollars per disc.

Bethesda should be ashamed."

To be fair, there were many moderating voices: 
"
I honestly don't see why everyone is freaking out about this; message boards seem to have exploded in rage all over the internet since yesterday, and it's really not that big a deal. I don't feel like $2.50 is worth a mod that doesn't actually do anything (the "armor" doesn't actually increase the horse's armor class, it just makes it look nice), and I feel like a lot of people are thinking the same thing. When Bethesda finds out that people aren't willing to pay that amount for so little, I'm guessing that future content will be priced more in line with the value it gives players. All in all, this really has nothing to do with Microsoft or how horrible the 360 is, but with why Bethesda chose that price for this particular content."

That last part turned out to be horribly wrong. On the contrary, developers have found that gamers are willing to pay much MORE than $2,50 for cosmetics.

"Dark Energy was something that only organics could access because of various techno-science magic reasons we hadn't decided on yet. Maybe using this Dark Energy was having a ripple effect on the space-time continuum.

"Maybe the Reapers kept wiping out organic life because organics keep evolving to the state where they would use biotics and dark energy and that caused an entropic effect that would hasten the end of the universe. Being immortal beings, that's something they wouldn't want to see.

"Then we thought, let's take it to the next level. Maybe the Reapers are looking at a way to stop this. Maybe there's an inevitable descent into the opposite of the Big Bang (the Big Crunch) and the Reapers realise that the only way they can stop it is by using biotics, but since they can't use biotics they have to keep rebuilding society - as they try and find the perfect group to use biotics for this purpose. The asari were close but they weren't quite right, the Protheans were close as well.

"Again it's very vague and not fleshed out, it was something we considered but we ended up going in a different direction." </TEXT>

There are few Western games set in a High School or with HS aged characters (there was Bully, but I can't recall anything else). Videogame heroes are usually in their late 20s or early 30s. I think that a HS setting would not really have broad appeal, like it seems to have in Japan. </TEXT>

To be credible, I would like to see an official statement backed by a reveal of at least part of the contracts they sign with publishers and developers showing us that they can legally removed the DRM at any time.

The problem is that it would be trivially easy for them to lie about. It's good PR and no one will know until the company really goes bankrupt, at which point it won't matter that they lied. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The major reasons why the DPS is much higher in SC2 is that units have good pathfinding, and that they can be stacked more tightly. By default, BW units form a conga line, which makes them very weak unless you micromanage them. See [Day9 for a very long video about BW micro](https://youtu.be/rWvoMrYCQBU). So, it requires a lot of skill to make them do their optimal DPS. Protoss players would set up moving armies that actually require a lot of effort to set up. 

As for the second point, stacking, most BW maps had tight chokepoints that made it almost impossible to stack a lot of units tightly. The units were slightly larger, the maps tighter, and combined with the poor pathfinding and limited united selection, it makes it impossible to have a 1A deathball, as you pointed out. So BW was more a series of small assaults, with some big confrontations sometimes taking place, but even the larger battles were not completely decisive.

-

One other mistake IMO are the high ground mechanics, which don't give the high ground as much of an advantage. So there's much less strategic terrain. 

Another related point is that too many units can cross over cliffs and even warp instantly across the map (protoss gateway). This makes it so that cliffs are less strategic, so defense and terrain have less importance. The protoss gateway ability means that Protoss had to be nerfed in other ways and that it becomes a central part of their design.

Also, most of the micro is gone. Watch the day9 video for an explanation. But it's just, as I've said that units do their highest DPS on a 1A command, without needing any micro. And casters don't have to be selected individually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's getting pretty good reviews on IMDB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2461520/

"

An excellent movie, though certainly not uplifting. Reviewers and others who hated it probably did so because the movie is not "pretty", contains no car chases, no nudity, no digitally enhanced B.S., and no sappy, contrived, over-the-top drama. To paraphrase part of the movie, it's all real". Worst of all for many who would prefer to live without acknowledging facts, it reminds us that America does not support its troops; America discards its troops. As the end credits declare, there are hundreds of thousands of discarded, homeless vets. Many with PTSD roam untreated, likewise discarded. We likely do not report those men/women as injured. The next time you feel all rah-rah about the U.S. sending troops into battle for reasons unclear, think of this show. Excellent acting, dialogue sometimes tough to understand. Those of you who want to "fight for America", know that t hose who sent you to war will not fight for you.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the answer. I think you mean GPLv2.

The shaders README says that "The copyright of these shaders belong to their respective authors and they are licensed under the General Public License v2 unless otherwise stated."

Higan is GPLv3. I thought that they would be compatible, but [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility) says that "GPLv2 itself is not compatible with GPLv3". This means you would need to contact the authors and relicense them under the GPLv3, if Wikipedia is accurate.

Edit: Maybe you could have the shaders be easily downloadable in one click or something. Also, I wonder if you upsample the SNES image before applying the shaders. SNES9x allows the image to be rendered at a higher resolution. I imagine that would make the shaders look a bit better.
Edit2: The shaders look nice, but some don't work and make screen black. For others (like NTSC), the scanlines disappear when I go fullscreen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are many consoles, but few arcade cabinets. You only address mainstream console gaming. In 30 years, there won't be as many consoles left.

Emulators have the advantage of being portable. Even if Microsoft goes bankrupt in 2029, emulators will still work on Linux or whatever is the new operating system. Consoles stop working once the hardware is dead and it's not always easy or possible to repair it. Also, with DRM you can lose access to your games. Future consoles might not work at all when not connected to a proprietary server over the Internet. This is already the case with Steam (and other competitors). If Valve, EA or Ubisoft go bankrupt you will lose access to all the games you have on those services.

Over time, more and more stuff gets lost. Just imagine what will happen in 100 years. Old consoles and old games will all suffer from bit rot, and disappear except for a few copies kept in museums. The best way to preserve games is through emulators that are constantly updated and ported to new operating systems.

Read this here:http://docs.mamedev.org/whatis.html

"MAMEs purpose is to preserve decades of software history. As electronic technology continues to rush forward, MAME prevents this important vintage software from being lost and forgotten. This is achieved by documenting the hardware and how it functions. The source code to MAME serves as this documentation. The fact that the software is usable serves primarily to validate the accuracy of the documentation (how else can you prove that you have recreated the hardware faithfully?). Over time, MAME absorbed the sister-project MESS (Multi Emulator Super System), so MAME now documents a wide variety of (mostly vintage) computers, video game consoles and calculators, in addition to the arcade video games that were its initial focus.

MAME main purpose is to be a reference to the inner workings of the emulated machines. This is done both for educational purposes and for preservation purposes, in order to prevent historical software from disappearing forever once the hardware it runs on stops working. Of course, in order to preserve the software and demonstrate that the emulated behavior matches the original, one must also be able to actually use the software. This is considered a nice side effect, and is not MAMEs primary focus." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CEMU is only one emulator. It's the exception by being closed source and emulating recent games. Please don't judge all emulators based on CEMU.

Also, pirates are more likely to play on original consoles. Cemu still has plenty of bugs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that traditional libraries and archives are not interested in preserving software.

Also, you have to preserve not only the software, but also the means to read it. So, you have to either preserve the original hardware and maintain it, or emulate it. 

Some emulators are dedicated to this mission. MAME's primary goal is not to play games but to document the hardware. The emulation serves not only to play arcade games, but can also be used to repair original arcade cabinets.  </TEXT>

 And I don't believe that there are going to be games as rare as Earthbound in the future. Gaming has changed. In the era of the SNES, it was a niche hobby.

There will. Games are increasingly being released on digital mediums only. Who will preserve xbox arcade games?

Shops will only preserve games that they can sell. They'll throw the other ones away because inventory space costs money. Where can you find old DOS games, or Wonderswan games for sale? What about demos or prototypes? 

Take a look here at how many different games and programs there are: https://archive.org/details/software </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No CMYK support. It's useless if you want to print anything. The UI isn't as good. If you're going to learn to use one program, why not learn photoshop? The tools and filters aren't as good.

See [here](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/can-photoshop-gimp-cant/) for a list.

Also, they've been working on their next generation engine GEGL for 17 years now. It was added to the development version 11 years ago. It's supposed to bring all the new functionalities that are missing, but it seems stuck in a black hole of never-ending development.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing that bugs me in these old IE games are the limited inventory space and weight limits. I doubt they'll remove those but especially in a game focused on the story like PS:T, these are really annoying. </TEXT>
