	<TEXT> This underground movement aimed to uphold the "Blue Code of Silence" allows officers to get away with crimes for which other citizens have to pay fines and do time. The article links out to a New York Times article reporting how officers showed up to the [arraignment of 16 officers](http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/29/nyregion/officers-unleash-anger-at-ticket-fixing-arraignments-in-the-bronx.html) charged with extending this professional courtesy. Although the headline read the officers were being arraigned for ticket-fixing, one "was accused of two dozen crimes, including attempted robbery, attempted grand larceny, transporting what he thought was heroin for drug dealers and revealing the identity of a confidential informant." 

Is this the same culture that makes some officers think they're justified in irresponsibly shooting people without justification? Love to hear your feelings.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It didn't even occur to me about the shipping applications of this technology. I could see a whole line of new companies rising to disrupt the shipping industry's modus operandi. It will also probably eliminate all the regulatory and technological challenges that drone delivery is encountering. It is going to be interesting to see both modes of transport go head to head; however, this model sounds a lot better. Even regarding safety, statistically speaking flying is the safest way to travel. However, Reuters reported that although trains get into more accidents than planes, [plane accidents kill more people](http://blogs.reuters.com/data-dive/2015/02/04/trains-have-more-accidents-but-plane-crashes-kill-more-people/). In 2014, the Aviation Safety Network recorded "21 fatal airliner accidents," that killed 990 people. The Federal Railroad Office of Safety Analysis recorded only six passenger deaths on 2,096 railroad accidents.

Edit: I know these aren't trains, but I surmise operating underground, like some trains are conducted, organizations can better account for more variables, which compromise safety, than what airlines can do in the air. I also know that pilots are very rigorously trained. Most come from a military background and have had to been flying for several thousand hours, if I'm not mistaken, to fly commercially. Perhaps if train or tube operators would be required to undergo the same level of rigorous training as airline pilots, you could significantly lower the number of train or potential tube accidents, making this a much safer way to travel and ship cargo.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you so much, professor! I am so honored to be considered especially by you, for you taught me so much through your contributions. I really dig deep into a couple of the studies you submit. And although there is still a lot I have to learn, I have gained a better understanding of the peer-review system reading your collections; the information has also shaped some of my decision-making towards performing a few actions that produce the most favorable results based on some findings. 

I would love to help r/futurology explore what the vast future holds. It is so incredible what is being done to repair the human body through stem cell repair. I am excited about experiencing all the developments towards interplanetary travel; hope we finally discover how to fly through a wormhole and make light year travel possible :) But even the more viable breakthroughs that are to be made towards a manned flight to Mars really make me proud of what humans are accomplishing right now. AI development, technology with applications for sustainable energy, and everything that is so close to coming to fruition really needs every chance it can get to be communicated and supported. I would utterly be honored to help move the conversation forward through a more involved contribution to this sub.

I am very grateful for your contribution and that of the rest of the mods on Reddit, for you give your most valuable resource: your time. I see your activity flooded with actions in order to maintain the content quality and keep making Reddit, what I think, is the best content and news site on the planet. Thank you again! I greatly appreciate all you have done for us.

Please enjoy the rest of your weekend!

	<TEXT> This paper has examined three massifs in the southernmost Heritage Range in order to help date the Ellsworth glacial trimline, a feature representing a significant thickening and expansion of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet. Coupling detailed geomorphological analysis with an intensive campaign of cosmogenic nuclide exposure age dating, we show that glacial erosion of surfaces associated with the trimline is not of LGM or indeed Pleistocene age. The lower parts were covered by ice during the LGM, but the effect, in common with all Pleistocene fluctuations, was to add and redistribute blue-ice morainic debris onto an already eroded bedrock surface. Exposure age dating demonstrates that the surfaces adjacent to the trimline were sculpted more than two million years ago. Landforms indicating the presence of warm-based ice and meltwater at the edge of a large ice sheet require a climate similar to present-day Greenland where surface melting occurs at least seasonally. We argue that in Antarctica this last occurred in the mid-Miocene 14 million years ago. During the middle Miocene and subsequently, glacial erosion has lowered the glaciers in relation to the mountains by deepening surrounding troughs.

Would not expect anybody to feel that way, but I thank you so much for sharing your feelings on Yoda's transcendence. I could totally see how he could be just an isolated power source through which the strongest part of the force is channelled. 

Nonetheless, with all due respect, I can't get enough of watching Yoda kick ass :) But that's what makes us great as humans. We can all possess diverse opinions and feelings of what is grand and majestic. And each opinion opens up our mind to other possibilities and thought patterns. 

Thanks for sharing that note. Have a great day! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They can probably make up for it in TLJ, but that snatches the ability of TFA standing on its own. One of the elements of Episode I to III that kept me engaged was the improved fighting skill with which the Jedi and Sith wielded the lightsabers. The flips and strikes were more frequent and faster. If they would have used special effects to show the skills worthy of a Jedi grandmaster into which Luke had evolved, like when Yoda first fought Dooku and then the Sith Lord, I think the crowd would have been cheering and not complaining that they only got to see Luke for a couple of minutes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have to watch it again, but, based on what I can immediately recall (do correct me if I"m wrong), I don't think it would have taken away much from Rey's story. In fact it would have probably been more plausible to emphasize how Ren was really much stronger than Rey, as he probably had more formal training. 

And in terms of Luke's part, I am at least 98 percent sure that people in the  audience would be cheering, like when Yoda first started flipping and showed off the best of his lightsaber skills against Dooku, in the theatre at which I saw it; people went nuts. At the end of TFA, nonetheless, I heard at least 4 to 5 people complaining that you only got to see Luke for two minutes. One guy stood up and said he got ripped off. 

With such an anticipated return, with special effects they could have done a lot better with Luke's entrance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We find that EGUs in the Eastern U.S. region from 2007 to 2012 exhibited a 3.87%  0.41% increase in electricity generation per C increase during summer months. This is associated with a 3.35%/C  0.50%/C increase in SO2 emissions, a 3.60%/C  0.49%/C increase in NOX emissions, and a 3.32%/C  0.36%/C increase in CO2 emissions. Sensitivities vary by year and by pollutant, with SO2 both the highest sensitivity (5.04% in 2012) and lowest sensitivity (2.19% in 2007) in terms of a regional average. Texas displays 20072012 sensitivities of 2.34%/C  0.28%/C for generation, 0.91%/C  0.25%/C for SO2 emissions, 2.15%/C  0.29%/C for NOX emissions, and 1.78%/C  0.22%/C for CO2 emissions. These results suggest demand-side and supply side technological improvements and fuel choice could play an important role in cost-effective reduction of carbon emissions and air pollution.

	<TEXT> What stood out to me the most was that younger men are carrying on the same antiquated attitudes as the older generation before them:

Most young men in the Middle East and North Africa still hold traditional attitudes similar to their fathers toward women's role in society

 In Palestine, Egypt, and Morocco, there was little difference
between younger and older men on gender attitudes

In other words, in Morocco, Palestine, and Egypt, younger mens
views on gender equality do not differ substantially from those of older men.

	<TEXT> I'm basing my assumptions on the following part of the study:

i) Josh is on the way to the airport to catch a flight for a hunting safari in Africa. He leaves with plenty of time to make it there, but his car breaks down on the highway. Now Josh is sitting in his car near a busy intersection and knows he needs to get to airport soon if he is going to catch his flight.

ii) Is it possible or impossible for Josh to [(a)] hail a taxi at the intersection, [(b)] fix his car by banging on it, [(c)] teleport himself to the airport, [(d)] sneak onto public transportation, or [(e)] sell his car for a ride to the airport?

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but it appears [(d)] is rated as immoral and improbable. Some one with a criminal background may not see any of these actions as immoral or, much less, improbable. Just to give you an example, in New York City it was a common practice to not pay subway fare by evading the turnstiles by simply walking through the exit door. Even people who wouldn't commit more serious crimes and held nine-to-five jobs did it. When a transit police unit was put in force and people started to get frisked, ticketed, and arrested for not paying subway fares, then the police discovered that many fare dodgers were armed with guns and knives and were on their way to mug people and perform more violent crimes in the subways. However, there were a few that were simply used to not paying the subway fare, and they were released with a summons. 

With the added security at train stations I guess it would be harder to test a sample of people who would think dodging a subway fare is acceptable. I still know some younger people who do it though. 

EDIT: One last thing: I do notice that older people who have had criminal backgrounds are more cynical and see criminal activity as the daily norm; they're not surprised when they see people get mugged, raped, shot, or bombed on the news. Hence some one like that may see a criminal act as immoral (just to be politically correct or not perceived to be stupid, perhaps) but such a person would not see the same act as improbable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing that screams out to me the most is that the [study's participants'](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2017/04/17/1619717114.full) were all hired from mechanical turk; keyword probably being *hired.* I don't know the exact demo on mechanical turks, but I am sure most share the idiosyncrasies of people who would widely be classified as moral: people who want to to get paid for performing legal tasks or work that for the most part may be considered to be moral. 

For some of these scenarios, I think the results would have been dramatically different if participants with a criminal background or even prison inmates reported their opinions. Having grown up with many people with criminal backgrounds, I know their classification of what is moral to be totally different than that of some one who would never commit a crime because such a person would simply would not need to. 

I knew a lot of people who sold crack cocaine back in the late eighties and early nineties because they simply didn't know of any other way to financially support themselves. They didn't know how to write a resume, cover letter, or present themselves professionally, and many were unable to land even a job paying minimum wage. 

Such people look at morality in a totally different light. They may not think selling drugs is immoral because otherwise, in their mind, how would they survive and perhaps feed themselves and, and in some cases, their children? Even some one who told police officers about a crime would be considered immoral because you are supposed to resolve your own conflicts. Police officers were and are considered to be an enemy in people who live in inner cities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The capacity for representing and reasoning over sets of possibilities, or modal cognition, supports diverse kinds of high-level judgments: causal reasoning, moral judgment, language comprehension, and more. Prior research on modal cognition asks how humans explicitly and deliberatively reason about what is possible but has not investigated whether or how people have a default, implicit representation of which events are possible. We present three studies that characterize the role of implicit representations of possibility in cognition. Collectively, these studies differentiate explicit reasoning about possibilities from default implicit representations, demonstrate that human adults often default to treating immoral and irrational events as impossible, and provide a case study of high-level cognitive judgments relying on default implicit representations of possibility rather than explicit deliberation.

	<TEXT> Common chimps and bonobos are our closest living relatives but almost nothing is known about bonobo internal anatomy. We present the first phylogenetic analysis to include musculoskeletal data obtained from a recent dissection of bonobos. Notably, chimpanzees, and in particular bonobos, provide a remarkable case of evolutionary stasis for since the chimpanzee-human split c.8 Ma among 120 head-neck (HN) and forelimb (FL) muscles there were only four minor changes in the chimpanzee clade, and all were reversions to the ancestral condition. Moreover, since the common chimpanzee-bonobo split c.2 Ma there have been no changes in bonobos, so with respect to HN-FL musculature bonobos are the better model for the last common ancestor (LCA) of chimpanzees/bonobos and humans. Moreover, in the hindlimb there are only two muscle absence/presence differences between common chimpanzees and bonobos. Puzzlingly, there is an evolutionary mosaicism between each of these species and humans. We discuss these data in the context of available genomic information and debates on whether the common chimpanzee-bonobo divergence is linked to heterochrony.

	<TEXT> Background: Adolescent bullying may be a key driver of interest in cosmetic surgery. This study examined the extent of such interest and whether any effect was sex-specific, and examined psychological functioning as a potential mechanism through which bullying involvement may lead to a wish for cosmetic surgery.

Methods: A two-stage design was used. In the first stage, 2782 adolescents (aged 11 to 16 years) were screened for bullying involvement using self-reports and peer nominations. In the second stage, 752 adolescents who were bullies, victims, bully-victims, or uninvolved in bullying reported their desire for cosmetic surgery. Psychological functioning was constructed as a composite of self-esteem and emotional problems (assessed at stage 1) and body-esteem scores (assessed at stage 2).

Results: Adolescents involved in bullying in any role were significantly more interested in cosmetic surgery than uninvolved adolescents. Desire for cosmetic surgery was greatest in adolescents who were bullied (victims and bully-victims) and girls. Desire for cosmetic surgery was highest in girls, but sex did not interact with bullying role. Being victimized by peers resulted in poor psychological functioning, which increased desire for cosmetic surgery. In contrast, desire for cosmetic surgery in bullies was not related to psychological functioning, which was in the normal range.

Conclusions: Bullying victimization is related to poor psychological functioning, and both are related to a greater desire for cosmetic surgery in adolescents. Cosmetic surgeons should screen candidates for psychological vulnerability and may want to include a short screening questionnaire for a history of peer victimization.

In Washington D.C., recent legislation authorizes citizens to test if products are properly represented and, if they are not, to bring a lawsuit for the benefit of the general public. Recent studies revealing the widespread phenomenon of seafood substitution across the United States make it a fertile area for consumer protection testing. DNA barcoding provides an accurate and cost-effective way to perform these tests, especially when tissue alone is available making species identification based on morphology impossible. In this study, we sequenced the 5 barcoding region of the Cytochrome Oxidase I gene for 12 samples of vertebrate and invertebrate food items across six restaurants in Washington, D.C. and used multiple analytical methods to make identifications. These samples included several ambiguous menu listings, sequences with little genetic variation among closely related species and one sequence with no available reference sequence. Despite these challenges, we were able to make identifications for all samples and found that 33% were potentially mislabeled. While we found a high degree of mislabeling, the errors involved closely related species and we did not identify egregious substitutions as have been found in other cities. This study highlights the efficacy of DNA barcoding and robust analyses in identifying seafood items for consumer protection.

	<TEXT> According to the journal article the students and the teachers reported to sleep better:

Most teaching staff (n = 60, 95.2%) appreciated the adjustment of the new SST. They reported that their students displayed improved concentration (74.1%), reduced dozing off (68.9%), and reduced the tardiness rate (69.5%). In addition, 85% of teachers reported their own improvement in the teaching and daily schedule, and 63% of them reported improvement of their own sleep.

Our results demonstrated that adolescents gained more sleep after a modest delay in SST from 7:45 a.m. to 8:00 a.m., either compared to a comparison school or by self-comparison. The increase in total time in bed was due mainly to later wake-up time. To the best of our knowledge, the delay of 15 min is the shortest delay intervention that has been reported in the existing literature. </TEXT>
