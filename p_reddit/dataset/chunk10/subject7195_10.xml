	<TEXT> Yes, good idea. I just read The Little Book of Hygge, which goes deep into the Danish obsession for warm candle lighting, cozy places, and blankets, and how that has helped them become the planet's veritable titans of happiness. So I've already been envisioning the scene you have conjured up, my man. Thanks for the instrumental suggestions, that's a field I have a pressing need for exposure to! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which do you recommend? The copy I got so long ago is the MacAndrew translation, so I'm going to stick with that for this reading. I'm most interested in picking up the Pevear and Volokhonsky translation to compare.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Beginning The Brothers Karamazov, anyone have any advice for me? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I decided to finally start the book I've had on my reading list since I was a sophomore in high school. My history teacher gave a soapbox speech about it to us, concluding that if we wanted to know ourselves we should read The Brothers Karamazov. Years went by and I ended up taking 3 years of Russian language and culture classes in college, but never found the time for Dostoevsky. More years went by and now that I'm done with my masters, pulled out the paperback copy I bought close to 10 years ago and am ready to begin. As added incentive, my girlfriend has agreed to begin her own treacherous, long put-off book, House of Leaves, if I get through this. I'm a librarian now, so a man's gotta do what he's gotta do to get his fellow dudes to read.

I thought I'd submit a thread asking my book friends for any tips, strategies, or general advice they might have for me before I get started. I've been exposed to Russian lit and its language before, so I totally understand that nickname conventions and the huge cast of characters are hard to grasp at first, but I think I'll be okay in that regard. I suppose what I'm asking is also more for you to share your thoughts and supply some insights, or point to accompanying material/literature that can enhance the read for me. Really anything to motivate me even more to embark on this journey is appreciated. I want book hype, I want sources that provide literary context, I want someone to say, "Hey, take it from me, you should draft up a character web to help you navigate through the story," or, "Eat some borscht and embrace your inner east Slavic."

What it comes down to is I'm excited and want everyone else to be excited. Not for me, but because there are great books out there, prolific books that can mean so much to someone despite having never read the work before. Books that carry so much clout with them that just opening up the cover can fills us with an unparalleled giddy anticipation for the journey about to unfold. I'm raving, perhaps emotionally off-kilter. Whatever. I hope everyone can enjoy a nice book tonight, and thanks in advance for anything you end up sharing.

	<TEXT> Yeah, that'll work. I was griping more about trying to secure alliances at the start date, when I have no money for extra mercs. And with this -50 malus to diplo relations that AI get now, Byzantium runs are miserable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ooohh, that'd be cool to get Bulgarians to spawn. Although how do you mean free clay? In that if their demands are met, they'll become an independent nation, thus probably allowing me to declare war on them immediately before they can gather allies? I'm a little foggy on how support rebels work, and how that translates to "free clay".

I'm guaranteeing Candar at the moment, as I went a little crazy in Poland and up through Crimea. I have Caffa and the two provinces neighboring either side of it, and those are definitely in fabrication distance for when the time comes. 

Iberia is unfortunately all under Castile's solid rule. I've seen Naples break away so many times this patch, too. Of course they don't when I finally manage to get a footing now.

	<TEXT> I've had a lot of difficult allying anyone in these runs. I'm guessing have a diplo rep. adviser is necessary, since the Mamluks are never in range of being allied. But yeah, Hungary will eventually be betrayed once I get my foothold. From what everyone has been saying, I'll focus my attention of wiping out the Ottomans first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking Poland must have lost its war to the Teutonic Order and they forced them to break their alliance with Lithuania. Either way, they're fighting each other now. \_()_/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just looking for advice. Was hoping to go for Basileus and don't feel like restarting 100 more times if this one goes south. So how do I succeed from here?

I've got a truce timer with the Ottomans until '91 because I accidentally took a ton of land off Venice without realizing it and started a massive coalition war. That was bad. Poland obviously chose to go with a local lord and is fighting Lithuania now. Austria got the inheritance. Everything else looks pretty normal for an early game besides my PU with Serbia and Wallachian Vassal. My plan is to go in through Italy with a claim on the Papal State, but I'd like to finish off the Ottomans first, I think. What should my plan of attack be from here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I don't mean to diminish your efforts haha. Even when things go completely your way, it takes a lot of experience to convert those positive events into absolute boons for your run. Knowing how to manage all of what comes your way for good or for bad, especially when you're playing within the HRE, is a good feeling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, I'm with you on the Azael thing. I don't want to just sit here and bash the guy on personal preference, as I do genuinely think he's a good analyst in post game talks and such. But in game his casting always seems like he's casting to prove something. He's very negative on player performances and quick to call out how bad of a decision something is, but in my opinion color casting should be more about breaking down the gameplay, setting up why the play occurred, and then speaking about the ramifications of it. 

Azael seems far too reactive in game, mimicking play-by-play casters too much, trying to follow the action and show off his knowledge at the same time. This restricts the depth of his analysis and what comes out is just really rudimentary observations like "ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! WITH THAT ACE THEY CAN JUST GO MID AND END THE GAME" or "WHAT A TURN AROUND! THIS MEANS THEY CAN GO STRAIGHT TO BARON!" And then he'll follow-up with comments that say something like "See, that was really good for them because it was good for them." I think he gets caught up in the moment, and that ends up sacrificing a lot of insight. He has that full-of-himself vibe going on, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I just don't think he's proven that he deserves that tone, based on the knowledge he's so rarely expressed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consider donating them to your local library if you really don't like them, or don't see yourself wanting to keep them. Many libraries are really struggling these days, (for example, the state of Illinois refuses to pass a state budget, and libraries have been truly suffering for the past couple of years), so if those books are in great, circulation condition, you might be able to contribute to their collection. And if not, most libraries have a book sale section for anyone to purchase donations. Those funds go to the Friends of the Library clubs or directly back to the library itself. </TEXT>
