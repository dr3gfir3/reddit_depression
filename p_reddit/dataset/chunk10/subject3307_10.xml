	<TEXT> Me too! I'm still trying to figure out how I didn't realize it sooner. But, better late than never right? Even though my last 2 relationships were terrible, I still have hope that I will meet my special person someday. Live your life for you and be happy!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congrats on two MAJOR accomplishments! You're far more patient than I; I let daycare do the potty training for my kids...

Oh, and the no drinking thing? AWESOME JOB!! I speak from experience that that is the single most special gift you can give your daughter aside from creating her! One day at a time. You can do this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to a spa for a facial once and I must say it felt a little uncomfortable. I feel like a stranger touching and massaging my face is just a little too personal. But I have no problem whatsoever getting a full body massage. Massages are the BEST!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm very sorry this has happened to you, OP. I went through pretty much the same situation. The only difference is that we were married and had two babies, 2 yo   2 mos. Also, she didn't notify me, but I discovered it on my own.

A lot has happened in the 8 years since, but that was one of the hardest things I've ever had to go through. I completely understand your pain and if you need to talk, I'm here for you.

Take care of yourself right now and if you can help it, try not to isolate yourself and make arrangements for a friend or family member to stay with you for a week or three. Unfortunately, time is the only thing that will heal the pain, however loving support gets you through it all.

Edit: 
I'd also like to add that the only reason Kate revealed herself is because she's selfish as fuck. She didn't notify you because she felt bad about what she did, she did it because she realized that since she couldn't have him that you shouldn't either. IMO, the only possible way to show remorse for being the other woman, especially for 5 YEARS, is to quietly walk away from the asshole and disappear into oblivion. I understand that some of you may say that OP deserves to know and you are absolutely correct. However, having been in this situation, I think I would have rather avoided the pain of knowing my SO had a lengthy relationship with someone else, than to have just maybe caught him cheating on a more casual scale because it would have eventually come out regardless. Cheaters will always be cheaters, so I can say with almost 100% certainty that you and Kate weren't the only ones.
TL;DR: Kate's a selfish bitch that's just bitter that she didn't get the so-called "prize". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been able to manage my depression quite well using trees. The suicidal thoughts are pretty much gone which is a huge relief. 

The negative is that I tend to get lazy. Also, I don't have much of an appetite unless I'm high. That can be considered both good and bad, depending on how you look at it.

I'm sure it would be easier to manage in general if I were able to buy legally, but I take whatever I can get so I usually don't get the option of choosing a strain that would work best for me. I really need to work on getting a prescription...

Off topic but I'm going crazy and need to vent: I'm stuck at my dad's for a week to help take care of him (he's disabled) and only have some  low grade brown stuff. I can't wait until my gf gets here tomorrow night! She's bringing some green!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Find a lactation consultant and/or a breastfeeding support group NOW! I went through the same thing your wife is going through. I wanted to succeed at bfing so bad but I began to resent my son for being hungry because it was sooooo painful feeding him and I was as close to quitting as I could get. My friend recommended I try the hospital support group and I got the help I so desperately needed. I'm so glad I was able to get help and save my bfing experience.

Tell her to hang in there just a little bit longer and find some help asap. It's so worth it.

	<TEXT> Thank you. I have a feeling property will be removed from the house at some point while my mom is displaced. I guess it will have to be dealt with after the fact... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [CA] My mother has been displaced from her house due to a restraining order from her wife. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-07 19:36:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm at work so I'll try to make this brief. My mother got into a physical altercation with her wife [C]. Police were called and arrested my mom because C had "scratches and bruises" on her allegedly inflicted by my mom. C has preexisting medical conditions that she used to her advantage.

As of today, due to the restraining order, my mom is displaced from her house, which she has had ownership of since 1984. The house is currently in a living trust, of which C has no rights to as far as I know. We went with the police yesterday afternoon on a civil standby to collect some personal belongings and my mom noticed there are several boxes packed in the house. I also want to add that C requested that the police allow her to inspect the personal belongings my mom packed to be sure no community property was being taken, which they allowed her to do.

What can we do to protect what is currently in the home so that C doesn't remove any property from the house? My mom has a criminal defense lawyer, but still needs to find a divorce lawyer. She wants to wait to find a divorce lawyer until this afternoon after she meets with her defense lawyer, but I feel like something needs to be done immediately. C is vindictive and I wouldn't put anything past her at this point. She tried to refuse my mother entry to the home even with police escort, so who knows what she's capable of. I have notified the neighbors of the situation and asked them to contact one of us if they notice property being removed from the home.

Is there some type of document that can be filed (maybe something I can do myself??) with the court to prevent the removal of any property from the house? My mom has spent a ton of money on this so far and is trying to avoid having to pay a lot more, but I feel at this point she needs to pony up so she doesn't lose more in the long run. I'm not quite sure my mom realizes how serious this is and I'm trying to reduce her potential loss as much as I can.

Any advice would be GREATLY appreciated. Thank you so much in advance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glad to know I'm not the only one that inspects, wipes and sits. Only your thighs and butt cheeks are touching the seat, so what's the big deal? If you're that concerned about germs, you should be carrying some cleaning wipes in your purse. </TEXT>
