	<TEXT> The problem is that theory can't in any way be construed as some kind of positive political programme. Theory starting with the frankfurt school takes some kind of aporia or fundamental negativity as the basis for social relations. I found the article humorous because it basically showed the disconnect between theory and every day life, and that's great because everything that matters is impractical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No. The idea that responsibility for smashing the Kyriarchy is one sided simply because the phrase toxic feminity doesn't exist is poor reasoning.

I'm not saying that, I'm talking about this particular domain and I'd replace the phrase 'toxic feminity' in place of 'heteronormativity'. I do think though that the phenomenon of toxic femininity - fetishising gendered lifestyle choices based ultimate in some kind of biological definition of sex - would be particularly useful. Even if as you say, SAHMs are setting boundaries within their relationships, surely this is a facade that gives the illusion of independence in what is ultimately a one-sided role? The success of Sex and the City, Desperate Housewives etc surely shows that a significant number of women aspire to this kind of lifestyle. I don't see many active attempt to by feminists to stigmatize what is clearly an anti-feminist lifestyle choice itself. Indeed, it seems to me that attempts to glamorize 'sex work' may in some ways be a false negation that provides the veneer of professionality to what is clearly a patriarchial role.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't find a thing on Stoltenberg sorry. 

As for toxic femininity, I don't think it should be posited as somehow 'opposite' or obverse to masculinity. Doing this misses the whole queer dimensionality of gender and misrecognizes the essential nature of masculinity and femininity (I understand that this is up for debate but I'm a Lacanian and essentially see these two poles of gender as complementary rather than antithetical). I think though that women have to be the primary agents of feminist social change and to that extent there *should be* a disproportionate emphasis on toxic femininity which is something women can actually undo themselves. To that extent we should be asking people of all genders whether they're perpetuating hetronormativity in their behavior, not *just* sexism. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is using the phrase 'toxic masculinity' to describe a certain set of behaviours problematic? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-08 00:31:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The term 'toxic masculinity' is only ever really applied to men. It therefore casts men as active and women as passive in maintaining and dismantling kyriarchy when of cours women can also be complicit in encouraging these behaviors.  'Toxic masculinity' implies that such a thing as 'healthy masculinity' exists and is to be encouraged. Of course, such a thing is impossible because at its core, all masculinity is premised on the idea that men have an essential gender-based superiority to protect. It seems from my experience that toxic masculinity is enacted by men so that certain gender norms can be enforced against other men - it's about maintaining and purifying a certain idea of masculinity in a group and the negative effects against women are purely a side effect. In this way, whatever the social impact of toxic masculinity, Queer men are always direct losers, being forced to perform a certain role and erase their identity to maintain 'in group' status. The term 'heteronormativity' can be a bit academic, but why isn't an equivalent word should be used by feminists in order to actually unpack the performative aspects of violent gender based behaviour? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Indeed. I think there is though there can be an unneccessary level of abstraction to someone like Derrida. Dropping a word like 'differance' or 'always-already' can function as a sort of linguistic in-group signifier in the way that 'synergy' functions in corporate discourse or 'IED' functions in military discourse.  When we don't have any common cannon to identify ourselves by, I think theory can be a tempting way for academics to establish in-group out-group status. Obviously the term 'accessibility' is loathed by academics who tend to see it most urgently used by grant-making bodies, but I think there is a danger of chasing obscurantism for its own sake.  I was writing a paper on history and atheism and I felt writing about post-modernity was much easier addressing historically specific intellectual developments. I found it much easier using a language shared by pretty much all humanities departments than by independently learning to 'think with' unique historical discourse.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok so the problem with this idea that all that was once lived becomes mere representation is the fact that it misses a large performative component of late capitalism. Check out this [Jucero press](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N51oiMv3IJw) which I think anyone would identity with the latest manifestation of silicon valley futurism. What seems to be up for sale are some very specific performative actions. The point isn't to conveniently taste some orange juice, it's to go through the japanese tea room-like motions - scanning the opening the box, scanning the QR, sending back the packaging - that the simple inscribe act of drinking juice as a revolutionary gesture toward toward the future. 

This proves to me that there can't be a spectacle without a supplement based in some kind of signified lived experience. After some kind of zero-point, people will start to realise that empty advertisements do not speak to them and they *must* return to a clearly identifiable physical  reality.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah but this is where things get confused. There's postmodern art and postmodern thought, which are critical responses to a form of late capitalism which I would describe "postmodernity" and then there's the cultural products that came from this regime without challenging it. More and more I see comment pieces in national papers blaming "postmodernism" for Trump/Brexit/the GFC. They would be correct if they identified say the Kendall Jenner Pepsi ad or the Emoji movie as manifestations of a larger ideological state apparatus which can in various ways be linked to these calamities. Yet it seems to me names like Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault and Judith Butler get thrown under the bus instead. It's similar to how Nietzsche didn't kill god, but gets blamed for secular relativism it in popular culture anyway.  </TEXT>

A system like that can only operate by presupposing that people are essentially tainted by original sin and need to be ruled by a Leviathan operating under divine right. I think Edmund Burke's [Reflections on the Revolution in France](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflections_on_the_Revolution_in_France) which were a direct response to Rousseau, Tocqueville, Voltaire et al capture these sentiments best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're a constitutional Monarchy, so Rosseau doesn't really fit into British political tradition. Hobbes was actually a royalist in the English Civil war, which later formed the basis of the current ruling Tory party and I think is actually echoed quite strongly in Theresa May's politics. I think it would be fair to characterize the main opposition in terms of media support and voting comes from a Lockean type of (neo)liberalism which I think Blair, Cameron and the Remain vote represented. Although the current political configuration doesn't reflect this because we have a parliamentary first past the post system which has really entrenched Labour a democratic socialist party which really arose as a response to a specific period in history where social class was pretty distinct.  </TEXT>

The problem with austerity is that with Brexit, it's been projected into infinity. There's a feeling of familiarity about it. We're British right? We have stiff upper lips, we keep calm and we carry on, we lie back and think of England. We're a nation that *wants to* suffer. Sure it may hurt but when you're in the ballot box and you put your political hat on, you suddenly ask yourself 'which candidate *feels* right' and it will always be the Tories because we don't know any better.  </TEXT>

Feminism is for me fundamentally about re-imagining the very notion of Cartesian subjectivity. Through the Eucharist, the church offers to absolve us from our flesh and to become one in the body of Christ. It's a deeply deeply sexual act, which entails reimagining the very notion of capitalist/patriarchical desire.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not at all. Freud said that inhibition is the price of civilisation. To be a proper member of civic society in a liberal democracy, you have to be understand why your its wrong to call your neighbours 'thieving gypos' in public, you have to restrain yourself through education so that certain things become unthinkable and people from different backgrounds can coexist. Fascism is an incredibly permissive ideology, its about allow people to indulge themselves and to not have to think through their actions and their worldview. The price of course is a country where people lose their humanity and ability to collectively understand themselves, they define themselves entirely in terms of these negative individual freedoms.  There's no space for expression or creation, its a society held together by destructive hateful impulses that seeks to tear down everything with it and eventually itself. What we've effectively seen is the aestheticism of fascism itself - we've externalised this inner evil impulse that we all have to contend with, so that its come to bring about very specific mustache and swastika connotation wrapped in our own memories of WWII. </TEXT>

Genealogy is a pretty well established technique to do so. Passion still means an almost divine devotion to something - if you have a passion for say, pottery then you're willing to in some sense go beyond what would be expected of you and suffer your comforts for it. To be passionate, especially in the realm of interpersonal relationships is to be willing to suffer for another person. You have to let someone know if you're feel passionately about them, otherwise it becomes a gift that you desperately want to give but they don't want to receive and it blurs the entire relationship. In any case, it's not possible to maintain an honest relationship if you keep it under wraps.  </TEXT>

If we're going to be deconstructionists we can't simply say 'no means no', we have to look at how 'no' pre-supposes that a 'yes' exists which can be taken to mean any number of things not necessarily in opposition to 'no' and the 'meaning' is a problematic concept in itself which entirely depends on the existence of certain truth regimes... It's ridiculous and inhumane to even start getting academic like this in the face of an obvious instance of injustice, we necessarily have to make some kind of affirmative statement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd largely agree with what you said but I'd have to contest this:

Calling gender a social construct is not a simplification, and its not unimportant. Its still epicly complicated and nuanced. I agree that gender is a huge part of how many people define themselves, but not everyone, and its not necessary. I cant define myself by my gender because it would do my head in, and I was only able to find peace once i stopped trying. 

The point of a social construct, I think isn't only about how people define themselves but it's also about how *we* define *each other*. If I know absolutely nothing about somebody then their gender-presentation is one of the only ways to be able to instantly relate with their life experience and recognize them as fully human. To say 'I don't see gender' is to be as obtuse as to say 'I don't see race'. Obviously there are plenty of other ways of identifying how to relate to someone but in a world set on tearing social life apart - it's one of the few ways for people to establish themselves as a member of society. For this reason, we need a *clear idea* of what gender actually is, so people can see beyond themselves and recognize the how we are all indeed inter-reliant on one another. Increasingly, at least in the petty-bourgeois circles I travel in, it seems that women are encouraged to have this conversation about what it means to be female whereas men are almost mostly excluded and thus turn to hateful spaces that will negatively engage with masculinity. This sub, and films like Moonlight are a good start  but we need to be way more expansive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The answer I think simply boils down to the profit incentive. 

I don't believe in drug legalisation because, subjected only to the market forces companies will find the crudest possible way to make money without any regard for the consequences. Regulating the market is about what defining what kinds of behaviours are socially permissible. If people have to 'go underground' to get substances then they are forced to consciously reject social teachings if they want to get high. If people are actively making the choice to degenerate like this then we can ask ourselves introspective questions about why we live in such a society that its own members would reject it and get enslaved by some substance.

	<TEXT> Problem comes when we actually try and define love, language just doesn't capture it. It's much easier to talk about pain and suffering because it's something we have all felt whereas love is totally evasive. 

Indeed I think it's true to say that he only way to access love is through pain. There's almost a biological component to pain, it's satisfying to watch say a horror movie because it reduces someone to a mere body. Indeed I think part of the appeal of Christianity is the comedy of worshipping a pathetic man-god suffering in infinite pain. Have you ever had the experience of cringing at something so hard you have to hit yourself to take the mental anguish away? That's the Christian experience for me at least - seeing the pain of the world and knowing that it's all ephemera compared to the infinity of love. Love is something that's really quite irrational, its when the barrier between giving and receiving breaks down. If you've ever had a partner ask 'why do you love me?' You'll know it's a question that can never be fully answered - if I were to say 'your hair' or 'your laughter' it would never properly satisfy. The figure of Jesus is to me the only adequate way to reconcile love and language because his experience on the cross resonates with the absurdity of love and being alive. Because of this I think it's dangerous to simply say 'love is god' - as we're just conflated anything that can't be immediately explained with holiness, when the reality is that what we once thought was love wasn't actually true love. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because despite forty years of feminist efforts, gender differences are as entrenched as ever. Sure we've reached a degree of parity but that hasn't changed the fact of gender expression still exists. Gender expression is rooted in certain behaviours which need in turn to be guided in specific ideals to bring about some kind of maturity to the population.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No, hes saying that any man, trans or cis, might not be capable of the same type of masculinity. 

How can you not be capable of exercising something like courage? It's not exactly like playing Pachelbel's Canon in D or beating an orangutan in a cage fight, its a fluid attribute rooted in choice and will. To say that someone is incapable of something like this is to suggest that they're not fully human. Granted, what something like courage might look like depends entirely on the situation and I'd deter people making negative judgements - but if every man knows that what takes guts and sacrifice to do is usually the right thing  then I can only see the world getting better. 

 And just because someone is trans doesn't mean they have to uphold standards of the gender they identify with.

How can they identify with that gender if they don't feel compelled to uphold any values that define that gender? The only way I can this working out is by reducing the entire concept of gender to see aesthetic or biological preference, that I think is innately anti-LGBT.

 I don't think trans people need these ideological objective ideals of gender in order to pass or to know how to live their life. They are just like cis people in that we all have to figure out what our gender means for us and having some ideal forced upon us is unhealthy for everyone but the lucky few where that cookie cutter mold already fits perfectly.

Just as a technical point of clarification, these aren't objective ideals, they're intersubjective ideals rooted in an aporia of essential manliness. The cyncic in me says that this idea that people know who they really are deep down is rooted in a innately modernist/cartestian bias that fits deeply into neoliberal behaviourist choice theory. Ask any trans person and they'll tell you that they didn't choose to be trans, a gender that exists in this realm of the imaginary ideals chose them. What I'm saying here is that it's not enough to simply write off things like this as a being  'social constructs' and thus unimportant, we literally have nothing else to define ourselves by. The point isn't to destroy masculinity, it's to define consciously work to define masculinity in a positive way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If my neighbour bought a knife from a supermarket, would Sainsburys be held accountable if he stabbed me? Headshop owners knew they were selling a highly addictive substance and they had the cover of a big warning on the packet saying 'not for human consumption'. There's no way they were accountable before the psychoactive substances bill. 

Sorry but there's no way on earth that publicly stigmatising it and forcing people to go underground to get it directly caused an uptick in usage. Heck I'm in Manchester city centre right now and I'm pretty sure the problem is rooted in larger social issues. </TEXT>
