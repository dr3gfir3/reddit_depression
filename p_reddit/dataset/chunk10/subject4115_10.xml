	<TEXT> My mind tried to wash the corpses out of the memory, because they were the evidence of my crimes. I think it tried to do that with murder weapons and other things, but some of my tools were so sacred that it wasn't allowed. Most of the details I struggle to remember, but when they come to me it's so exhilarating. 

Thank you for your kind words. I'm glad it spoke to you. If I do end up writing anything of significance I'd love to share it! </TEXT>
