	<TEXT> i'm going to say it's a collection of city states each competing for more land. i make a version of this piece at the beginning of every year (without referring to last year's illustration) to see how i've changed -- gay pride has gotten larger and anxiety has lost some territory, for reference :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't used him in the games either actually! I was just very confused / intrigued by the character design so I decided to see if I could add to it. I don't even own the new games yet, but as an illustrator / designer I'm often more interested in how pokemon designs work aesthetically-- Dhelmise really threw me because, as people in the comments section keep mentioning, it doesn't really have any discernible facial features or expressions. That really bothered me when I first saw it, but when I looked up its backstory where it talked about how it's possessed ghost-seaweed, the design grew on me, and now I actually think it's pretty cool. Plus there have been faceless pokemon since gen 1 with Starmie (coincidentally another one of my favorites! haha). I actually often end up prefering the more ambiguous character designs like Dhelmise, Starmie, Aegislash etc. to the more humanoid ones (Pheromosa, Tornadus, etc.) So I guess the reason Dhelmise is one of my favorites from this gen is because he made me ponder the most, if that makes sense :P </TEXT>
