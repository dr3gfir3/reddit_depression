	<TEXT> damn, i must be the odd one out, i will never support/back abusing players unless it's fully warranted, bad performances/tactics doesn't cut the mustard for me, it's clear the #WengerOut movement isn't working atm and i don't think the board will be tempted to do anything different because fans are abusing the players. That shit won't help at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> im a sucker for chill hop/lo fi beats like these, and this is an awesome listen! everything sounds perfect, the only slight criticism i would add is that the snare isn't as snappy and doesn't stand out as well, other than that, i fucking love it! will give you a follow.  </TEXT>
