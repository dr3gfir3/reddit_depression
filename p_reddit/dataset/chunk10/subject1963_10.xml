	<TEXT> Diamonds and gems - even non-engagement gifts - are a big deal. I think it's just the DIAMOND thing. It's a very romantic gift. My fianc did something similar. We had only been together like two months when my birthday came around, getting serious pretty fast. But we had talked about all kinds of weird stuff and I had mentioned once that I'd wanted a ring in my birthstone. I don't even remember how or why it would have come up. 

In comes my 21st birthday. I wasn't working at the time, staying at his place. He was only 24 but had a very respectable job, his own place, great finances, the whole deal. He's a lot like your boyfriend actually, frugal mostly but knows when to invest. He came home from work, reached into a the pocket of a coat that was hanging on the door, and literally tossed a ring box at me. 

That was it. Just "Hey, sorry I'm home a little late, Happy Birthday!" And a tossed ring box. Understandably, I had a panic face on, but he just turned bright red which didn't help my nerves. As I started opening it he explained that he remembered me saying it a while ago and thought this was a good opportunity. 

So here's this ring, white gold and an oval amethyst and a couple of tiny diamonds on the side. He kept stammering on about how the diamonds were really really tiny and were barely diamonds anyway, but that he thought I might like it. I still don't know how much it cost, at least a few hundred dollars, and only two months in?! I was basically super embarrassed but very grateful. My family didn't have money growing up, nicer things were hard to come by, I'd never been given jewelry like this ever. 

Think of it like this: he invests in tech. He wants a quality item that serves a function or makes him happy. He is frugal at times so that he can splurge other times, where he feels it is deserved. He has decided to invest in a gift for you. He found something that would bring you joy, he wanted to do that for you. It is flattering and it also FEELS like a lot of pressure. But he clearly trusts and loves you enough to want to do this for you. 

I lose my shit all the time. I am the worst. But now I have an engagement ring worth ~$7k that I haven't lost ever. My amethyst ring sits in a dish by my bed right next to my engagement ring. I once misplaced my engagement ring for like four minutes and freaked. But I know what it's worth and I know the sentimental value so I check for it on my hand. It's beautiful and I cherish it. 

It sounds like you guys are on roughly the same page about your relationship. An age difference can be a BIG factor - our difference was even smaller but I felt like the ring carried SO much meaning because it came from someone who was very well established in his life. 

Do you love the ring? Do you WANT to wear it? Sounds like it. Wear it. Love it. Don't think of the number. Think of it like you did before - it cost some amount of money, it's beautiful, you appreciate it. That's my only advice. The discomfort you're feeling is very normal. It can take some getting used to. For a few months after we got engaged I couldn't stop thinking "I'm carrying seven grand on my hand!" And I still get nervous about losing it or anything happening to it. It's natural to feel jittery about an expensive gift. 

Practically speaking, too, you don't even have to worry about putting it on your parents insurance. There are insurance companies that are specifically for jewelry. In fact, most jewelers work in-house with a third party insurer. That's how mine is insured. They just ask for an appraisal and stuff and it's a really small payment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is so me. I've always been heavier, I was 206/Size 14 at my heaviest, with some MAJOR body dysmorphia that pretty much had me convinced that I looked like I was 500 pounds. When I got engaged in 2015 with a wedding planned for 2017 I was like "oh well, I'll just have more time to find a dress that doesn't make me look fat". My mother and sister dearest (bitches!) made "funny" comments about fitting my butt into dresses, finding something that fit right, trying on 200 dresses, etc. I know they love me but they can be a little shitty sometimes. It hurts. I felt like they were justifying the picture I had of myself. And they made it sound like I could never change, I'd just slowly get bigger or stay where I was, and that was that. Not like they have room to talk. My mom is pretty heavy and my sister has put on like 20 pounds in the last year. But they do like I did, swear up and down that a change will be made, weight will be lost. Never happened for any of us. 

Shortly after I started treatment for depression. And I began getting more and more upset at the comments. So I started eating super healthy, vegan at home, put more effort into my appearance and into my health.  Stopped making excuses. Knew I didn't want to feel awful at my wedding. 

I'm down to 180ish. Not a huge loss but... something. And I got to order my dress in an 8! I am on track to lose maybe 34 more, landing me at around 145-150, a weight I haven't been since I was 16. I will probably have to alter my dress down to a 6.  I'm okay with this. 

Your progress is freaking amazing. You're going to slay at this wedding!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Family is being dumb 
2. Family is being EXTRA dumb
3. We're over budget 
4. I am getting lazy 
5. There are only four months left 
6. I still have to arrange everyone's accommodations

Coping? Mostly naps. And sushi. Also, I bought cute roller skates. They're fun and it's a great workout but I still have problems skating... in general. So it's funny. FH used to skate like crazy when he was younger so he had zero problems getting used to it again, literally skating in circles around me. I fell twice. Still fun. 

But I really am looking forward to the wedding weekend, even if half of everything goes wrong, it will be great. And besides, we have an awesome two week honeymoon that we leave for the same day we leave our venue (day after the wedding). So, even if it's stressful and I am ready to GO, there's plenty to look forward to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been with my guy for six years now and I initially felt exactly like you do. Actually, sometimes I still feel that way, but I've learned a few ways to make myself less of a jerk. 

My family situation was a little fucked up. My parents screamed at each other, sometimes at my sister, mostly at me. We also didn't have much money but we apparently had enough that my parents could buy themselves nice things... then complain about how we were short on grocery money. I spent as much of my life out of the house as I could, starting in middle school. They had a nasty divorce when my sister and I were 17 and 20, they're still jerks, whatever. 

My fiances parents divorced when he was really young but they're all still very friendly. They both remarried and both sides of the family are very close and very normal. It's so weird seeing a family interact and thinking "is this what families are supposed to do???" 

I was almost resentful and to be honest, spending time with some of them was really annoying for a while. But I got over it. I was very honest with my FH from the beginning about why I was weird around his family - he'd seen some of my family's dysfunctional dynamics firsthand, so he knew, but it still took him a long time to really understand how hard it was for me - just like I didn't know what a "good" family was like, he didn't know what a "bad" one was like. 

Talk to your girlfriend. Let her know it's nothing personal, that you just never had that normalcy, and that you're used to having a guard up around family and it's a difficult thing to unlearn. And until it gets easier, find something to help you get through visits. 

For me, it went like this: I know every person has their problems. Some of FH's family isn't my favorite. But whether or not I liked them didn't matter. I picked one or two things to be my "focus" with each person. Asked them about X thing they liked to do, or Y thing they had mentioned doing last time I saw them. They were happy to see me taking an interest, I got more comfortable, and slowly it became easier to spend time around them. 

But your biggest helper here has to be your girl - she may not understand completely, but if she knows a little about your family, she will get it if you sit down with her and say "this is not something I'm used to, can you help me out until I get more comfortable?"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, I'M impressed, which is funny. I keep thinking about it and it's mostly dread and stress but every once in a while I'm like "oh shit, this is kinda strong too, check me out". 

Super not weird to say you're proud of me. Thank you!! You're my new mom now though, is that cool? I'll be there in two weeks! Yay! 

A zoo wedding sounds so cool! We knew we wanted a "unique" venue and we definitely ended up with one. A zoo sounds like so much fun though omg I would be too busy running around to have a wedding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It WOULD be a shame. For him. For me... this is my olive branch. If he wants to set it on fire, that's on him. He's a grown up. He'll just prove exactly how much he cares about his family, and I'll be fine either way. 

And thank you for saying that. I do try, I've had a really hard last few years with untreated depression and the last few months of treatment have been incredibly hard, but my confidence to confront my dad only happened because I'm working on getting better. I should have done this a long time ago, I've always been the no-nonsense sort of "keep your drama approximately ninety billion miles away from me thank you" kind of person, so I feel like I don't do enough. It feels really good to hear someone say that, so thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically, my sister got pregnant at 18. She was nowhere near ready to have a baby. She was on birth control but it obviously failed. Long story short, she found a wonderful family to adopt the baby, open adoption, and they have been a major part of our family since then. Literally a week after he was born, she brought their family on our family vacation. She sees us for birthdays and holidays and we plan stuff together. I get to see my nephews (he's got an older brother, also adopted) all the time and it makes me really happy. 

My dad is a fucking child. That's putting it nicely. He has always been immature, angry, overly sensitive, and a raging asshole. He is still my dad, but after my parents split in 2010, I have seen him less and less every year. Last year I saw him twice. I haven't spoken to him since Christmas Eve. I would still like he and my stepfamily to be able to be at the wedding. So they are invited, as guests. We're skipping the traditional toasts and dances and stuff because that's not us, so I get to tell him that too. But. 

My dad has never met his grandson. Not once. The mother of my nephew, K, is super nice but she is fierce as hell, too. There were rules to introducing new family to the baby. Since my dad and sister were on the outs when the baby was born, he wasn't there for the birth like my mom's family was. (It's worth noting that my sister and dad/stepfamily were on the outs because, when they found out sister was pregnant, they sobbed and told her she was making a mistake and told her she couldn't just give her baby away, that if she didn't want it they would raise it, blah blah. They never at once respected her decision. I shut that shit down really fast by becoming the middle man between them and my sister. But it was a HUGE blow to my sister, who was already going through an incredibly tough time.) 

K had never met my dad's family.  She did know what they'd said to my sister, so she knew they were being totally rude about the whole thing. So the rule was, when he came to meet the baby for the first time, it would be at K's house. And it would have to just be my dad at first. She didn't want a whole group of people she didn't know coming into her home with a lot of really tense emotion. Totally reasonable. 

Except to my dad and stepmom, it wasn't. They INSISTED that their family be able to see him, all of them, on THEIR schedule. Uh. No. Shot down. So instead of then following the rules, Dad tried AGAIN with "oh, just me and stepmom then". No. Just you. One at a time. That's the rule. K was super flexible with her schedule, she and my sister tried countless times to get my dad to meet with them. He would meet with my sister for breakfast, swear it was just going to be him, and surprise! Stepmom is in the car too. She never apologized for how she acted towards my sister. I don't blame her for her feelings, I understand that a LITTLE BIT because of her family background - religious, very close. But it doesn't excuse her reaction. 

So, it's been FOUR YEARS since then. My nephew is going to turn 5 before this wedding. None of my dad's family has met them. 

So here's where I have to wedge myself in - I am having a wedding. We have the venue for the weekend, which is important, but even if we didn't, this means that both sets of people will be in the same place. I do not want this first meeting to happen at my wedding. I don't want to know what will happen. I am not risking it. So I thought about it, and I told my sister and mom and my fiance. I am going to contact K. I am going to ask her if she's willing to meet with my dad, and maybe later my stepmom, before the wedding. If she is, I'm going by HER schedule. She'll make time, I know she will. 

Then I'm going to go to my dad and tell him this: "I am not going to have this first meeting be at my wedding. It's time for you guys to meet, and then in September we can all have a nice time together with no tension. Here is how it will go: you will drive to my house. If you are alone, I will drive you in my car to K's house. You will meet. If it goes well, we can introduce stepmom, then stepsisters and etc at a later date. We might even be able to go straight from just you that day to the four of you a week later if things go really well. This will happen before my wedding because it is waaayyy too high stress to add to an already stressful time. If you can follow this one rule, great! Everyone will get to know each other and we can do things together more often. I would love that. But if you can't follow that rule, you will not be coming to my wedding. End of story." 

I used to be a bit timid about stressful things because I had a weird childhood and I am also just a ball of nerves at the best of times. Some time in the last few years I grew a shiny steel spine and I do enjoy wielding it from time to time. But man, does this one hurt. I can't believe it has taken this long. I can't believe his ego has been soooo important for almost FIVE YEARS... to the degree that he's never met his first grand kid. 

Sorry for the rant, I just figure there will be other wedditors out there with dumb family things going on, and while I frequent justnofamily and stuff like that, I needed perspective from other people getting married or who have gotten married with crappy family stuff going on. Done.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, "taking a deep breath" is for squares. I prefer gin. I told my mother this the other day when she was half-assed listening to my rant about organizing accommodations (because it somehow became my responsibility to make sure everyone rents the right places, even though I provided TONS of information on four different options) and how I just want to make people comfortable, because we're going to be there all weekend, and... I just got up in the middle of the conversation, got some gin, sat back down. Mom was like "where did you go?" And I said "gin." And she said "oh. Do you want me to help with organizing things?" Uh, duh. Needed that a while ago, last time I asked. Maybe before I turn to the devil's drink to get me through the day. 

I would suggest talking to Grandma yourself and seeing what she wants to do. Mom is, of course, going to just try and push through. This is not quite what you wanted anyway, so talk to Grandma and see what she wants to do. I don't know your Grandma, but most Grandmas I know would be cool with whatever would make everyone else feel comfortable. Let her Skype in for as much as she wants. Have your mom make sure that the guests know ahead of time what happened and why Grandma isn't there. If there are any specific "birthday" things that would be out, it's up to you whether or not to remove those things. Anything with vendors? That too. Let them know if it's relevant to what they're doing. It's going to be a bummer but it's going to happen, and at the end of the day, I'm gonna throw the line at you, it will really be worth it. You'll be married, the whole ordeal will be over and THEN you can relax. Maybe with liquor. I don't know you, I don't know what you drink, but you've earned a few.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's like you're me, but me from a year ago. FH and I got engaged 12-19-15. We're getting married in September, so not completely two years but it has certainly felt like it. A long engagement has its pros and cons - the positives being more time to plan, more availability with venues, more time to save money, and more time to really fine tune what you want. I was very cool and blas about the whole thing at first. I kind of wanted a longer engagement anyway. But I got overconfident and thought "I'll have plenty of time!" and now I'm planning a majority of my wedding with four months to go. So, YMMV. 

The extra time can absolutely feel like ages. Mentally, it seems totally reasonable to wait another few months, what's another few months in the long run, blah blah. But oh man can it get on your nerves. I wanted to be married by this last winter. We picked through venues (we live in LA but wanted a very outdoorsy wedding up a mountain and wanted somewhere that we could have the venue for the whole weekend instead of just a single day) and I basically gave up for a while. I was convinced we were never going to get married. 

BUT! After many, uh, unique (insane) google search terms, I stumbled upon our venue. It's everything I wanted and it's so pretty and charming it makes me want to puke. The people who own it are literally the nicest people I've ever met. I didn't find them on wedding wire or the knot or any of the specialty sites. I just started changing up my search terms, I think I found these guys through some kind of combo of "wedding photography blog southern california mountain weekend trees". No lie. Went through the image searches. A photographer's blog about a pretty wedding they shot is what lead me to the venue. A beautiful photo of a field near the ceremony spot. I felt like crying. I had been engaged eight months at that point and was so disheartened. I was set on this place without even seeing it in person. Once I'd found the name, I went ham on searching for more wedding blogs with pictures. So. Pretty. It is three hours from home - not quite 3,000 miles, but still requires a hefty drive for most things - and it's not at all in the area I thought I would find something. But it is perfect. 

Point being, it WILL happen. I pinky promise. And it will be super annoying to feel like you're waiting forever sometimes, but you'll be grateful for the extra time, too. Enjoy being engaged. Get creative with your search. Think about how feasible it would be for you to organize vendor meetings - might require a trip for tastings but most information is easily passed on through email or skype. Think about doing an all-inclusive venue if there are any in the area - then you can see if you can do a single visit, if you love it, one more visit might do it. I'm guessing you'd be planning farther away because that's where family is - do you have any family there that could run errands for you? Trust someone's opinion on cake? That's another option. 

Sorry this turned into an essay. I had coffee for the first time in two months, lol, but also I just have Feelings about long engagements and finding the right place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plenty of people have covered how shitty the situation is and how unreasonable your parents are going, so as a person currently in the middle of planning a wedding with my psycho family, I'll help with logistics. Where is your wedding? Anywhere private? If it's a backyard wedding it's different, but I'm going to go with the idea that you're having a traditional sort of wedding/venue. Most of them have some sort of entrance. This will be important later. 

You sit down with your parents and your sister together. You tell them that her behavior is what's causing this - you shouldn't have to worry about your adult sister's tantrums, especially on your wedding day. You understand she went through something awful, and she is your sister, but her behavior is not okay. There will be a dress code. It will be enforced. There will be a standard of behavior that will be enforced. 

And you hire security. Doesn't need to be anything fancy, might cost a couple hundred bucks, but if you really want your family there and they insist she comes, you can have someone on hand to remove her if she does something ridiculous. Or just not let her in if she looks like a slob. They stand at the entrance or near a central point when people arrive. You can let them know specifically who it is you're worried about, that she's only there because your family refused to come without her. You get your family there, you get peace of mind. But you have to be very clear with them that this is only because you really want your parents and grandparents there. You're not condoning her behavior. But if it takes that to get them to go, and hiring security, it might be worth it. 

I've been seriously considering one for my wedding because both of my sets of parents are dramatic assholes who never grew up. It's a big chunk of change in an already tight budget, but if I don't have to worry, it's worth it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My 10M has done this since I started with them two years ago. It's a pain in the brain but just remember, they're just kids with dumb kid brains. I am not gonna lie and say I'm not still offended sometimes, but then I remember I can either A: ice him out and ignore him and his comments until he gets bored, or B: take away his screen time, which makes him more mad so he throws a tantrum, but it gets him out of my face for a while. 

Only in the last few months have I gotten a really good grasp on how to handle him. His parents work a lot but they're well aware of what he's like, he's been going to a behavioral therapist and has gotten a little better. Still has fits and screams about everyone ruining his life. Now I just ignore it, or if he tries to bug me to get something I just raise my eyebrows and look at him until he walks away. Calm. Cool. Collected. I'm not any of those things but I am damn good at pretending, lol. 

I play both good cop and bad cop. If you play fair and follow the rules and want to hang out and have fun, great! Go grab a little piece of homework after two healthy snacks. Want to have a dance party? I'll DJ! Want to kick and scream on the floor because I won't let you have screen time even though you were right there when your mom told me you couldn't have any today? You can go sit your butt at the far side of the dining room table, where I can see you from the couch, and you can read a book or draw. My kiddos know that if they can't follow directions, I am a no-nonsense kinda nanny. But that if they're respectful, rewards come. 

But again, it's been two years for me. And sometimes I feel like some of the things I say or do are a little petty. But the big booster for my respect also came from the parents - reports on continued bad behavior, requesting to sit down with the kid and remind the kid that I am totally in charge while they're away. Setting very firm rules helped a lot. that thing about the healthy snacks? They have to have two full healthy, like, fruit or veg, maybe cheese, snacks before they can ask for candy. Their treat is usually something small - two starburst, a mini chocolate. Whatever's in the cabinet. But if behavior is bad, no amount of healthy snacks is going to earn that reward back when it's taken away. And if they cry, if they try to be a jerk when you have to say No to something - not your fault. They know exactly what they're doing, and it's crappy but that's a prime age for kids learning to push boundaries with authority. Don't let the waterworks pressure you into it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Carnival Sensation out of Miami, September 11th. Ocho Rios and Grand Cayman. Aft extended balcony - haven't had a balcony since I was a kid with my family. Never been on an East Coast cruise at all before, so we're excited even if it wasn't the ideal itinerary. We typically sail out of LA on the same class ship with Carnival (we live 15 minutes from port!) so this will be a nice change without being too jarring. We'll already know our way around! We just got confirmation we'll be doing the Chef's Table dinner too, a first for us. 

Getting married Saturday the 9th, breakfast with family on the 10th then getting on a plane, boarding on Monday, debarking Saturday. Then renting a nice convertible in Miami, having a nice lunch, and driving up to Orlando for 8 days at Disney World. Total of 2 weeks! I may be just as excited for my honeymoon as I am for my wedding weekend!  </TEXT>

We're getting married on the 9th up a mountain in Southern California though, and not leaving until the morning of the 10th. Might be difficult to get to the port in time, so we picked the one leaving on the 11th.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is basically what happened with my SO. I thought he was cute, asked one of his friends about him. They said "he doesn't talk to girls" and I pretty much said "hold my beer!" except it was liquor. Sat down next to him, asked him a dumb question about the poker game he was playing, apparently had my hand on his knee for half the night (I do not remember this part because I was high on extrovert adrenaline) and we ended up spending the whole night talking. Went on our first date the next night. 

We're getting married in September. Woo!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like my MIL. She likes to insinuate that I am some kind of two dimensional alcoholic. She forgets my birthday every year (going on six years in a row!) but the "gift" she throws together at the last minute (literally right after FH mentions it) always has something to do with wine - a wine journal (?), a wine glass, etc. She makes little digs all the time that, even if you hear the words, don't always make sense to other people. But basically more of the same - shrouded insults. 

On a camping trip last summer, I felt awful and sick and wasn't sleeping well. Unusual for me. I had been drinking whatever I normally drink on a camping trip, not excessively, and half of the rest of the family also had several beers and wine with dinner. I woke up one morning after breakfast and she laid into me with some kind of fucking inquisition trying to figure out what I was doing "wrong" - first she suggested I wasn't drinking enough water. I have been backpacking for 14 years and survival camping 15. I have been camping since I was an infant. I know how elevation works. She then was like "well it's probably because of how much you've been drinking!" 

FH didn't see the problem at the time. He has since learned. We started wedding planning a little over a year ago and she went full throttle. He was all "she can't be that bad, that's not like her" and I was like "she literally scolded me for wearing comfortable shoes to our forest wedding, made only negative comments when I tried on dresses, and gives me this condescending tone and smile CONSTANTLY" and then he started to see it. And he started to remember other shit she'd said that had made me uncomfortable through the years. Hah. Took him long enough.  </TEXT>

Even though it's at a lower speed, the cars are less stable. The effect is like genuinely getting rear-ended by someone. It's not cool.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we have basically the same skin. I'm slightly more fair at MAC 15-20, skin LOOKS yellow but is actually olive, after much experimentation. I had issues finding a perfect color for so long because, like you said, cool stuff pulls grey and basically everything else pulls brown. I basically had to start following the rule that, whatever color I saw in the tube or on the applicator, it would show up two shades darker and one step more muted on my lips. I don't have this problem nearly as much with tube lipsticks, but liquids are basically built on hope, for me. 

I know lots of people hate on Lime Crime but the ONLY color I've ever had that works as a true pinky nude on me, doesn't look too dark or muted, is Marshmallow. Putting that stuff on my lips the first time was a celebration. It comes out of the tube looking VERY pale but once it dries down and sets over the course of 20 minutes or so, it looks quite a bit rosier. I have darker natural lips and it covers completely in one thin coat and isn't as drying as many other liquid lipsticks I have owned. 

If you're concerned about information/security leaks because of their website, fret not - Amazon has almost every shade of their liquid lips for $20 with free prime shipping. That's where I get all of mine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A close friend of mine got pregnant at 19, before the whole insurance requirement was a thing. She worked part time but lived with her retired grandmother. She was otherwise perfectly healthy so they skipped insurance and paid out of pocket on the occasion she got sick or hurt, but once she found out she was pregnant, they tried to get her insurance and she was turned down because she was very petite and pregnant. Pre-existing condition and somewhat high risk because of her size. They applied for some financial help and got a little, but she had to pay something like $28k when all was said and done. 

Another friend had "good" insurance but still had to meet a deductible that was something like $6k remaining. And then still had to pay co-pays (and later, specialist copays, which were $80) towards the end of her pregnancy. 

And yes, in some cases with great insurance that you've had for a while, it can cost virtually zero out of pocket. But those are the plans that are not only very expensive but not offered by a majority of employers. When it comes to prenatal visits on insurance, it is sometimes less than a regular doctor visit. But you need far more prenatal visits over the course of nine months than a not pregnant person would need over an entire year, so it's kind of a moot point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is honest, and I like it. I do feel like I give Dan a few too many excuses for weird behaviors because I know them to be normal for him. Doesn't mean they're good behaviors or that I should give him a pass for being a jerk about this. His ex-girlfriend was straight up crazy pants and I knew it but I got along with her when she was around because I know he loved her. The fact that I'm now realizing he hasn't done the same for me is... troubling. 

I have a feeling being more honest with Dan is going to go one of two ways - he'll feel bad and he'll really try to give this another chance, or he'll just continue to make excuses for his shunning Sam. That's on him though. 

Going by myself is not really an option. The rest of the group is all couples, I am not the kind of person to exclude my partner just because one or two people have crappy attitudes sometimes. He doesn't have a lot of friends either, we're not hyper social people to begin with, but I have kept these friends close because they feel like good friends most of the time. I'll have to "test" that a little and see if they're willing to try again. 

And I know the whole thing about getting married and having kids. I am actually kind of excited for that. Both Sam and myself work jobs where meeting friends isn't really possible (I'm a nanny, so the only people I see often are the kids and their parents, and he's the lone member of a specialized software team in a small-ish company dominated by people thirty years older than him. Once we pop out a kid or two, there will be opportunities to meet new people. We've thought about meetup groups or something like that beforehand but I don't think I ever felt it necessary until this point. But yeah, having kids and all that is going to be better for us emotionally than this point in our lives. We know it. Still trying to at least maintain some semblance of a social life while we're child free though. We'll see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seconding the pole with a hook idea - kind of like the hooks in clothes shops for getting down unreachable hangers. I would suggest fishing line or some kind of decorative line (twine, ribbon) tied to each of the items you want to put up in a line, in whatever distance you like relative to the rafter spacing. You want a small weight to make sure the lanterns don't just pull the line off on the ends. You can even put a lantern or whatever on the end with something concealed/taped to the inside somehow, maybe a small wooden block from a craft store. With everything tied to stay in place and a weight at the end, start in the middle and work your way out on each side. You'll have to lift multiple lanterns over each rafter, but starting from the middle would mean less lanterns to lift on each side, and with a big enough hook you can probably lift a few lanterns at a time. Takedown would just be this in reverse. Might take a few minutes per line, but depending on your spacing and how many lines you choose to do, it could go pretty quickly. 

This is a modified version of how we hung stuff from rafters at an event my mom threw a while back. We had little hanging decoration things, lifted them from the middle and spaced them so that there were two or three between each rafter. Takedown was pretty quick and easy since the same person (me) put them up and took them down.  </TEXT>

I basically have gotten to the point where I'm going to have to just keep inviting people and seeing people until they get to know him better. Half of these people I haven't really been friends with for more than a year, and during that year Dan's been weird, so most people haven't gotten a real chance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm gonna skip over the fairly rude tone of this and get to the points - no, Dan is not in love with me. Never has been. Neither of us is anywhere near each other's type, and I've been his wingman on several occasions. 

Dan can have a tendency to come across as shy, but I don't think dull is the right word. He's a workaholic and his work is very technical, so it's not like he has a bunch of funny office stories or weird things that happen with customers because that's not what he does. He watches the same shows as all of these people, has similar interests (perhaps even more that I have with them) the whole bit. They're just fast talkers. 

And again, I doubt it's me because we all talk online fairly often. We were invited to their wedding over dozens of other people, Dan is going to be in my wedding, we all saw a show together a little while ago, went to dinner another time, things I didn't set up but we were invited to. If they didn't want to be my friend, they wouldn't. But they do, they've shown that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah Dan is sort of the common denominator for most of the group. I do wonder if it's just the case of him leaving Sam out. But this behavior is really DRASTICALLY unlike Dan. Dan and I have known each other since we were five years old, we both have depression that we're working on and we're very close. Part of Dan's issue with Sam is that Dan is very likeable and has a ton of friends, and I think he was expecting Sam to be the same way because I'm with him and I'm that way, but Sam isn't that at all. Maybe it's disappointment with feeling like Sam doesn't want to be friends, but I have told Dan twice now that it isn't the case and that he just needs time. We just never get the chance. But Dan is a very nice person 99% of the time so I'm a little perplexed as to the reason why he's so strongly resisting talking to Sam. 

Sam is definitely not the resting bitch face type. He smiles a ton and laughs along, he is right there and paying attention to the conversation, it's just that he doesn't contribute as much because he doesn't want to intrude. 

Both Sam and Dan seem to be stuck in this "this is just how it is" mindset and it's so weird to me because neither of them are normally like that.  </TEXT>

My last one, I told her about a problem I was having with my mom, who is a real piece of work. I told her that I was occasionally taking communication breaks from my mom, a few days at a time where I just didnt open her texts or talk to her or get suckered into doing some ridiculous thing or hearing her yell for an hour. I expressed that it was helping a little, but that l needed to find a better long term solution because I can't just ignore my mom forever.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the well thought out response! I appreciate it and it gave me a few new thoughts. 

Sam used to hang out with a pretty close knit group of people he has known since high school, but that group had a major social fallout/divide right around the time he and I got together, and they sort of split into two groups, each emphasizing a super annoying trait in the whole group - one group couldn't grow up and were slackers and couldn't take anything seriously, and the other group were gossipy and kind of jerks. We have pretty much stopped hanging out with all of them but one because we didn't want that kind of energy. It was good for us, and I thought this group of mine was different. They are! Sam and myself and the group all have very similar interests, and Sam does occasionally pipe in, so I'm kind of confused. 

I do agree that part of it is our fault though. I did ask Sam once in the beginning to try to be a little more social, but it is hard for him. But it's not like he's standoffish at all or that he actually comes off as rude - my family is loud and boisterous and social and they all LOVE Sam, because they know he's quiet and he saves his words for when he wants to actually make points or say something funny. They include him in conversation, ask him how he's been, the whole deal. It's totally different. 

I think the biggest point for me was the mental prep for conversations and the realization on your part that when someone is talking to your partner, it's still a group conversation. I think that's the part he misses, that he can jump in any time and he knows what we're talking about 90% of the time so he COULD if he didn't feel like he would be stepping on toes. 

And I do agree that part of it is my fault, but sometimes I feel like I try and he just doesn't respond. It's hard to like warn him ahead of time that I'm going to bring him into a conversation if I don't know where the conversation is going, and when I try to bring it to him he's just so self-effacing because he KNOWS he's not as social as us and he feels like his conversational skills aren't up to par. It's literally just this friend group that has a problem though - other friends we have love him, they know he's quiet but they talk to him and ask him questions and we have a great time. He's got some old friends who are even more social and talkative than my group. It's frustrating. He thinks of this group so much as MY group of friends that he wants to let me have time, but I don't want that. 

I think I'm going to have to have a good talk with Dan and see if this is what's happening and if this is the cause. I have a feeling it is but I could still be wrong. Either way I do need to have a real talk with Sam about maybe putting in a little extra effort with this group so they can have a better relationship with him, and I can offer to help him as much as he'd like. And you're right, I should just put together a thing whenever I can and let Sam have another shot. I'll have to figure out everyone's schedules and all that but I'll make it work. Thank you!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See I was thinking about that, but Mark and I are fine in person. His girlfriend and I get along well, Mark talks to Sam and I (maybe more than anyone else in the group talks to Sam!) and it would be weird if it were over some crap that happened 5-6 years ago since we're all fine now. 

I typically make plans through Dan, because he is more social than I am and some of this other bigger group I don't really know or have only met once or do. I have attempted to make plans upwards of six times in the last eight months, each time things don't work out or people are genuinely busy or working. I get that, we all have different jobs and days off, and I'm busy planning a wedding too so I don't always push too hard to make plans after I get a lackluster response. 

Dan's girlfriend is also fairly new - maybe a few months - and she does talk when people ask her questions, I remember that, same as Sam. But I think the issue is that more people actually try to include her in conversation because they don't already have a bias against her and she's super nice.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My [26F] fianc [29M] is shy, and I think it's causing people to not invite us to thinks. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been brushing this off for a while but tonight it really came to a head. 

I have been with my fianc Sam for almost six years. He's not necessarily super shy or awkward, he's just a perfect example of a "man of few words". He is a passive participant in conversation in groups. He often is quiet when I'm with any of the few friends I have because he wants to respect my time with these people and wants to let me talk and catch up. If he gets brought into a conversation he will gladly talk about things but he doesn't interject into a conversation he's not already in. In private, we talk TONS and I know him to be a very weird, funny, loving person who values the people in his life. 

I went through some health issues a few years ago, coupled with some crippling depression. It sucked. I'm over it. But it caused me to lose a great number of "friends" around the age of 22 - plus, I just quit the whole party scene and wanted to find friends who actually cared. All told, I have maybe ten people I can consider good friends. I went to a wedding a few months ago for an old acquaintance from high school and reconnected with a few people from high school there too. I should mention we're all fairly talkative on social media, mid-20s, nerdy kids with similar interests. We have done a few things together in various groups over the last few months alone. But more often than not, especially as a large group, they are doing things without me. It hurts! I'm not gonna lie, I know I'm a little weird but these people have always known that. One of them is my oldest friend on this planet, Dan, a guy I consider my brother - literally going to be a bridesmaid in my wedding! And it's around him that I sort of place the most blame. 

Backstory - another friend named Mark and I in the group almost dated a very long time ago. It was a rough break and it was right before I started dating my fianc. Mark never wanted to officially get together and would play it cool even though I knew he had stronger feelings for me than he would admit out loud - the guy basically lived at my house for a while, he was a great guy but it didn't work out. We stopped seeing each other, I got together with Sam and got fairly serious very fast. Mark and I got into a huge fight a few months later over him saying some awful things to me. Mark is kind of a jerk online. I don't put up with his stuff anymore and don't really consider him a friend anymore, but I am always friendly to him in person, we hug, we catch up a bit, he's fine. He's actually dating a girl I've known since elementary school who is pretty cool too. She and I have hung out, we talk online a bit, she is actually the person who most often tries to include Sam and I. She knows there's weird history but she knows we're also sorta friends so she doesn't care. It's all civil, so why dwell on the past? That kind of thing. 

So Dan is my concern here. I wanted Sam to meet Dan fairly early in our relationship because Dan is a big part of my life. This was before Mark started turning into a jerk, so the four of us went out. Mark, Dan and myself all have a very weird rhythm when we hang out. We talk very fast, we make very odd references and jokes, the whole shebang. Remember how I said Sam lets me talk to my friends and hangs back? He did this. He talked sometimes too but even if he wanted to, it's tough to just jump in on that kind of conversation. He laughs when he understands stuff, it's not like he's EVER just sitting there on his phone or not paying attention to things. He's just quiet. 

Dan's a fairly social, open guy though. So from very early on Dan apparently thought that Sam just didn't like him, and he didn't like Sam much because he thought that Sam wasn't making an effort to get to know my friends. I told him he couldn't be farther from the truth, that Sam liked him a great deal and could see why we were so close. Dan was skeptical. I totally understand that part. Nobody who knows me would ever expect me to be with someone so reserved. But Sam is honestly my best friend on this planet and I wish people could see the side of him that I do. 

But now it's been several years. Dan and I hang out solo more often than with Sam because Dan wants that. Fine. But Mark and his girlfriend are not the easiest people to get along with but I am still very friendly and warm in person. It's just how I am. The girlfriend and Dan and I have hung out together. It's not a big deal. The couple whose wedding we all went to? Them too. And Dan has a girlfriend now who I have met and totally liked off the bat. But she is also kind of quiet. Which irks me in a way that it shouldn't, because that's why Dan doesn't like Sam, but that's almost beside the point. 

These three couples, and a few others that I only sort of know, do stuff together all the time. Tonight they posted this group picture of all of them at an event that we all mentioned going to together. I was never told about this at all, obviously. 

I don't understand why. I still talk to a majority of these people often. I don't see any of them as often as I'd like, even before Sam and I got together, because we're all leading very different lives and we get busy. I'm having a small wedding but the friends, minus Mark and his girlfriend because I see them much less and they KNOW that's why, the rest of them are  coming. There has never been any sort of disagreement. I constantly encourage these plans. It's not like they don't want to be my friend, because I still actively talk to them about all kinds of stuff. Pretty much at least once a week I talk to most of these people. 

The only thing I can think of is that it's because of Sam. Because they think he doesn't like them, or because they think he's a jerk because he doesn't talk. I don't know if this might have been perpetuated by Dan, but he is a talkative person so he might have talked to one or two people about it, they share with their significant others, suddenly the whole group just thinks Sam's a jerk because he supposedly doesn't want to talk to them. They're all very social people. I am too. Sam just needs time to warm up to people, but if he's never given that opportunity, it won't happen. Like I have said many times, these people are all very cool with me. Just no invites. 

And it's not an issue of like "oh the whole group went to school together" or anything. Mark, Dan, myself, Mark's girlfriend, and one other guy did. The remaining 6-8 people did not. People who have expressed that they'd like to hang out with me, the ones I haven't seen often, but... still nope. I don't know if it's a conscious "don't invite Kate and Sam" or if it's just that they think we wouldn't want to do the things they do, which is bogus because we've both expressed interest in these things. Or maybe we're just left out because we are busy maybe 25% of the time we ARE asked because we have a wedding to plan and four sets of parents to deal with. Maybe they assume we're busy? But Dan knows we don't do much socially without these people, and he also knows what days I always have free. Dan's girlfriend also expressed interest in another double date at some point,  which I would love, she's super nice and I'd like to get to know her more since I've really only met her once when the two of them met us for dinner. Dan instigated this dinner so it's not like he never makes plans with me, we talk less than most people would say of their close friends but we have always been that way, we talk less day to day but we have always stayed super close and very open and emotional with each other. I know he wanted me to meet his girlfriend and things went well. 

I'm stumped. There have been real, actual arguments between Mark and his girlfriend and Dan, rude things said between them. But they get invited out? The girlfriend is pretty social, yeah, so she probably reaches out to make plans. I have tried several times. Some of the time the dates honestly don't line up, people are busy and some of them work weird days, but several times I've been sitting on my couch when they all post pictures. I'm hurt in a stupid, shallow way and I feel dumb even wondering why they aren't hanging out with meeeee. But that's the way it is. 

On one hand, I think I need to talk to Dan about this. I can be honest about how hurt i feel about them leaving us out, and how it upsets me that, even if it's not WHY we're left out, that he hasn't been willing to give Sam a second chance. It's totally unlike Dan to act this way. I know once he knows I'm hurt he'll talk to me. I don't know how to go about it though. 

On the other hand, I don't know that it will change anything. If people are already against Sam, they just are. I can't just keep pushing to make plans and keep being disappointed that we're not included in the group. It's hurting me. It feels dumb. But some of these people make up a majority of the friends that I'm inviting to our wedding. How can I still want that if they don't even want to hang out with us? I'm torn between continuing to try, then getting hurt, or just giving up entirely. But I don't want to lose these people as friends. We're friends! But I'm not going to commit to going solo to future events if Sam is the problem just because they won't give him a chance. 

Any advice on the matter? Does it seem like my assumption that it's about Sam could be true? Or am I missing something here that I'm just not seeing because I'm too close? 

tl;dr my fianc and I have been together six years, but my friend group all does stuff without us as couples. I think it's because fianc is quiet and my friend group is very talkative and social so they think he's aloof or doesn't like them. Couldn't be farther from the truth. We all talk online so I feel like it's not just an issue with ME since they aren't distancing themselves from me personally, they just almost never extend invites to my fianc and I. Not sure how to proceed.

But not so much anymore.

I want to soften it as much as possible. Agh. I just feel so bad, even though I know I'm doing the right thing for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finally figured my diet out by some mad combination of part time veganism and antidepressants. Most meds make you gain weight (cravings!) but I specifically wanted one that would not because I was just inside the obese range and trying to get healthy. That it came before my wedding was a nice coincidence. 28 pounds down so far, 40ish to go before September. I've been losing 2 a week for the last six or seven weeks but before that it literally took me a year to lose ten pounds, so whatever. And idk if it's because I'm getting older or what but my skin decided to stop acting like I am 14 again and is not full of acne so that's cool. 

Meanwhile, my fianc eats half a pizza and loses weight. And my sister drinks giant sugary Starbucks drinks and pasta and whatever the hell else and goes out drinking a few nights a week and she's tiny. I subside on lentils and my hopes and dreams.  </TEXT>

Mine is sort of similar to yours but in a weirdly overly polite way while also being one of the rudest people I've ever met. It's amazing to watch.

 Yeah my dress ended up being drastically different than what I wanted at first. I wanted a big poofy dress! Then I remembered I'm getting married literally in a forest and that it would be warm. And that sparkles are itchy. And I also want to pee by myself. So. Ended up with BHLDN's Genevieve. The farthest thing from a strapless poofy sparkly dress that I could humanly find. I tried quite a few non-white dresses, and ultimately I looked a little funny (VERY pale, dark hair, curvy... I looked like cotton candy with hair on top) but I loved a pale blue dress I tried.

So I made an appointment for as soon as I could, and instead of focusing on that MOMENT and having my sisters and girls and stuff around me, I just brought my fiance and tried a ton of different stuff on just to make SURE I knew I wanted that one. Tried on like twenty dresses, and yup, I did still want it. Put it on the card, signed the paperwork, and that was it. No major fanfare.

	<TEXT> Sounds more like depression than BPD. I'm not a doctor, but I am in a family with a broad history of mental illness, several of which have BPD in various stages of treatment. Some not being treated at all. Mania is not something you'd gloss over, the manic feelings aren't just changing your mood, it's being so wired and high energy and on edge that you can't sleep, can't focus, aren't thinking rationally. It can manifest in a few different ways - anger, excessive need to show happiness, sexual dysfunction, all kinds of stuff. 

A lot of what you have described sounds like what I have dealt with in the past. I am in treatment now for depression, as well as some poorly controlled anxiety issues and some raging PTSD from a shitty childhood. I didn't recognize PTSD for what it was until my therapist suggested it. Sounds like you've been through some shit too, and it can change how you see the world and how you interact with it. Detachment is something I deal with all the time, I do and think and say things that don't match up with what I know I should do or want to do. Many people see me as "happy" even though I have been fairly open about my mental health issues. I, too, felt the void. I was the void, the void was me. I saw no way out. Until I realized that I needed to find a way out before I ended things. 

I feel very cynical most days, but I have found that it's less about cynicism and more about an analytical approach to how i see the world. I am constantly remembering or in fear of something that has happened or could happen again. I can't feel "normal" because I don't behave normally. Most people are not this distrusting. I also feel the need to flaunt my successes, and that's more common than you'd think. Especially for people who have been through childhood trauma, the desire to be better than that and to get past that is SO strong. I have about four people that are currently keeping me from just packing up and leaving my current state. I don't hesitate to brag about the newest positive developments in my life. I have distanced myself from everyone associated with the more negative parts of my life. I want to be someone else, but I can't be, so I at least want to be as far removed from the OLD me as possible. 

From where you're standing, it's also very very normal to be hesitant about therapy or to feel the need to lie to your therapist to make things seem better or worse than they are. You can't manipulate a therapist. It's very very hard to make them think things about you that aren't true. I thought I was calm and cool and mine read me like a book at our second appointment. I'm glad she did, because I'm making progress, but even after that appointment it took me several sessions before I had an appointment without at least one major lie. 

Anti-depressants have totally helped me, though. I thought I could never be fixed, but I also knew I couldn't continue to be that miserable and empty feeling about my life, so I figured I'd give it a shot. Took the happy pills. It's actually been a good few months. It CAN get better. Your school probably has at least one good resource, and if not there are usually youth resources in any decent size city. Not always, but usually. Might take some digging. And once you're in college, there are tons of student resources to help you out. It is a pain in the ass to drag yourself out of the void, but it's better than being miserable forever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would depend on whether or not your therapist thought you were in danger of actually harming yourself. That's when intervention happens. For example, I've been fairly open with mine about suicidal ideations and the way I have been feeling when I'm at my lowest, but I know it's just that - ideation. I don't have plans to kill myself, I am actively working on my mental health, and that's enough for her. But depending on your situation - diagnosis, age, living arrangements, social history - a therapist can see it as more or less of a red flag based on what they know about you. Most of them have heard "I want to die" or some variation of that SO many times, thousands of times, that they know when they need to escalate and get you more help than they can provide.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be direct. And it may take some time, some men are MUCH different than others. My fianc is emotionally stunted (or rather, was, he had a weird family dynamic growing up so he never really got a good feel for personal relationships) and the first time I told him I wanted more romance he was so confused. Didn't we just go on a date last weekend? Yeeeees but I planned and executed the whole thing, and the ten dates before that too. We worked on it for a long time, and I had to keep reminding him because honestly, some dudes will then put in a huge burst of effort and they'll see that it makes you feel good, and then they'll stop trying so hard because they think the problem is fixed. But FH now knows what to do. He doesn't always do it, he's a software engineer on top of being a weirdo, so sometimes he forgets that making me plan everything does not mean that I'm feeling appreciated. But he tries. Some men will, some won't. If he doesn't even try, or even want to really talk about it, move on. Pretty silly to stay in a lackluster relationship.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same! I used to be a product hoarder and tried everything I could afford to get my hands on. Then I got lazy and stopped washing my face as often as I should (like 3 times a week now?) and my skin got better... so I dropped my other products too, and I've never had clearer skin. Now I just wash and use either a moisturizer in the morning or the admittedly bougie Drunk Elephant Framboos Serum at night. Never had better skin. What. So counterintuitive but it's like my skin is saying "thank you for dropping the Clean and Clear scrubs and harsh BP creams, now I'll calm down"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I will never understand the parents that force their way into hospitals when their kid is having a baby. The kind of grandparents who feel they're entitled to everything. 

My dad is a prime example. My sister had her baby, open adoption so the mom was there with her. Baby's mom says our family is welcome to visit often (they go on vacations with my mom's side of the family and stuff like that!) but that home visits needed to be only one or two people at a time. Totally understood. Nope. My dad insists that his wife comes with him - the wife that sobbed and begged my sister not to put the baby up for adoption and made her feel extremely guilty for a very personal decision. My dad won't go unless his new wife can go. My sister explains that this is not her rule, it's the mom's, and they need to be respectful or they won't be able to have a relationship with him. 

Guess who hasn't met his grandson? Yep. And the kid is turning 4 soon. Four YEARS my dad has let his ego trump basic decency. Sigh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I almost never do it. I think I've stayed home two total days in the last nine months. I always feel kind of bad but my MB is a doctor/currently a medical director for an organization, so she gets health stuff. I nanny for 3 though and the littlest just started preschool, so if I took days off every time I was sick, I would never work, lol. I've been sniffly since October. 

And actually, the two days I took off, SHE told me to take off. We're Facebook friends and I mentioned having an awful head cold and she called me like "you know you can stay home if you're that sick, right?" And basically made me stay home. And the other time I legit had the flu and had been toughing it out for a week already but I was miserable. She texted asking how I was doing and I was honest. I felt like I'd been hit by a truck. She was like "rest up, don't worry about it, see you Wednesday!"

I still feel guilty lol  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Give your sister a super ultra high five for me. My own dad was pretty okay growing up, had a LOT of issues that really came to the surface when he and my mom split when I was 18.  He's a loser. He's always been a loser. I was just too little to understand. 

He moved off and started a nice little life with his new wife and her two daughters - all very similar to my mom and my sister and I. Hmmmm. But to them he's Super Dad because their old "dad" was a total piece of shit. Newsflash, folks, he seems great now but wait until he starts abusing pain medication again and has explosive anger issues and starts hitting people. From what I can tell, he's juuuuust starting that process again now that he's on "disability" for his "shoulder problems". Ugh. He has also lied about my sister and I hating him to his extended family - which we never get to see, because he never invites us. I only know this because I ran into my great aunt in the grocery store before my dad's wedding and she made a comment about how she hoped we'd be at his wedding. We were literally in the wedding. All four daughters were "bridesmaids". But he hadn't told them that part, couldn't fix that part, because everyone else thought we were just some bitches that hated him. 

My stepmom is kind of an ass too, but she's not all that smart, and the girls are brainwashed by the both of them. I see my dad maybe twice a year, if that. I always initiate meetings. He doesn't ever try to contact me. He said some fucked up shit to my sister a few months ago but she said she's over it. 

He's soooo lucky he's invited to my wedding as a guest. That my sister allowed that to happen, because honestly it  was up to her. 

I think of him as an old friend that I don't really talk to anymore because we've drifted apart, but that I might barely regret not inviting. 

Females standing up to family that is supposed to support them... kicking ass despite the cards they were dealt... that's the real shit.  </TEXT>

But unless she's a serious body builder/competition level athlete, there's no way she's hanging onto that much muscle.

She realized he had caught on to her shit from very early on.

	<TEXT> Fellow C-PTSD person (I'm actually only recently diagnosed and it makes sooooo much sense), fellow Wellbutrin taker. Also depression and ADD and what we used to call a panic disorder but is def related to the PTSD problems caused by mother dearest. 

This is a gooood place to be, this sub. I've been on Wellbutrin for several months now and it has totally changed my life. It's insane. It doesn't work for everyone, but after an initial period of side effects, it has been like night and day. My relationship with my mother has been difficult since... probably my conception, honestly, and maybe before that too. She's a real character, my mom. 

I'm 26, it took me a long time to admit that what happened to me was abuse, even though I knew intrinsically that parents should not beat or psychologically punish their children. It actually took me until about last year, so you have a jump start on me! 

Letting it all out like this is cathartic in all the best ways. The internet is great for this. I love tattling on my mom because she always loved to air my dirty laundry in front of EVERYONE she came in contact with. 

Joke's on her, she's fucking crazy and everyone knows it and she has systematically ruined a majority of her relationships with people and everyone knows exactly why I stay as far away from her as I possibly can. 

Also my life is great now that I am not bogged down by depression and I'm learning to manage a few of my C-PTSD problems. I mean, I am still not skipping through fields but I can wake up and shower in the morning! I can hold a job! I don't want to die! I have three reliable, awesome, non-family relationships, including my fianc! Previously my behaviors were... not conducive to monogamous relationships. But intense focus and work has changed me for the better. 

If you ever want to vent/mindlessly bitch about mother problems together... I'll bring the popcorn.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started taking 150mg of a generic I got from Kaiser. I barely had any side effects and I felt great, so we upped my dose a little and I felt even better! 

I have been taking the 300mg for probably two months now. I unfortunately am going to have a gap in my kaiser insurance, so I had to transfer my prescription out to a different pharmacy. Which meant a different generic. 

I feel TERRIBLE. I have depressed thoughts throughout the day, constant high anxiety and near daily panic attacks, I'm nauseous and vomiting, I'm constipated, my stomach feels like it's being torn from my body, I have a constant headache, my body aches so much, I am shaky and just totally out of it.  

I have read online that different generics can cause this problem. I just don't know how to fix this. Do I just call around and get a refill with whatever pharmacy has the old generic? I can't keep this up. I feel almost like I did at my very worst, mentally. I had it so good. I want that back. Or I at least don't want to feel like my body is being ripped to shreds.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My HG is Toni and Guy Wave Memoriser. Naturally, it was discontinued in the US, but there are various overseas shops that still sell it. I use about a penny sized circle for that one and scrunch into soaking wet hair. It's the texture that's great - thicker/smoother than gel, nothing that dries my curls. Gels always make me... frazzled. Not sure how to describe it. 

I have also used Miss Jessie's Pillow Soft Curls to some success. Kind of depended on the weather, for me, but my hair is super finicky. Anything that is a semi-thick, squeezable "styling cream" might work. Right now, because it's drier, I'm using MoroccanOil curl defining cream - maybe a dime to nickel sized amount. 

The same procedure applies - I find my hair responds best to products when my hair is still really wet. My shampoo and conditioner routine is all over the place (another discontinued product, UGH) but I always spray It's a 10, separate the bigger sections, scrunch in a bit of styling cream, and then I take a microfiber type towel and scrunch the water out, and it also removes excess product for me since my hair is thin and doesn't need too much! I put extra so I am sure it's even, but probably at least 1/3 of it comes off when I scrunch dry. 

Hope that helps!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, everyone else has already given you the justnomil suggestion, but I'm going to add this: I'm not sure how your finances are arranged, but if there's any separation in spending money, tell fianc that if he doesn't want to enforce the house rules and can't say no to mommy, he gets to pay for the carpets to get cleaned next time. Or even better, he can clean them himself. 

My FMIL is kind of loony and has a lot of "rules" like this too. "You can't ask people to do ____!" She talks about things being rude but is literally rude to almost everyone she encounters. FH used to be a momma's boy, and I put up with that for a few years, but then I stomped that shit out pretty fast. Drastically cut down how often we saw her. She didn't come over. It can take a while, but these guys need to realize that mommy isn't the most important woman in their lives anymore.

	<TEXT> Obviously the experiment quote was a bad move on his part, but it's not uncommon for people to feel this way. Analytical people and people who have been burned before (or just some people in general) tend to search for very specific things in a partner. After some time, they may realize that these qualities are too restricting/not as desirable as they initially thought. They "experiment" by going outside of their "type" and they either decide "I like this" or they don't. 

My relationship was like this. In the beginning, I was kind of attracted to my guy, mostly I liked that he's really tall, but it was too easy for me to say that he wasn't the hottest guy I'd been with. But I continued to date him because he wasn't my "type" - he's quiet and reserved but a little goofy, where my type was very social and confident - and I wanted to know if the maturity vs "type" thing would work out. Ends up my type was not made up of people I wanted to be in long term relationships with. Over time he became more attractive to me because I started to appreciate him more and more. Does he know this? Yes. Did I tell him I wasn't attracted to him and he was an experiment? Hell no. That's a little insensitive. That's like saying "you should feel so appreciative that I kept you around! Everything worked out!" Which is crap. 

Are you still an experiment? Highly doubtful. If he's admitted to crappy thoughts but wants to marry you, he wants to marry you. But you have to let him know that this really upset you, that you are deeply hurt by it, and that he needs to make it up by not doing shit like that ever again, and by showing you that he loves you, and really does want to be with you.  </TEXT>
