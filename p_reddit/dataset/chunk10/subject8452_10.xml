I shop at both.

I pretty much know what I need.

I also go up every aisle.

I know where both have their marked down specials.

They take it in turns to discount a product, If Woolies brand x is not on special, look at Coles.

I have a Freezer, I buy a lot of meat at 60% off and freeze, use as required/ Also Brie /Camembert for 10%. It's at use by date, fuck me it's perfectly ripe and due to the high fat content freezes well.

If I see a stupidly ridiculous price on something I know we will use I buy all I can, .e.g. 12 large packs of washing powder that were less than half normal price. Still have 4, a little lumpy but I saved $100+. 

Don't get me wrong, it's probably a good app for the casual shopper.

I buy my Potatos/Onions/ Dragonfruit/Garlic from my local Norco Produce store for less than half the price the supermarkets charge.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had golf balls in ceramic eggs she still ate hers, seperated her from the other one. I might get a couple of bantams next week.

Guava needed white oil, fruit fly magnet, Loquats are too, NSW you can't have them in a Citrus growing area. My 1 dragonfruit got blown off a few months ago but I got some from my Produce place $2.00 each and planted the skin with some seeds on it and look to have over 100 coming up, 

Mate had a farm at Bucca just inland from me and grew Lemon Myrtle commercially, a little Anniseed Myrtle and another type?  sadly he did not do enough work himself. He needed to build his own still to process the oil, used to get a guy with a traveling still to come in. We took some flowers up to the Brisbane market once, that was a dead loss. The pure full strength oil cures Tinea, (you walk gingerly for a few days) ;) 

When Spring onions are on special, grab a few bunches and plant them in a large pot, cut as required, they keep growing from the cut stems, you can do the same with leeks.
Mum gave me some Egypyian walking or tree Onions at Xmas, but it got too hot up here and I lost most of them , have about 5 left, the actual onions grow at the top, not in the ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A guy was standing on the shore at Bondi Beach and saw a young boy swimming unaware of a approaching dorsal fin. 

He swam out and after a fierce struggle, dispatched the shark.

A nearby reporter who witnessed the incident ran down to the shore and said I can see tomorrows headlines "Aussie Hero Saves lad From Vicious Shark Attack".

"But I'm not an Aussie" replied the hero, "I'm from London".

The headlines next day read.

"Pommie Bastard Kills Boys Pet Fish". </TEXT>
