	<TEXT> A female friend was crying over her body once and told me she wish she had a perfect body like mine... I felt so bad for her but wow that was like so nice of her to say!

Also the boy I like was holding my hand and arm and goes "holy crap your arms are so delicate. You're so thin" and I just smiled and was like OMGG SWOON  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for asking love! I ended up forcing myself to do some positive things. I made myself take a walk and enjoy the weather and didn't wear any makeup while I did it! So it felt like a successful day in my book. Really turned around from impulsively wanting to down a bottle of wine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ive had a similar experience. It turned from "ok ill just use IF to manage my tendency to overeat/binge" to "oh god i cannot consume anything before 6 pm even if im absolutely starving" and then i end rewarding myself with a large "dinner" and end up overeating anyways. I think seeking professional help from a nutritionist or ED specialist would be best in OP's case! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i feel i can really relate to you. Im not necessarily underweight and have EDNOS, and have been non stop binging and restricting days for the past few months. More often than not i binge. i feel so stupid because im experiencing horrible physical and emotional symptoms of en ED while staying at what is technically the cusp of a healthy body weight. also i carry my weight in such a where where i dont look very thin. 

sorry this turned into a rant but i just wanted to tell you i understand.  a part of me wishes my stuggles with eating would physically show more so it could validate just how much i struggle with eating on a daily basis. i feel like im suffering in silence because im too "fat" to be considered any sort of anorexic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend is basically very inconsistent. He sometimes will be understanding and kind of sympathetic but honestly most of the time he's annoyed/frustrated with my eating behaviors. He seems to believe it's all about vanity when I've communicated to him many times that it's far more than simply wanting to have a flat stomach. 

The inconsistency really messes with me though because I never know if I can open up to him and get a kind and gentle person who can help soothe my distress or if he will get angry with me and say "it's not that hard. All you have to do is eat." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I wish I was more active on this sub like I used to be, there are so many new faces!

Anyways, I've been in a horrible binge/restrict cycle for MONTHs now and it's been causing me to maintain my weight. Today was finally different though. I felt much more in control and had under 500 cals. I haven't even felt tempted to binge at all! What helped was that I was still able to eat three hot dogs for dinner that were only 45 cals a pop! I basically fasted till 930 and ate a nice big dinner. 

Anyone else been having trouble with binging?
