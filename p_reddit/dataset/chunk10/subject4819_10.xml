	<TITLE> What's the line between a movie having a gimmicky feature like out of order scenes and one that is clever adding rewatch value? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 05:15:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For example, what determines how a movie uses the way it's being watched by the audience to cleverly present a story or show it in an interesting way? We have the movie pulp fiction which has different sequences presented out of order. It's a great movie that really had a significant impact on its genre of cinema as a whole.

Another amazing movie is Memento, which similarly uses out of order scenes and distinguishing between scenes using black and white. Both are amazing, critically acclaimed movies. 

Then there are other movies like say... the difficult to watch Irreversible that is basically the movie being told backwards. Or movies that use black and white to seem artsy without understanding if it works stylistically for them like Ed Wood, which actually pulls it off. However I didn't feel like there was a point to Frances Ha being b+w, seeing the scenes they shot in color actually add a whole lot to the movie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do people have a problem with the goody 2 shoes character? I've always liked that character, and feel like I can rely on them. But when I see the idiot character, the one that audiences love, I dislike them and want to stay as far away from them as possible, even if the hijinx done are all in the name of comedy. 

My favorite character has always been Lisa because she's smart, or Leela because she's dependable, and as a kid those were the characters I gravitated towards. 

Just legitimately curious over the psychology behind liking a certain character more than another.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I still don't understand why they left. I know there was talk about a spinoff that focused on Bobby and Hunter on the run, but I'm surprised that was serious talk considering it doesn't sound profitable to make a new series about these 2 in a show that is already teetering on the edge of cancellation. 

Now that their pilot didn't take off, does that mean they'll come back, or does the studio not want them back? Is there only room for one veteran badass female agent a la May? I really liked Bobby and thought she was going to be a mainstay, especially if Mockingbird is this important character in the comics of agents of shield.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Maybe it will help boost sales, maybe we'll get a special edition green Vita, it's just a shame to see the handheld die. It's such a nifty piece of hardware but there's just no games on it. It was nice enough for Falcom to release Ys 8 on both it and ps4, but really it doesn't compare to actually having games on it from different developers and different genres.

Because MGS Peace Walker on PSP did a lot for the handheld. Hell I don't even like MGS and I bought my first PSP because of that bundle.

So I think an original MGS would do wonders for Vita, even if like PW it will just get ported to ps4 later down the line.

Hell I just realized the real problem; not even square enix is giving vita the time of day. While the 3ds got a kingdom hearts, the vita which has analog sticks now didn't get one at all, and a kh 2.94323 and three quarters would have really helped the system.

Plus it would be interesting to see a game really take advantage of whatever the hardware has to offer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "art" of binging means that people can now watch almost an entire half season's worth of episodes in one day. Whether or not that's better than pacing yourself and watching one episode or 2 a day, who's to say. 

But netflix and binging type streaming services has already marked the death of "clipshow" episodes that are now no longer necessary when you can watch an entire series at once, and no longer miss an episode on tv. 

How about soap operas, which are usually a daily thing that older people watch at a certain time as part of their daily routine, will that be affected by binging? 

What do you think binging episodes will mean for the future of tv shows? </TEXT>

Just wondering if wire-fu is part of the character of the iron fist, since I don't know what his comic self is like, if it's all about chinese homages like how luke cage is about blaxploitation homages.  </TEXT>

Still, it's just... Daredevil 2 showed it's hard to take people in black red garb with knives and swords seriously in the 21st century where people have guns and automatic weapons. It's just more goofy than anything else, and reminds me of that one It's Always Sunny episode with Mac trying to come at Charlie with a sword when Charlie is holding a gun just shooting at him. 

At least with magic it makes sense that only magic can beat other magic, but all the martial arts in the world isn't gonna make you faster than  bullets spraying in all directions from a machine gun or whatever.  </TEXT>

Not the greatest of signs. I'd attribute stuff like that to why Iron is supposedly liked the least out of the Marvel shows, but here's hoping. Fist is the character I know the least about in comics, like not even a little bit of passing knowledge like Luke Cage. So still holding off on judging the overall show until the end.

	<TEXT> Was it an orthodox title for a show? Maybe. Does it have a very specific kind of humor? Perhaps. But nearly every scene of every episode had moments that made me burst out laughing. 

I was going to post a link to a scene to showcase what the grinder is like but one scene doesn't really do it justice. It's one of those shows that you'll know if you'll like it immediately from the very first episode. 

It's quirky, meta at times, self-referential and just feels really original. Shame it couldn't have been Fox's 3rd great comedy show along with B99 .

Just... I can't stop being ticked that it was canceled and suffered in the ratings apparently. At least we the first season was a full 22 episodes so we'll always have those... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately it's very true. Sure nowadays there is an actual "no cigarettes will be sold to under 21" law (not unlike alcohol in the western world) but the fact of the matter is not many stores care to enact this law and even then, smoking still occurs regardless of purchasing a cig, they'll get it any other way. 

It's... frustrating to say the least, living in a society that's all about control but when it matters regarding health a la smoking, is completely ambivalent.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-04-22 14:24:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Such a Great show. Very intense. It gives me so many questions and makes me hunger for more episodes. 

I wonder why at the same time that Dolores is able to kill and achieve consciousness, Maeve decides to go back instead of leaving Westworld? 

Also that scene reminded me of Ex Machina a little, and like that movie I wonder how these androids even work. What sustains them. If they go out in the world how will they survive, what exactly is their power source. Is the blood for show, clearly not if putting blood from Lawrence into Teddy made Teddy more alive somehow (I guess they all have the same blood type or something). Do they have any form of biology like eating and stuff? I dunno. How exactly do you want to have sex with something that... I mean synthetic flesh isn't really enough, what about I dunno taste and smell and all these other qualities that make up real people.

How can Ford just get away with killing Theresa? And Elsie's disappearance after vacation time is up? What happened to the head of security guy who was with Elsie and seemed to suspect Bernard? I don't think they've shown him since. 

So did Logan just die in Westworld, is that what was implied? William made him dehydrate and/or starve on the outskirts of the park?

At the end the credits rolled but then we got a mid credits scene with the blond snake lady. Why didn't the security guards shoot the hell out of the blonde snake lady, why the hell are they just standing there saying "get on the ground" instead of shooting her with the bullets and guns they have? I can't even... I don't even... What? Why are they just standing there instead of blasting her with bullets?

Such a great show, I'm glad I watched it, and I hope there's more to come.

	<TEXT> In the season 1 episode 11 "Up All Night" Mitch forces Cam to "ferberize" the baby Lily by making her cry herself to sleep, something that to us seems downright barbaric and I can't even. 

On the flip side, in the season 2 episode "someone  to watch over Lily" they freak out over Lily having gotten her ears pierced, something that is considered a rite of passage for all baby girls here, something about it being better to have the ears pierced when they're young.  

I just find it funny how people from different cultures interpret what is right and wrong compared to what the characters find right and wrong. Leaving a baby to cry themselves to sleep is a big no-no, yet Mitchell talks about it like a completely normal thing. Just always find that weirder and weirder on rewatches.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FF 12 being released on the ps4 is getting me really excited since I'd like to try the job system that was in the japanese and PAL versions of the game. 

But I wonder if they're going to have the option to switch the camera x axis this time around because in the original FF 12 the camera was permanently on reverse, so if you moved the analog stick right it would go left, and vice versa. Was rather annoying that they couldn't be bothered to let players have the option to switch to the kind of camera they prefer. 

It's not a big deal but really it's the little things that make up life and the same can be said for enjoyment of games. </TEXT>

But at some point it just feels like you're insecure we won't like your show if there isn't a little titillation with a guy having sex with 3 girls between scenes. </TEXT>

They pulled out all the stops though with the show ending with Eliza kissing Goliath on the lips. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm dreading the thumbs down arrows this post will get but I also was rather ambivalent about the movie. I can appreciate the concept of obsession and I like that revenge twist JK does to the kid, but the entire movie just sounds like a loud cacaphony of sounds that is aggravating to my ear. As someone who doesn't really care for music I really have less of a stake and appreciation for the guy bleeding his hands out to make loud noises. Aka music really is subjective. 

But I still like the idea behind what they were going for, one guy pushing because he wants the absolute best out of someone and another always coming back for more. It's just priorities wise I can't seem to care for something as insignificant to me as music. I'm so strongly reminded of the Brooklyn 99 episode where they bring philharmonic musical instrument players and show how they're all starving and scrapping for food due to dying interest in the arts by the public. Couldn't help thinking of that episode every time someone in the movie was taking music too seriously.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Similarities between Spirited Away and Coraline? *Spoilers* </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-09 06:58:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This may be an obvious observation or maybe I'm over thinking it but after watching the movie Coraline  I couldn't help but notice quite a few similarities to Spirited Away in the main characters.
Again, bear with me as these may be blatant/obvious but here's a couple things that stood out to me in both films:
Both start out with young pre-teen girls moving or having just moved to a new location
Said girls are loathe to move because they are leaving behind friends
Both have parents that are either un-attentive or outright dismissive
Both go through a tunnel that leads to a different world of sorts
Both meet a boy that either helps or guides them in their journey at different points
Both have to rescue their parents from a malevolent mother type figure through a test or game
I thought there were some interesting contrast as well: Coraline is initially sold on this other world pretty quickly but increasingly comes to find it a terrible place while Chihiro is scared of being there and increasingly comes to find it comforting.
I'm sure there are probably more things that I missed but those seemed like the more obvious ones. Given how revered Spirited Away is, I wonder if there was an influence between these or it it's purely coincidental. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She didn't seem unhappy at all during her time there. She had a job, was enjoying her relationship with Jim Farrel, hanging out with her friend... I mean I personally would be someone who would go to America rather than stay in the place where they grew up, but that is my own bias. It didn't seem like she yearned for America because she kept hiding/putting away her husband's letters from america and feeling guilty about it, and didn't know what to write back to him if she did read the letters. 

I can understand the security and feeling of comfort in marrying a well off man like Jim in a town she grew up in... I dunno, just it seemed like the old lady snooping was the only trigger that made her leave. Nothing beforehand had made her unhappy, which made me wonder whether it was just being reminded she was in a gossipy town that made her leave. 

I was hoping they'd show how how being do different now, especially with how glamorous her clothing and 1950s sunglasses were, causing states by the drab dressed villagers everywhere she walked by  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely love saoirse ronan and if you haven't seen the movie I implore you to watch it. 

The acting is superb, and the dialogue very endearing, being from the same guy who screenplayed 2009's an education (also a good movie to watch)

The colors and sets of 1950s america and beautiful and wonderfully contrasted with the more homely simple look of this Irish town. 

One thing I'm bothered by is that I wish the movie hadn't made the decision for saoirse's character to leave Ireland and go back to America because that spiteful old lady found out she was married and was seemingly intending to blackmail her and/or just be a huge nosy nelly gossip. 

If that WASN'T in the movie... what would she have done? Would she have chosen to stay in Ireland and marry Jim or go back to America to thw nice Italian boy she'd already married? It's not an easy decision. And it feels like she didn't make a choice, but rather just had her hand tied and fate decided. 

I dunno.  It's a story that really hit close to home, which is partly why I love it so much. Just really fantastic all around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember back in the beginning of Modern Family reading up on how Luke's actor in real life is actually some super genius with a high school and/or college degree when he was just 13 or something. I assumed eventually that he'd do something else. It's kinda clear that they really don't know what to do with him and his story lines once he'd grown up into a full-fledged man and is no longer the cute little kid doing antics with his young-at-heart father (and yes they also did an episode on that)

It actually seems like they don't know what to do with most of the young unmarried males in the family. 

As for Alex, I always assumed that they'd have to feature her less eventually since she's the super genius in the show and would go to a college with intensive classes and she'd be studying very hard to earn her degree in a STEM field. I personally don't know what more they can do with her. I agree with another user who stated how annoyed he was that they just had her yelling and irritable in every episode she's been in recently. It's kinda hard not to notice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Season 2 Someone to watch over Lily. I assumed it was because they wanted to be there when Lily's ears first got pierced or something, but throughout the episode they never once explained it. Feels like one of those values dissonance things where people from other cultures like myself don't understand why Mitch and Cam got so upset at Lily's ears being pierced (that's how it's usually done here, where mothers/aunts/etc pierce the baby daughter's ears at a young age with those tiny earrings Gloria had on Lily) 


Btw rewatching this show and I love Phil, while I love him the whole Phil crush on Gloria in the beginning has not aged well at all... I mean when you're married to someone like Julie Bowen, it just does not make sense. At least not to me. Otherwise great show to rewatch, laughing so hard at some of the classic jokes and others I'd forgotten.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow so many posts! I was going to type up my entire thoughts on the show since I started rewatching it at the beginning of the month. 

Watching the 5 episode pilot was so bittersweet with the amount of nostalgia and childhood memories. I owned SO many gargoyles action figures and toys. I remember being shocked when I first came on the internet and found out that it wasn't as massively popular and well known as it should have been, considering it's such a great series. Hearing Goliath's voice still gives me goosebumps every time. 

I started watching out of nostalgic reasons but now I legitimately think this show is great and fantastic with complex characters and story lines. 

I feel so bad for Macbeth for all that he's been through. I want to hate Demona, but then I'll be just like her, filled with nothing but hate, and continuing the endless cycle of vengeance and suffering. So I just pity her. Pity her for never being able to love again. The 4 parter city of stone that shows Demona's backstory and how she and Macbeth came to know each other is great, and I love how that theme of vengeance begetting vengeance is ever present.

I did feel slightly betrayed when the weird sisters turned out to be not really that altruistic and were just manipulating Macbeth and Demona for *centuries*, all culminating in them getting the 3 sources of power for the arch-mage villain (eye of Odin, book of grimorum, and the Phoenix gate) 

This led to the avalon storyline, a great one, which in turned led to Angela, one of my favorite newly introduced gargoyles (I love how sweet she is, indicating that a home of love and nurture is key to how good a person can be, contrasting with Demona) 

THAT led in turn to the 20 episode arc that could have been a season all its own in which Goliath, Elisa, Bronx, and Angela travel on a boat to many different locales, solving problems throughout each area, coming toe to toe with the pack, xanatos , and assorted other villain, but also other gargoyles! That was fun to see. 

I was also excited to finally see Oberon and titania, as well as Oberon's children, and the plot line with xanatos and fox's baby. 

Oh, I could talk about Gargoyles endlessly, I love the show so much.  </TEXT>

I remember when I saw that episode as a kid I was absolutely floored, it just completely threw my worldview in disarray. Rewatching the show 20 years later, I've noticed very subtle foreshadowing and nods to this revelation as proof that it was always planned, which I for one found pretty damn awesome on rewatch.

If there's anyone still here I'd love to discuss *all* the episodes and characters, particularly the tragic ones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm surprised it's not more popular, showing a completely awkward guy not knowing what he's doing cumming several times within the video inside the girl while she leads him by the hand and takes charge, grinding on top of him, moaning how good it must feel for him with her on top, stuff like that. 

The awkward guy wanting to please and the girl fully taking charge in all sex positions is key to this kinda fantasy and videos.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ... you know they released vesperia on 360 right, a console that the Japanese hated and sold poorly. And it was entirely motivated by greed, Microsoft paying them to release it on said system and they'd pay for the localization and development. 

For the record I would have preferred if they'd just localized the already existing ps3  version. Since the game is just right there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tons of the American ones have done japanese porn. Riley reid, lexi belle, chloe foster... the worst part is they don't even end in creampie. So basically it has none of the good things japanese porn has but neither is it like American porn. Sort of a "worst of both worlds" kinda thing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much, you hit the nail on the head. It's even worse with the high pitched squeaky  little girl voice and the really deep guy voice that sounds like he's purposely trying to create a baritone in his voice instead of speaking normally.  

And I don't want that in games. I'm quite fine with the cheesy bad English voice acting for companies who can't afford any better, since I know they can't be final Fantasy 12 levels of voice acting. And I'm ok with that. Just leave it in English. Since ideally the battle system is fun enough to not mind endearingly cheesy lines, for example star ocean 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't even consider them in the same category as the jrpgs I used to play. 

I used to like the tales games and so thought to check out the one they released on vita but they didn't even bother to localize it properly with voice acting, the entire thing is in Japanese voice actors, which are over the top in a bad way and pretty awful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean there's a HUGE difference between fun jrpgs like chrono trigger/final Fantasy 6, and the steaming pile of dung jrpgs with little anime girl looking things that seem to release on the vita. 

I like the former, I don't even acknowledge the latter. So far the only 2 rpgs I want are persona 4 golden, and Ys 4. If there were more games like these 2, either being action rpgs or just a fun funny game, I'd be interested.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So true. It's like, hardware wise it really does seem to fix all the problems of the psp like for example having a non garbage UMD format to play games on. But it was just too little too late, the industry has changed too much with the advent of smartphones and $1 app games for there to be another handheld to be compete with that and Nintendo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yeah I forgot about extra credits. I remember the very first time checking out Daniel Floyd's videos back in 2008 or 2009. Then they moved to the escapist, then they moved to penny arcade... I kinda lost track and interest in both video games and them by that point. Still always enjoy what they stand for: a better video game industry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn shame, it was everything the psp should have been back in 2005, just simply having 2 analog sticks is a huge game changer...

But it seems there are no games developing for it, no big AAA games from publishers, hell even square enix seems to have given it a pass and not even given it its own kingdom hearts like with psp, which would actually work better this time around since the handheld has actual analog sticks to move the characters around and stuff.

The handheld is still priced at $200, which is only $50 less than a ps4... that probably doesn't sound too enticing to new buyers. </TEXT>
