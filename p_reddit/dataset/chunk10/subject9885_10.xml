	<TEXT> No idea, I'm assuming she got the vaccinations herself but just didn't want to vaccinate us kids? There wasn't any reasonable logic in her reasoning around the issue so I'm sure a huge inconsistency like that wouldn't be a problem </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep unfortunately doesn't always hold out - my mum is a nurse and didn't vaccinate me or my siblings as kids! Wasn't until I went to the docs at 18 before going abroad on my own that I finally got all my vaccinations  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 25 and me and my boyfriend just switched to a  diet together 6 months ago. I've never been a huge meat eater, my mum is veggie so I grew up around a lot of vegetarian cooking and while I was studying and on a limited income I hardly ate any meat either. I think I just finally came to the realisation that I can have a perfectly healthy and balanced diet without meat - and eating it started to seem more and more immoral. Doing it with my bf on board too had been really helpful - especially when eating out and stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! It's just a glac, icing sugar and water, but made up quite thick - I think it might've been easier with royal icing but I was making them vegan for my sister </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It must be very inconvenient for preening etc, but it also means they're really well adapted to collect nectar from certain flowers that other humming birds with shorter beaks can't reach - so it's a trade off I guess? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plenty of beans and pulses, I always have kidney beans, butter beans, black beans, chickpeas and red and green lentils on hand to bulk out dishes like chili or soups, make quick salads with or for dips or veggie burgers - really versatile and super cheap, especially if you plan ahead a bit and buy them dry for soaking  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [here's](http://imgur.com/PpZVvwU) an idea I've used before - it's a modular ball using sonobe units which you can fill with sweets/whatever you want. I've done smaller ones as Christmas tree decorations too which are cute  </TEXT>
