	<TEXT> I've recently taken up nature photography as a hobby and I've been posting the photos to relevant Reddit subs and my Instagram feed (it's @fillsyourniche if you're interested).  There's also some lab dissection in there so fair warning if that's not your thing, but it's pretty far back in the feed.

Anyway! I end up posting a little blurb about each organism and through this, I am having a great time getting to know my local flora and fauna much better than I ever have. Even when I was doing field work I was only really focused on the endangered birds I was studying so now I am getting to know other organisms. I was thinking about making a blog out of it, but I'm not sure where to start. I'll also be starting a Ph.D. this Fall which will be ecology-related so I'd probably add research stuff in as well.

Do any of you have science blogs? What are yours about? I'm thinking about tieing it in with this username because I use it for everything; Twitter, Instagram, here and Flickr. Another thing to worry about is Doxxing myself, but I'm not sure I'm worth stalking and I only post things here that I wouldn't be ashamed of connecting to my real name. I'm pretty PC and PG-13 rated for the most part.

That was long-winded! Any advice is welcome. Thanks, ladies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Full and free journal article ink.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347217301124)

**Highlights:**

* We assess whether a great tit breeding population is structured by personality.
* Network analyses were conducted on a 6-year data set from this wild bird population.
* Males show positive assortment, nesting nearer to similar personalities (bold/shy).
* This assortment was not found to be related to local environmental variation.
* We discuss implications for natural and sexual selection on personality in the wild.


**Abstract:**

Animal personalities can influence social interactions among individuals, and thus have major implications for population processes and structure. Few studies have investigated the significance of the social context of animal personalities, and such research has largely focused on the social organization of nonterritorial populations. Here we address the question of whether exploratory behaviour, a well-studied personality trait, is related to the social structure of a wild great tit, Parus major, population during the breeding season. We assayed the exploration behaviour of wild-caught great tits and then established the phenotypic spatial structure of the population over six consecutive breeding seasons. Network analyses of breeding proximity revealed that males, but not females, show positive assortment by behavioural phenotype, with males breeding closer to those of similar personalities. This assortment was detected when we used networks based on nearest neighbours, but not when we used the Thiessen polygon method where neighbours were defined from inferred territory boundaries. Further analysis found no relationship between personality assortment and local environmental conditions, suggesting that social processes may be more important than environmental variation in influencing male territory choice. This social organization during the breeding season has implications for the strength and direction of both natural and sexual selection on personality in wild animal populations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! Thanks for the great question.

Plankton feeders are their own category; [*planktivores*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planktivore).

There are four different groups of plankton; Phytoplankton (*phyto* = plants),  Zooplankton (*zoo* = animal), Bacterioplankton (*bacterio* = bacteria + archae), and Mycoplankton (*myco* = fungi). If you want to be super specific, it depends on what type of plankton the plankivore is eating to determine whether or not it's a carnivore, omnivore or herbivore. Really though, most filter feeders will swallow up whatever is in the area without really discriminating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Ig Nobel is for novel research that is unusual or trivial, but not a joke [Via Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ig_Nobel_Prize):

The Ig Nobel Prizes are parodies of the Nobel Prizes given out each autumn for 10 unusual or trivial achievements in scientific research. They have been awarded since 1991, with the stated aim to "honor achievements that first make people laugh, and then make them think". The awards can be veiled criticism or satire, but are also used to point out that even absurd-sounding avenues of research can yield useful knowledge.

The researchers for this study still published their findings, under peer review, as the article [*Alteration of the platelet serotonin transporter in romantic love.*](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10405096) If the research was not sound it would never have been published in a reputable journal.

I've published my own research and it's not an easy process or trivial.

Here is the abstract:

**Abstract:**

**BACKGROUND:**

The evolutionary consequences of love are so important that there must be some long-established biological process regulating it. Recent findings suggest that the serotonin (5-HT) transporter might be linked to both neuroticism and sexual behaviour as well as to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The similarities between an overvalued idea, such as that typical of subjects in the early phase of a love relationship, and obsession, prompted us to explore the possibility that the two conditions might share alterations at the level of the 5-HT transporter.

**METHODS:**

Twenty subjects who had recently (within the previous 6 months) fallen in love, 20 unmedicated OCD patients and 20 normal controls, were included in the study. The 5-HT transporter was evaluated with the specific binding of 3H-paroxetine (3H-Par) to platelet membranes.

**RESULTS:**

The results showed that the density of 3H-Par binding sites was significantly lower in subjects who had recently fallen in love and in OCD patients than in controls.

**DISCUSSION:**
The main finding of the present study is that subjects who were in the early romantic phase of a love relationship were not different from OCD patients in terms of the density of the platelet 5-HT transporter, which proved to be significantly lower than in the normal controls. This would suggest common neurochemical changes involving the 5-HT system, linked to psychological dimensions shared by the two conditions, perhaps at an ideational level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist flying in. You're God damn right it is!

This example would fall under the "[sexual selection](http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_28)" category of natural selection; where females choose the brightest, most stand-out male they can (in this case, it's not always).

This seems counterintuitive because the males will stand out to predators as well. The reasoning behind this is even though this beautiful, loudly colored male is bright as Hell, he has avoided predation into his reproductive years. A male like this must have some pretty impressive genes to keep it alive with all the attention it must be getting.

It's the same concept with peacocks and their giant, unwieldy, heavy tails. A male is going to have a hard time maneuvering, but if he makes it to reproductive age there must be something special there. 

I love it! Definitely ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I teach Climate Science to non-science majors at my university. The students that I am seeing are not very informed, which I am assuming is why they take my class, but very willing to listen and understand the data. I haven't had any outright deniers, only a few who just weren't sure because again they were uninformed.

It's imperative that the next generation has this data available to them and not only at a college level. This should be taught in middle school and high school. Maybe it is? I'm not sure, but most of my students only knew what they read on social media - which is pretty alarming. The government trying to hide this is just disgusting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For those interested, here is a link to the full and free journal article, [*Osteology of Galeamopus pabsti sp. nov. \(Sauropoda: Diplodocidae\), with implications for neurocentral closure timing, and the cervico-dorsal transition in diplodocids*](https://peerj.com/articles/3179/).

**Abstract:**


Diplodocids are among the best known sauropod dinosaurs. Numerous specimens of currently 15 accepted species belonging to ten genera have been reported from the Late Jurassic to Early Cretaceous of North and South America, Europe, and Africa. The highest diversity is known from the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the western United States: a recent review recognized 12 valid, named species, and possibly three additional, yet unnamed ones. One of these is herein described in detail and referred to the genus Galeamopus. The holotype specimen of Galeamopus pabsti sp. nov., SMA 0011, is represented by material from all body parts but the tail, and was found at the Howe-Scott Quarry in the northern Bighorn Basin in Wyoming, USA. Autapomorphic features of the new species include a horizontal canal on the maxilla that connects the posterior margin of the preantorbital and the ventral margin of the antorbital fenestrae, a vertical midline groove marking the sagittal nuchal crest, the presence of a large foramen connecting the postzygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa and the spinopostzygapophyseal fossa of mid- and posterior cervical vertebrae, a very robust humerus, a laterally placed, rugose tubercle on the concave proximal portion of the anterior surface of the humerus, a relatively stout radius, the absence of a distinct ambiens process on the pubis, and a distinctly concave posteroventral margin of the ascending process of the astragalus. In addition to the holotype specimen SMA 0011, the skull USNM 2673 can also be referred to Galeamopus pabsti. Histology shows that the type specimen SMA 0011 is sexually mature, although neurocentral closure was not completed at the time of death. Because SMA 0011 has highly pneumatized cervical vertebrae, the development of the lamination appears a more important indicator for individual age than neurocentral fusion patterns. SMA 0011 is one of very few sauropod specimens that preserves the cervico-dorsal transition in both vertebrae and ribs. The association of ribs with their respective vertebrae shows that the transition between cervical and dorsal vertebrae is significantly different in Galeamopus pabsti than in Diplodocus carnegii or Apatosaurus louisae, being represented by a considerable shortening of the centra from the last cervical to the first dorsal vertebra. Diplodocids show a surprisingly high diversity in the Morrison Formation. This can possibly be explained by a combination of geographical and temporal segregation, and niche partitioning.

Our giant friend here would have difficulty attacking the diver from that angle unless it changed course to come straight at him. Coming up from underneath and alongside the rail the diver is behind makes it difficult for the shark to grab him given the shark's size. He's a brave man, but fairly safe here.

A little more about this amazing animal! Her name is *Deep Blue* and she is a 20 foot long Great White shark (*[Carcharodon carcharias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark)*) . The reason she looks so massive here is because she is very pregnant. She was videoed off the coast of Mexico's Guadalupe Island by  shark researcher Mauricio Hoyos Padilla.

Here are a few articles on her, though they will all be pretty similar:

* [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3194207/The-real-life-Jaws-World-s-largest-shark-nicknamed-Deep-Blue-flashes-razor-sharp-teeth-new-awe-inspiring-video.html) with several close up photos and a little more backstory. For some reason, hopefully a typo, Daily Mail called her a mammal. Of course she is not a mammal! All sharks are members of Class [Chondrichthyes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrichthyes) and are cartilaginous fishes. 

* [Discovery channel](http://www.discovery.com/tv-shows/shark-week/shark-feed/learn-more-about-deep-blue-one-of-the-biggest-great-white-sharks-ever-filmed/)

* [ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/International/video-footage-reveal-largest-great-white-shark-caught/story?id=33038151)



On a side note; I know Great whites, especially this big momma here, are scary. Great whites are listed as "vulnerable" though on the [International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List](http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/3855/0), meaning the species is likely to become endangered unless conditions improve. These amazing animals need our support and help and it is important to remember every animal has a place here regardless of how scary/ugly/creepy/etc. they may be.

Great Whites get a bad rep, but they don't cause nearly the amount of attacks we think they do. According to the [International Shark Attack File](http://www.flmnh.ufl.edu/fish/sharks/Statistics/statistics.htm#white), Great White sharks have been implicated in 280 unprovoked attacks on humans globally between 1876 and 2013. That's only about 2 attacks worldwide per year. Or for an easier read here is the [USA Today article from July 4th](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2015/07/04/great-white-sharks-rebound/29711213/). </TEXT>

There's a lot going on in the video, it's really something amazing to watch! 

I love the color display happening here. It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull. Aside from chromatophores some cephalopods also have [iridophores](http://en.termwiki.com/EN/iridiophore) and [leucophores](http://tolweb.org/notes/?note_id=2646). Iridophores have stacks of reflecting plates which create iridescent colors (greens, blues, silvers and golds) which you can see in [this photo](http://www.the-scientist.com/images/February2013/Fig1A_Loligo-Overview---pic-from-Grayson-Hanlon.jpg) of *[Loligo paeli](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longfin_inshore_squid)*. Leucophores mirror back the colors of the environment, helping the animal blend in with its surroundings.
Some cephalopods can change the texture of their skin by manipulating [muscular hydrostats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muscular_hydrostat). Hydrostats can change shape by squeezing some segments to create extension others. [Our tongues have muscular hydrostats which allow us to stretch it out.](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/octopus-chronicles/octopus-arms-human-tongues-intertwine-for-science/) According to a [paper published in 2014](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jmor.20221/abstract):

The octopuses [in the study] had three dedicated types of muscles that control their on-call skin protrusions, or papillae. One set are shaped in concentric circles to lift the skin vertically away from the body. Another set pulls this form together, to determine the shapewhether it will be a round bump or tall spike. And a third group seems to pull the raised section back toward the surface, spreading out its base.

There's also some inking at the end. Cephalopods release ink when escaping predators, or stunning their prey, but  these cuttlefish are using it in battle! The ink comes from a [sac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ink_sac) located between the gills of the cephalopod. It's actually an extension of the animal's gut. All cephalopods aside from those dweeling very deep within the ocean have ink sacs. They aren't necessary where there is no light. Depending on the type of cephalopod you will get a [different ink color](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalopod_ink); black for octopuses, blue-black for squid and brown from our friends here, the cuttlefish. </TEXT>

There's a lot going on in the video, it's really something amazing to watch! 

I love the color display happening here. It all starts with the humble [chromatophore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatophore). Chromatophores are cells that reflect light and hold pigment and are found just below the skin. To contrast, mammals and birds have [melanocyts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanocyte). Amphibians, fish, reptiles, crustaceans and some insects also use chromatophores to change their coloring.

Chromatophores contain a small sack full of pigment (black, brown, orange, red or yellow) which can stretch. If stretched out the color will be brighter, if retracted the color will appear more dull.

	<TEXT> Clemson University's article about the research [*35-year South Carolina alligator study uncovers mysteries about growth and reproduction*](http://newsstand.clemson.edu/mediarelations/35-year-south-carolina-alligator-study-uncovers-mysteries-about-growth-and-reproduction/?utm_source=homepage).

[Journal article link.](http://www.asihcopeiaonline.org/doi/abs/10.1643/CH-16-430?=)

**Abstract:**

The perception that crocodilians exhibit indeterminate growth is common in the general reptilian literature. However, this assumption is frequently based on observations of immature and young adult animals and therefore lacks a complete understanding of adult growth patterns. Long-term mark-recapture studies appear to be the most certain method of determining growth patterns of adult crocodilians. From 19792015, we conducted a mark-recapture study of an American Alligator (*Alligator mississippiensis*) population on the Tom Yawkey Wildlife Center (YWC) in coastal South Carolina to examine long-term growth patterns and the influence of age on multiple reproductive parameters. We found no discernible linear growth in 19 of 31 adult female and 7 of 19 adult male alligators over periods of 533 years. The mean maximum reproductive lifespan for female alligators on the study site was 46 years, and females continued to reproduce for an extended period of time after reaching maximum size. The Schnute growth model predicted that male alligators grew at a faster rate and attained a greater estimated mean terminal snoutvent length (SVL) than females (males = 186.9, CI0.95 = 184.5, 189.3 cm; females = 135.9, CI0.95 = 134.1, 137.8 cm) at the hypothetical age 75. In addition, the model predicted that males exhibited a greater estimated mean size (SVL = 182.0, CI0.95 = 179.6, 184.4 cm) and age (43 years) at which growth essentially ceased when compared to females (SVL = 131.4, CI0.95 = 129.5, 133.2 cm; 31 years). However, actual growth records of individual alligators suggested that the growth model may have overestimated the age at which male alligator growth ceased. The estimated mean earliest age at sexual maturity was 11.6 years (CI0.95 = 10.5, 12.8) for males and 15.8 years (CI0.95 = 14.5, 17.1) for females. We also documented that alligators on the site commonly live to 50 and can possibly live to 70 years of age. This study provides evidence that both male and female American Alligators in a population in coastal South Carolina exhibit a pattern of determinate growth and adds to a growing list of studies suggesting crocodilians as a group exhibit this growth pattern rather than indeterminate growth. Our findings are important for modeling population growth and determining sustainable harvest rates, particularly for alligators living near their northern distributional limit where growing seasons may be shorter and onset of sexual maturity later than in more southern portions of their range. </TEXT>

This both a ridiculous and wonderful gif. Terrestrial crabs feed on a wide variety of foods, sometimes peeling bark back from trees to find insects or to eat rotting vegetation. I think this little jerk is doing just that. A second option is it's tasting the paint and deciding it's not food, but given crabs are not very smart it just keeps going. They're running on instinct here.

I can't believe this mess! I love it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The research was published in the journal *Soft Matter* which gave me a giggle. 

This research goes nicely with the finding that most mammals [take roughly 21 seconds](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24425-universal-law-of-urination-found-in-mammals/) to empty their bladders. 

The journal article [*Hydrodynamics of defecation*](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/sm/c6sm02795d/unauth#!divAbstract) is behind a paywall, but here is the abstract:

Animals discharge feces within a range of sizes and shapes. Such variation has long been used to track animals as well as to diagnose illnesses in both humans and animals. However, the physics by which feces are discharged remain poorly understood. In this combined experimental and theoretical study, we investigate the defecation of mammals from cats to elephants using the dimensions of large intestines and feces, videography at Zoo Atlanta, cone-on-plate rheological measurements of feces and mucus, and a mathematical model of defecation. The diameter of feces is comparable to that of the rectum, but the length is double that of the rectum, indicating that not only the rectum but also the colon is a storage facility for feces. Despite the length of rectum ranging from 4 to 40 cm, mammals from cats to elephants defecate within a nearly constant duration of 12  7 seconds (N=23). We rationalize this surprising trend by the model, which shows that feces slide along the large intestine by a layer of mucus, similar to a sled sliding through a chute. Larger animals have not only more feces but also thicker mucus layers, which facilitate their ejection. Our model accounts for the shorter and longer defecation times associated with diarrhea and constipation, respectively. This study may support clinicians use of non-invasive procedures such as defecation time in the diagnoses of ailments of the digestive system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The relationship between pollinating insects and brightly colored flowers is a very intimate one. Flowers used to be green and brown, drab, and their pollen was a source of food for insects. You lose some that way, but it's still better than relying solely on the wind for reproduction. Early on beetles and flies were pollinators, attracted to plants that stunk like rotting meat. As time went on flowers transitioned into something more attractive; bright colors and the evolution of petals (I think magnolias and water lilies were the first to evolve petals - bright white). From here the plants specialized to attract specific pollinators and became brighter to outdo each other in attractiveness. I'm not sure on the evolution of UV vision in insects, but I think it's a fairly old trait. Later, we finally get nectar production which was a game changer. Now insects are eating the Nexus instead of pollen, which allows for more pollen to be spread around for reproduction. Nectar allowed for insect mouthpart specialization - long proboscises in butterflies, moths, and flies or somewhat long in bees. Bees became so specialized and reliant on flowers nectar and pollen are their only food source. Much different than butterflies, moths, and flies who have larval stages that do not eat nectar.

It was a long road to pollinating and not any one trait it transition that caused the switch. Remember Evolution is a process with many steps. There was a niche to be filled as plants evolved and bees were incredibly successful at filling it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of this according to a new study. I love new research! 

The main point of the article is actually the relatedness between ants and Apoids, but I loved the evolution aspect of wasps and bees. Apoids are the closest living relatives to ants. They all share an order, [Hymenoptera](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hymenoptera), but for the first time, we have DNA evidence of just how closely related they all are.

For anyone interested [here is the link](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822\(17\)30325-1) to the full and free journal article.

Or for the quick and dirty:

**Highlights**

* UCE phylogenomics provides a highly resolved phylogeny of the stinging wasps
* Ants are the sister group to bees and apoid wasps
* Bees are nested inside crabronid wasps and sister to Pemphredoninae+Philanthinae
* Outgroup choice and taxon sampling can strongly impact phylogenomic inference

**Summary**

The stinging wasps (Hymenoptera: Aculeata) are an extremely diverse lineage of hymenopteran insects, encompassing over 70,000 described species and a diversity of life history traits, including ectoparasitism, cleptoparasitism, predation, pollen feeding (bees [Anthophila] and Masarinae), and eusociality (social vespid wasps, ants, and some bees) [1]. The most well-studied lineages of Aculeata are the ants, which are ecologically dominant in most terrestrial ecosystems [2], and the bees, the most important lineage of angiosperm-pollinating insects [3]. Establishing the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees helps us understand and reconstruct patterns of social evolution as well as fully appreciate the biological implications of the switch from carnivory to pollen feeding (pollenivory). Despite recent advancements in aculeate phylogeny [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], considerable uncertainty remains regarding higher-level relationships within Aculeata, including the phylogenetic affinities of ants and bees [5, 6, 7]. We used ultraconserved element (UCE) phylogenomics [7, 12] to resolve relationships among stinging-wasp families, gathering sequence data from 800 UCE loci and 187 samples, including 30 out of 31 aculeate families. We analyzed the 187-taxon dataset using multiple analytical approaches, and we evaluated several alternative taxon sets. We also tested alternative hypotheses for the phylogenetic positions of ants and bees. Our results present a highly supported phylogeny of the stinging wasps. Most importantly, we find unequivocal evidence that ants are the sister group to bees+apoid wasps (Apoidea) and that bees are nested within a paraphyletic Crabronidae. We also demonstrate that taxon choice can fundamentally impact tree topology and clade support in phylogenomic inference. </TEXT>

Summary:  

Two luminous arches stretched across the dome of the sky on this northern spring night. After sunset on March 29, the mountain view panorama was captured in 57 exposures from Chopok peak in central Slovakia at an altitude of about 2,000 meters. The arc of the northern Milky Way is visible toward the right, but only after it reaches above the terrestrial lights from the mountain top perspective. Though dusk has passed, a bright patch of celestial light still hovers near the horizon and fades into a second luminous arch of Zodiacal Light, crossing near the center of the Milky Way. Dust in the ecliptic plane reflects sunlight to create the Zodiacal glow, typically prominent after sunset in clear, dark, skies of the northern spring. Almost opposite the Sun, Jupiter shines brightly near the horizon toward the left. Since Jupiter lies near the ecliptic, it appears within the slight brightening of the Zodiacal band also opposite the Sun called the Gegenschein. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Well where is he then? He should be here with you, doesn't sound like a good husband to me."

That is the worst. Like we are not allowed to do things without each other without being called terrible partners. I don't need to be with my husband every minute of the day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dragonflies don't have any stinging appendages, as bees or wasps do. They can bite you, as they have some pretty serious [mandibles](https://bybio.files.wordpress.com/2013/07/12-spotted-skimmer-face.jpg), but even then unless they get you on the webbing of your finger you probably won't notice. If you catch a dragonfly you might notice them opening and closing their mouthparts repeatedly.

Females have what might look like something that they can sting with at the end of their abdomens, an [ovipositor](http://wongchunxing.com/DragonFly/Ovipositor/Zyxomma_petiolatum5.jpg). They're not used defensively, but a female could mistake your leg or arm is a plant (especially if you're near or in water) and accidentally try to lay eggs. Again, it's not a defensive strategy, it's a mistake and likely pretty rare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find if you say you're not interested they try to convince you. If you say you have a partner (male or female, it's not just a guy has ownership) they leave you alone quicker. Also, saying you have a partner is a gentler way of saying you're not interested, this way it's not an outright rejection of the other person.

I've had similar situations with women, so we shouldn't generalize it's only men that do this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're close to 3 in (7.6 cm) long, so this might be a bit of an exaggeration due to camera perspective. </TEXT>
