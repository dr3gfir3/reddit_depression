Im crying writing this. You probably guessed it already; something happened to the camera. 

Look, I saw what happened because it streamed to my phone. You guys cant see because the footage never made its way onto my computer.

Fuck, so I downed like 5 coffees even though I hate it. I sat up and I waited until I saw the light. For those enquiring why my parents havent heard/seen him, their bedroom is on the other side of the house and faces the street whereas mine faces the garden.

When I saw the torch, I quickly switched on the app and began to watch. Tom unlocks the door and walks in. He produces a light bulb from his pocket and replaces the bulb in there which flickers a lot, and then turns on the light. 
Tom chooses a selection of pictures of the wall and sits down on dishevelled rat-chewed sofa. This is when I lost it. He began biting at the wood of the picture frames. He closed his eyes as he did it, briefly opening them to look at the picture. Once hed gnawed enough, he hung all the pictures back up.

I can hardly write the next bit. 

He reaches down to an old plastic bag full of my dress up clothes. He takes out a dress (Hermione Grangers Yule Ball dress to be precise; I was a geek when I was younger and I still kinda am), and begins to strip. When he was fully nude, he puts on the pink dress, its frills barely covering his male body. He stood there, smiling to himself, the sensation being euphoric to him.

I cried. A lot. Thats what hes doing. Fuck. 

I continued to watch, through my stream of tears. Thats when I got the low battery notification on my phone. That meant a light had begun to flash on the camera. Shit. Tom walked over to the flashing light and picked up the camera. He grinned.

You like that? He said, rather salaciously. He continued to laugh in that flirtatious, courteous tone. I shook my head. I know you do.

He began to walk with the camera out of the shed, back over the fence, back into his house. He walked through the house, still thinly clad in my costume dress. He walked into his daughters room, took off the dress and laid it on her desk. 

You cant have it anymore. You arent FRESH enough. He hissed. See you soon.

The camera flicked off and I sat paralysed for a few minutes. Holy shit. I needed to get that camera. I ran downstairs, and I never run anywhere. I ran into the kitchen and froze. Tom, now fully clothed was half over my fence with camera in hand. He threw it down behind him and walked into his garden, calling for Milo.

As soon as I was certain he was gone, I ran outside and got the camera. Hed taken the SD card out, which stored ALL the footage from last night and more. I went back inside and locked the back door. 

I cannot take this. Now he knows that I know what Im doing. Im about to go speak to his wife, Nancy. Ill update on what she said when I get back.

------

This is all off the scale now. My conversation with Nancy wasstrange. 

I took round one of their stray balls that had found its way into our garden. Before she could close the door, I asked if I could speak to her. She uncertainly agreed, and I stepped inside.

I explained everything. The encounters, the chewing, the dressing up, and the video itself. What seemed strange is she didnt seem too bothered by it all.

Tom has always been fascinated by you; youre an amazing young lady. She said, her voice light and soft as a feather. 

I dont think its a good thing that he is fascinated by me, Nancy. What he said on the video sounded hostile. I replied, with a scoff. How dare she brush this off and pretend like its nothing. 

Tom doesnt hurt you, though. He hasnt gone that far. He just cares about you. Our daughter doesnt give the same kind of love, or so Tom says. Nancy replied. Now, this reply baffled me. It was almost like she was ENDORSING his actions. How could she endorse what he does?

Does he hurt you? I said.

Nancy nodded. Tom is a perfectionist; he loves when things are exactly how he likes them. I am not perfect, and nobody is. Youll be okay. Youre perfect.

I am not perfect. I dont get good grades. Im not that pretty I dont think. What the hell is perfect about me?
I must say I am shocked he goes in the shed. Thats invasion on your property. Maybe Ill stop him doing that. Just leave him be; hes a tortured soul.

Fuck you, Nancy. That man is fucking obsessed with me and you expect me to leave it be? Im gonna call the police.

I took my phone from my pocket, and dialled 999.

She grabbed my wrist, and the look in her eyes told me to stop, to listen. Her voice lowered to a desperate whisper. Dont call the police. Hell kill you. And me. And everyone. He told me if he;s going to prison he might as well do it in style.

I pulled away. I am not letting this carry on Nancy. If hes hurting you-

I heard Toms car pull up.

Go, go now. Nancy said, directing me out the back door and over the dreaded gap in the fence. I stood watching in the kitchen. 

Tom sauntered in, and noticed Nancys distress. He slapped her across the face and then left the room.

I am at a crossroads. Something is very wrong with that family, and that guy. But hes threatened to kill me if I tell the police. I know I need to tell the police, but I dont want to risk my damn life.

Ive jammed the shed lock so he cant get in. Maybe thatll stop him. Its selfish but Id rather he left me the fuck alone and was weird in his own house. 

Ill update tomorrow, or never depending on whether this stops it.  </TEXT>
