	<TEXT> The "XD" screens at Cinemark by Fayette Mall are pretty good... Bigger and louder than the standard screens there. That is also one of the newer/busier theaters in town so if anyone dresses up they'd probably go there. Just make sure you buy your ticket for one of the "XD" showings  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a tiny playground on the corner of Francis and Burley Ave behind the Rally's on Broadway. They've been tearing down old buildings back there and putting in cheap student housing. It has a basketball court and a few play structures... I cut through there to avoid traffic sometimes and have never seen anyone but college kids playing basketball.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boot's Auto Body has done lots of work for my family over the years. My parents don't even bother getting estimates anywhere else, as they insurance and have been very pleased with the work done there. 

Most car guys in town will say that The Lab on Versailles Rd does the absolute best work, but you pay for it. I took a motorcycle there for a paint estimate once and it was double what I expected. The shop was full of classic muscle cars and high end imports, so I guess that says something.
