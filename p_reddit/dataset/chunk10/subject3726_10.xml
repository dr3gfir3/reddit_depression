	<TEXT> Have you seen Michael Haneke's film *The Piano Teacher* (also based on a book - I have not read it!). It stars Isobel Huppert as a deeply narcissistic, self destructive, self harming piano teacher (and of course Huppert made an excellent Madame Bovary too! Narcissism is her speciality I think!). This is perhaps an Anna Karenina, Emma Bovary, Hedda Gabler for our time (? - maybe not!). And yet Haneke finds an element of *hope* at the end of the film. It's barely there, but it *is* there. Hope is possible within such a narrative. The braver artist will surely provide it for us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if I misunderstand you, but I'm not remotely worried Flaubert is over my head! It happens that in this novel I feel the writer's presence strongly. Perhaps I'm mistaken, but for me the tone he often strikes is satirical. Satire suggests a wry knowing - the author makes his presence known by winking at us, or maybe in this case he simply raises an eyebrow. Either way, he is 'in the room'. He has targets: as I suggested, romanticism is one, but the arrogance of empiricism is another. As I read, I'm experiencing Flaubert's shots at these targets as something slightly separate from the literal narrative. His opinions on farming and local politics, for example, which I didn't understand but was aware that he was telling me about, are something apart from Emma's romantic intrigues (although of course, for Flaubert the two may stem from the same root). And so, for me, the novel is working on two levels. This is simply what I, the reader, make of the text! Perhaps if I were more gripped by Emma's  plight my mind would not be tempted to wander over to Flaubert and try to figure out what he's getting at! Thanks for your recommendation I will give it a look!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There could be a very basic reason for my feelings on *The Corrections* in that it describes a world (a time) that I recognise, and the past of *Bovary* seems strange. But - Emma's acting for herself? Does she? It seems to me she acts only against herself. Perhaps I understood her too quickly - and now I'm bored! Emma wants desperately to be loved, and yet, for some reason, considers herself utterly unacceptable - an abject creature that should have no place in the world. Therefore when adoring, unconditional love is offered to her simply and openly (from Charles) it is immediately dismissed. After all, whoever offered it must surely be intensely stupid, or otherwise have such low standards as to be as detestable as Emma is herself. And so she focusses her attention on seeking love from men who view her as worthless - although all she really wants from them is rejection. Rejection will re-affirm Emma's self loathing, and self loathing is her comfort zone and also the home of her great pride. I haven't finished to book, but I know that Emma commits suicide in the end. I don't know if I want to finish the journey. Where is the hope for God's sake? It's too sad and also cruel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah - but you see I can't see Emma as a victim. She's lazy - she doesn't try. Emma sits back and waits for the world to make her happy. It's such a basic error, and obviously a widespread and common one. Of course! I know something about this error myself - enough to know that it's entirely self inflicted. But there are ways out of this self imposed prison. Emma doesn't *want* to help herself out, and I find that tiresome. In fact as I write this I'm starting to realise I hate Emma! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your comment! It's interesting to me that the passages you recall to clearly are from the first section of the book, before the Bovary's move to Yonville. I hope you don't mind if I cut and paste my own reply to another comment:

The first section of the book, before the Bovary's move to the town where the main action is set, I enjoyed very much. Perhaps this was simply for, as you put it, the narrative voice. The descriptions of Charles and Emma's upbringing, their courtship, wedding, the grand ball that becomes some kind of touchstone for Emma's ambition. I wonder though, if with the move to Yonville the tone shifts slightly, adopting a kind of bitter cynicism. I feel sometimes as if Flaubert is using the setting, characters and action, to get some things off his chest. He rants against everything - against romanticism of course, but also against rational enlightened ideas that look to science to answer all of life's mysteries. Ambition - love - all is vanity. Does Flaubert simply loathe the world?

Of course this makes me think of the translation too. To enjoy writing in the way you describe, the translation is surely everything. I'm reading the Lydia Davis version. Is there an alternative you would recommend?

	<TEXT> Well that's a very interesting question isn't it! Hmmmmm.... perhaps it's not so much that I have to 'like' them, and more that I have to be attracted to them. This could be because they're open hearted and courageous - but it could equally be because they're terribly badly behaved or even evil! I guess I'm not attracted to Emma. I've thought about why this might be, but I can't find an answer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How strange you should mention *The Corrections*. I don't read that many books, but this was the one I read before starting *Madame Bovary*! I had no trouble connecting with Franzen's characters. Deeply flawed and often selfish as they were, I recognised them as intensely human. Maybe this is what I'm missing with Emma - her humanity. About half way through the book it started to bother me that she has no friends. No friends - at all! Of course this could be circumstance - maybe there are simply none available to her. But I find this unlikely. It makes Emma strange to me. It frustrates me a little that Flaubert will mention that Emma spent some time chatting to the servants - and I think I recall a passage where she receives female visitors from the town. But we learn nothing about the nature of these conversations. I can't help feeling it's in ordinary social situations like these an the human aspect of Emma may be found - but it's denied us.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Madame Bovary is confusing me. How should I be reading this book? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello - I'll try and keep this short as it's my first post here and you never know if you're going to get taken down for not reading the rules properly. 

Madame Bovary - about three quarters of the way through this classic novel and struggling. Problem I'm having is that I just don't *like* anybody, and I get the feeling Flaubert doesn't like them very much either. Emma is a narcissistic nightmare, her husband's an idiot, the neighbour is a pompous prat, the first lover a cad and the second just annoying. This reads like a satire - and it's hard to connect emotionally with satire. This is why satire is so often funny. Madame Bovary, however, while containing comic undertones, is far from comedy. I would describe it as a satirical romantic tragedy, and that's pretty confusing to me if I'm honest. My question is - why am I failing to connect with this story and these characters? I don't understand *how* I'm supposed to be reading this book. Should I be moved? Amused? Should I judge the characters for their failings? Confused. 

Edit: Thank you for all the insightful and helpful comments! I return to Madame Bovary with a refreshed enthusiasm! Very useful indeed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I agree with you also. This is why I said 'for the time being at least'. You are right - the ending of *Taxi Driver* is ambiguous. We don't really know what the future is going to be like for Travis. There's an unreal quality to the ending too. As you point out, we only see Betsy in the mirror. Is she even there? We can't be sure. IMO *Taxi Driver* is one of the greatest films of the 20th century. Multiple, sometimes contradictory interpretations can sit together and all contain some truth. This is a defining feature of great art! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I would say he does change, most obviously at the end of the film. We can see how much he has changed when we compare his reaction to Betsy at the start of the film to the end when she gets into his taxi. Through his extreme action Travis has, for the time being at least, found a way out of his depression and social isolation. He seems, relatively speaking, to have become a normally functioning human being. He changes too in other ways prior to this, i.e. from a lost and desperate alienated loser to a vigilante social crusader with definite goals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody I can think of has the combination of intellectual rigour, emotional distance, and flamboyant theatricality that for me characterises Kubrick. People quite often compare PTA to Kubrick, but I don't get it. Theatricality, yes, but Anderson's heart is often placed firmly on his sleeve and intellectually he is happy to remain relatively abstract, where Kubrick liked to keep his thesis clear. I might suggest Michael Haneke as a better comparison. The coldness is there for sure, but also the discipline and a good dose of flair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw this film years ago but still remember it pretty well - something I would attribute to more than simple shock factor. Having said that, I also remember Breillat's previous film, *Romance*, which I'm pretty sure I remember only for its shock factor. In my opinion *Fat Girl* is by far the superior film. 

I've always been curious about the title change for its English language release. The original French title, *A Ma Soeur!* (To My Sister!), contextualises the narrative in a radically different way to the confrontational 'Fat Girl'. It almost becomes a different film. I wonder why this decision was taken? Simply to create controversy?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This post made me laugh! I also find the treatment of Lina in the movie to be excessively cruel. I find the ending where she is 'exposed' uncomfortable viewing. I also agree with you about the speech instructor scene. I have always felt sorry for him - the two male stars are basically assholes. 'Make Em Laugh' is my least favourite scene in the movie - it's the unfunniest thing I've ever seen. Forced entertainment indeed. 

I would go further with your take on Kelly's character in that I also find his treatment of Reynolds throughout the film questionable. He makes her feel extremely uncomfortable in some scenes, and is persistant to the point of insensitivity. His stunt at the end could potentially have been deeply humiliating for both women. He's basically a bully. This is mirrored by Kelly's reported treatment of Reynolds during her training for *Singin In The Rain*, when Reynolds was put through some sort of punishing dance boot camp by Kelly which left her a physical and emotional wreck (although Reynolds later spoke of this as a positive experience). Reynolds was 18 - I believe Kelly was 40 at the time. Kelly was a brilliantly tallented performer and an extraordinary dancer. But from a modern perspective there's something dislikable about his character in his films. I'm not sure how sincere I ever find him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's funny - I completely agree with your take on *Drive* but I hated the film for exactly the reasons you love it. I hadn't actually thought of the film as deconstructing the male fantasy in the way you suggest - but I'm convinced by it and maybe will give it another view at some point with this in mind. I found Gosling's character to be, as you suggest, an incredibly creepy weirdo, and the idea that any woman would not run a million miles away from him as fast as they could was, for me, completely ridiculous. This is the kind of guy who practices karate moves in front of his bedroom mirror. Was this the ultimate man's fantasy, or the ultimate boy's fantasy?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's for the long meal scenes, as I recall *Van Gogh* is particularly striking. *A Nos Amours* is generally regarded as Pialat's masterpiece though - although IMO he made several masterpieces. While we're on the subject, *La Gueule Ouverte* opens with a very long, static scene of Mother and Son eating at a table. I find the scene absolutely riveting - and I have no idea why.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This immediately makes me think of Pialat. He has a crazy technique he uses in *Lola*, *A Nos Amours*, and also *Van Gogh* where towards the end of the film he will introduce a scene that starts normally, keeps going, keeps going..... and then *keeps going* till you assume the editor just gave up. This is after 90 minutes of a movie with pretty regular scene length and structure. The scenes are always set around a dinner table with a group of characters eating, and they ramble and ramble on and on. The effect is tremendously exciting - he's so audacious. He's disrupting the structure of the film, and completely confounding the viewer's expectations. We're forced to abandon our grip on the narrative somewhat, and therefore Pialat invites us to live with the characters in the moment - we have no choice! It sends shivers down my spine. I realise I've kind of spoilt this for anyone who hasn't seen these films. Sorry about that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer: I am not American - brownies are not part of my culture, so please excuse any brownie ignorance or plain lack of taste in the brownie department that may offend. My brownie recipe comes from a *Frenchman*. 

Hi everyone. I love brownies and found a recipe (on youtube of all places) that is just to my taste (for me, perfect cakey gooey-ness without becoming sickly). It bothers me, however, that there is no solid chocolate included. It's just cocoa. I love the texture, but want more chocolate depth. Basically the recipe calls for a sugar/ground nut/flour (very little)/cocoa powder/butter mix, to which you add egg whites and an alarming amount of browned butter. You then beat the mixture for a good while to get air into it, and then add toasted nuts. I'd like to try melting some solid chocolate into the melted butter and see how things go. The texture of the brownies is very much to my liking, so I don't want to mess with that. What would you guys do?

Edit: The video I took the recipe from is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ojU1TqDXl2U) if anyone is interested.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree with you. Thing is, because Lynch makes films that are just so insanely fruitloops, you can sometimes end up questioning the film's worth, because if pretty much *anything* can happen at *any* time, where's the artistry in that? Surely the artistry in film lies in communicating something sensible to an audience - telling a coherent story? I think this is what some detractors would argue. But they understimate the skill required to create crazy worlds and still make them believable - to take an audience on such a mad ride and keep them engaged to the very end. The narrative *has* to be making some kind of sense on some subtle level - maybe an abstract level. IMO Lynch is a great artist, and to take a rational approach to his films is like taking a rational approach to a piece of music.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't think of a better example of what you describe than Federico Fellini. After *8 1/2* it's like even he couldn't see past the 'Fellini-esque' tag - it's a kind of creative curse. When a director starts to put his own name before the title of his films  - 'Fellini's Casanova' - 'Fellini Satyricon' - it's a bad bad sign. It's just popped into my head that Fellini's friend Ingmar Bergman somehow managed largely to avoid this problem, despite having his own 'Bergman-esque' tag and a highly distinctive film making style. *Fanny And Alexander*, made at the end of Bergman's career, is right up there with his best work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can anyone help me troublshoot my croissants? 

This is one of those situations where there is so much contradictory advice out there I no longer know up from down! My journey to the croissants of my dreams is well on its way now, but I'm having trouble with the final proving. My rise is lacklustre to say the least. 

I think it's a yeast problem. I'm using instant yeast, but on doing some research online I've found a number of sources warning against using instant yeast in dough that spends time in the refridgerator. A few manufacturer's own websites carry this warning. Meanwhile a number of croissant recipes from big names (eg Paul Hollywood) include instant yeast without any mention of a potential problem. 

Does anyone have any comments on this? For dough that needs chilled, is there a problem with instant yeast, or in your experience does instant yeast work fine? 

PS - if anyone wants to make a comment on the whole 'to knead or not to knead' debate that would be appreciated too.  </TEXT>
