And it got stuck there, not doing anything, not letting me back out or anything. Alt+F4. Upon re-launching the game, I get thrown into an endless queue with "Exit battle" freezing my screen with "Exit...", once again not being able to do anything else. Further Alt+F4'ing yelds the same result. Are the servers fucked (EU) or is this something fucky on my side? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the reason people buy a Porsche SUV instead of a sports car is because they need a SUV and don't need a sports car.

You "can" daily drive a 911 but it's quite a bit of a pain and inconvenience (even though 911's are one of the few cars that you technically can daily if you really want to). So if you want your car to be an extension of your chosen genitals but at the same time actually use it every day all year round, you pick the Cayenne.

And fuck the Panamera. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a direct drive slow speed engine with fixed pitch propeller so the prop shaft is fixed permamently to the crankshaft. There is no transmission there, so if we want to stop, we have to stop the entire engine. It can also run both ways for forwards and reverse propulsion.

There are kinds of ships that utilize medium speed engines that require the use of a reduction gear because it would spin the prop too fast. You don't want the prop to spin too fast because it would just cavitate the shit out of the water, eat itself and not really go anywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The dirty water is collected in special tanks called slop tanks. It can be (with several strict restrictions) discharged into the sea through special equipment called ODME - Oil Discharge Monitoring Equipment (duh) - that doses the discharge so only a certain amount of dirty water can be discharged over a given traveled distance. I can't really get into details about exact numbers because this is deck officer's responsibility that I don't really care about, lol. Of course any remaining amount of slop can be discharged to special port facilities.

In the engine room however, we need to take care about bilge water. Bilge water collects in bilges (duh), the spaces under the bottom floor of the engine room. It just gets there. Tiny leaks, condensation, blah blah there's always some water there and we need to get rid of it. This water also has some oil content in it because engine rooms aren't the cleanest spaces ever, also any spills and leaks eventually make their way into the bilges. We use a piece of equipment called the Oily Water Separator that cleans the water off most of its oil content. The regulations say that we can discharge bilge water with oil content that is no more than 15  ppm - parts per million. So basically oil can only be the 15/1000000 of the stuff we get rid of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Like this!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfH7Ia8mwTA) Sea water is used to clean the tanks if necessary before hauling next cargo. There's "cargo compatibility" charts and shit that state if tank cleaning is necessary or is it ok for some cargo to get mixed with a tiny bit of remains from the previous one. Of course the magical spinny spraying thing cannot clean everything, so afterwards people actually go down inside the tanks and clean what's left.

The engine room is a loud place. You have to wear earplugs or headphones, some people use both. There's the main engine, at least one auxiliary engine and a shitton of electrical pumps, fans and shit all running in a single enclosed space. Shit's loud yo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is actually the primary forced draft fan for the auxiliary boiler, the blue cylinder seen behind it. There aren't many exhaust fans in the engine room, don't really need any. There's a lot of machinery that consumes ambient air inside the engine room (Main engine, auxiliary engine, auxiliary boiler, incinerator, probably something I'm forgetting). We have four large supply fans to keep positive pressure inside. If for some magical reason they all failed and we wouldn't know (VERY unlikely to happen), we'd pretty much fucking suffocate. Note the turbocharger seen under the exhaust duct (the biggest silver pipe thing going up) </TEXT>
