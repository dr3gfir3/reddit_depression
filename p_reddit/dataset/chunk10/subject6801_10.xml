	<TITLE> ELI5 Why isn't T-Mobile violating net neutrality? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> T-Mobile doesn't charge extra data when users listen to music on certain data plans. 

Yesterday, there was an article on r/worldnews about Canada upholding net neutrality. It said,

"Differential pricing contradicts the principle of net neutrality because it allows service providers to leverage their privileged position to decide which services are most attractive to their customers, effectively discriminating against others."

So wouldn't this be a violation? </TEXT>
