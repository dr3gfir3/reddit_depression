	<TEXT>  On 3 August 2014, ISIS launched a coordinated attack on Sinjar City and surrounding towns and villages, forcing Yazidis to seek refuge on Mount Sinjar. Those who could not flee in time were either killed or kidnapped [6]. As ISIS encircled the mountain on 4 August, tens of thousands of Yazidis remained trapped without water, food, or shelter in temperatures rising above 50C. At the request of the Iraqi government, United States airstrikes and humanitarian aid airdrops began on 8 August; helicopter rescue missions were initiated a few days later. Most Yazidis were evacuated between 913 August when a safe corridor was opened by Kurdish forces, allowing them to flee through Syria into the Kurdistan Region of Iraq [7].

The vast majority of Yazidis reached Kurdistan by mid-August 2014, where they found temporary shelter in hundreds of informal settlements, including schools, community spaces, and unfinished buildings. As schools were needed for the beginning of the academic year and some property owners requested the government to clear their properties, displaced Yazidis were gradually transferred to newly built camps [8]. More than 300,000 Yazidis have settled in Kurdistan, with over half in camps managed by the Kurdistan regional government and the balance still scattered in construction sites and unofficial tented settlements [8,9]. A relatively low number of Yazidis have settled elsewhere: by 2015, it was estimated that some 10,000 remained in tents on the north side of Mount Sinjar under Kurdish control, nearly 15,000 were reportedly in refugee camps in Syria, and at least 30,000 were known to have crossed into Turkey [1012].

Soon after the events of August 2014, the United Nations Human Rights Council dispatched a mission to Kurdistan to document the scope of ISIS violations of international human rights law. The mission report asserts that members of ISIS may have perpetrated genocide against the Yazidi community by killing, causing serious bodily or mental harm and forcibly transferring members of the group, including children, in the context of a manifest pattern of conduct aimed at the destruction of the group and that further investigation is needed to establish the precise number of those who continue to be held by ISIS as well as the numbers killed, estimated to be in the thousands [13].

Some attempts have been made to compile lists of those affected. Kurdish authorities and human rights organisations have reported to the United Nations that between 2,000 and 5,500 Yazidis were killed and more than 6,000 were kidnapped; however, the United Nations has not yet been able to independently verify these figures [14]. Between 4 November and 25 December 2015, we conducted a retrospective household survey to provide the first population-based estimates of the number and demographic profile of Yazidis killed and kidnapped by ISIS.

	<TEXT> Hmm im not exactly hopeful when industries on the board have factored a 4c increase in warming into their future plans. Oh and also a highly respected  scientist called Ivanka Trump has an influence on policy


President Donald Trump's daughter, Ivanka, will meet with Cabinet officials and department heads in the next two weeks to discuss a variety of issues, including the Paris climate accord, Politico reported.

The website dubbed her planned series of meetings: "Ivanka's Listening Tour."

She is scheduled to meet with EPA administrator Scott Pruitt on Monday and Tuesday to discuss whether the administration should pull out of the Paris climate treaty, Politico said.

And Axios reported the president is inclined to abandon the pact, but his daughter is determined that he hear all the facts before he makes a decision.

	<TEXT> Do you really trust governments who will produce reports around climate change who have a conflict of interest? In this case America with Exxon Mobile and Saudi Aramco producing  future climate change reports. I kid you not.

 108 national and international environmental organizations sent a letter to the chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to raise their concerns about the selection of authors for the special report on the impacts of global warming, which the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) will present next year. One of the selected authors (proposed by the US government) works for ExxonMobil, another for the Saudi oil company SaudiAramco. The signatories criticize that this selection does not correspond to the internal policy of the IPCC. It would actually constitute a violation of IPCCs own conflict of interest policy.

Writing in the Lancet, researchers from the UK and Sweden describe how they carried out research between 1998 and 2004. More than 10,000 at-risk patients  predominantly white, male and over 60  were randomly allocated to one of two groups, either taking statins or a placebo, and followed for more than three years. Neither the participants nor their doctors knew which group they belonged to.

In the second part of the study, 9,899 of the patients had the medication or placebo stopped, and both groups were then given the option of taking statins. The patients were then followed for more than two years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Common side-effects of statins are not down to the drugs, but are instead a result of patients negative expectations, research suggests.

Statins are typically prescribed to help lower levels of bad cholesterol  or low-density lipoprotein  in order to reduce the risk of a heart attack or stroke. A recent report estimated that the drugs prevent around 80,000 such incidents a year in the UK.

Despite their benefits, statins have been caught up in a storm of controversy, with critics questioning the safety and efficacy of the drugs after NHS guidelines advised that prescriptions should be extended to those at lower risk of heart attack.

But the new study suggests common side-effects of muscle pain and weakness are not a result of the drugs themselves, but rather patients negative beliefs about the medication  a phenomenon known as the nocebo effect.

You only get the muscle-related symptoms when you know you are taking the drug, Peter Sever, lead author of the study from the national heart and lung institute at Imperial College London.

He added that it was important to note that patients are not imagining their pains. Patients genuinely get the symptoms, he said. But you cannot attribute that, in this case, to the drug.

	<TEXT> Increasing the percentage of elementary school children in the United States who participate in 25 minutes of physical activity three times a week from 32 percent to 50 percent would avoid $21.9 billion in medical costs and lost wages over the course of their lifetimes, new Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health research suggests.

The findings, published May 1 in Health Affairs, suggest that just a small increase in the frequency of exercise among children ages eight through 11 would also result in 340,000 fewer obese and overweight youth, a reduction of more than four percent. If all current eight- through 11-year-olds in the United States exercised 25 minutes a day, three times a week, the researchers suggest that $62.3 billion in medical costs and lost wages over the course of their lifetimes could be avoided and in 1.2 million fewer youths would be overweight or obese.

These numbers represent cost savings for one cohort of eight-to-11 year olds, so every year that children in this age group reach those levels of physical activity, over $60 billion more will be saved.

"Physical activity not only makes kids feel better and helps them develop healthy habits, it's also good for the nation's bottom line," says study leader Bruce Y. Lee, MD, MBA, executive director of the Global Obesity Prevention Center at the Bloomberg School. "Our findings show that encouraging exercise and investing in physical activity such as school recess and youth sports leagues when kids are young pays big dividends as they grow up."

Studies have shown that a high body mass index (BMI) at 18 is associated with a high BMI throughout adulthood and increases the subsequent risk of developing diseases such as diabetes and heart disease associated with being overweight or obese, which can lead to high medical costs and productivity losses due to illness. In recent decades, there has been a growing epidemic of obesity in the United States.

For the study, Lee and his colleagues, including team members from the Bloomberg School and the Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center at Carnegie Mellon University, developed a computational simulation model utilizing their VPOP (Virtual Population for Obesity Prevention) software platform to represent the current population of U.S. children and to show how changes in levels of physical activity could affect them throughout their lifetime and the resulting economic impact. The model relied on data from the 2005 and 2013 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) as well as information from the National Center for Health Statistics. The medical costs and the lost wages were calculated in the second model, which looked at the lifetime effects of physical activity.

The researchers also looked at various levels of healthy physical activity, starting with the current average of 32 percent of children ages eight to 11 who exercise for 25 minutes a day, three days a week, up to 100 percent doing so. That is a guideline developed by the Sports and Fitness Industry Association. The researchers found that maintaining the current level of physical activity would result in 8.1 million of these youths being overweight or obese by 2020, which would cost $2.8 trillion in additional medical costs and lost wages over their lifetimes. An overweight person's lifetime medical costs average $62,331 and lost wages average $93,075. For an obese person, these amounts are even greater.

"Even modest increases in physical activity could yield billions of dollars in savings," Lee says. The costs averted are likely an underestimate, he says, as there are other benefits of physical activity that don't impact weight, such as improving bone density, improving mood and building muscle.

Lee says that the spending averted by healthy levels of physical activity would more than make up for costs of programs designed to increase activity levels.

"As the prevalence of childhood obesity grows, so will the value of increasing physical activity," he says. "We need to be adding physical education programs and not cutting them. We need to encourage kids to be active, to reduce screen time and get them running around again. It's important for their physical health -- and the nation's financial health."

What bit are you stuck on exactly? Here is another article about it.

Unlike simple models such as disease contagion or transmission of news, which need only one exposure to infect or inform the next individual, the spreading of protests is more complex, making it less certain, said Steinert-Threlkeld, who teaches courses on these topics at the undergraduate and graduate levels at UCLA Luskin.

"Having someone tell you, 'Hey, I'm going to protest tomorrow' is much less impactful than having multiple people tell you they are protesting tomorrow," he said. Large groups of people, as opposed to a few central individuals, are able to discuss "where to go, how to get there, when to go," as well as what is going on once there, Steinert-Threlkeld added. In addition, individuals debating whether or not to protest must receive a credible signal that large numbers of people are protesting.

"Protests are a complex contagion phenomenon because increasing participation makes others more likely to join," Steinert-Threlkeld said, pointing out that because more individuals are on the periphery than in the core of a network, protest is more likely to occur where the larger group is located. "The decision to participate in a protest appears to be driven by normal people taking cues from each other, not from elites."
