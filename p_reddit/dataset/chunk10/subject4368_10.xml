	<TEXT> Yes. Another good example is a cat screech when something smashes even if no cat is present. It exists to enhance the action. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a sound design trick: if there's a gun on screen, it has to make a chambering sound. Helps the audience connect with the severity of the situation because guns, believe it or not, aren't the noisiest things in the world until you pull the trigger. Another example of this are tire screeching when there isn't braking, whoosh sounds and impact s for punches and that whistling sound for a bomb drop. These are instutions of sound design for film, they don't happen in real life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a Mormon girl I thought was really cute that came to my house one day. Normally Id either tell them to beat it or if get into some religious debate but not her. I don't know what I was thinking but I think I may have confused her Mormon niceness with flirting and the next thing I know we're in the garage and her and her friend are praying for me and I'm reading pages from the LDS. We're still friends on Facebook. She visited me last year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've lived here roughly 6 years now. Apparently, while living here I have experienced dozens of "earthquakes", but in all honesty, I have no idea what an actual earthquake feels like. Most of the quakes I've experienced last but mere seconds. Half the time I assume either some hit the side of the house or a rocket launch or something. I keep hearing about all these Cali quakes but I have yet to really feel one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't worry, guys. It was just an unhappy refugee. Sweden will figure it out. In the meantime, I say we all get to work ignoring this and we'll talk next week when something like this happens again. Also, don't forget the that Islam is a religion of peace and that if you disagree with forced multiculturalism... You're a racist! </TEXT>
