	<TEXT> Strange how people can have such vast differences on the same book. Personally, I really struggled to even finish that one even though it's so short. I ended up giving the rare one star rating from me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please tell me I'm not the only one who does this. I have multiple copies of Wool by Hugh Howey, as it is one of my all time favorite books, and whenever someone visits and sees my library and asks for a book recommendation, I give them a copy. It really encourages reading! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely need some sort of twist ending, and I do want to work on interactions between the crew. I am leaning more towards the latter, with them arriving back to Earth relatively early on, and focusing on the after effects. This is where I'm stuck. What are the crew going to do now? Where do they go? Do they attempt to go back to the surface of the planet? Is the planet even still whole? Where did the survivors (if any) flee to...perhaps the moon? Mars? I'm hoping to have some ideas spit out for me to sift through and expand upon. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help me develop this hard sci-fi idea? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-19 03:43:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sorry if this isn't allowed here, but I have an idea for a novel, but I'm looking for some ideas to help develop my single idea into a plot. This is just a fun little project I'm doing for myself to try my hand at writing something other than non-fiction. I'm trying to keep this theoretically possible. So here's my little blurb:

The Earthen Federation (or some sort of government) creates a new, advanced ship with the first ever warp drive. A small group of engineers, scientists, and pilots are selected to take said ship on the first test of its new warp drive. All seems to go well, however, when returning after what they have assumed to be only a day or two, they return to an Earth in ruins. A side effect of the warp drive was inadvertent time dilation due to the distance travelled. This wasn't anticipated, as they assumed the warp drive would move them instantaneously, whereas in reality they experienced the full amount of time (relative) of traveling to the location and back without the warp factor.

This (to me) seems like a good opening act of a novel, but as far as how to get to this point, and what to base the rest of the story on is beyond me. So, I'm looking for ideas to help develop this premise. Plot points, sub plots, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hold up...you know of Mother Mother?! You are literally the first person I've ever met who has heard of them! That just made my day haha. And yes, hip-hop is another favorite of mine, how did I forget to mention it?! My favorite hip-hop artists are Eminem, Hopsin, Tech N9ne (fun fact, his studio is in my city!), and I've just started listening to Future. Also, perhaps we should private message instead of holding a convo in a reddit thread? Haha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ohhh 11/22/63 is one of the books I have planned to read this year! I love Stephen King, he's one of my favorite authors! I would have loved to see Interstellar in IMAX! I usually don't go out to the theater too much, because I spent thousands of dollars to create my own home theater in my living room haha. As far as music, I listen to just about everything. Some favorite bands include Panic! at the Disco, Pink Floyd, Mother Mother, The Beatles, Billy Joel, Daft Punk, and Anything Classical, or Musicals. How about yourself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, poetry?! Nice! Let's see, currently, I'm reading two biographies (You caught me in one of my non-fiction moods!). One is The Wright Brothers by David McCullough, and the other is Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow. Yes, I'm addicted to the new Hamilton musical...but I have a feeling it's not as big in Canada ha! As far as movies...hmm, I haven't really had much time to go see any new ones in theaters, but two of my all time favorites are The Imitation Game, and Interstellar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sci-Fi and Beer? Yes please! What part of Canada? I'm originally from NY and used to visit Toronto all the time. I'm now living in the midwest USA so I don't ever visit our friendly neighbors to the north anymore. I'm looking for a snail-mail pen pal as well! I'm a big music and book nerd. I've been a classical pianist for almost my whole life, and reading is my BIGGEST passion. (I even turned a room of my house into a library!). I'd love to talk books and films with you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well hello there! Let me first start by saying I'm a 27 year old male with almost identical interests as yourself. I'm a classical pianist, love literature of all eras, own a 1930's typewriter which I use quite often to spark my creativity, have a weak spot for musical theater, and almost double majored in English and Philosophy. (Currently working on my second degree...Physics with a minor in Math). I'm looking for a snail mail pen-pal that I can handwrite (or use my typewriter!) to on a regular basis. I love talking books, philosophy, science, music. I'm also a hopeless romantic. So there's that. PS, I'm also a fellow INFP. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Translation differences in From the Earth to the Moon by Jules Verne </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-31 23:21:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, a little information about me: I read physical copies of books during the day, and the ebook at night, in bed. Recently though, while reading From the Earth to the Moon, I started out reading my Bantam Classics edition physically, and when I went to read the ebook, I noticed it was COMPLETELY different. Literally every sentence is written much differently, some parts are completely omitted, and some seem like they were added. I can tell that the ebook is the original translation (i.e. they mention the War of the Rebellion as opposed to the newer translation listing it as The Civil War). 

Anyway, the point of this rant...what is your opinion on something like this? Have you run across translations where the ebook is completely different than the physical copy? I feel like I'm reading two different books when I go between them and it sucks! </TEXT>
