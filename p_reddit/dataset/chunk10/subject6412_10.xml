	<TEXT> My father worked for many years as a segment producer for Chicago's WGN-TV's Nine O'Clock News during the 80's and some of the 90's. Of course he has all sorts of stories, some of them quite funny. Most of them I heard quite often growing up, like the one about the drunk newsman who couldn't read the teleprompter or that time their field reporter wouldn't stop cursing because he thought the mic was broken (it wasn't).

I loved these stories. They were like hearing about a real life Ron Burgandy and his crew. But there was one story he would never speak about. My twin brother and I weren't even born when it happened, so obviously I don't remember it at all. But years later when we were at a Christmas Eve party for the station, somebody got drunk at the bar and started shouting over and over and it turned into quite the commotion.

He was shouting about The Max Headroom Incident.

Sure, I was only 8 at the time of the party, but I had never seen a room full of jovial, drunk professionals get quiet so fast. Even after the crowd completely dialed down, the guy kept shouting at the bar. He even sounded angry and his eyes had begun to tear up.

"Tell 'em! Tell 'em Al, tell 'em what happened!"

Al was my father and it took me quite some time to even realize that was who the man was addressing. In an instant, my father looked exhausted, his usually dark, gaunt eyes looking even more tired and deep set than usual.

As the crowd watched without saying a word, my father gathered up me, my brother and my mom and slowly walked out of the building. The ride home was eerily quiet as the snow drifted over the city. Years and years later, I found out the drunk guy at the bar was fired the day after Christmas and never heard from again.

To be honest, after that incident, I never really thought about it again (a heaping pile of presents with a brand new N64 nestled in the middle the following morning certainly helped). But recently, my father's health hasn't been too hot and so these old stories about the station have become and more and more treasured as his memory began to falter.

My brother and I came home for Thanksgiving dinner and he was telling his usual, favorite story (the cursing newsman) when suddenly his eyes went wide and he began to mutter under his breath.

"...he didn't get fired for that, funny enough... he didn't get fired until after Christmas..."

And then it all came flooding back, the memory of that Christmas party having been blocked by hours of Shadows of the Empire and Mario 64 the following morning.

My mother suddenly looked very concerned as she took my father's arm and walked him over to the nearby couch. He rested his head back and my brother and I sat down in the love seat on the opposite end of the living room.

"The Max Headroom Incident," I quietly said, afraid I might spook my father by bringing back more bad memories.

"Quiet," my mother said to me in a gentle, though very forceful tone.

"It's okay," my father said, waving his hand weakly in my mother's direction. "It's okay," he repeated. "It's time they knew."

Now for clarity's sake, I am going to tell the rest of this story exactly as it was told to my brother and I, weird bits and all.

For those that aren't aware, The Incident in question occurred on the night of November 22, 1987. Twice during the night, WGN's signal was hijacked by a guy in a Max Headroom mask (again, 1987). The first incident was during the 9 o'clock news and only lasted a moment. The second intrusion occurred later that evening on the sister channel WTTW during a rerun of Doctor Who and went for a full 90 seconds.

It was... [weird](https://youtu.be/tWdgAMYjYSs) to say the least. And to this day, nobody knows for sure who pulled the (highly illegal) stunt off.

My father's story began directly after the first intrusion. Dan Roan, a good friend of my father's and WGN's premiere sports anchor, was recounting the highlights of an earlier baseball game when the interruption occurred. 

Viewers could just make out the surreal image of Max Headroom's smiling visage before cutting out after only a few seconds. Dan even made a little quip right after.

The public knows this. The news broadcast wrapped up and that was that. 

What the public doesn't know is that Dan left the studio immediately after wrapping his segment. His nose began to bleed and his he claimed his head was pounding. A few of the stage producers also began to suffer minor ill effects, mostly just headaches and stiff neck joints.

As my father tells it, nobody made the connection. Why would they? It was nearing the holidays, everybody was stressed to begin with. A few headaches and a nose bleed (once more, 1987) were nothing to overthink in the newsroom.

So the night went on.

That evening, my father had to work late, just some extra paperwork, nothing major. However, he was more stressed than usual as my mother and him had been trying to make a baby for the past year but to no avail (a low sperm count that unfortunately my brother and I inherited). 

Being quite the sci-fi nerd, and looking to loosen up a little, he chose to do his extra work in the broadcast booth so he could watch the Doctor Who reruns that WTTW would air at 11:00.

WTTW was a sister network that would bounce off of WGN's signal to broadcast across their own channel. The studio itself was located directly below WGN's, so if they weren't filming live original content, it was essentially WGN's job to broadcast whatever old sitcom or soap that was on the docket while their own main channel was on standby.

That night, there were only three people in the booth. My father, an editor working on an outtake reel for the company Christmas party and the editor's assistant, a young female student from the University of Chicago's then brand new film program.

It was business as usual until around 11:10, my father was hit with the sudden urge to use the bathroom. Really he just wanted to finish his work, finish the episode and go home, holding in nature's call until then. 

But, and again this is how he told it, his eyes baring that same tired gaunt, faraway stare that I saw at the Christmas party all those years ago, something within him just told him he had to get up and go right at that very moment. Something deep and primal that raised the hairs on his arms and neck.

Excusing himself, he left the room and returned at 11:17. What he came back to can only be described as a nightmare.

The editor was dead, his head forced backwards at an impossible angle, his arms and legs splayed out as if he were hit by an incredible, physical force. Blood was leaking from his eyes and nose and absolutely pouring out of his mouth like a faucet.

Before my father could even react, he took notice of the assistant. Her jaw was touching the floor while the rest of her body spasmed with a violent force so strong framed pictures were falling from the wall.

My father approached her. As he told it, it was not until he was practically on top of her that he realized she was speaking. 

Apparently it wasn't until later, the initial shock still so strong, that he realized she was speaking in tongues. Never a religious man, as my father said this last part his hand waved before his face dismissively as if he still didn't believe it.

Like the editor, the young woman also began to heave out torrential waterfalls of crimson brown blood on the floor before her. As this happened, she was still trying to speak. She only stopped when she wretched up her own tongue, having seemingly bit it off during her convulsions.

She collapsed immediately afterwards, dead.

When my father was done speaking, my brother and I could only sit back in the love seat. My mother nervously fidgeted, staring at the floor. After a long moment of silence, my brother finally stammered out the inevitable:

"Wh... what happened next?"

"A lot," my father answered.

Shaking, not even aware of the broadcast intrusion that had occurred while he was in the bathroom, my father walked backwards out of the room. In the hallway, one of the overnight janitors stopped working as he saw the look of pale fright on my father's face.

"Don't go in there," my father managed to mutter between his chattering teeth. "Don't go in there."

Just as he said this, the midnight news anchor limped his way out of the studio, clutching his head, his nose gushing blood.

"Did you see it!?" he was shouting. "Goddamnit, did you fucking see it!?"

Before my father had time to respond, the doors on the opposite end of the hall burst open. Within seconds, the entire hall was full of official looking men-

"Official looking men?" I couldn't help but ask.

"Official looking men," my father repeated. "And one woman."

A peculiar woman apparently. Very tall and athletic looking, awkwardly strutting through the door after the official looking men on a pair of garish high heels. 

As the men wordlessly marched past my father and the anchor and into the control booth, the woman stopped and introduced herself as a doctor.

"What... what happened?" my father managed to ask.

She stopped for a moment, seemingly thinking, choosing her words carefully.

"A slight miscommunication, actually. They found some old rerun and thought we'd like to see more," she answered. "We think it was mostly an accident."

She laughed. "Mostly," she repeated through a queer grin.

"'They'... 'we'..." my father stammered, repeating the doctor's words. The woman reached out and touched his shoulder, trying to comfort him. 

"What the fuck!? What the fuck!?" the anchor was screeching maniacally behind the woman. She just rolled her eyes and moved her free arm towards my father. He felt a slight pinch on his side and immediately lost consciousness.

After that, there was nothing. When my father awoke, he was all alone, laying on a couch in the break room. The janitor and anchor were gone and there was seemingly not another soul in the entire building.

"Did you go back into the control room?" my brother practically demanded.

"Clean. Bone dry, no bodies. And completely and utterly clean," my father immediately answered, expecting the question.

My father drove home in a daze. My mother chimed in here, saying she knew the moment he got home, something was terribly wrong, but just couldn't get it out of him.

The janitor was never seen again. The anchor resurfaced a week later, at first saying he had no knowledge of what had happened.

"But he remembered," my father recalled. "He remembered, especially when he drank."

As he said this, he practically spat on the floor.

"And you didn't... you didn't say anything at all?" I asked quietly.

"I didn't know where to even start. I inquired to the station manager, our lead anchor, even wrote a letter to the studio head. I didn't even say exactly what happened, unsure if they would try to put me in the nut house. They knew about the intrusion of course, the whole city did. But the answer was always the same:

"'Yeah, that Max Headroom thing... that was weird, huh?'

"Just like that. All three of them."

The living room was once more trounced in silence.

"That doctor... did you ever see the woman again?" my brother asked.

"No. No, thank god. But I did receive a letter not too long after the whole thing. I burned it."

"What did it say?" my brother and I nearly shouted at the exact same time.

My father sat up from the couch, sweat beading across his pale forehead. Slowly, he walked across the living room, towards the stairs leading to his bedroom. As he crossed by my mother, she reached out and lovingly took his hand. He kissed the top of her knuckles and walked upstairs.

"What did it say?" I repeated once my father was out of ear shot, whispering through my clenched jaw.

My mother sighed and looked at me and my brother.

"'In nine months, your wife will give birth-'"

"What?"

"It's what the letter said," she continued in a low whisper. "'In nine months, your wife will give birth. Probably twins. Probably a side effect. It's in your best interest to raise them accordingly.'"

She stopped, sighing once more, staring at the ceiling as she repeated the last line of the letter:

"'You're welcome.'" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, but it would be nice to see a shout out or two given to films that aren't strictly dramatic, historical or tragic.

I know there have been some exceptions (Dark Knight, Return of the King) and some misguided attempts to be inclusive (Avatar)... but I feel there could be way more done to give credit where credit is due. </TEXT>
