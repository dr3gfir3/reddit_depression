	<TEXT> I named my horse Roach, too! As soon as it asked me to name my horse I heard "C'mon, Roach" echo inside my head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Horrible texter here. So, I'm horrible at responding to text messages if it's just general conversation because I'm typically busy at work or I flat out forget. That being said, if it's something important (like your question) I will respond in a timely matter. The fact that he responded to the watch question and not the following question is significant though because he clearly dodged the question. The only way this will get figured out is through conversation. I'd recommend seeing if he'd like to meet up to grab coffee or food and try and talk it out there. However, if the communication is still spotty after asking him to grab coffee or if he just doesn't respond/cancels I would take that as a sign that he's not willing to put forth the effort. Hoping for the best, OP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This^ Highly recommend both although I did enjoy the book more than the movie. I think this line in the book is explained more thoroughly than in the movie. But definitely watch the movie if you haven't!  </TEXT>
