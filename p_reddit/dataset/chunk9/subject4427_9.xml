	<TEXT> There are a few ways to tell. The first is to look for dots next to the [serial number](http://ourmoments.org/secret-code-to-tell-if-nikon-gear-is-refurbished/):

The next is to see how many shots are on the shutter. Take a [picture and upload](https://www.camerashuttercount.com/) to check. 

Where did you buy it from?

	<TEXT> You wouldn't happen to be using Lexar SD cards would you? I had a similar issue with my D5100, but it only occurred with  Lexar SD cards and not SanDisk. I thought the SD card reader was going but changing the cards seemed to work. I have no idea why.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Heavy/ prog rock album with Venetian doctor on the cover </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello, I heard a heavy/ prog rock album playing at a music store. When I asked the guy working behind the counter what it was,  he told me the name of the band and showed me the cover. I thought to myself; "I'm smart, of course I'll remember the name." Well I didn't. I do remember the album cover had a Venetian doctor, I believe, in a dark circle, on it. I think it was a newer album (2013+). This might be a long shot but any guesses would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>
