	<TEXT> Definitely. The actions taken by Trump, his admin, the GOP, and the people that have been fighting to be seen with Trump, it's something that I only have ever seen from those in control of 3rd World Countries. 

It's disturbing because it represents a devolution from the norm in how US politics, politicians, and power mongers operate.

Whereas before the impact and influence of these people are at least curbed since they also had that invisible line that represents what is acceptable and therefore should not be seen as crossing, that line has since faded if not totally erased. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fuck a year minimum of Trump then. There's gotta be at least a handful of decent people in the GOP - it's hard to believe that the events and decisions this week alone still isn't enough to trigger moral outrage from those few. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kinda doubt that immigrants were the cause of these. These were already happening before they came. Do immigrants exacerbate these? It can be argued. It can also be argued that they could help. To wholesale blame them as the cause, is just shortsighted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is fucking massive. But massive doesn't even begin to describe it. And then you start thinking, there is this space that holds this blackhole where it is just one of unknown number - this must be what they mean when they say that "...you will not be able to withstand the glory of the sight of God." - beyond rationality. </TEXT>
