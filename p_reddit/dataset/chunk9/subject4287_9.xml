	<TEXT> Engineering degrees are easier to get employed off of than science or arts degrees.

Still, you can get a good paycheck being a plumber without all the education. There aren't a lot of jobs out there just to do chemistry, and even those will be replaced by automation before you would retire.

It's better to find something you actually care about than just something arbitrary though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was basically in your shoes 10 years ago.  I actually only applied to engineering at one school out of all the programs that I applied to.  It was probably the best decision I ever made though, because there was a really good coop program where you could go and work in different industries and see what you liked.  

So I did oil   gas, automotive, pharmaceuticals, etc.  You quickly figure out what you're interested in and what you're not.  I actually moved out to Calgary and worked for a few years after I graduated too.  I eventually decided I wanted to do something a little more on the frontier of science, so I went back and I've since been researching ways to improve a class of protein-based cancer therapies.  

The point is, you want to do something that will keep as many doors open as possible so you can figure out what you actually like.  

Also, do an exchange term if you get a chance, go to Japan or Germany or somewhere, I really missed the boat on that.

Also, don't get a science degree unless you're passionate about getting into research and academia (no offense to any science majors reading). </TEXT>

So, I ended up taking Solid State Physics and Molecular Beam Epitaxy for quantum nano devices.  So like semiconductors and transistors and I'm just sitting there like [that dog from that meme](http://imgur.com/ChzUb), "I have no idea what I'm doing"

	<TEXT> It must be different... I can't imagine there being enough diluent available to move regular bitumen from Alberta to the gulf coast.  

Bitumen is a pretty all encompassing term, there must be some pre-treatment involved, but probably not full-out upgrading.  I looked up a couple papers after my first comment, which said that it is common to use some special alloys and polyurethane coating to extend the lifespan of the line.  However, I recall hearing about pipeline-sections that had to be replaced in a matter of months out there, and that's just not realistic for a continent-spanning pipeline (I would think anyway).

Garneau wasn't the greatest politician, but he seemed to have a pretty decent resume in terms of military, engineering PhD, critic for foreign affairs. Plus the astronaut thing really would have played well to the general public I think.

Maybe it would have been easier to teach him to be charismatic than to teach Trudeau everything else. </TEXT>

The idea of Justin out at an international event dealing with Putin, or working out a trade deal with China... I don't see it.

He actually seemed like he was having fun the first few times I saw him. I think he's lost that a bit since the CF18s comment and his gradual withdrawal from speaking his mind.

	<TEXT> IMHO, whether or not they occurred at low points they were a reflection of character, and not necessarily even positive character, but a willingness to be adversarial and put up a fight.

Politics is about a conflict of ideas and ideologies, and it takes a certain toughness to be a leader and take a stand. Any time you watch Mulcair in QP, the guy is not taking no for an answer, he won't be cowed. 

To quote Gene Hackman, "It's about putting a brick through the other guy's windshield. I'm talking about taking it out and chopping it up." 

Maybe Trudeau is rope-a-doping right now and this is all strategy... After all, if the CPC redirect all their resources at Mulcair and he comes out swinging fast enough to win people over, he'll come out on top. However, I don't think politics works quite like boxing, it's an awfully big risk to run a campaign of blandness with the hope that you'll be too boring to criticize.

Also, thanks for the pun compliment. :) </TEXT>

Justin should've stuck to his guns, wilting and walking off with his tail between his legs just made him look weak to all the voters that were ready to give him a chance.  

Sometimes you say fuddle duddle, or give a guy a Shawinigan handshake.  Being a Liberal is about grit, that's what liberal voters respond to.  It's pretty heartbreaking watching the LPC over-manage Justin and basically ruin his potential as a politician.  

Even his most recent announcement about tax cuts for the middle class was like watching someone doped up on Valium.  No passion, just some soulless script...

	<TEXT> I'm not really surprised by everything that's going on with the Liberals.  Trudeau has let himself and the liberals appear really boring over the last 6 months.  Pretty much ever since the "whipping out our CF18s" comment.  

He needs to accept that he's going to occasionally say things that don't play well in the media and get over it.  The liberals can't run a campaign on "Let's go back to 10 years ago".  They need to have new vibrant ideas like kicking all the senators out of caucus, continue to take risks and own the centre.  

It's not about filing a giant policy platform that the average voter won't read, it's about injecting some healthy populism and criticism of the current administration and offering a better vision of the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For an analysis piece, this seems to lack any real cohesive point.  However, one related aspect that would be interesting to consider is that we're moving towards an economy where conventional labour is disappearing and the concept of a 'job' and livelihood is shifting.  

Some jobs remain in high demand today, including many trades, but it's not crazy to assume that in the next 10 years an effective welding robot will emerge, or that most construction will be conducted by prefabricating and assembling the components in place.  "Disruptive" technology has already become an irritating though accurate buzzword to describe many other economic sectors that are getting upended. 

I don't want to sound like an Isaac Asimov book report, but the reality is that we're approaching a time where the greatest human commodity will be creativity and enormous resources will be available to make whatever we desire.  Companies and ventures will still exist, but like Larry Smith's point in the article, the only thing anyone will bother working for are the things they really care about.

I don't imagine some dystopia where jobs have disappeared and where we all live in poverty with no money, but rather a future where resources to do anything are in such large supply that the cost of doing them is minute, and as a result whatever you want to do, you literally can go do.  

It's difficult to imagine, especially considering that poverty continues to exist unabated today, but I like to think Canada could lead the way in shifting towards supporting smaller cheaper ventures with a better social safety net, and less reliance on trying to hang on to big companies that employ thousands of "workers".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's this classic movie from 1939 called "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" starring Jimmy Stewart made by Frank Capra, great movie. It popularized the whole idea of filibustering in the US Senate.  The main character is this guy who gets appointed to fill the seat of a deceased US Senator.  He's not a politician, just a normal guy, but he stands by his convictions to make sure some bad legislation doesn't happen.

Regarding Trudeau, people don't expect him to be brilliant (visionary), but generally speaking think he's a good guy that will stand up for what he believes in, like multiculturalism, justice, etc.

I don't think he can pull off visionary statesman, but he can pull off a bit of justified firebrand populism.  Don't just claim to fight for the middle class, fight for all Canadians, and not with some nebulous rhetoric. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   It has nothing to do with technology. Governments are the most democratic when they are closer to the people.

I'm all in favour of municipal level politics remaining local, but I would argue that the size of our country coupled with the how small our population is is an excellent reason why ridings make little sense as a basis of government when we're all more connected online.  

At a federal level, I have much more in common constituently with /u/Borror0 or /u/palpz even though they're on opposite sides of the country than my neighbours that I've never met or associated with.  

The entire /r/CanadaPolitics subreddit is a reasonably sized and arguably more representative community to exercise federal representation than some arbitrarily drawn geographical basis.

Some rural areas might still exercise a geographical representation given the choice, but by and large Canadian citizens are more connected by other mechanisms than where they happen to live. </TEXT>

The border has definitely gotten out of control, hopefully that at least gets improved in the next five years.

However, if someone can make shit cheaper, then I don't think we should be making it.  There in is the question for the future of the Canadian economy, what is a production area that we can remain economically viable for in the global economy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The best way to do that is through the investment of government dollars in public goods. Rather than spending on often poorly targeted subsidies, instead we should make investments in our cash starved universities, daycare/early childhood education, and improved care for chronic mental and physical illnesses.

I really like this idea, though I would include the idea of broadening the mandate of libraries.  Public libraries are already essential community tools for helping people reeducate and return to the workforce.  However, as electronic media becomes more ubiquitous, the focus of libraries can change to include concepts like hackerspaces for developing new ideas and technologies outside of universities.  Several countries are already [moving in this direction](http://www.npr.org/2011/12/10/143401182/libraries-make-room-for-high-tech-hackerspaces). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting, so would you say that the current SCC spends a greater proportion of its time on modern legislation than previous courts? This is perhaps more related to the challenges that are brought to it, but I'd be curious whether a lot of pre-Charter low hanging fruit has already been taken care of, such that now the SCC is caught up and focuses a greater amount of time on legislation as it is being passed by parliament. 

The latter would mean that even the next administrations will face greater scrutiny of their policy, and it's little to do with the current government.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The cause of the loss of manufacturing in Canada is kind of a moot point, and an excuse to point fingers at the West, as though they shouldn't be trying to extract and produce their resources.  

I would prefer to see an article on potential directions that manufacturing in Quebec and Ontario could go.  It seems like most of the big investment to date has been in propping up flagging industries that were ultimately leaving anyway.  Canada is a developed economy, if we don't want to be replaced by developing countries who are advancing their own manufacturing capabilities, we have to have an eye to the next decade, not the previous one. </TEXT>

CHAPPiE was actually pretty good! It didn't feel disorganized, I was emotionally connected to the characters. I caught some of the subtext that Chappie was a foil for every person who comes into this world. Plus, I liked where it went, it wasn't totally formulaic, and the action was good.

	<TEXT> I really thought this would be a different article from the title.  The entrepreneurship scene can definitely be a bit of a cult, with people drowning in their own Koolaid like they've joined a pyramid scheme.  I've personally known people to pitch ideas for startups that sound great, win a bunch of money, and then roll-up the company like con-artists disappearing to enjoy their free lunch.  Or worse, the concept defies the laws of physics and none of the judges dolling out money have a highschool level understanding of thermodynamics.

Those are some negatives of the entrepreneurship culture going on in Canada and elsewhere.

The positives are it's an enormously rewarding education even if your venture doesn't get off the ground.  I've seen several small groups of people start with a problem and conceive a relatively clever solution and a few years later their team is tripled, they have operating capital, and they've made something cool and useful that people are willing to pay for.  In good faith trying to scale a solution to a real world problem.  Even if it hasn't gotten off the ground, they notice a different problem, build a new team, and iterate their knowledge, avoiding the mistakes they made the first time.  Investing in that sort of education in Canada isn't a waste of money, it pays dividends in metrics that are still being conceived.

Entrepreneurship is risky in the sense that you don't have the kind of income security that lets you pay down a mortgage, makes you worried about getting married, or trying to have a family.  But honestly, there's a generation of people now who don't feel that sense of security in a regular job anyway.  With a feeling like there isn't much to lose, I think Canada is heading for a very innovative time for startups provided they don't all leave to America because all the investors here are chickenshit scared to be the first to sign a term sheet. </TEXT>

2. There can only be seven Chandrian, therefore when there are rumors early in the story of a 'new' Chandrian, this is actually Denna who has fully joined Haliax's team and gone to the dark side after Kvothe kills Cinder.


3. Kvothe is ultimately able to open his thrice-locked chest with the help of Auri, who understands seemingly inanimate objects so intimately that she's the only who who is able to make it 'right' so that is will open.

I've often felt that one of the benefits of first-past-the-post was that its tendency towards majority governments at least provided for a lot of legislation to be passed, unlike PR legislatures that suffer more gridlock appeasing several parties at once.

However, if the ease of passing legislation means we must wait for legal challenges from private citizens and the courts to remove poorly conceived laws (i.e. unconstitutional legislation), then I don't know if I wouldn't support moving to a more PR system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much.  Plus, shale oil does not yield high production long term.  The US is temporarily a major exporter of oil gas.  Alberta has a much longer-term supply.  The question is whether prior to the drop in US production energy alternatives will rise enough to yield a long term 'drop' in oil prices.  

If Alberta can get it's pipelines down in time for when the price of oil  likely rises again, it will have a fairly sustainable revenue stream from harvesting bitumen IMHO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, PM me after Christmas if you're still interested, I think my housemate is going to try it with me and split the bill. (economies of scale for the win)

I assume you also started off with this website - [DIY Soylent](http://diy.soylent.me/) - that /u/WhyAmISuchAJerk already posted one recipe from in this thread, and there are about a hundred specifically Canadian recipes on there to date it looks like. 

Most of the recipes have fewer than 15 ingredients total, and they cover your basics: protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals

The fewer the total ingredients, the better **$/day** (generally)

My goal is to start with a fairly basic recipe just to start out and then find some decent flavors to work in.  I've heard mixing with coffee is okay for breakfast, but I wouldn't mind trying one with a frozen fruit component (since frozen fruit is relatively cheap, flavourful and lasts).

I am curious whether there's a way to make hot meals with soylent that won't be completely gross...

	<TEXT>  Professional assessment of each clinical situation should be based on guidelines developed in light of up-to-date evidence-based data. Until such consensual guidelines are developed, the Commissioner believes that clinics should adopt a moratorium on IVF for women over the age of 42 who wish to use their own eggs. This age limit was proposed by an expert committee in Ontario and is already used in a number of clinics in Qubec.

Interesting, so because professional guidelines have not yet been released to physicians the province wants to try and pass legislation?

Seems a little heavy-handed... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never understand why governments attempt to legislate this sort of thing instead of simply reaching out to the professional regulatory body for physicians (Collge des mdecins du Qubec) to follow recommended practices for this sort of thing. 

If practitioners in the majority of cases agree to follow a guideline not to perform certain medical procedures given certain conditions, that's a much simpler way to handle this than trying to pass laws to the same effect.

	<TEXT> I really hope this movement can get off the ground.  There are so many technological opportunities for carbon capture and storage.  A carbon economy would really drive a lot of interesting engineering R D and innovation that if other nations follow suit on policy, Canada can become a major exporter of these technologies.  

I hope in the next five years Canadians will be looking at carbon as an opportunity and not as some unnecessary burden that will hobble our economy. </TEXT>

I was thinking about this too, what could possibly lure Harper into thawing relations before the election? All that came to mind was if Ontario had some big crisis that required the federal government to step in.  Maybe if there's a really bad snow storm... Or if the ON economy takes tumble...

	<TEXT> I think /u/Borror0 is correct, Harper can meet with a few other premiers to soften the story, and with the tax-cuts and budget-surplus coming out in the new year, he'll probably come out better than if he met with her and let the Liberals control the message in Ontario for another cycle. 

Plus, it would make him look like he's capitulating after the news stories.  I'd be surprised if he meets with Wynne or even has a phone call with her before the next election.  

Wynne is figuratively a can of worms right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plenty of good points.  Meeting with Wynne is a no-win situation for Harper.  Continuing to ignore her might come with its own set of problems over time, but how often can the media report a lack of communication as a political story before people move on to something more exciting.

There's an election coming up, no sense giving ammunition to the opposition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in complete agreement. Frankly, if we have agriculture we can have solar. We don't need giant solar farms, distributed power generation is a better model, especially in Canada where we're already so sparsely populated.

Frankly, I think solar innovation is advancing so rapidly that ironically there's actually a disincentive to investing in solar, because it will so rapidly become obselete.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's unfair at all to consider renewables as competition to conventional forms of power generation. In Canada, solar is less impressive simply due to our latitude. However, there's still plenty of room for innovation in wind, geothermal, etc.

Also, while not strictly 'renewable' nuclear energy is rapidly becoming a very interesting area of innovation, with thorium and also U-238.

Personally, I'd like to see petroleum gradually become more of a materials industry rather than an energy industry. </TEXT>

Non-equatorial tethers for space elevators are actually quite advantageous because they avoid space debris and already heavily occupied geosynchronous orbits. They also avoid much of the more intense radiation of the Van Allen belts. </TEXT>

Difficult to prohibit partisanship depending on the responsibilities the GG will have.  

If the GG maintains its current responsibilities, I would almost suggest that the GG be replaced entirely by the Supreme Court of Canada.  That way they can simply veto legislation that is not constitutional without waiting for legal challenges. </TEXT>
