	<TEXT> I'm aware as coming off a desperate. That's why I never initiate with messages . and when we hangout it just kinda happens. I just don't like the fact that when I hangout with her i feel like I'm on cloud 9 :/ even tho she mentions how she finds other people attractive while we hangouts or talks to me about her crushes. 
It makes me feel like a cuck but I Dont know how to change that  </TEXT>
