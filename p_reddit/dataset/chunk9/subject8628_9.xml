I meant what I wrote. I hated it. There were many factors for m to do that. It was the first 3d movie I went to. I use a pair of eyeglasses and had to take them off to watch the movie. After first few minutes, I couldn't bear it and put the my glasses on again. And it was a drown the drain experience from there. 

I'll clarify why I switched sides. I had seen Alien back in the 90's when I was a kid and didn't recall all of it. 

It was only a couple of months after my Prometheus 3D experience that I read something about it online and saw Alien again thereby noticing and connected the dots as I said.

Since then this is one of the movies I love to watch. I may not watch all of it but I do watch many of its sequences.

	<TEXT> Just putting the facts as they come to my mind:

1. There are numerous scenes in Prometheus with direct similarity between the two movies. The most important one being the engineer shown sitting in both movies.

Engineer in Alien:

Engineer in Prometheus

2. The spaceship  shown in Alien is same as the one David and Dr. Shaw fly at the end of Prometheus.

3. Prometheus happens in 2093 and Alien happens in 2122. Some 30 years after. This suggests nothing solid just the fact that the the ship shown in Alien is a brother ship of the one that flies out in the end in Prometheus. The alien ship in Alien was piloted by one of many engineers who died or may have been overtaken by his cargo and thats that.


4. The black liquid that the engineer drinks in beginning of the Prometheus later appears when the main characters land on LV-223, and enter the chamber. And the chamber itself is VERY similar to the egg silo of Alien.


5. Alien is set on LV-426, Prometheus is set on LV-223.  Given the way logical naming convention works, LV would generally denote planetary bodies or moons in a local cluster / same galaxy, distance between which maybe easily travelelled in a span of 30 years.

	<TEXT> This is the first movie I ever saw in 3D. I hated it. But then I saw it again and connected the dots with the Alien storyline. Ever since then this has been one of my most watched movie ever. I love it and have been waiting for the sequel. Can't wait for Covenant. </TEXT>
