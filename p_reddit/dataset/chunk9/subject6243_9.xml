	<TEXT> OOH let m kno how it goes. Little tip, kneading with hot water really helps. And mix the water slowly into the dough. If it's too sticky, rolling it out will be a nightmare. And make sure the girdle is hot enough. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Ingredients** 

Whole wheat flour	3 cups 

Oil	1 tablespoon 

Sugar	1 teaspoon 

Salt	as required 

Hot water	as required 

***For stuffing*** 

Boiled and peeled Potato	1/2 cup 

Cooked Green peas	1/2 cup 

Garlic paste	1/4 teaspoon 

Finely chopped onion	2 tablespoons 

Chopped green chilies	1/2 teaspoon 

Turmeric powder	1/4 teaspoon 

Aamchur(dried Mango Powder)	1/4 teaspoon 

Salt	as required 

**Steps** 

Take the whole wheat flour in a wide bowl. Add the oil, sugar and salt. Pour hot water into this mix and knead till a smooth dough is formed. Be careful while pouring the water. 

Pour small quantities so you know you won't end up adding too much, making the dough sticky. 

Mash together, cooked green peas and boiled potatoes. Add the garlic paste, finely chopped onions, turmeric powder, aamchur and salt. Mix well. 

Take the dough and divide it into 12 equal sized balls. Roll out one of them, but make sure to not make this too thin. Keep aside. 

Roll out a second one in the same fashion. Take one roti. Place the aloo mattar mix and flatten on it . 

Place the second roti on top. press and seal the edges. 

Roll it out again fully. 

Heat a tawa/girdle. 

Place the rolled paratha on it and flip till both sides are cooked. Add some butter if you want and serve hot with some yoghurt and pickle. 

Repeat with the remaining dough.

**Note:** 
You can pick up all the spices in asian supermarkets. If you don't find Aamchur, that's fine. What it does it give a nice tangy flavour. Instead you can add some lemon juice to the mashed mixture.

	<TITLE> Indian Chicken Curry Simmered In a Tea Sauce </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-30 10:36:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Ingredients** 

Curry Cut Chicken(Skinless pieces of whole chicken)	1 kg 

Onions (medium sized)	3 

Tomatoes (medium sized)	2 

Ginger paste	2 teaspoons 

Garlic paste	2 teaspoons 

Black tea	1/2 cup 

Oil	2 teaspoons 

Cloves	2-3 

Cinnamon	1 inch 

Fenugreek seeds	3-4 

Coriander powder	3 teaspoons 

Red chili powder	2 teaspoons 

Kasuri methi(Dried fenugreek leaves)	2 teaspoons 

Salt	as required 

***For Marinade*** 

Whey	 3 cups 

Red chili powder	2 teaspoons 

Turmeric powder	1 teaspoon 

Lemon juice	2 tablespoons 

Salt	as required 

***For garnish***

Oil	2 teaspoons 

Onion	1 

Sugar	1 teaspoon 

Salt	as required 

**Steps** 

1. Clean the chicken pieces thoroughly. Take all the ingredients of the marinade, mix it together and pour over the chicken. Rub it into the chicken pieces and refrigerate for 4 hours. For the people who are wondering what whey is, it's the water that collects on top of curd/yogurt. If you don't have whey, simply drain the youghurt into a mislin cloth and use the water that collects. 

2. Chop the onions and the tomatoes. 

3. Heat 2 teaspoons of oil in a wok/kadhai. 

4. Fry the cloves, cinnamon and fenugreek till the aromas are released. Add the onions into this. Saute till they become transparent. 

5. Add the tomatoes. When the tomatoes are half cooked, add the ginger and garlic paste. allow to cook till the raw smell leaves. 

6. Add the dry spices and cook till the oil is released from them. 

7. Now add the chicken pieces along with the marinade, add the tea and kasuri methi, cook on low till the chicken pieces are done. 

8. The sauce will be a little thin at this point, but that's okay because it will thicken as the curry sits. 

9. Take a pan, heat oil. Add thinly sliced onions and saute on low flame. Then add the sugar and allow the onions to caramelise. 

10. Season with a little salt and top over the chicken curry. Serve hot with rice or flatbreads like  rotis, phulkas or kerala porottas. 

**Note:** 

All the spiced mentioned are available in most asian stores. I used a normal Indian tea. You can get excellent results with chai tea or masala tea also.

	<TEXT> It's a sort of firmer cottage cheese. You can get it in pretty much every asian store. If you don't you can simply drain the cottage cheese using a muslin cloth and use that . And capsicum is green pepper here. You can use red too. It just gives  hit of extra flavour :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for this. What I'm thinking of here are specialised recipe ebooks with a little bit of narrative. In terms of design and layout, we have a professional designer, so that should not be an issue. So mailing lists are the biggest target group for conversion, huh. Would make sense because they would be the engaged readers who find value in the content. Thanks. This really helps!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Guys! I have some questions around ebooks, so hoping it's okay to post here. So I was wondering what kind of download rates one can expect for a paid ebook? ( Is there even a norm around this?) And what would be the better format? PDF? Epub? Just trying to understand the feasibility of an ebook as a monetisation model. Any suggestions/help is greatly appreciated :).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before I answer this, I just want to say upfront that I work with Cucumbertown, which is a food blogging platform. So this is what happens usually. People blog for some time, get a loyal following over that time with a combination of good content and promotion on social media and then they get out an ebook. this way they already have an engaged user base that hey can talk about the ebook. You should check out [this interview](https://magazine.cucumbertown.com/not-yet-3-months-in-and-already-3000-up-the-first-steps-of-monetising-your-food-blog-by-samantha-ebf02209a295) we had done sometime back, where the blogger talks about what she did with ebooks mainly as a way of passive income. In my opinion, it's best to do both. Blog and get an ebook out, because with ebooks, the competition is extremely high, and conversion could be low.  </TEXT>
