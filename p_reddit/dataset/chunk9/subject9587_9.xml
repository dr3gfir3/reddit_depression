	<TEXT> For the steak?
I actually baked it in the same cast that I'd later sear the steak. I made a bed with the onions and put the steak on top so it never touched any part of the cast iron during the bake.

The potatoes I lined a baking sheet with aluminum foil. I only had one baking sheet so I cooked the asparagus by just wrapping it in foil, usually I'd use a baking sheet as well though (and no cover). </TEXT>
