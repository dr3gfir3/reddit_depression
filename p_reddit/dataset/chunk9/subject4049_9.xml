	<TEXT> Yeah I agree, you're wrong. Why are you trying to make me feel as though I'm making a bad decision for wanting to stay instead of leaving? How would you, of all people, know how I feel about my girlfriend when you refuse to empathize with someone with depression? God, what is the point of arguing with people like you? You're someone who gave up. Do you understand that? You tried to help your SOs and when your efforts weren't working you decided to give up, instead of asking questions. Please tell me how your life was so miserable that you had to post shit about "penis injections" in your OC. Dude, let this sink in, WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME LIFE! All I want to do is help my girlfriend. I care about her and  our future together. If you can't understand that then why are you here? </TEXT>

Just because you were weak and couldn't handle problems in your previous relationships doesn't mean I can't handle problems in OUR relationship. All I came here to do was seek advice and you want to make it all about yourself. You dated? Wonderful! Please, keep showering me with shitty dating advice because that is DEFINITELY what I'm looking for. The older I get, the more I realize that there are adults who never gained wisdom with age and you're one of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My girlfriend was diagnosed with clinical depression. After she was told this, she has been way more down than she was before the appointment.

 She's an amazing person that I see myself staying with for a long time. I just don't know how to help her or at least alleviate how she constantly feels. 

I try to get her out of the house or try talking to her and it doesn't seem to help. I really need some advice on how to handle this. </TEXT>

Do I enjoy going down on my SO? Most of the time, yes. But really only because she enjoys it and I love her reactions. Will I do it all the time? No. I really only do it if she has showered and shaved. She holds me to these same standards and I don't have a problem with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lost my Virginity when I was almost 20. I did the stupid thing of sleeping with someone to get it out of the way. It was a terrible experience. I was so nervous I couldn't even get hard. It was like I shut down, but we still went through with it. 

I regretted after because I put so much pressure on myself only to get no real joy in return. 

OP I think the only thing that matters is just getting a girlfriend. Being able to share your first time with someone you care about sounds a lot better. Please don't put too much pressure on yourself. It's not as big of a deal as you think it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole birthday situation you guys went through with him sucks. The same thing happened to me also, but worse.

 Anyways, he handled this situation pretty poorly. If I were in his position, I would attend the party and hangout like any other friend would do. However, I would avoid you. Most people can't handle FWBs, especially guys. But we don't tell you so this kind of relationship doesn't end.

 You text each other all the time even after you hooked up for the first time and you expect him not to start developing more feelings for you? Things changed after you hooked up. If you slept with a random guy, he might try to ask you out and if you reject him then it's not as bad. But you guys were friends and that means more than you think. He's trying to ignore you because of this. At this point, I don't think I could side with either one of you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, I really wish I was in your position. The things you have accomplished are phenomenal to me. I don't know if this is good advice but I'll give it a try.

 When you're in school, many students tend to make friends. But how exactly? Well I realized that many of us make friends through similar activities and school is the most convenient. When you're completely out of school, I'll admit it gets harder to keep relationships. I don't want you to worry about that though. From what you posted, you have everything in order besides more of a social life and you're only 21. If your friends left you because you have everything together, then forget them. True friends stay with you. 

Now, if you can't keep relationships for more than 6 months, it could be because your not that social, maybe due to work (?) or it might be your personality. I hope you don't take offense to that. Maybe it's social anxiety? I've had problems with gfs and friends because of my personality sometimes. I worked through it, but it took a little time. I checked out a lot of local places and went out often and it soon left me more comfortable in these places and got me talking to others. If you're not into that, find a club or a hobby that will involve others around you. Everyone gets lonely. I mean, just imagine a person moving to a new state or country, it's like they have to start over again. Try not to get discouraged,  you have a long road ahead.

 If you want to talk, feel free to PM me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm finishing up CC. Web Development there is really not that great. The school keeps restructuring itself by eliminating, combining or adding courses, especially to the IS and IT departments. They do have C# and Java but that's really it. Also they only have a certificate of specialization in Web Development and I'm not sure if I that matters if I'm going to University. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm a 20 year old college student. I'm thinking about becoming a Web Developer. Is it too late? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-16 20:17:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I started with basic coding languages  (HTML, CSS, JS) when I was about 16-17. I took a pretty long break because I was interested in so many things like Computer Engineering, Computer Science and Physical Therapy. My Godfather is a very successful self-taught Web Developer who never went to college, however this was around the time the Internet was a pretty new thing. This kind of leaves me a bit less confident in finding a career because Web Design has gotten much more popular. I don't remember as much as I did back in High School and I'm a bit confused as to where to start. Any suggestions?

Edit: I appreciate all the responses! The reason why I said, "too late" was only because of me personally. I've been having trouble figuring out what I want to become. Also my friend and I were in the same Web Development classes when we were sophomores in H.S. but he stuck with it...I didn't. I got discouraged because many started early on as I did or earlier. I didn't know anyone who started later in life, so I apologize if I sounded like an idiot. </TEXT>

You can't sympathize with people who have depression because of this, and you're only thinking logically when giving "advice".
