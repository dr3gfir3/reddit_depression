	<TEXT> Russia invented fake news.... even the fact that that tactic of disinfo became such a part of this election is rather suspect. Why was a Russian strategy such a part of this election? [Here's a nice piece on their troll army](https://nyti.ms/1AHZ353), just one small part of their effort to sway narratives to their liking. Note that it was written back in summer 2015, before anything really started cooking.  
  
Another thing to know is that Sweden [is a big target for Russia](https://nyti.ms/2mxAhmp). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what's so funny to me. They're evil.. but not evil geniuses, they're evil morons. They could have ingratiated the public with them (especially after losing the popular) but instead chose war on the media, on intelligence, and on US. All while teaming up with Russia. All while acting petty as all fuck, and just really distasteful and unbecoming of the office. And they've made such a multitude of unforced errors that they're definitely evil... but fortunately totally incompetent, which means less evil gets done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. That's for two reasons: one, I'm just not as fluent in it as I am in other things. two, it's reeeallly hard to put hip hop/rap in a mix that isn't a hip hop rap mix. It really just is too different a vibe, all it's own, that many of those songs I feel break the jive of a mixed-genre playlist. I could be wrong, just my opinion. </TEXT>

This has been here before, but I've since retooled it greatly, and it's almost doubled in length now. There's no hitting every genre mark, and I'm sure I have glaring oversights-- for those failings, I apologize. My general gauge for a good song is it has to move you: either emotionally or physically, on another level.  
  
As always, would love to hear recommendations, playlist recs, or playlist discussion too--  
  
Thanks and have a great day!

	<TEXT> At that time, though, half were also given wearable tech devices that monitored their activity and connected to a website to help provide feedback. All participants were followed for 18 more months.  
  
At the end of the two years, which is pretty long for a weight loss study, those without access to the wearable technology lost an average of 13 pounds. Those with the wearable tech lost an average of 7.7 pounds.  
  
Its hard for many to accept, so Im going to state the results again: Those people who used the wearable tech for 18 months lost significantly less weight than those who didnt.

You know, I wish we could somehow get a Trump on the Democrat side, just to hear how balls to the wall outraged they would get at what he does... just when it's not their guy. The conservative tears would be streaming in a way we've never seen before. They have a guy who is everything they called Obama.... lazy, an embarrassment, weak on everything, a moron. And now they've cheering him on! It's amazing! What if there was a Trump on the left, and they actually had something to grieve about, how nuts would they get? </TEXT>

It's no wonder the_donald peddles so deeeply in memes and distractions, if they had to debate they'd be fucked.

	<TEXT> I agree. He is speaking out strongly, against Trump, but voting as a member of his party. [Watch his remarks in Europe yesterday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNeLmjuMtIU app=desktop) and see what it does to your opinion of the man. Every time he comes up folks bash him on his votes. But, it doesn't seem like that is changing, so if outspokenness is the best we got, I say we take it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I said this before, here's what should be done:  
The town halls should be held/formed anyway. Have them be platforms for individuals to speak out on how the Republican moves/Trump EO's are affecting their lives. A forum for venting. Bring democratic candidates in as well. And create options for folks to sign up to run for office.
