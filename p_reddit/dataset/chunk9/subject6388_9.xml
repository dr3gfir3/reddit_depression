	<TEXT> I know plenty of people say that but I know for sure now. Nobody texts me and I don't easily get replies. Maybe they reply just to be nice. Girls don't reply easily. I have a crush and I get the feeling she has a boyfriend now. She replies me but usually late and we are not good friends either anyway.  
I am piss poor and my dad is an alcoholic. He is so entitled I hate it. I can't get a job and my parents don't give me any money. I hate my existence. No wonder no one likes me. My life simply  sucks and I hate it too so why would anyone else want to be a part of it? I have unfollowed many people on Facebook and after months I opened my instagram and got SO depressed because everyone is having fun and I hate even existing now. Fuck me. </TEXT>

Also, despite thinking about suicide I never acted upon it and I am perceived as a good and kind human being. Feeling a little proud of myself today.

He'd speak for 10 minutes and then change the topic leaving me to keep my thoughts to myself. Now they just want me to pretend I am fine while he's getting married to show his soon to be wife and her family that we are "amazing" people. I just hate it because it is selfishness. Instead of helping me out everyone just says to be "happy" and "shit happens, no one gives a fuck, move on" etc. Well I can't. I am exhausted. It just sucks. I am depressed and at age 19 I am getting bombarded with not only my responsibilities but my older cousins as well because they are such a kid themselves that can't do anything on their own. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My friend is living my dream in front of me </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-25 10:28:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wanted to be a singer(I know every teenager dreams of being a rockstar or a popular singer or a celebrity or something like that). I wanted to be one as well. I happened to become a friend of someone who was also interested in these things. Thing is long story short, I have had a tough life. My dad has been an unemployed, alcoholic, drug-addict, foul mouthed person all his life and obviously I have been quite poor and couldn't afford lots of things. I had to be grateful for even have my basic needs fulfilled. Not to mention on top of all of it I faced lots of abuse and trauma throughout my childhood and teen life.  
However, my friend has had a good life. I always see him happy and smiling. His dad was a government worker and earned lots of money(now retired). He still gets pension and I don't know how much money he must have saved. Nobody talks about that stuff. Again, my friend could afford lots of things as compared to me and never really had any restrictions. He could follow whatever his heart told him to. So he kept practicing singing and mixing mastering. He bought a laptop, a tab, a DSLR, a digital camera before that and everyone has smartphones in their house. Recently he bought an expensive microphone and he has started covering songs that are of good quality.  
I can't help but feel so jealous because I was fucked over for so many years and now I am depressed and hate my life so much and then just in front of me my friend is living my dream. It's like the universe has rubbed salt on my wounds. It makes me even more depressed to see that he might actually make his own dream come true. I know you would say if I had the talent I could become a singer as well. The thing is I accept I don't have a great voice. Even if everything was right in my life I still wouldn't be able to buy talent. Although I have a decent speaking voice(people have told me to become an RJ on a number of occasions) I simply do not have the singing voice.  
My main problem is I have no support network from anywhere now. My parents can't do anything and my relatives keep telling me to get a job and no one will even support my education anymore. I am kinda like on my own now.  
My friend won't help me either. It is his priority to look after himself first. He has explicitly told me that if he doesn't see his own benefit then he won't benefit anyone else which means he won't let me come at his house and record or just play around with microphone because he wants to get famous first.  
I just don't know what to do. If I didn't know him it would have been fine but he is a friend of 6 years and watching him grow makes me feel bad because I was getting fucked over and having suicidal thoughts when he was out there enjoying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But then again you can argue there is no right way to live. What you need at 17 might not be needed at 27 but who is to guarantee that? You never know what your perspective is going to be at a certain age. It is your life experiences and going out in the world that will shape you as a person. In that process you will always make mistakes and will continue to do so. At a certain age you might have your own set of values which are correct from your perception but not from anyone else. So many think they have it "figured out" but that is just not the case. We keep changing and until and unless the situation presents itself to you, you will never know how you're going to respond to them.  
At the end of the day we just have to accept whatever the situation is and go with the flow. This is life. No rules. No guarantees. Just try to do your best and accept you will never know everything. Also, as much as you want to help younger people to not repeat the same mistakes you did, the truth is that one can only learn by his/her experiences. Like I said earlier, no matter what happens you will always have to accept the situation that is there. Do not try to run away from circumstances. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Analogy to understand depression </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-23 13:38:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What does depression feel like? For those who don't understand it well consider this analogy:
Imagine yourself being trapped in a cage. You see others walking around you, you want to join them but you are bound in your cage that is only visible to you not anyone else. Others would wonder why you're like this because they can't see your cage but only you can. You're trapped and as much as you want to break free and join others you can't. 
It's suffocating to be trapped but you alone cannot get out of it. Depression feels like a trap and you cannot simply snap out of it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These days I am so overwhelmed and anxious that I don't breathe  for seconds. My heartbeat runs fast and my throat is always dry. My hands are shaky and I feel my brain is damaged. Perks of years of abuse and trauma. Sometimes I notice that I am not breathing and then have to make a conscious effort of breathing.  
I remember I used to get made fun of for being obese and to hide my fat I used to pull my stomach in and hold my breath so that people wouldn't make fun of my obesity. Funny thing is I wasn't that obese just a little but it was a big deal because my brother and cousin were athletic. It's a shame that most of the shaming came from them and my family and few friends.  
Maybe from there I got this habit of holding my breath. Anyway, well, I am so out of energy and I don't breath well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I don't know what to believe anymore. I would like to be positive and all that but everything I do or plan to do with friends turns out as a failure. If I think "positive" I have a chance of being deluded. If I think "negative" no one will like me and my attitude. But why give yourself a sense of false hope? I like to dream but also plan things out to achieve that dream. I hate it when people have those hazy, unplanned dreams. They just want an outcome but don't want to put in work towards that. I have a friend who is horrible at singing and she wants a career in singing(she is 22 and older than me by 3 years). I told her she will have to practice a lot and put in some work on her voice but then she said I am demotivating her(wtf!). I told her the truth and she doesn't want to believe it. I don't know what to do anymore. Should I be "positive" and deluded or be "negative" and have realistic expectations? I just can't connect with a single human being these days. I feel I am very different and sort of broken as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A girl I was talking to keeps saying I am "negative". She has used this word too many times for me. Once I blocked her on fb and whatsapp because it was getting too much. I was getting emotionally hurt by her words. Like, ok I might be "negative" but why does she have the need to keep saying it again and again. Funny thing is she describes herself as a pessimist and yet keeps calling me "negative" and "I should talk about something positive". What the fuck?  
Anyway, I added her again on Facebook and got her number again after few months and initially it was fine but then she again started saying those things. I sometimes write poems to vent and express my emotions and she had a problem with that as well. She said "this poem is negative too". At that point I was fucking pissed off. Why the fuck is she trying to control me so much? Even if I am "too negative" for her why doesn't she ignore and find someone else?  
Last night we were having an okay conversation and she blurted out "You haven't said anything positive yet". I was like what the fuck, once again? I told her I am not the person you're looking for and told her we're never going to talk again in this life ever. Blocked her again from all forms of social media and have no intention to see her ever.  
Also note that we've been only texting and have never met so it was even more frustrating to see her judging me all the time.  
She has flaws as well. she is fat, she has a weak eyesight, is a pessimist, a nerd etc. But I never made fun of her or kept pointing out her flaws. I don't know why she had the need to do it to me. Last thing a depressed person is someone hurting him again and again. I only regret wasting my time with this girl and getting hurt. I wish I never talked to her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My father once said when I was younger that he would choose alcohol over his wife and kids(me and my brother) everyday of his life without any shame or hesitation. Alcohol has always mattered more to him than us. What annoys me more is the fact that he expects us to respect him just because he is the father. He wants us to take care of him when he is old. He spends money recklessly and has told me repeatedly not to spend much, That has left me so paranoid about money and I immediately feel so guilty if I spend some money on myself.  
Alcohol has always been his priority and nothing can separate him and his alcohol. I hate the fact I know such a shitty person like him. He never should have started his own family. I am not from USA so the society and culture are different here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Literally everyone keeps saying "Leave the past, do something, be happy" etc. and along those lines.  
Happiness is NOT a choice though? You can't have a switch that just turn off depression. Serotonin is a natural mood stabilizer and if that is messed up how can you just be "happy"? Won't you need medication to fix it? Probably exercising might help? But I hate it when people simply blame me for everything that has happened to me or that is happening? It's not my fucking fault that my father is a drug addict and an alcoholic. It's not my fault my brother outright assault me. It's not my fucking fault my mother does not want to listen to me. It's not my fault they do't give me any money. Tears are rolling down from my eyes now. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I feel incompetent, what to do? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-16 11:21:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was one of the toppers in last year of high school but I have been out of school for 2 years and I dropped out from college this semester. I am quite clueless about what to do in life and naturally an anxious person. I had friends who failed a year back in school and were clearly less smarter than I was.   
Yet, the thing is one friend who was never good in studies but good in theater is now confident and has a job that pays quite well and he seems to be enjoying his life. One very close friend is into drugs, alcohol etc. and was never good in studies and even failed a year back in school but he is an entertainer who knows how to conduct himself in social situations. He also has a job right now because he isn't studying that doesn't pay well but at least he has a job.  
I feel very incompetent now. I have lost motivation, have no direction, I'm anxious, socially retarded, don't even have the courage to go for job interviews let alone doing a job and I feel exhausted all the time.  
I'd say I am a good thinker but I have  no qualifications or experience so that people might take me seriously. I can't put in 10 hours everyday for work everyday because I feel tired and just really have no motivation.  
So, despite all the grades and all the compliments I used to get about how smart I am, I feel so incompetent now because the people who were once behind me seems far ahead now. Looking for some motivation/advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am quite depressed lately and a girl I text sometimes would talk about our other guy friend. I just get annoyed because I am so broken myself and want someone to think about me. So, I feel jealous/annoyed even if she mentions his name. I know I shouldn't let it affect me but I have been anxious and depressed for months and the last thing I want is listen about the life of someone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have guests at my house and it's a good environment. My brother is upbeat and my cousin feels okay. I feel depressed, worthless and pathetic. I fucking hate it. Everyone thinks I am a cynical person. A pessimist. A quiet person who is boring to be around. A person who is mute most of the time. A pathetic excuse of a human being. I can feel the awkwardness when I am out with cousins and my brother is not around. He's the multi-talented, entertaining guy everyone wants to be around. I am the mood-killer. I always feel as if nobody wants me around.  
No matter how much they'll tell me that it's okay I can't help but feel they don't want me around. I am mentally exhausted. I just don't want to exist. I don't want to die...I just don't want to exist. </TEXT>
