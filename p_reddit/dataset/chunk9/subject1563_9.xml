Not the point in question. You said there are none looking. I said that's not the point.

And my follow still stands. He would be snapped up by every single CL team if they were looking and he was available.

 He's shown nothing recently to suggest he deserves, or would be considered for, a job bigger than Arsenal.

	<TEXT>  There are no CL teams looking for new managers right now

Yeah but I said 'What CL team right now if they did not have a manager would not want Wenger if he was free?'

  I don't think any of the biggest Champions League clubs would take him now after so long without consistently winning trophies with Arsenal.

I think most people are well aware of his skillsets and his philosophy in spending. Utd dominated for years, now the money clubs are in. Yet he's still consistent, entertaining, and admired. They would take him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you explain the multiple sightings of mysterious men around the complex around the time of the abduction? That's weird. 

Your argument against an intruder does not really hold up. Prob tried the shutter, was noisy, then just walked inside. There you go.

They prob were not checking every 15 minutes, that is exactly right, but it would take a min for it to happen. Didn't the father think after that the abductor might have been in the room when he looked in?
