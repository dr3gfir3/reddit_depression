	<TEXT> My wife is a teacher. She taught at a title 1 school for a decade. Granted, not all of Michelle Obama's ideas were good ones. The fresh vegetable initiative was kind of stupid when they would provide the kids with bags of raw okra and stuff like that. But where my wife taught, kids had new Nikes every few months, but no lunch. Not even a pencil to write. Regardless of whether the kids eat, it's a bad idea to serve them unhealthy food. </TEXT>

And unless you're willing to pay for the babies, stop demanding that women can't choose what they want to do with their own bodies. I am not wrong. You are just confused by religious beliefs. And unless you are out there rescuing all life from harm and death, you are a cherry picking hypocrite. Next time a spider falls into your bathtub while you are showering and you decide not to rescue it, think deeply about why you feel that only humans are deserving of your protection. And unless a fetus is inside of your body, stop making decisions which impact other humans. You don't get to decide what other people do. Free will doesn't require your consent. And finally, an infant is not sentient. Go back to school and learn science. Don't use buzzwords for which you don't understand the actual concepts. </TEXT>

This is a fallacy. Yes, if heroic measures are taken and extremely expensive procedures are made, a 22-24 week preemie could potentially survive. An infant has already passed through the birth canal. That "magic" is called medical science. And you are so far below it in your rhetoric, it's damn near criminal. Life is defined at separation.

	<TEXT> We all know that anti-abortion advocates only care about fetuses. Once children are born, however, they don't care at all. And these are the same people who on the other side of the coin say, "if you can't afford children, don't have them."

I believe, if anti-abortion legislation is made, it should provide neo-natal care, hospital birth care, medical care for the mother and child up to age 18 and child care all funded by the state. If the state wants babies so much, it should pay for them. </TEXT>
