	<TEXT> No. None. Just as I said though, my whole life I have had to use mild soaps. A normal, adult "Man's" soap will make my skin dry and itchy after a few days of regular use. I always have to use creamy soaps like *Dove* or *Ivory* or soaps for ladies. Usually I am fine with most shampoos - certainly *baby* shampoos.

And I am not concerned for myself. I will simply stop using Johnson's Baby Shampoo, and I'll recover in a few days. I am concerned for infants who are not consulted in their choice of shampoos. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ni hao China:

I consider it my civic duty to report Johnson's   Johnson's for the state of their **Johnson's Baby Shampoo**. 'No more tears', but it does make you break out in a rash. Well, me, anyway. I am no baby but I have always had super-sensitive skin and have to be careful what soaps and shampoos I use. Hence I bought Johnson's Baby Shampoo thinking it would be the mildest kind.

The point is that if it gives *me* a rash, it must give most babies a rash. My guess is that Johnson's   Johnson's  are fine with this because then parents will buy other Johnson's baby products to stop the rash. 

In two separate periods of a week or so, I have used Johnson's baby shampoo almost daily. I managed to get rid of the rash after about two more weeks by NOT using it anymore. I am fairly certain there I have it can only have been this product that is causing me to break out in hives on various parts of my body where perhaps I did not rinse quite well enough because I tried using it again after about six weeks, and in a few days the rash was back

**I am calling on Chinese citizens to complain to the appropriate government agency to investigate this product.** 

In another post I will show a photo of the back of the shampoo bottle because it has a code to scan as well as other useful information.

Please do it for the kids! </TEXT>
