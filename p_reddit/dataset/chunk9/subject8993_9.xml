	<TEXT> Has there ever been an update on any mobile device ever that didn't have bugs? 

The point is, what you're expecting of Verizon is impossible. There are 100s of different devices operating on the network. They aren't spending hours testing each one to make sure it's the smoothest thing of all time. So many factors can go in to what makes an update bad or not and Verizon has very little control over that. 

If you update and your service stops working (unless its an iPhone where Apple destroys usability of iPhone 6's with every update) then it's a Verizon problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe that feature is no longer offered, I know you can't do it on the unlimited plan can't recall off the top of my of head for the other plans. 

So what happens when a feature is grandfathered is that it drops when you make an account change. Looks like your last warning text came on 4/19 in the morning. Later that afternoon you changed the plan, which backdated of course to cover your data usage. This change dropped the feature I believe. I've never changed a plan via text so idk how it does it or what kind of confirmation it gives you. 


I would still escalate the situation of course. I'd probably post the screenshots and tweet at Verizon as well as call and escalate up the ladder. 

You can try a store as well, but they can't do anything for you on a store level outside of getting you on the phone with the correct people. 


Good luck this is a shitty situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> $500 for 50 days yes 

However on fi you're paying like $70 or $80/mo for 5GB while Verizon is $55/mo. So over a year it would be pretty similar not even accounting what you spend overseas on fi. 


And when you go over seas you can use your plan as normal allowing you 5GB for that time.  </TEXT>

And you're mad at getting charged for going over data when you clearly understood you would get charged for going over data? 

And you're mad at the only carrier with unlocked phones for like, the last 6 years for locking down devices (they aren't locked tho)?

	<TEXT> Why should a utility company be "loyal". There are promotions all the time for current customers. For your loyalty you have had reliable cell phone service. Your loyalty would have got you a free Galaxy S7 but even though you're loyal you cancelled service! I mean, delusions. 

And for all your loyalty, you're immediately ready to jump ship for one issue in 10+ years. Lol. 

7/11 by my house doesn't ever give me anything and I buy a soda or something there almost daily. McDonald's doesn't give me free stuff because I've shopped there for 20 years.

	<TEXT> You have very few legs to stand on as far as "negotiating". You cancelled a line with a device payment it sounds like so you owe the phone payments. 


Since you had to reconnect the line, it would have been de-registered from online access. Re-register it. 

That's the best I can gather from your post. 



Sidebar I've never really got the "appreciated" thing. I've used the same electric company for 12 years on bills and have yet to get a discount once! Crazy how utilities just provide a service for a cost. </TEXT>

If you get brand new phones you will add device payments and applicable insurance on top of that. 

Of course, buying used phones will be less expensive.

	<TEXT> Why stay on "regular rates?" the rates are the same for the business until the business has more than 10 lines. Plus businesses don't pay activation fees, get the 8% discount and accessory discount, special promotions, etc. 


There is nothing to lose by making it a business account and only to gain, unless you are on a personal account that has a really good employer discount.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm on SMP thanks to getting screwed in February (only had 13 working days despite only a 5 day vacation) where I was 78% and then in March our quota was stupid (60 new for a B store while the A store 5 min away had 33...) and my two discrepancies didn't post in time so I was at 79% so now I'm on  SMP. 


It's a 4 month program. First month you have to hit 80%, month 2 90%, month 3 and 4 100% and then you're off. If you fail to hit, then it goes into a 6 month window with a similar structure but at that point not hitting 80% will get you canned in all likelihood. 


Still pretty salty about February where our quota was 48 new and I did 30 in 13 days and didn't get 80% because of the the way my schedule broke out. </TEXT>
