	<TEXT> Yup.  We were an insanely productive discovery team at my old pharmaceutical company and did great work for the size of the team we had.

	<TEXT> It really wasn't THAT simple.  You really need to go back an understand how much warfare during Vietnam was different than WWII.  A lot of times during Vietnam there simply were NO objectives.  Thousands of soldiers would slaughter the enemy on 'search and destroy' missions for the sole purpose of ONLY killing them because our kill ratio was so high.  Once those missions were over, the gains that were made were abandoned and the enemy would simply retake it.  You also need to understand how the tactics of the VC, who would often not wear uniforms, hide weapons caches in villages and setup booby traps in civilian locations.  You couldn't tell who was enemy from civilian.  

The type of combat and stress of not knowing who the enemy was coupled with the fact that you and your friends were dying for basically no discernable reason (i.e. objectives would shift and be lost after being deprioritized) probably made them into psychopaths.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say yes, and that's only because DeShields plays on a better team.  They actually profile similarly. Jankowski has 70/70 speed (faster than DeShields) and was, surprisingly, a 1st round pick too.  The power is non-existent, but his K rate should reduce (he's never had over 20% K rate at any level of baseball except for his brief MLB appearances) meaning an even better AVG/OBP/SB.  But, DeShields simply because a better team and better park. 

I wouldn't get upset if you didn't get DeShields or didn't want to drop Jankowski.   </TEXT>

If it does, there's a huge array of different columns, IP reagents and buffers to try.

Brokers, advisers, etc. lose your money?  They make money.  Brokers, advisers, etc. make you money?  They make money.  

Financial advisers love to constantly talk about the power of compounded interest and how if you invest now you'll be a 'millionaire' by the time you retire, but rarely if ever do they discuss how their 1% fee or whatever also compounds to add up to a shit ton of money.  The financial industry: YOU give us all of YOUR money and YOU take all of the risk--we make money off of you no matter what.  And we make money off of you in an exponential fashion if you do end up getting lucky and beat the market.

	<TEXT> No, but it is incredibly rich to hear teachers complaining about lack of pay and/or raises when they get paid just as much as millions of people and get entire summers off as well as all of the days off during school calendar holidays.  They also get extraordinary benefits that are better than millions of people, and it is absolutely rich that people with nowhere near as good benefits and time off have to pay more taxes to pay for everything.

And secondly, it doesn't matter where you go, public employees constantly say that they don't make enough money.  In the city where I'm from, the school system and teachers themselves are one of THE biggest wasters of money and perpetrators of fraud in the entire city.  Then they have the gall to complain about salaries and constantly claim there is a 'funding crisis for schools'.  For example, in one case, only a handful of school personnel in our school district are SUPPOSED to have access payroll hours.  An investigation uncovered numerous unauthorized people changing personnel hours for the payroll that made city taxpayers have to overpay for supposed OT hours to many people, hours that were never worked and cost millions of dollars in fraud.   There are wild stories of teachers during days off bragging while at the strip club about how much OT they're getting for days they didn't even work.  The school system here also 'lost' over 1000 computers for students.  School administrators have also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not millions, 'renovating' their offices to make them nice and cushy.....and all during a supposed 'funding crisis'.  

Teachers just need to realize there are millions of people who get worse or the the same compensation that they do AND who probably work more hours every year.  Don't cry about lack of being paid when people who get paid less and who have far worse benefits from working in the private sector  have to pay higher taxes to cover the cost of what teachers (or any public employee for that matter) are demanding.  If you want salary increases, stop wasting millions of dollars by cutting down on fraud too.  Tons of school districts also wouldn't be in such a financial mess if they weren't hamstrung by things like cushy teacher pensions, which is something millions of people don't get.  They should count their lucky stars that they get a pension.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And many people who are in salaried positions in the private sector never get a single dime for OT when they have to work 50 or 60 hour weeks.  What's your point?  There are many salaried workers who only earn $50k for regularly working 40+ hour weeks or more, and they have far worse benefits than most teachers do, including crappy health care plans with insane premiums or deductibles, little to no retirement benefits if they're salaried at a small company, and get nowhere near as many guaranteed vacation days.  Who exactly is better off, the salaried worker in Philly who won't get OT for working 50-60 hours weeks (possibly even 6 days per week), or the $50k teacher who might sometimes have to do extra work grading exams after 2 PM or 3 PM, coaches baseball in the evening, and who gets amazing benefits?  

I used to work at a CRO as a contracted employee stuck on a shitty $53k/year salary.  Worked 80 hours per week in order to get projects out in order to meet deadlines under contract.  Often would have to work 6 days per week, even 7 days sometimes.  And I got no OT pay.  

Did he get a pension too?  That's something else almost 0 people get unless they work in the public sector.   </TEXT>

That doesn't even list the crazy amount of benefits that they get and all of the days off of school and summer vacation.  Teachers can also get all of their student loans forgiven if they work long enough, unlike those who work in the private sector.  

Those salaries are actually well over the median income in Philly and the benefits are crazy.  What's the problem?

I've seen Phds in science and engineering who have to work with and be in charge of multi-million dollar pieces of equipment earn $20-30k less than that AND have shite for benefits.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not always.  One of the things that makes you uniquely human as opposed to any other organism are the sets of sugars and the sugar code the human body produces.  Bacteria often produce sugar structures that are completely alien looking and it is because they literally are--the sugar structures on bacteria are actually what cause sepsis and why you get sick when you get a bacterial infection. They'll often use sugars that humans are completely incapable of using and you never find many types of rare or weird sugars that bacteria use in a human.  Plants and even eukaryotic cells like yeast still don't produce human forms of sugars many times without significant amounts of genetic engineering required.  That's why sugar biology is so , so friggin' difficult--it's because it is an incredibly daunting task to engineer a yeast or plant cell to produce exact types of sugar structures found on a human.   The pharmaceutical industry has this problem allllllllllllllll the time.  A ton of drugs in the pipeline now are things like antibodies and other secreted proteins, but what was overlooked was the fact that those types of drugs and virtually any other type of protein that is produced is covered in sugar.  Pharma almost never uses plants and bacteria to produce monoclonal therapies etc. for a lot of different drugs, and it is because those types of cells are not able to produce humanized forms of sugars that coat them.  The FDA in fact requires you to be able to keep a narrow window of glyco profiles of your drug and it must be consistent from batch to batch.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, you've really stumbled onto a massive field of research and the short answer is basically 'no'.  

The reason why glycobiology is pretty neat is that there is no known code to manipulate that will allow you to produce a specific type of oliggosaccharide.  This is in stark contrast to DNA, which provide a template for you to easily study and allows you to manipulate the production of proteins.  This does not exist for what is known as the 'sugar code'.  We know nature is not randomly making glycans and oliggosaccharides, but there are very well defined types of them, the problem is that no one to date understands how to manipulate nature in order to make a specific type of glycan.  If you could figure that out you'd be a billionaire.  

Synthetically you could in theory do it both with organic chemistry and enzymes, but that tends to be extraordinarily difficult because that's just the way chemistry of carbohydrates works. Just to synthetically make one type of oliggosaccharide that is contained in breast milk (I looked it up) it would take more than 2 people their entire PhDs to obtain.....and there are literally dozens, if not hundreds of different kinds of olioggos in breast milk . 

I mean making specific types of oliggos has been done before (so I shouldn't really say it can't be done), such as making humanized oliggos on the drug EPO for example, but that was a massive effort of chemical and biomolecular engineering--and that was far less complicated than how many types of oliggos are produced in breast milk apparently.  There are some automated techniques to make some oliggosaccharides, but they tend to be low yielding after a lot of reactions.  

Not being able to synthesize sugar structures is actually a big reason why the glyco realm of biology is extremely difficult and why it is still considered to be like the dark matter of biology.  How can you study something that's so difficult to work with? </TEXT>

Now I'm going to have to research what exactly the structures are of these oliggos that 'people can not digest' but our bugs can.  That would be very intriguing and means that there could be some sort of very special carbohydrate metabolic pathways and glycogenes that are upregulated during lactation and which are found almost nowhere else in the body.  Thanks!   </TEXT>

Worse yet, those institutions actually generate thousands of jobs and ideas worth billions.  Cutting spending on programs that are actually productive is stupid.  Meanwhile the military, who has previously sent over $100 million on cushy villas in Afghanistan, $700 million on gem cutters in Afghanistan, and who lost over $500 million in equipment in Yemen, gets a financial boost.

I used to live on Baltimore St. and had our house broken into (edit: this was also a home invasion--we were present a first degree crime, not just a typical city life crime).  A neighbor also caught video (he has outdoor security cams) of a swarm of kids (12+ of them) beating a random dude for no reason one night on a side street near Baltimore.  

There has been some pretty violent/fucked up attacks on random pedestrians near the park over the past few years, so be aware that that element doesn't always stay on the border near Baltimore street and every so often does make it down to the southern parts of the park.  Don't listen to sugar coaters, do you your homework and take an objective look at the statistics, starting with a crime heat map for example.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really surprised a lot of people expect a decent paper by their 3rd year. I mean I know people do it, but you've spent a lot of time in your first three years taking classes, passing your oral exams, and completing TA requirements.  There's really not a lot of time to get a ton of real research done.  I know of more than one person who was allowed to graduate after 7 years and 0 papers, although they did extremely high quality work and the papers were just about to be submitted. </TEXT>

Just two days ago the entire street was blocked off because two douche bags double parked.....right fucking next to each other and gave 0 fucks about blocking alllllllllllllll traffic on Calvert St.  Even more infuriating is the fact that people will double park even when there are spots open literally 2-3 cars away.  Have to take bags to the house?  Sorry, city life, get a collapsable cart with wheels and put in your car and wheel them home if you have to park away from your house.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are regulars at a local restaurant run by a family who is simply trying to make a living, yet it is unbelievable the vitriol that people will spew once they can hide anonymously behind a keyboard and a screen name.  People constantly complain that their orderup delivery is slow.....well yeah, their small restaurant tends to get slammed on a Friday/Saturday night during prime dining hours so it might take 1-1.5 hours to get your order out, sorry.  Additionally, some people leave idiotic 1 star reviews for things like 'pork' in their dish when the dish they make absolutely has 0 pork in it.  Or they'll complain about 'small portions' even though no dish at the restaurant costs more than $14 and I can count numerous shrimp tails or many large size pieces of beef.  

Anonymous idiots have no dea how much their hate spewing rhetoric hurts people trying to simply make a living.  Make Yelp users start identifying themselves and be responsible for what they say.  For example, require a credit card/ID to sign up in order to post.  Not to charge, but just to ID.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you!  Very interesting and useful. 

Our lab uses both natural and unnatural carbohydrates to molecular engineer the surfaces of cancer cells (similar to Bertozzi) followed by glycoproteomics identification.  I simply got bored one day and started playing around with some ideas wrt the physiochemical and pharmacological properties of the molecules we use for that purpose --could we one day design a carbohydrate analog that would actually be used one day in a patient rather than just cells?  My interest was piqued when I simply ran them through the HPLC to look for differences in lipophilicity to start.  

ManNAc and GalNAc expensive?  I mean we always purchase from Carbosynth:

100g is only about $500 http://www.carbosynth.com/carbosynth/website.nsf/(w-productdisplay)/9BCBB2ABD562023380256A6B0035AC96

We also bought kilos of ManNAc from NZP:  https://www.nzp.co.nz/mannac

(not sure how much it cost, but it couldn't have been prohibitively expensive since we literally have giant buckets of it in the cold room).   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-25 22:50:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm working with per- acetylated version of N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylmannosamine, and N-acetyl glucosamine.  When I injected them into the HPLC (RP-C18) you absolutely notice differences in their retention times.  After piquing my interest, I simply decided to test their water solubilities and sometimes noticed differences in solubility between those sugars.  

Is there a particular reason why the physiochemical properties are different between those per acetylated hexosamines?  They all have the same number of acetates that are protecting the hydroxyls, the only difference is basically the way the molecule is arranged in 3-D space.  What would make say GalNAc more 'lipophilic' than GlcNAc or ManNAc?  I tried searching the literature and couldn't really find any meaningful hits explaining the physiochemical differences between various carbohydrates due to changes in the way the -OH groups are oriented on the core carbon ring.   </TEXT>

5/10, rocket to Venus, blue pit BBQ, grano pasta bar all have food affordable for a high school kid. Stroll the avenue after and get a dessert at the charmery of Daniela's.

Johnny Rads for some good pizza and skeeball/old school video games.

Duckpin bowling

The bun shop is open later for coffees and a pastry after dinner.

Mayuree Thai Tavern is by far and away our favorite Thai in the area and they have a pool table, darts, foosball, and Nintendo for playing.  There's parking in the back (that area can be difficult for street parking).

Cinebistro also just opened up if you literally want to eat dinner while going to a movie, but it is a bit pricy. Can also go walk the avenue after. </TEXT>
