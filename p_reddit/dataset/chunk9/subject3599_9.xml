	<TEXT> Reliant on the startup's server=disaster waiting to happen. If and when they run out of money, the device is a paperweight because the service is almost certain to be shutdown. Or, say they get acquired? The new company can just shut them down as well.

Also; the major US carriers all have WiFi calling. Why would I want this when I can use the same measures I would to gain access to this service to just connect directly to the home carrier's wifi calling and have better functionality without the intermediary? 

Absent wifi calling, I see the use case. Outside the US (say, Asia, Central or South America) where borders are frequently crossed and roaming may get prohibitive and carriers may not offer wifi calling, I see the use case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you throw a bunch of money at the problem and get a vinyl plant up and running? You betcha. 

Can you hire the expertise you need to get and keep scrap rates down enough to have profitable production yield? Are you just pressing or will you be cutting lacquers and making stampers as well? If so do you already have a lathe or know where you're going to get one?  

An improperly run pressing plant will burn cash insanely quickly. Pressing records is as much art as it is science. Far better places to invest if you don't have the specific knowledge and experience to make this work. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seeing a lot of Band 30 (WCS band) popping up, especially in San Antonio. Having massive issues with it. Phone will select Band 2 initially but prefers 30 which in some areas (Riverwalk, I-10 and 1604, 281 and 410) pretty much doesn't work. No data throughput at all. Airplane mode corrects the problem for a bit but once it's back on band 30, I effectively have no data. Anyone else having issues? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bought this for the office. I'm damn impressed! Finish is top notch and it looks great. Sound is very good; I like the AT-95E a HELL of a lot more than I do the OM5e, so I'd give it an edge over any of the lower-end Pro-Ject 'tables. The arm isn't nearly as substantial as it looks but it still has proper adjustments and does the trick. Note that sound comments are based upon use with an external preamp. See below.

This looks almost identical to the Teac TN-300 with some added features; right down to the straight tonearm and goofy angled headshell. For this reason you CANNOT use a standard headshell on this 'table despite the standard connector and collet. 

Just skip the internal preamp and forget the bluetooth and USB functionality. The internal preamp has quite low output, and is noisy once you turn up volume enough to compensate for that. In addition, the dynamics are squashed, and...well... it's passable but absolutely does not do the 'table and cartridge justice. An Art DJ Pre II works wonderfully for an extra $50 and for $300 you end up with a great looking, and sounding, combo.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Battery bulge/touchpad issue on the XPS9550, I purchased additional warranty and on-site support. Dell now saying, the battery warranty is one year and additional warranty coverage doesn't apply? Required to disassemble computer to provide information from battery before they'll dispatch support. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-13 20:54:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Long and short of it: Purchased XPS9550 March 11, 2016 from Best Buy. Purchased an upgrade to on-site service, and accidental damage and a two year warranty extension that next week directly from Dell. Because Dell shipped the laptop to Best Buy they assert the warranty started in January, when they shipped it. But, i'm getting ahead of myself...

I'm having the battery bulging that results in the touchpad not working properly. Filed a support request online after failing the self-test. Dell ships a RAM stick??? Did a chat with a support rep and... 'the warranty on the battery is only one year'. 

Well, I was never provided with updated terms and conditions when I purchased the warranty or indeed ANY documentation other than seeing the information update on the support site. So, that isn't going to fly. They've asked for part information from the battery. I now have to disassemble the computer to get this. Not happy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Discourse, not disclosure. Your source as evidence for stating film will not work in space? Why not? You seek to disprove something happened. Provide proof it wasn't possible. 

The video does not show studio cameras, etc. It shows another astronaut holding the camera mounted to his chest and using it. The film used was 70mm film in light-tight magazines that could be changed without exposing the film. That's part of why they used those specific Hasselblad cameras. Surely you have more than your own thoughts and what you think you see in a video. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ed-zachary. Used to be an exec in a 900 person business. We had unions try to organize not once, not twice, but THREE times over fifteen years. Nobody inside the organization ever drove this; it was always outside organizers. The first time we flipped out and basically told EVERYONE if they had felt like they couldn't approach us before that here's a special cellphone straight to the CEO and if there's a problem, call. Very few calls, but we did get some legit issues we solved. Vote went badly for the union. 

Next time? We started noticing complaints going up from customers, people talking to employees as they walked into the parking lot (we finally kicked them off property when OUR people started complaining and one got into a fight with an organizer who tried to keep him from getting into his car, we really were trying to be fair), organizers calling employees (someone gave them a list of phone numbers), etc. How it didn't make the news here I have no idea. That vote went even worse for the union. 

The last time was much more subtle and they just left fliers everywhere and bought a few billboards. THAT one they actually moved the needle but still lost. We treated our people right and thankfully the organizers were vague enough in the sweetness and light promises that our folks saw through it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently bought a lower-end 'table for the office that uses removable headshells. Decided it might be nice to have a few extras to cart-swap, etc. Contacted their parts department, ordered two, they came in today brand new, perfectly packed... WITH NEW AT-95E CARTS MOUNTED (yes, styli as well). 

Let me be clear; the price for each headshell was ~$15. Unless there's a freakin' CRAZY markup on cartridges, there's no way this was intentional although the part number matched what I ordered. So either they just don't care and are taking a loss, they AREN'T taking a loss and the carts are that cheap, or somebody made a mistake and I got $110 worth of carts and two headshells for under $40 shipped. 

My inclination is to call 'em, tell them what happened and offer to pack it all back up for them to have picked up if it was a mistake. If it wasn't, I know I did the right thing. </TEXT>
