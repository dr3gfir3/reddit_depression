The rule on the side states:

 This is not a sub to post content with humans. If a person is the main subject of your post it will be removed.

I would say that the dinosaur snatching away a fish is the main subject of the post. I tried to reason with the mod who banned me but was told to just read the sidebar. I feel like I've been a pretty steady contributor and to get 30 days for that was a bit much. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about listening to YouTube while phone is in sleep mode </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 23:35:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! So I like to listen to some YouTube compilations on my phone while it's asleep. Usually I would, using safari, find the YouTube video, hit play, put the phone to sleep, hit the home button, and hit the play button and put it back to sleep and never have a problem. Over the weekend I tried to do this but when I hit play after putting it to sleep, it would go into Music mode and play songs stored on the phone. Did I do something in my setting to make this happen? Is there a work around? Will the YouTube app work while the phone is in sleep mode? The things I'm listening to have nothing visual to them but are just old Howard Stern radio shows.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Howard told Gary to post it on the site so I'm sure it's floating around somewhere. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe so. The video comes from https://www.latestsightings.com/. My understanding is that this is an organization that has cams setup throughout the nature park to capture these types of things and probably ensure nothing illegal is taking place in the park. These are all filmed in [Kruger National Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruger_National_Park), which does have tourist lodging and provide safaris. According to Wikipedia, **"The park was initially created to control hunting and protect the diminished number of animals in the park."* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dan's been on at least once that I remember, right around the time the Big Three came to Miami. Simmons and Lebatard likened the whole situation to that of the 1980's Scarface movie. A listener of that pod ended up making [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6n7LWlLOrNk). If you read the description, he writes:

 What happens when you combine Scarface with the Miami Heat? Now you know. There are many guest appearances, so watch closely! I was looking to have some fun with the Miami Heat situation. I finally landed on an idea when I heard Bill Simmons and Dan LeBatard compare the Miami Heat to Scarface. I couldn't pass it up.

Bill and Dan also cohosted PTI a handful of times, and Bill was in studio for an entire show of Lebatards. Bill was a semi-frequent caller into Dan's show. Dan nicknamed Bill the Body Language Oracle which Bill eventually turned into Body Language Doctor. Oracle is much, much funnier, IMO.

Edit: [here's the archive of Bill sitting in during one of Lebatards radio shows from a few years back](https://www.reddit.com/r/billsimmons/comments/59brgm/from_2014_bill_simmons_on_the_lebatard_show/)

Edit 2: they were also on that special pre Lebron's The Decision with Uncle Tony and Mike Wilbon discussing possible destinations for LeBron. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just an incredible looking creature. From the source:

natgeo: video by @joelsartore | A southern three-banded armadillo at the @LincolnChildrensZoo in Nebraska. 
This is one of only two species of armadillo with the ability to roll up into a complete ball as a defense mechanism. The southern three-banded armadillo is listed as near threatened on the IUCN red list, meaning although it doesnt qualify for a threatened status right now, it is close to qualifying for, or is likely to qualify for one in the near future. One major factor in the decline of to the southern three-banded armadillo is hunting. Since they are not fossorial (adapted to living underground), this species is easier to hunt than other armadillos. Habitat loss as well as the high mortality rate during exportation into the pet trade are also significant threats to this species.
