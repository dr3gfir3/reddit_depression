	<TEXT> Cheers. I think it depends on whether or not you take advantage of the quarterly 5% categories. If you do, then the Freedom is great. If not, the Freedom Unlimited is worth it because it is 1.5% on all purchases.

You can definitely switch between the two, or if you want to open a second card you can do that too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could apply for the Delta Platinum amex. There's currently a 50K offer after $1k spend via [referral from Rankt.com](https://rankt.com/r/churning/referrals/amex_delta_platinum/). 

It does have a $195 annual fee, but the signup bonus comes with a $100 statement credit if you make any Delta purchase (including paying the taxes on an award flight)

edit: Make sure you use the 50K links (the 60K links are for a different card and should not be there). While it's not the historical high of 70K, it's good if you need the points soon.

Also, the bonus posts quickly on amex, usually within 1-2 days of meeting the minimum spend, so you don't have to wait until your statement closes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Unfortunately, there is no longer a free Delta card. There is a lower tier card (I believe just called "Delta Skymiles card") which has a $55 AF but offers no benefits. Not worth it, in my opinion.
* It is possible to upgrade to the Delta Plat without a hard pull. I did this several years ago. However, you will not get the sign-up bonus and will be excluded from receiving a sign-up bonus for this card in the future. When you call, ask them if you have an offer for upgrading (I forget what I was offered, but it was enough to make it worth it for me).
* The companion certificate is awarded every year upon renewal, so you would get it next April. However, I believe it is possible to cancel your card after the AF posts. Since the certificate is already in your Delta account, they won't take it back.

Hope this helps! </TEXT>

You could lower your cash advance limit to $20 (or whatever the lowest is). Plastiq will give you a warning if it will trigger a cash advance, so you can just try it out and see if it goes through.
