I came in as a newbie and am in no way affiliated with mods or the cliquey runners here, am fairly slow and an amateur runner, and have asked stupid questions, most of which were answered. 

What I think sucks is that sometimes people come here looking for validation (Do you guys think I could spontaneously run a marathon?) and don't respond to or contribute to constructive conversation. Imo that kind of newbie runner is shunned because they aren't here to genuinely participate in the discussion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished **The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead** this weekend. I liked it, I feel like I've read some hate for it on here, but it was an extremely emotional and raw read with a smidge of inventiveness. 

Working my way through **Responsibility and Judgement by Hannah Arendt** I love the way Arendt thinks. I'm taking it slow, taking copious notes. 

Just started **Audacity of Hope by Jonathan Chait** half because I like Chait, and half because my presidential kick is getting a little ancient feeling. 

My half marathon this weekend helped me eat up hours in **Path to Power by Robert Caro** and I'll probably finish it today during my run commute. LBJ was something else.

### Training

Best described as everything that can go wrong will go wrong. I ran my first half marathon in November and finished really really poorly. 2:37. I attributed that to 1) not getting enough water during the race because I figured I was super human and wouldn't dehydrate and 2) under training. I set out a goal to stick with Hal Higdon's Intermediate HM 1 plan (I think), realized I was less than 13 weeks out already and just loosely followed it. At week 6 (or so) I signed up for a 15k as a tune up 4 weeks before the race. [Side note: for whatever reason April is consistently my worst running month, all the other months kick April's ass in terms of mileage total.] A week before my 15k I had flu like symptoms, may have fainted at work, and missed a whole week of training (and my race per the advice of my wife and doctor) and just felt bad about my chances going into the HM. I slowly got back on track, started foam rolling to deal with what I think might be ITBS and not just *general soreness* as I kept fooling myself into believing. 

But of course I felt like I had undertrained. My longest run before the HM was 8 miles, which I think shows a little bit in my splits miles 11-13. 

### Mile [1]

Probably my least favorite part of the race. The race was organized as both a 5k and a half marathon, and for some reason they started them both at the exact same time. My usual strategy is to start at the back because I figure a) I'm slow and b) it's more fun passing people than being passed. The race started in a parking lot before winding down to the bike path around Rockland Lake and my strategy of starting in the back just led to a frustrated and slow beginning. The path bottlenecked and people did not seem to be aware of how much space they were taking. Running passing lanes should be a thing. 

### Miles [2] to [6]
I was finally able to break away from the pack. My initial strategy was going to be slow first 5k, fast 10k, and then just finish as strong as possible. The slow first mile threw me for a loop and I had to adapt a little bit. I was able to get in with a good paced group of three other people I didn't know and I drafted behind them until around mile 4 when they started to slow down. I am extremely grateful to one bald runner who was just at the right pace for me, but who I suspected was just really great at pacing himself and would pass me later. 

### Mile [10]
[Note: At about mile 7 I got passed by my early pacing buddy. He kicked it into a pace I would not have been able to maintain]

Dreaded mile 10. The hook half marathon ran one loop around Rockland Lake, turned out into the streets of Valley Cottage/Nyack and then ran over to Nyack beach. The beach is located at an elevation dip and runs flat for about 1.5 miles. The course ran down one entrance, to the other, and then back. 

Just at the end of mile 10 is a steep incline that runs for about 1/4 to 1/3 of a mile. Strava says 227 ft, and I'm guessing it's all in that final hill. An award was given to the fastest female and male runners up the hill. That was not me. 

One of my implicit goals of any race I do is to finish running. This hill tried that goal, but I was able to get it done. My time shot up, my energy reserves felt depleted, but I made it up the damn hill. 

(Thank also here to my wife for recommending routes to run during my training in her hometown that were very steep, very demanding.)

### Miles [11] to [13.1]
After the hook mountain hill I was beat and back to my *why do I sign up for these things, why would I want to run anything longer than a 10k, please just end me now* mindset. But I also had two personal and vindictive goals to reach. 1) I want to be the fastest member of my wife's family. Her extended family has some marathon runners, but we're talking 5 hour marathon runners, and I felt with enough training and consistency I could accomplish my goal. (I just barely edged her cousin who just completed the United NYC Half at 2:17:19. Per Strava I finished 2:16:33) The second was something my wife told me just before the race. She said "I don't think it's possible to shave off 20 minutes since your last half in November."

I'm sometimes a petty runner, using any negative energy, not that hers was overly negative, to get things going. It helps that the last 2 miles were relatively flat around the lake. So with all that I came in at 2:16:33! A new PR and shaving 20 minutes off my half time. 

### What's next?

Queens half marathon in November. This will be a re-race for me and hopefully I can get my time down to below 2:10. I'm also really pumped for this because they redrew the course and are running through the park that I got my start running in.
