	<TEXT> So, I've played a few hours and I think that the start is fine.  Not great, not terrible, just fine...  I'm hoping it'll pick up when things open up with the open worlds.  Look at it like a rough pilot for a possible good series and that may sway you a bit later.  It took the Expanse an episode or two to get going...  Maybe Mass Effect needs room to breathe before it gets good.

I don't really think the writing and voice work is that bad.  There's a scene getting tossed around where Ryder tells two people something about his/her family.  Yeah, that scene could have been better, but it didn't make me scoff and laugh.  Male Ryder has been pretty good.  I like how relaxed he sounds compared to Male Shep.  Liam and Cora are fine I guess, but when have the human companions ever been interesting.

I mean, let's face it...  Faces look like butt.  Yet everything else in the game looks amazing.  Armor, effects, environments...  It all looks pretty rad.  You get over a cringe curve after a while with the faces where you get used to it, though.

Hopping around and jetting like an insane person is actually really fun.  I've had no qualms with the movement so far, like others have.  Shooting feels a bit spongey, but I think that's cause I put the difficulty at hardcore.  I really wanna see what abilities I can open up.

I think my thing is that I don't expect 2001: A Space Oddesey when I play Mass Effect...  I expect goofy shit like Star Wars, Firefly, or old Star trek.  Getting SERIOUS Trek vibes with all the scanning.  I read somewhere that people were expecting some kind of Lovecraftian existential horror monsters with the Kett.  They aren't that AT ALL.  Empire Strikes Back music basically starts playing when they show up on screen.  It's classic, campy ass sci-fi. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But see, what you're missing from the video you posted is the body expression and movement.  Shepherd is leaning against some crates when he talks to Liara, and Liara's head isn't twitching, trying to focus on him like she's PROGRAMED to do.  She's facing forward because she knows Shepherd is there and can hear her.  Like a person would...

That one girl they show Ryder talking to seemed like she was trying to snap her neck to look at him.  And her eyes weren't even looking up at him, they were pointed towards space somewhere.  Thankfully the aliens seem to have some emotion to them, and that's probably because they're so outside the natural valley that it can work even with little animation.

Regardless if you think these look better than the original series, with games like The Witcher 3 having some of the most realistic looking faces in video games, it really is no excuse for a giant like EA not to compete with that.  I'm one of those people who believe that yeah, Poland set the bar THAT high, and you got to compete now.  Gameplay looks great, exploring looks great, RPG elements look great, these faces do not.  And it's a damn shame, because you know Witcher 3 and others have taken influence from the drama that ME brought to the table with its dialogue system.

This is really unacceptable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to stay positive about the game, BUT JESUS THOSE FACIAL ANIMATIONS. They're so stiff too... It's like they're not even trying.

It really isn't ok to have characters looking that dead inside, especially since it's the crew conversations, where we're supposed to get the real characterization of each crew mate. I can understand facial animation taking a back seat for meaningless side quests, but what the fuck man... The original ME series had better facial animation than this. Where Shepherd gives a wry smile to Garrus talking about 'popping the heat sink,' Tali fidgeting nervously revealing her crush, Wrex smacking his hands together in a wicked blood thirsty smile. Thane crossing his fingers together in melancholy retrospect.

You got a lot more personality from their subtle movements and facial quicks, despite how dated it may look now.  I REALLY hope this is from a previous build, because this looks just plain bad.  I'd expect this kind of work from a Focus Interactive game, not Bioware. </TEXT>

The ignorance to Global Warming is shown in the first two shots of the intro, where it shows the Arctic sea melting away, and the Statue of Liberty becoming engulfed in water.  I love when they show New York, and just have it surrounded by a gigantic sea wall.  They treat it with nonchalance, going, "Yeah, that's what is going to happen.

	<TEXT> The Expanse!

It's on Sy-Fy, but it probably has the best budget out of all their programs.  The show is based on a series of books by James S.A. Corey.  The books aren't like Game of Thrones, but Sy-Fy is trying to make the show like a Sci-Fi version of it.

It takes place hundreds of years in the future, where generations have been born and have grown up in zero gravity or on space.  The factions are divided between three peoples...  Earthers, Martians and people who live in space, known as Belters.  The story revolves around a crew of an ice-hauler who stumble upon a huge, world-shaking conspiracy.  Give it a shot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, one of the things that isn't often mentioned about this game is that it's a perfect time sink.  Akin to games like Eurotruck or Elite: Dangerous, you never feel pressured to go anywhere with a story or sidequests.  You honestly can just play as much as you want, quit, start a new character, or play on the super nifty Azezel mode. (Hope I spelled that right.)

Azezel mode allows you to ghost jump when you die to either a squadmate or another random person on the map.  With each jump, I'd always craft little stories in my head as I played, giving motivation to my character's fleeting lives.

One arc involved the military.  I spawned as a commander of a patrol of three, and we set out on this long stretch of road.  We came upon a band of bandits that laid waste to us, having the height advantage of a bridge to mow us easily down.  One soldier was left, after struggling to kill the rest of the bandits off.  So, I decided to make him a bitter drunk mourning the loss of his squad.  Every bottle of Cossack's vodka I could find, I downed, storming into small bases of innocent STALKERS or other factions and killing them without mercy.

Surprisingly, luck was on my side, and my drunken soldier was finding himself continually winning with odds stacked against him.  He would charge into battle, hoping to die and join his comrades, only to find himself looking for vodka on the bodies of the dead.  Eventually, I found a military squad holed up inside a warehouse, under attack by swarming bandits and STALKERS.  I had stripped myself of all weapons at that point and was charging into battles with a knife.  That is where I finally met my death along the side of the warehouse.

BUT, I had added a couple of men to my squad.  And I warped to another soldier.  For some reason, the military really wanted to hold this warehouse deep in the zone, so I killed what bandits came, and guarded the warehouse.  I assigned myself body disposal detail and began dragging the corpses of the slain soldiers and bandits to a ditch.  Included in the heap, was my previous self, stripped of his vodka and left to rot amongst bandits and soldiers alike.

I let my character become enraged of what became of his men, of his unit, so I organized a force to attack the bandit base that resided nearby.  We would devastate this scourge to the zone.  BUT, thanks to that Dynamic factions mod, as I was in the base planning my surprise attack, the bandits and military declared a truce over the radio.  Just at they did, I came upon my first bandit.  We both pointed our weapons at each other, unsure of what to do, when we finally said, "Fuck the rules, these guys die." We laid waste to their base, with notifications that my standing within the Military was growing worse.  I was becoming reviled even by my own association.  I stood amongst the bodies, collected what I could, and moved on...

Until I was sniped by some bandit out in the wastes.

This is the kind of story that Racyevick is talking about, and my God does he nail it.  The moment to moment gameplay of CoC is really something to be seen.  Give it a try, seriously... </TEXT>
