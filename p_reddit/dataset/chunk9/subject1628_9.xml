	<TEXT> Actually they are pygmy date palm seeds. Pretty easy for an armchair warrior like yourself to make such accusations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speculate all you want. I couldn't find any seeds in my area so I ordered online. Make sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for all of the replies. They're just palm tree seeds but don't have paperwork or anything. I don't know much about customs but know they can be strict on seeds plants etc coming in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, so I bought some seeds online and they arrived this week. I ended up finding some locally and don't really need the ones that arrived. Am I able to sell them on my local classifieds site without any paperwork or anything? I just want to play it safe and not face any legal ramifications. I have already arranged a transaction but it seems fishy- small amount of seeds wanted, will be arriving with a friend, insists on meeting INSIDE the cafe as opposed to just outside the door- maybe he is just taking safety measures and I am just being paranoid. Anyway, thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks to everyone who replied RE: how to receive a refund. I have decided just to go with the extra month- I still plan on watching a bit of hockey and it would be different if the service was terrible.

Best wishes to all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it is it's unsettling how paying for something once gives consent to do it on a recurring basis. I understand it's a subscription but I paid for 1 month before and it didn't automatically renew.
Like I sad, I'll suck it up. I've already disabled it. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But technically I "gave payment" for 1 month, that's it. Anyway, I'll suck it up, it's just a bit unsettling to see that it's that easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't understand how PayPal can allow it. I understand it is a subscription but even with Netflix you have to give consent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got dinged $22 CAD for another month and I don't recall giving consent for a recurring payment. I kind of planned on letting it go until the fall. Has anyone else had this happen? </TEXT>
