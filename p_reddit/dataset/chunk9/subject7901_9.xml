	<TEXT> If the architecture of containment works (without leaching too much water into the water table), then using an abandoned coal mine as the lower reservoir for pumped hydro energy storage would address a critical barrier to renewable energy -- overcoming the resistance to change of coal miners.  By providing a source of employment at their  home base, the real agenda of these folk would be addressed: to keep their families and communities intact in the face of technological change.  This, of course, is just a place marker -- an anchor showing a commitment to people and place.  Social engineering when it is democratic and consensual is not some elitist imposition.  It is as important as every other kind of engineering in making a livable world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The right to protest and the right to speak must both be protected. As a matter of persuasive political theater I would be for a peacekeeping force that would separate the hate-speakers and their audience from the people they wish to provoke, protecting the community from intimidation, and the hate-speakers from the violence which they are seeking. That would normally be the job of the municipal police. But the police, themselves, are a provocative force in many communities, and would be seen by the community as an extension of the intrusion by the haters. The better defense against provocateurs comes from community-based parade marshalls who would respond in a disciplined way to de-escalate violence. Its how non-violent demonstrations should be dealing with the black bloc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "An internal rule of an undertaking which prohibits the visible wearing of any political, philosophical or religious sign does not constitute direct discrimination," the court said in a statement.

However it ruled that the company must have a policy that bars religious signals and requires employees to "dress neutrally".

The danger to the "undertaking" is ANY freedom of expression.  It is not only Muslim women whose liberty is threatened.  Suppressing rather than celebrating diversity is the sure sign of a society that is closing down -- afraid of the threat posed by freedom.  The requirement to "dress neutrally" expresses intolerance for "otherness".  Defining what is forbidden -- i.e., outside the boundaries of "neutrality" -- is the definition of what "discrimination" means in practice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Affordable Care Act revision would reduce insured numbers by 24 million, CBO projects](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/obamacare-revision-would-reduce-insured-numbers-by-24-million/2017/03/13/ea4c860a-0829-11e7-93dc-00f9bdd74ed1_story.html)

The analysis predicts that the number of people without health coverage would rise to 52 million by 2026, compared with 28 million if the Affordable Care Act remains intact. That erosion would mean that about 1 in 5 U.S. residents would be uninsured by 2026  compared to 1 in 10 uninsured now and 1 in 6 who were uninsured before the Affordable Care Act was enacted...

While the deficit would be lower, the legislation also would reduce federal revenue by $592 billion by 2026 by repealing several taxes that the Affordable Care Act created to help pay for more people to get insurance  notably taxes on high-income Americans, hospitals and health insurers...

If the GOP plan is enacted, a 21-year-old making $68,200 would pay an average of $1,450 for a years worth of insurance premiums after the new tax credits, compared with $5,100 under the current law.

On the other hand, the cost of a years worth of premiums would stay about the same for a 64-year-old at the same income level. For a 64-year-old making $26,500, the cost would rise sharply, from $1,700 to $14,600.

Now I understand how the GOP plan will improve America's health.  Uninsured people die more quickly.  Kick sick old people out of the healthcare system, and the average surviving population will be healthier, and cheaper to insure.  Trumpcare motto: Survival of the Fittest! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The researchers examined six industries that account for 80 percent of private employment in the United States. In each one, they discovered a remarkably consistent upward trend in concentration. In manufacturing, for instance, the top four companies controlled 43 percent of sales in 2012, up from 38 percent in 1982. In finance, the figure grew to 35 percent, from 24 percent, and in retail trade it went to 30 percent, from 15 percent.

The faster concentration grew, the bigger the drop in labors share.

	<TEXT> This is from faith leaders of Nashville and middle-Tennessee.
It's important to recognize when laws don't work -- like Prohibition, and drug criminalization.  Bad laws need to be changed, but even before laws change, we need to minimize harm.  Jails and deportations will not succeed in holding back people for long.  A self-confident America once welcomed immigrants, successfully overcoming fears to build a great and diverse people.  Over the generations our identity evolves, but slowly.  Immigrants give their children to this country, and those children become us -- who we are.  Reverting to previous American identities would be turning against ourselves.  It is a fear-driven Un-American vision.  If that vision wins, whoever is left to live in that bitter country will be the poorer in every way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In January, the Obama administration changed the rules governing how the National Security Agency may share raw surveillance it intercepts abroad, where the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act does not apply and the agency may vacuum up private communications in bulk.

	<TEXT> Russo's treatment is fully understandable once one recognizes that the United States is no longer the United States that is a beacon of freedom to the world.  It is a paranoid security state, that will never be able to protect itself because the cost of paranoia is too high to bear.  It is the end of an Open Society (which depends on a broad degree of trust).  Chasing for enemies is the vortex that will take us down the drain. </TEXT>

The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And Im not judging, Im just saying socially thats where they are.

	<TEXT> Romulo Avelica-Gonzalez was arrested and will be deported.  His daughter, Fatima Avelica, used her phone to record the agents taking him into custody. Avelica-Gonzalez is an undocumented immigrant from Mexico and has lived in the United States for over 25 years.  What are the crimes that warrant tearing this man away from his children?

Avelica-Gonzalez was convicted of misdemeanor DUI and misdemeanor driving without a license in 2008. Another misdemeanor conviction, in 1998, was for receipt of stolen property when he bought a non-DMV-issued vehicle registration tag. 

These are either "crimes" that are made necessary by living without legal status, or, in the case of DUI, a crime for which deportation is a ridiculous response.  It is an excuse to deport, not a reason.

Yeah, The Law Is The Law.  But that's not what's actually happening here.  Romulo harmed nobody.  His arrest is a terror tactic to send a message.  Not so much to undocumented immigrants.  They will live in greater fear, and be subject to greater exploitation because of their increased vulnerability.  But they will stay.  There are too many of them to deport.  Consider the cost of deporting this one man, and multiply that by 11 million. The goal of the new deportation tactic is to satisfy Trump's white base that their anger now has force, and is government policy.  But this does nothing to solve any real problem that Trump supporters face in life.  The question is, will they ever notice that their anger has been directed against the wrong target? Immigrants and minorities may be easier to attack than the controlling 1%.  But if you win White Purity, what have you got?  A Police State looking for another enemy of the people to lock up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [COMMENT FROM PNHP](http://www.pnhp.org/news/2017/february/unitedhealths-gaming-of-medicare-is-now-in-court)

Private Medicare Advantage plans have gamed the system at the expense of taxpayers by surreptitiously selectively enrolling healthier, less costly patients, and then, when risk adjustment was introduced to correct for this favorable selection, the plans upcoded to qualify for higher payments by making the patients appear sicker than they really were.  Finally, the legal system has caught up with them. First a whistleblower suit was filed under the False Claims Act, and now,  the Justice Department has joined in that action....

Whether or not there is a technical violation of the regulations, it is the insertion of a rent-seeking intermediary that is the fundamental flaw here. Gaming favorable selection and risk adjustment does not occur in the traditional Medicare program. Gaming the system is expensive because it requires more administrative efforts to pull it off. The private plans have about five times the administrative costs of the traditional Medicare program, and we taxpayers are footing the bill....

Obviously the insurers violated what should have been the intent of the laws and regulations. But they will always do that if it accrues to their benefit. The solution is simple: throw them out, fix Medicare, and then expand it to include all of us. An immediate benefit is that it would also end discussion of all of the flawed policies being considered under repeal and replace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There could not be better evidence that the Republicans never did have an effective plan to replace the Affordable Care Act than the fact that they are now advancing legislation to protect the private insurers in the ACA exchanges - reinforcing them rather than shutting them down.

So their strategy has changed from repeal and replace, and then to repeal and repair, and now simply to repair - repair that will protect the private insurers.

Changing market rules to promote bare-bones private plans is the Republican version of providing access, but that would make actual health care truly unaffordable for a majority of Americans with significant medical needs because the very high out-of-pocket expenses would be beyond the capabilities of most American family budgets.

It appears that all of the Republican replace proposals would leave millions worse off. The replace that people want is affordable health care, but not merely a continuation of the inadequate policies of the Affordable Care Act. What they really want, though some do not realize it, is an equitably funded, universal health insurance program - an improved Medicare for all. That would give all of us affordable access to health care, and not just access to nearly worthless private health plans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the waning days of the Obama administration, James R. Clapper Jr., who was the director of national intelligence, and John Brennan, the CIA director at the time, shared Yatess concerns and concurred with her recommendation to inform the Trump White House. They feared that Flynn had put himself in a compromising position and thought that Pence had a right to know that he had been misled, according to one of the officials, who, like others, spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss intelligence matters.

A senior Trump administration official said that the White House was aware of the matter, adding that weve been working on this for weeks.

The current and former officials said that although they believed that Pence was misled about the contents of Flynns communications with the Russian ambassador, they couldnt rule out that Flynn was acting with the knowledge of others in the transition.

So Flynn has a choice: fall on his sword for the team, or point the sword at those who directed him -- Bannon? Miller? Trump? -- and make shish kebab.  What a revolting predicament! How could Flynn have suspected that his private conversation with the Russian Ambassador could be recorded by the NSA? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Tuesday, the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology is expected to hold a hearing on a bill to undermine health regulations that is based on a strategy cooked up by tobacco industry strategists more than two decades ago. At what Republicans on the committee have dubbed the Making EPA Great Again hearing, lawmakers are likely to discuss the Secret Science Reform Act, a bill that would limit the EPA to using only data that can be replicated or made available for independent analysis.

The proposal may sound reasonable enough at first. But because health research often contains confidential personal information that is illegal to share, the bill would prevent the EPA from using many of the best scientific studies. It would also prohibit using studies of one-time events, such as the Gulf oil spill or the effect of a partial ban of chlorpyrifos on children, which fueled the EPAs decision to eliminate all agricultural uses of the pesticide, because these events  and thus the studies of them  cant be repeated. Although it is nominally about transparency, the bill leaves intact protections that allow industry to keep much of its own inner workings and skewed research secret from the public, while delegitimizing studies done by researchers with no vested interest in their outcome.

	<TEXT> A few blocks away from Aljasem, John Dutcher, a 61-year-old house cleaner, lives in a complex of low-rise apartments in a neighborhood where American flags flapped on porches. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Dutcher said he was one of those guys who would want to put a pigs head on a mosque. I never acted on it, but I played it in my head.

I hated Muslims, he said.

For years, Dutchers neighbors were meth addicts and rowdy alcoholics. Slobs. In June, a Syrian family who spoke no English moved in. Another family moved in after that, then another. Now there are six.

Soon enough, Dutcher said, empty bottles in the hallway were replaced with childrens bicycles. The loud arguments of a drug-addicted couple were replaced by the sounds of childrens laughter.

The Muslims here were all about family and they just loved everyone, Dutcher said. I remember the people who lived here before; they took for granted everything this country gave them. These people, they really changed my heart.

And what about the despair of the Trump-loving meth addicts who were displaced by God-fearing family-loving Syrian refugees?  Their lives also matter.  Beyond right-wing populist nativism and liberal moral superiority there is a gap in the discussion.  Bernie Sanders got the direction right, but didn't show he could do what was necessary: provide enough hope for the future to those in America who live in despair -- enough confidence in the future so that their moral sights are raised, and they can imagine being members of a common humanity, who can afford to offer a helping hand to others in greater need then themselves.  Unless America's growing basket of discarded are re-knit back into the fabric of society, the future will be behind walls and behind prison bars.

	<TEXT> The difference between Bannon/Trump and politicians like McConnell is that Bannon/Trump disdains hypocrisy.  The game is Winner Takes All.  Bannon/Trump  believes that Killers Win, so it's vital to break from the politically correct stance that says that the USA is morally superior to Putin's Russia.  McConnell doesn't understand Bannon/Trump's game plan to Win.  That requires the world to be intimidated by the threat of naked aggression by the USA, and, accordingly, to submit to American power.  But before the world submits, Bannon/Trump must bring Americans under heel.  There is no better model for Bannon/Trump than the calculating cold-hearted killer Putin.  McConnell is caught out, in a unique act of courage, defending hypocrisy.  McConnell, you are on notice. Stay in your corrupt shell, and don't raise your head again.          </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spoiler: It is not a myth.  But skeptics, who really tried to poke holes in the underlying study, cast doubt by saying that you should reduce the estimate of agreement from 97% to 91%.  The original study has been updated:[Consensus on consensus: a synthesis of consensus estimates on human-caused global warming](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/4/048002) and sets the range of consensus:

The consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper. Those results are consistent with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al (Environ. Res. Lett. 8 024024) based on 11 944 abstracts of research papers, of which 4014 took a position on the cause of recent global warming. A survey of authors of those papers (N = 2412 papers) also supported a 97% consensus. Tol (2016 Environ. Res. Lett. 11 048001) comes to a different conclusion using results from surveys of non-experts such as economic geologists and a self-selected group of those who reject the consensus. We demonstrate that this outcome is not unexpected because the level of consensus correlates with expertise in climate science. At one point, Tol also reduces the apparent consensus by assuming that abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming ('no position') represent non-endorsement, an approach that if applied elsewhere would reject consensus on well-established theories such as plate tectonics. We examine the available studies and conclude that the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue is not whether Bannon needs Senate confirmation, but whether this President can hand over control of the flow of vital security information and analysis to Steve Bannon.  Bannon has an agenda: to manufacture enemies in order to restrict the human rights and civil liberties which are the foundations of American identity.  His goal is an America dominated by Right Wing political correctness: male, white, and Christian.  The Senate Committee on Homeland Security is now taking calls on Bannon's appointment to National Security Council.  The Southern Poverty Law Center reported that the Committee is tallying calls and emails.  The NSC is the most important security body in the White House, and no political operative - especially not this one - should have so much sway over the most important decisions effecting our domestic security and military policy.   Main Number: 202-224-4751   Call and express your opposition to Bannon's appointment to the NSC.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a terrific piece.  Ive been disappointed with most discussions of NAFTA (and on other trade agreements like TPP) from the left.  The critique made by Bernie Sanders is not clearly distinct from the economic nationalism of Trump.  Lori Wallach, Maude  Barlow, and Dean Baker make important points, but miss the essential role of workers as the counterweight to corporatist globalization.   

Changing the direction of the race   not to the bottom, but, rather, towards a rising vision for the future  is the fight worth waging.  I believe that the need to deal with climate change and resource constraints requires a focus on the real economy, and away from financialization.  It means lowering environmental impacts.  We have neither time nor resources to waste.  That means focusing on public goods to meet a greater share of human needs.  That can be the programmatic basis for a transnational working class alternative for globalization.  

Is that possible?  I dont know.  Workers struggles for the right to defend themselves is the place to start.  Solidarity across borders is required if any of those struggles is to succeed.  This piece gives me hope.
