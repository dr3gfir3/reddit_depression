Hey, guys. Its been a while. I know I promised you a lot. Said Id update as much as possible, and so far Ive held true to that promise. Ive been really, really busy lately. The people who were following Finn and I around a while ago are still at it. I dont know how they found us in Indy, but theyre good. *Real* good.

I just want you to know that Im scared. Im incredibly scared right now, and I have no idea what to do. I think this series is coming to a close, soon, but Im also pretty sure I may die soon as well. Okay, lets get into this.

~~

Now, finally, an answer to the number one question on everybodys mind: Whats Project Mermaid?

Well heres the long answer.

About two weeks before I met Finn and we left Dryston, I went for a swim. Yeah, I knew there was a conspiracy. Yes, I understood that Dryston was a dangerous place to live. But Isabelle was gone, so I couldnt unwind with her in her pool. So I decided to take a swim down memory river and hop into the good ol ocean.

I lived in Dryston for years, and somehow never noticed the complete lack of fish in this area. Which is weird because its the fucking ocean. 

~~

At this point, the towns population was ~560. Knowing what I know now, I assume its because the Cannery was trying to get rid of what theyd consider witnesses.

~~

The water was freezing, but it was a welcome change to the lukewarm, deaf shouting of the world around me.

~~

Everybody in Dryston knew that something very bad was happening. Maybe not at the level that I understood, but it was still there.

~~

My Dad was laying down in one of those beach benches, reading some 1960s crime novel. My Mom was in the water with me, ignoring me as usual.

~~

I began to float on my back, closing my eyes. I swished my feet around to slowly propel me through the water. As I floated, I noticed the world get brighter.

I opened my eyes to see that, for the first time, the Cannerys lights were on before midnight. I was so amazed I barely noticed the gel sliding around my ankle.

Barely.

I looked down to see Nightglow wrapping itself around my leg, like the time it tried to pull the jar back into the water. As it did, I slowly pulled myself up to the beach. It took three swift heaves to pull my foot out of the water.

My Mother was not as lucky as me.

You know those water boots that people wear sometimes to avoid stepping on rocks and crabs? Thats what she was wearing. Because of this, she didnt notice the Nightglow until it was halfway up her shin. The Cannery lights flashed, and she was pulled into the water, her arms flailing above her.

I watched, helpless, as she splashed her way to Haunted Island at a speed far faster than she could swim.

Id like to say she died quickly, but I saw her drown. The Nightglow wanted her alive as long as possible, only allowing her to come up for air in very short bursts until she stopped coming up altogether.

I turned to my Dad, to see if he knew what was going on, but he was facing away from me, towards the Cannery. I walked around in front of him to see what was going on but saw nothing out of the ordinary. He was staring directly at the lights, his eyes reflecting a blue tint.

I shouted to him, telling him I just watched my Mom drown to death, but he did nothing.

He did nothing until I waved my hands in front of his face.

He wanted to look at the lights, I know that much. So when I interrupted his concentration, he backhanded me.

He slapped me.

My Dad was a good man. He had never hit me, never even raised his voice. I figured it was just shock and headed back home.

I turned to look back at him and saw that he had begun to walk purposefully towards the Cannery.

That day marked the last day I would ever see my parents.

I sat at home for a while and cried. I knew that I wouldnt see my Dad again, and my Mother had just died in front of me because of my absolute favorite thing in the world-- Nightglow.

And then I began to plan. I checked the Dryston schedule, looked up old (doctored) news articles, thought back on my life. I remembered the circumstances surrounding Isabelles disappearance, remarking how strange they were. I remembered the pink-and-blue splatter on the wall. I remembered the fact that none of the doors could slam.

I remembered Project Mermaid.

I realized that Isabelle was likely dead, and so were all the other missing people. I realized that the gaps in my memory were likely there due to trauma. I realized that at the center of it all, metaphorically *and* literally, was Dryston Cannery.

And I was ***livid***.

	<TITLE> My watch is showing the wrong time. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-02 03:42:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am currently freaking out. Id ask you to excuse any grammatical errors or anything, but I doubt thatll happen.

This all started with my watch. 

Ive always loved clocks and timepieces. One might call me a Horophile if that didnt sound like a fetish. So when I got a pop-up on Instagram advertising free watches, I went to their site immediately.

Dozens of watches, most of which looked absolutely fabulous, were shown on screen. I chose three and ordered them immediately. The following week, they arrived.

Needless to say, I was excited. The watches looked even better in real life, and I immediately synced them up with my phone. My favorite one was a blue-and-white analog that looked like something someone in the navy would wear.

It was wonderful, at least for a few days.

Then it started acting up.

First, the date jumped forward by a day. That didnt matter so much, so I just flicked it back and didnt really worry about it for the rest of the day.

Then it jumped forward a day and four hours. All right, thats a bit annoying, but it only takes a minute to fix.

After a thousand different issues, I decided it wasnt worth the effort and retired it to my desk.

A couple of days passed with absolutely nothing strange happening until my friend texted me out of the blue.

Hey man. Do you mind if I borrow your blue and white watch for a little while? Itll be, like, a week at most. -DS (9:56 | 1/26/17)

I informed him that it was acting up, but he didnt seem to care all that much. Apparently, it was more for looks than anything else. So I lent it to him the next day, thinking that it wouldnt be much of an issue.

I was very, very wrong.

I didnt hear back from him for the next three days, but hes a busy guy (a lawyer) so I figured he was probably consulting with clients or something. On the fourth day, however, he told me something strange.

He was sitting at his desk, writing, when suddenly the watch cracked. He said he didnt hit it on anything, it just exploded, stuck on 6:52:03, January 31st. Of course, I was skeptical, but I decided that whether or not he was lying to me didnt really matter as long as he got it fixed. Hell, maybe itd even end up better than when I got it.

I sent him a couple pictures of what it looked like before it broke, and he set off to get it repaired. Apparently, he lived just a few blocks away from watch repair shop, so he could just run over there and get it fixed.

The watchmaker said that hed have to spend a little while on it, so my friend could just leave it here while it was repaired. Hed get an email when it was finished.

It was finished the next day. 

Hey man, your watch repairs just got finished. Imma bring it back to you tomorrow, that all good? - DS (6:28 | 1/31/17)

I told him that was fine, and at around 6:30 he set out.

Alright, just grabbed your watch. Its looking good. -DS (6:50 | 1/31/17)

A couple minutes later, I shot him an enthusiastic reply and turned on the news. I was met with footage of a bus driver arguing with a cop. Behind them was the censored but obviously mangled corpse of my friend.

Todays report showed that he only had two things in his pocket; his phone and a broken watch set to 6:52:03, January 31st. The exact time he died.

If any of you have an explanation for this, itd be much [appreciated](https://www.facebook.com/Forevergallifralone/).  </TEXT>
