And if we are going to be perfectly honest here I have yet to meet police officer that privately told me that reason for becoming officer is to protect and serve. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for job they do, and they should get all benefits and praises, however they should be responsible for their actions especially when those actions lead to loss of innocent life. 

Only than public perception will change and we can start talking about respect and compassion.  </TEXT>

Something must be wrong here, it must be fake news, because everyone knows that states with open carry gun laws don't have shootings in public places. Everyone knows it! Just ask anyone!!!

	<TEXT> Realistically speaking it would be impossible for all bible characters to be exclusively straight. Also it is not just " some of us Christians " that demonize homosexuality it is wast ( virtually all ) clergy that demonizes homosexuality, and that is precisely what matters. It is extremely important what preachers say to clergy. Heck I have more than one Christian priest on tape talking about evils of gay marriage during wedding ceremonies! Just imagine what they say behind closed doors. 

The issue that I have in with Bible in general is that no one could read or translate original transcript. Bible is written in a dead language that had about 3500 words in vocabulary. Words and phrases literarily had dozens of different meanings depending on the context so how can someone take anything written in it seriously? 

Further there is over 20 popular translation of Bible. Not a single one is same and often same passages have completely different meanings. 

Just check out this particular passage and number of different translations and meaning. Same could be applied to virtually every other part of Bible.

	<TEXT> New Jersey

Just like many others states, corruption in politics is out of hand. 

For example since early 80s every mayor of my town ether resigned or ended up in prison during their term. 

Funny thing is that because of some local law new mayor is chosen by a single person that is assigned to that position ( this person is appointed and can't be replaced unless mayor chooses to do so ) ... Oddly enough same person has been assigning all these crooked mayors since, you guessed it, early 80s :) 

We have mayoral election coming up and as of right now only relevant candidate is the guy that was assigned to that position. I just wonder how long before he ends up in prison too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how patriotic this was, but to me most uniting moment I have experienced was when almost entire Northeast and parts of Midwest along with parts of Canada lost electricity in 2003. I was driving from New Jersey to Manhattan when it happened and on radio they were already warning people ~~about looting and riots as soon as it gets dark~~ fear mongering. 

In reality everyone came together! People with cars were ( my self included ) were cramming complete strangers in cars to give them a ride. Random civilians were standing on the intersections regulating traffic. Even some restaurants were giving away food for free. 

Once it got dark people were just hanging out on the streets and connecting with neighbors ( totally unusual for Manhattan ) 

Gogol Bordello even made a song about it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzBpkkM3qP8

It was truly magical moment in the sense that everyone came together without any prejudice even though media was telling us otherwise.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is the thing, only small number of cities actually oblige. Majority just stay quiet and don't enforce policy even though they are not officially sanctuary cities. 

I'll give you an example form personal experience. Amarillo, TX is not officially sanctuary city, right? Well, I personally know refugee family that was relocated to Amarillo by US government and given job at one of Amarillo's massive slaughterhouses, and it wasn't just them it was hundreds of people that escaped Bosnian Civil War. Now here is where it gets interesting and relevant. These slaughterhouses employ thousands of people and majority of them are illegal immigrants. Everyone knows that, and in some cases they even provide mobile home type of housing for "temporary work force" yet local law enforcement and prosecutors never raided employers nor did they prosecute any of them form employing illegals. Why? Well, because they know that if they prosecute and deport people involved massive chuck of income for local government and residents alike will disappear in to a thin air. Further more it would create vacuum in supply and increased prices for you and me because employers would not be able to find US workforce willing to stand in blood up to their ankles 12 hours per day and get paid $4-6 per hour with no benefits or overtime. And that brings back me to my original point that I already talked about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is not local law enforcements job to handle matters of immigration, they are not paid, qualified or trained to do this.

Only fraction of people actually crosses border illegally by running trough a dessert or in hidden compartments of various vehicles. Vast majority of people actually come to US legally and than overstay their visa. 

If he really wanted to get serious about immigration he would go after employers like [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/20/us/tyson-foods-indicted-in-plan-to-smuggle-illegal-workers.html) or [this](http://www.foxnews.com/story/2006/04/16/many-illegal-immigrants-have-jobs-in-us-before-crossing-border.html)

And it is not just Tyson Foods and Asian Restaurants. Truth is US food and in some cases manufacturing and service industries can't afford to pay workers fair wage along with pension and medical coverage. 

Point is that people would stop coming if employers would stop hiring. Trump knows this because he is one of employers that hires these people trough various subcontractors. That is why we have this farce of immigration policy and publicity stunt like policies that only waste everyones time and money and don't address real problem.  </TEXT>

With that said this just goes to show how valuable Rondo really is. You can hate him all you want, but in my opinion he is still top PG and one of the few people in the league that actually makes entire team much, much better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some common sense laws regarding guns should be federal, for example making sure that person is mentally stable should be no brainer or having mandatory training so that people that own guns know how to use them. 

I don't really think that anyone relevant on the left is arguing in favor of blanket ban on anything. Rhetoric coming form NRA and interest groups like NRA is that you can't give an inch because if you do "they will come and take your guns away" and that is nothing more than brainwashing.

	<TEXT> Well, I grew up in civil war and was protesting one of the most vicious dictators in modern European history. Milosevi did send out armed forces police and military on people/protestors. Heck he even send fucking tanks on people/protestors. Only reason why there was no bloodshed is because opposition organizers as well as protestors refused to engage. We were literarily fighting them with fists, sticks and rocks. No one ever fired a single bullet.

Also you have to understand that in situations like this people protecting dictator are corrupt and some already have blood on their hands, and by defending his regime they are defending them selfs too. They are well aware that once regime falls people will eat them alive. 

For the record Serbians love guns just as much as Americans. Grandfather give me first hunting rifle when I was 13 and I carried gun (illegally during civil war) when I was 15. 

Can you even begin to imagine aftermath where you have about 150000 protestors on one side and about 50000 of police on other killing each other on the streets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We can't really deny/ignore dozens of needless wars and conflicts that America in fact instigated. 

Ever since WWII our largest and most profitable manufacturing industry is exclusively making killing tools. We need consumers to unload all those goods and war is definitely most efficient way of getting rid of large quantities of product. 

With that said, I don't think that we should blame solders even though they willingly go in to fight. We should blame people that send them in to harms way because of their self interest. 

There is many mainly socio-economic reasons why would one join the Army, and once they are there they must follow orders.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is another perspective. 

More GROUND MAINTENANCE WORKERS die in the line of duty than cops. Exaggeration of danger that cops face on daily bases and narrative that you are pushing is what literarily allows them to get away with murder. 

If we prosecute and convict cops ( just like regular people ) when they use deadly force for no reason at all, general public would show much more support, respect and most importantly trust in to police force in general.
