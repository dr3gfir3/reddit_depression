	<TEXT> This looks more immediately practical than Momentum Machines' Rube Goldberg approach, as demonstrated by the fact that it's already being deployed. At the moment, it only flips burgers and puts them on a bun, but that's a useful labor-saving skill on its own. (I wondered why they didn't just create a griddle "slot" that heated both sides simultaneously instead of creating a high-tech flipper, until I saw the arm transfer the patty to the bun.) You can imagine a future arm programmed to add toppings, or one that ferries fries in and out of the fryer. There's already an [automatic drink maker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akv4vSXa5a4) in operation.

By having the robot adapt to the kitchen, instead of replacing the kitchen with a complex assembly system as Momentum does, you allow a human to take over if the machine is out of service. This also keeps the griddle in service if the restaurant wants or needs to change what it makes or how it makes it without reconfiguring a closed-box contraption.

I'm excited to see new automation in action, but worried about the eventual impact. The video tries to stress "there's still a happy worker there, smiling at his robot buddy," but the only reason to do this is to reduce labor. And the restaurant industry is a massive employer. </TEXT>

Members of the Front de libration du Qubec (FLQ) kidnapped the provincial cabinet minister Pierre Laporte and the British diplomat James Cross. In response, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau invoked the only peacetime use of the War Measures Act. The kidnappers murdered Laporte, and negotiations led to Cross's release and the kidnappers' exile to Cuba.

That's not as quaint as I was expecting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recommend reading the [original report](http://tonyortega.org/2017/03/03/lapd-probing-scientology-and-danny-masterston-for-multiple-rapes-cover-up/). I couldn't post it because it's a blog post, but it's written by the former editor of the Village Voice, who now writes extensively about Scientology.

The LAPD has long been accused of covering for Scientology, which funds LAPD charities and has a policy called "safe-pointing" to develop financial and other relationships with local police and officials for "protection." In this report, a victim had her case transferred to one officer at the LAPD who took a particular interest in her case. The officer warned her not to speak with any other officers about her case, and took her case out of the LAPD computers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like you might be from Singapore, so I'm guessing this is a sincere question (but it looks funny to an American). I know that especially in smaller, more densely populated countries, department stores are more likely to be in population centers and carry groceries, but in the US, most department stores and enclosed shopping malls are in suburbs miles away from the city center, where property is cheaper, often off highways. You generally can't walk to them, and they don't carry groceries. It became more common in the '90s for a single upscale mall to open in the city center, but you can't run an efficient and competitive grocery operation with only one store per city.

In residential areas, there are grocery store chains, as well as superstores like Walmart and Target that sell general merchandise in addition to groceries. They differ from department stores in a few ways, most definitionally in that they don't have registers in each department and instead have a bank of registers at the front of the store. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're different categories in NAICS, the coding system used by government, and are therefore reported separately in government reports. Another big difference is that US department stores don't carry groceries and are therefore not part of consumers' weekly shopping habits. It's a good thing they're reported separately, too, because they're experiencing very different sales trends, and we couldn't see that if we didn't make the distinction. Consumers are clearly treating department stores and superstores differently, so why shouldn't we distinguish them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The easiest and most immediately effective step would be to make their taxation progressive (it's currently [regressive](http://www.itep.org/whopays/states/michigan.php)), so that they stop literally taking money from the poor. However, Republicans are proposing the opposite. They recently caved on a plan to eliminate their (slightly progressive) income tax altogether, which would leave them to rely more on their highly regressive sales tax that hits the poor hardest and a property tax that hits the middle class hardest. But Republicans are back with a new income tax cut, again leaving the resulting tax structure more regressive than before, putting a greater share of the state's tax burden on the poor and middle class. (And in other states where Republicans cut income taxes, they subsequently raised sales taxes to make up the losses, redistributing wealth from the poor to the rich.) </TEXT>

In England, death by asphyxiation from breathing oven fumes had accounted for roughly half of all suicides up until the 1970s, when Britain began converting ovens from coal gas, which contains lots of carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which has almost none.

	<TEXT> And for those without the time to read the study: **Suicides did not go up on weekdays** to compensate (they were unchanged).

It basically just comes down to not having an effective suicide method readily available. [Most people don't plan their suicide:](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92319314)

70 percent [of suicide attempt survivors] said they **thought about it for less than an hour**; and a whopping 24 percent said the idea had occurred to them less than five minutes before their attempt.

Another example (same source):

In England, death by asphyxiation from breathing oven fumes had accounted for roughly half of all suicides up until the 1970s, when Britain began converting ovens from coal gas, which contains lots of carbon monoxide, to natural gas, which has almost none. During that time, **suicides plummeted roughly 30 percent**  and the numbers haven't changed since.

Removing a suicide method like a gun works the same way as removing carbon monoxide coal gas did there, as [guns are the deadliest method of suicide.](http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/21/guns-most-deadly-choice-in-suicide-attempts/2572097/)

Also, stories about suicide have been shown to make depressed people think about suicide, so I want to put the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline number here: **1-800-273-8255**. There's also [online chat](http://chat.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/GetHelp/LifelineChat.aspx). </TEXT>

Those are prepared, too, probably because producers want a topic on that didn't make the list. Sometimes they'll have a photo or video ready for an unlisted topic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It could also be that some guests aren't that interested in news and politics, so having to consume it and prepare new material about it for every show is a chore. Notice that Alan used two topical shows as his examples. Panelists have openly complained about having to come up with fresh material about Brexit every week.

And preparing comedy material is work. Standups can develop one set and live off it for months on tour. Having to create new stuff for every show is a writing job. Frankie once said his least favorite round of Mock the Week was Headliners, because he had to come up with multiple successful punchlines under such strict constraints (What's funny about this picture that begins with T___ F___ H___ C___?) Paula Poundstone once said she hated the Bluff The Listener round of Wait Wait because you have to prepare an entire story. </TEXT>

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them *or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking Pence would wait until after the midterms, because of how term limits work for partial terms. If someone is president for the majority of a term (over 2 years), they can only have one more term. But if they've been in office less than 2 years, they can have two more terms,  or nearly ten years in office. But Trump may be forcing an early intervention. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mao was not the first dictator to use the phrase enemies of the people, of course. Nazi German leaders applied it to the Jewish people decades before, including Goebbels, who declared them a sworn enemy of the German people. Hitlers writing, thinking, and perhaps actions may have been inspired by an Ibsen play of the same name, some scholars believe.

This is the more likely inspiration, given Ivana's revelation that he [kept a book of Hitler's speeches on his nightstand.](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/09/trump-files-donalds-big-book-hitler-speeches) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try a nearby credit union for fee-free banking. They have networks of thousands of free ATMs, too.

For occasional international travel, I'd recommend a credit card with no foreign transaction fee and no annual fee, preferably a Visa, which is most widely accepted. The only card I can think of that fits those criteria is a BofA Travel Rewards card. You don't need a BofA bank account to get it, and it doesn't require excellent credit. A credit card is safer abroad, because the creditor is liable for 100% of all fraudulent charges, even if you don't notice for weeks. If you don't want debt, just pay it off before interest is charged, which is 25 days after the monthly cycle ends. </TEXT>
