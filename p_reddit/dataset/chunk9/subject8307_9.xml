	<TEXT> In Siberia . In the 1800s and 1900s up to 40% of certain villages were killed by the smallpox virus. Those victims were buried in the permafrost.

Now that permafrost is melting. Turns out freezing viruses does not kill them, in fact, it preserves them.

They found corpses that bore sores that look like the marks left by smallpox.

While the experts  dressed in protective clothing because of the risks  did not find the virus itself, they did detect fragments of its DNA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> all of this started with evolution.

Once you can throw out the scientifically validated concept of evolution as a "lie from Satan.", Then you could basically throw out any scientific concept whatsoever that you feel even slightly uncomfortable with.

I mean, consider a lot of these people believe in a literal six-day creation. That the earth is literally only 6000 years old. This flies in the face of about 713 different scientific disciplines and literally millions of scientific studies and papers.  But who cares? They can just chuck it all the window and never think about it again

Climate change? pshaw

Poor people? Lazy.

Unending warfare? As long as we get to kill Muslims Fine with me.

it is an entire world based on bizarre rules of logic, no consistent reasoning, an active contempt for science, and for some strange reason a near worshipful attitude toward corporate power. It's highly destructive

https://www.wired.com/2017/01/not-screw-spending-1-trillion-us-infrastructure/

Do we have the money? Of course not. Not last administration, and not this administration.

You know what we do have the money to do, though?

Apparently we have unlimited funds to destroy infrastructure in other countries. Iraq's infrastructure For instance, has been pretty much decimated since we've been there. We destroyed Libya's infrastructure and then never rebuilt it After we "liberated" that country A couple years back.

And these days we are destroying Syria's infrastructure, and then just today we dropped the largest nonnuclear bomb in history  on Afghanistan's infrastructure.

So basically we roll around the world spending trillions of dollars destroying other countries infrastructures, neglecting our own infrastructure, and then whining and crying because some people don't like America

Are you going to sit there and look me in the eye and tell me both sides are the same? Give me a break. The facts, the statistics and observable reality says they are not the same

the point is the right wing seems to have no actual philosophy, other than "when we do something, it's good. When they (i.e. evil liberals) do the exact same thing It's bad."

it's fundamentally insane. And this country is going to pay for this insanity

To give some perspective. The recent US missile strike on an abandoned airfield in Syria (which was in use days later) cost well over $100 million.

So this is about the same cost as 1.3 missile strikes that seem to have mysteriously missed most of their targets.

Which do you think is a better investment?

another way of looking at it is  this. The "war" on Isis cost US taxpayers $1.5 billion a a month. So this program could be funded for entire school year on what we are paying for a fantastically ineffectual and tragic war that is accomplishing nothing

You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky

You look pretty good down here

But you ain't really good


It seems to be suggesting a person has died and left the body, and now faces judgment of his life. But St. Peter cannot be bribed with money. Maybe he/she was viewed as a good person on earth, but it's a different thing On the other side.

Breaking through the atmosphere

And things are pretty good from here

Remember everything will be alright

We can meet again somewhere

Somewhere far away from here

Again with the theme of leaving the earth, and looking back on it. "We can meet again." Refers to the people he is leaving behind.

We never learn, we been here before

Sort of has a reincarnation theme, or a Buddhist wheel of samsara thing going on. The notion you continue to reincarnate again and again until you finally learn the lessons you have been trying to learn

I remember when I was a kid, my racist grandfather LOVE Archie Bunker. He was one of his heroes.

This has ALWAYS been a genius of Archie Bunker. Liberals take it as satirical commentary, whereas right-wingers take it quite literally.

It's why the show was one of the most successful television shows in history

take the dude's idiotic racist blanket statements and title them things like "Archie Bunker exposes [racial/political/religious group]" as if these horrific statements weren't parody

Right, that has always been the popular reaction to Archie Bunker from right-wingers since day one. It's nothing new. Trust me, I'm telling you from first-hand experience </TEXT>

We should do away with the absolutely specious notion that everybody has to earn a living. It is a fact today that one in ten thousand of us can make a technological breakthrough capable of supporting all the rest. The youth of today are absolutely right in recognizing this nonsense of earning a living. We keep inventing jobs because of this false idea that everybody has to be employed at some kind of drudgery because, according to Malthusian Darwinian theory he must justify his right to exist. So we have inspectors of inspectors and people making instruments for inspectors to inspect inspectors. The true business of people should be to go back to school and think about whatever it was they were thinking about before somebody came along and told them they had to earn a living.

???????????????????????

what the hell are you talking about?

******  SPOILERS   **************

The central ethical issue of the movie presents a scenario in which you could murder millions of people, with the INTENTION of creating a better world. Which Initially Did happen. Dr. Manhattan did indeed create a better world

So it begs the question Is it okay to kill a few million completely innocent people If the ends justify the means?

of course Rorschach fucked the whole thing up At the end 

are you aware that US Armed Forces just killed a bunch of innocent civilians in Syria? And, in fact, the wars started by America in Iraq and Afghanistan have killed literally HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of civilians. 500,000 innocent men, women and child in Iraq alone. But we justify this by saying "well, we're fighting the bad guys and helping to create a better world."

In other words, the question here presented in this film are entirely and completely relevant to today's global, social, geopolitical  scenario </TEXT>

	<TEXT> fun fact!

There are three videos by the weeknd, that when viewed together form a coherent story. The story is about an unknown singer who meets a kind of Mephistopheles figure, makes a deal with that guy, becomes famous, regrets his deal with the devil, attempts to negate the deal, fails and winds up realizing he cannot out run the devil and accept his fate.

notice how everything changes when he makes the deal and the Mephistopheles figure throws the lighter at 2:40

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs

notice that 2:12. It's the same guy, only this time, things are different. he kills the Mephistopheles figure and buries his body in the desert. His deal with the devil has been canceled Or so he thinks.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs


but things don't go well , and he crashes and burns Literally. Uh oh! Who is that at 3:48? Looks like he's holding an Apple, obvious Garden of Eden reference

	<TEXT> I watch a lot of cooking shows, and the amount of sugar These people are adding to main courses that are supposed to be savory is insane

barbecue is the worst offender. First, they marinate the meat in some kind of vinegar base with tons of brown sugar added, then they baste it while it's cooking with some kind of sauce that has tons of sugar added, then they top it off with barbecue sauce infused with tons of sugar again.

Virtually every sauce, dressing, and whatnot I see these people adding cupfuls of sugar to

I absolutely love love love Thai food. But those people sure do like to add palm sugar to everything.

I mean if you're consuming this much sugar in the main course, then you're drinking sweet tea or Coca-Cola with your meal, and then finishing it off with a piece of pie you have consumed enough calories for a small family for entire week.

And people wonder why we're so overweight!

I like my savory dishes Savory!

The working-class got used and abused, and essentially raped by the corporate class. The working-class then got angry and irrationally lashed out at the wrong targets.

It's human history. It's always the same thing. The wealthy elite want to extract as much capital and resources from the working-class as they can, even if that means massive suffering. It sociopathic essentially.

And then when things go wrong The corporate class asks "oh, golly Gee! What could possibly have caused this?"

One of the first people to introduce zen Buddhism to Japan, also brought the tea leaf with him from China.

Because of that tea and Buddhism have always been intricately linked in Japan, thus giving rise to the tea ceremony.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eisai.

The zen monks loved to drink the tea because the caffeine gave them energy to meditate all night if necessary. So if you do drink caffeinated drinks with your meditation, you are in good company.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_tea_ceremony

However! I would not recommend drinking coffee Since it's a cholagogue, which means that it stimulates the liver to produce bile which is a big part of the digestive process. I think green tea is best, personally. </TEXT>

If you're really interested in the nutrition aspect of it, then Dr. Jason Fung is the guy you want to listen to. Also, Dr. Rhonda Patrick has some good things to say. Go to YouTube and put in Jason's name and you get tons of great videos.

I do short fasts of two  three days. But even a short fasts of 24 hours is still beneficial. I eat nothing at all, although I will sip on watered-down Gatorade from time to time. I also take endogenous ketones in supplement form. Ketones are what your body produces during a fast, and are fantastically healthy, anti-inflammatory, appetite suppressing, and great brain fuel

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted about meditation combined with fasting before.

https://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation/comments/5xhixc/nothing_and_i_mean_absolutely_nothing_will/

I just got done with another short fast, during which I did quite a bit of meditation. There is something That happens when you fast, and meditate at the same time where you are able to see deep deep into your soul. You are able to see things that otherwise would remain hidden, and you can confront those things, and let go of those things.

I have made more progress during short periods of fasting and meditation than I have in months and months of just meditating alone. once you reach a certain fasting level, you can clear your mind and enter into a deep meditative state in about 2 to 3 minutes.

it's funny because I'm on fasting subreddits, and nobody there talks about meditation.  And I'm on meditation subs and nobody there talks about fasting. It's the COMBINATION of the two that is so incredibly powerful.

if you feel stuck,or sluggish in your meditation practice, try fasting. You will be amazed.

Reddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis Ohanian in 2005. Cond Nast Publications acquired the site in October 2006. Reddit became a direct subsidiary of Cond Nast's parent company, Advance Publications, in September 2011. As of August 2012, Reddit operates as an independent entity, although Advance is still its largest shareholder.[9] 

however, my point still stands. Whoever owns Reddit.com I'm 100% convinced, absolutely loves the_donald. They view it as a jewel in their Crown, they don't see it as a black eye so many people here see it </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  the beast that has been haunting reddit for more than a year now. 

I actually find that sentiment somewhat amusing. This website is owned by Cond Nast, and despite that specific sub Reddit wildly violating rule after rule after rule they were never deleted nor even barely punished. This is despite the fact that other subs that only did 1/64th of what they did were permanently deleted.

Why?

Simple. Traffic. Clicks. Advertising dollars. Etc.

Cond Nast WANTED and LOVED this sub. In fact, my crazy wacky conspiracy theory is that most media related entities wanted Donald Trump is president simply because they knew it would be great for business. They did not give a shit how bad or good of a president he would be, they just knew it would be good for their bottom line </TEXT>

God loves each and every person, every single human being, totally and completely unconditionally. And wants the absolute best for each person. That's God's will.

We also know God is just, punishing somebody for the actions of another person is not just

Anyway, that's how I see it. Sorry to be harsh. It's just that when I hear people saying that children might be punished in the afterlife for something they had nothing to do with, it just doesn't sit right with me </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Advances in agricultural science are the reason why, at least in some countries, the vast majority of people don't go hungry.

good grief This is corporate propaganda At its worst.

But an extensive examination by The New York Times indicates that the debate has missed a more basic problem  genetic modification in the United States and Canada has not accelerated increases in crop yields or led to an overall reduction in the use of chemical pesticides.

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/business/gmo-promise-falls-short.html

GMO Has done exactly fuck all to increase crop yields, and/or to feed hungry people, or to reduce pesticide use. Literally the only thing it's been good for to vastly increase corporate control over our food system.

and here is one of the monsters from Kong

http://imgur.com/a/qPtVA

The two monsters are very very very similar. The shape of their heads, Their mouths, teeth, and tongues are almost identical. Plus they are both reptilian like creatures, neither has very much personality, and both are essentially murder machines hell-bent on killing humans For some reason. their mannerisms are very similar, their intelligence level seems to be about the same, etc.

Is that a coincidence? Did 2 completely unrelated creative teams dream up nearly identical monsters for two separate films that just happened to be released at the same time?

is that possible? I don't know enough about how Hollywood works, but as an outsider looking in that seems extraordinarily unlikely.

Thoughts?

for the longest time they completely and totally denied climate change altogether. Then when the evidence became absolutely overwhelmingly obvious, they shifted gears and said, "okay, maybe there is climate change. But it is DEFINITELY not caused by humans!"

They continue to move the goalposts. remember the "pause" in global warming. A few years back? They were all over that llike flies on shit. Then when it became obvious there really was no pause Suddenly they dropped that and never mentioned it again

They are coming from a fundamentally dishonest stance.  That is why it's so difficult to debate them. They did not arrive at their conclusions to reason and logic. They arrived at their conclusions through emotions and biases and sometimes pure belligerence.

Question: Have you ever fasted and prayed? Most Christians are simply completely ignorant about the power of fasting. Fasting will accelerate your spiritual growth like nothing else, it will also somewhat dissolve the barrier between this world and the spirit world, making hearing the voice of the spirit easier.

Only YOU can decide what is right here. But you have to get in touch with your deepest spirit to know that. My advice is to take some time away and fast and pray about this and find out what you really really want to do deep deep inside of you. Find out what you truly believe is in the best interest of both yourself and your father.

	<TEXT> Last night's dateline was a look into the Sarah Goode case. You can watch the whole episode here.

http://www.nbcnews.com/dateline.

Text update here

http://abc7ny.com/news/dante-taylor-gets-life-without-parole-in-murder-of-sarah-goode/1448294/

I'm not going to go into the whole background of the case because it's no longer an unsolved mystery. However! Two things really popped out from this episode.

1. So her car was found abandonment on a street, near a housing complex shortly after she went missing. A whole army of friends and family turned out to volunteer to search the area. They searched and searched and found nothing.

Fast forward a few months they decide to look around in the same area, and lo and behold, her body was there within walking distance of the car. And had been there the whole time.

In other words, an entire army of volunteers simply missed a dead body that was laying right in plain sight.

So anybody who says, "there's no way that person/that body could be in that area because the search party looked there." Well You're just wrong. if they had not decided to go back and look, who knows how long it would of been before they found the body

2. The police in this country  time and again and again act in extraordinarily unprofessional manners that jeopardize investigations.

In this case they were grabbing people who they only vaguely suspected of the crime, screaming and hollering at them, slapping them around, and insisting that they tell the police where the body is. Turns out all of the people they did that to were completely innocent.

do you honestly think that kind of behavior is helping to solve crimes?

And then when they finally arrested the correct suspect, ***they didn't even read him his rights!***  I mean Come on! This meant they had to let him go free, even though they knew it was him due to fingerprints. But the fingerprints were going to be dismissed because they didn't read his rights. Unbelievable.

Luckily for them, somebody else came forward  and they were able to charge the suspect in a separate incident, and therefore got his fingerprints after all.

**The cops in this country desperately need more training and better instructions.**  I'm sorry, but our police officers suck
