	<TEXT> Yup, he's mentioned in interviews before that our buildings have gotten taller and operate in 3 dimensions, but our roads are still 2 dimensions and haven't caught up. Underground roads would essentially create the equivalent of "skyscrapers" of highways. He's got a good point, even in cities with extensive public transit to handle demand, the roads just bottleneck and dont have the capacity to handle what the cities need because there's only one level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm willing to bet this is their first step towards eventually being able to show you how outfits will look on you without needing to try them on. Thus eliminating one of the last remaining reasons people buy clothes at brick and mortar stores. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buses in their current incarnation are very very unappealing and bad solutions to the function they're meant to serve: "last mile" transportation. 

In an ideal scenario where a city's subway and commuter rail is relatively comprehensive, buses should be designed to take passengers from the subway/train station nearest to their destination, to a bus stop that's even closer to their destination, minimizing walking required. 

The problem is that buses are currently behemoths that are way too big for the roads/lanes they drive on, are super loud and spew fumes as others have said, and bus stops don't adequately provide seating and protection from weather.

Make them electric, shrink them down to sizes that can make turns without taking up 2.5 lanes (while increasing number of buses to make up for smaller size), and improve the bus stops themselves, and people will happily use them.

I live in NYC, by far the most transit oriented city in America, and even here, people who use subway and commuter rail daily cannot stand buses. Buses aren't "uncool", they just suck. Thankfully Lyft and Uber are working on shuttle services with fixed routes, and we can see how such an improved system will increase ridership. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he constantly intervened and prevented people from inflicting suffering on others, then there would be no free will and people would be "good" only because they had no choice, not because they willingly chose to be. We would essentially be robots. The existing of suffering is an unfortunate side effect of that free will policy. Us humans are the source of the suffering, not God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you're observing is the result of free will. God didn't force any human to act this way, we choose to. </TEXT>
