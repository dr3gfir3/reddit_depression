	<TEXT> These photos reveal something the government is especially guilty of doing: over-classifying tons of data. There is so much information that gets stamped with NATSEC clearance for reasons that can only be explained by lawyers familiar with NATSEC legalese and they certainly can't comment about it (nor are they going to lobby against a proliferation of it). Rather we the people need to take a look at declassified data and go WTF are we classifying this for? At what cost? For what purpose? Everything costs money. Even if it's just the stamps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is being marketed but not to a wide audience. They're doing a slow burn aimed at their core, but like others have said, I'm sure the powers that be at Sony saw a cut and demanded a bunch of re-shoots, hopefully some additional scenes, better CGI ... maybe a better ending, who knows? Only time will tell. I'd actually be fine with Sony pushing the release back from summer to fall or winter and taking even MORE time to make sure what they release is worth the Dark Tower brand because if they play this right, and god knows they should, they could have a HUGE franchise that they could mine for decades.  </TEXT>
