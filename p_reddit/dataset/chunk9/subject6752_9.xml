	<TEXT> Innovation can also means when someone takes a solution and makes it better.

Ex: Mobile Payment and Fingerprint on Phones

The ideas weren't made by Apple, true, but I believe we can all agree when I say that Apple innovated with the mobile payments. It also even forced Google to make an app to follow suit (Google Wallet - Android Pay) and Samsung got in the game.

For Fingerprints, Apple didn't invent thay. Motorola made a phone with it first. Once Apple implemented in their phones and improved the solution (in-app, mobile payment, etc) everyone else followed suit.

In the Airpod's case:


Is Apple the first to make Bluetooth earphones that aren't connected by a wire? No. Does that mean Apple innovated with them? Arguably. Look at the way it handles audio. With most Bluetooth earphones, the audio signal goes into one ear piece and then from that ear piece, it's sent to the second ear piece. The problem with this is that this creates a lag of 30-40 milliseconds or so while the audio is sent to each ear piece and then synced up together. That's fine if you're just listening to music, but if you're watching a movie or something, the audio will be off. Apple fixed this by sending two Bluetooth signals, one to each piece. This means that there's no delay while audio is sent from one piece to the second. That's innovation in my book. No, not the definition where they had to invent something new, but the definition where someone grabbed a solution and made it better

	<TEXT>  i'm curious how water resistant it really is.

I believe what I did was more strong than showering with the phone.

I took the phone to DR for vacation. I went to a water park, and took photos underwater and used my phone in the surface of the pool. Once in a while I would go on slides and record myself going down. At the end of the slide there is a 4-5 feet pool so to be safe I would raise my hand grabbing the phone so it doesn't go deep down, but it could still get its share of water splash on it. 

Everything works fine until this day. Just be smart about it. Don't take it to the 10ft area, for example. 

Some YT (specifically one from EverythingApplePro) videos shows that the phone can even beat the Galaxy S7 in a water resistant test. Note that the 7 is rated IP-67 and the S7 is rated IP-68 </TEXT>
