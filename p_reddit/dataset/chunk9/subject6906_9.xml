	<TEXT> In terms of programs, RBS is not THAT highly regarded. Most of RBS's image and reputation is due to the close proximity of NYC. Therefore, it's easier for recruiters to come to campus and recruit for their respective companies.  Many RBS alumni have positions with many top financial firms. Yet, Those companies come to Rutgers to recruit the ABSOLUTE best in the class. Remember, there are many other business schools who are recruited as much or more than RBS. 

However, college is college. Pick the best school for your situation. Financially, you will have to pay one way or another. Don't bank on Rutgers close proximity to NYC as a true selling point. This is because there are a lot of variables involved to achieve a job in NYC. If you are determined to be in NYC, then consider Rutgers. There are no guarantees to anything, though. 

There are a lot of opportunities b/c of NYC, BUT you have to do everything within your control to put yourself in a position for consideration.   

RBS has a ton of programs that help with connections and networking events for RBS students only. Again, it's still a gamble because sometimes it's being at the right place at the right time.  

If you're in-state (Illinois), attend Illinois do well and do whatever you can to network.  You'll be much happier knowing that your debt (if any) is more manageable than paying more for a similar education and for other so-called selling points that may not be there for you.  

In other words, consider all the factors that are within your control when choosing either Rutgers or Illinois-Urbana/Champaign. 

The factors out of your control have the potential to mislead you. Generally, the high performing, well connected students at RU have a higher probability to work in NYC. Intern, Intern, Intern. Fall, Spring and Summer. It's the main way to stay connected to employers in the area and gain experience.  It def helps with the competition for jobs as so many students from the Tri-State area target NYC with employment aspirations. 

Good Luck!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a fair amount of them that live off of daddy's money and still breastfeed from their mother's nipples. One of my buddy's knew someone that was given a "weekly allowance." And when he ran out of money, his parents refilled his Debit Card for him. LOL </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the "college age" students seem to perceive things differently. College is very status driven. The group think mentality is alive and well. It's troubling to think that people will label you for being a responsible person. It makes you realize just how many people deal with serious insecurity issues on campus. 

Taking up the entire sidewalk with your bros, so other's can't pass is cold and elitist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is correct. Strange, right? I'd say once you get into higher level classes with upperclassman, students generally have a more mature approach to things. However, that's not always the case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some are ignorant and think it's not normal for people to attend college outside of the range of 18-24. Also, if you didn't attend Rutgers from Freshman year on....some people seem to think that social openness concludes after their 1st year. 

Many RU students attend the school as 1st years on and don't understand the fact that life happens...  I have friends who were in the same position as you.  There are a lot of rich, stuck up brats who think their shit doesn't stink.  They've lived inside a bubble and have been coddled by their parents.  Therefore, when they see older students in their classes, the lack of knowledge of the real world shows. If you have become the object of derision, don't take it personal...it's a bunch of misguided "adults" with minimal real-world experience. It's a lack of understanding that it's never to late to attend college nor is it shameful to have a gap in education.  Their responsibilities and priority structures are much different, too.  

If you come to class, then leave after its over to work part-time, take care of family, etc....it's not something these students are aware of.  Many times these students will have plans after leaving class....and those plans do not include raising a family or returning home to do adult things. Rather, those plans include getting drunk on Fireball and fucking like jack rabbits.

I wouldn't worry too much. Tell them to buddy up and back stroke it. Also, ask them how it feels to have signed their lives away for the next 30 years (Loans).
