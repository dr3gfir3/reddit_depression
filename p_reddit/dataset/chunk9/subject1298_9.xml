	<TEXT> I don't think it should be illegal. People like to deny it because 'it's their right to be gay, be who you are'. What if they don't want to gay though.

I will say however that **nobody** should be forced to undergo it and it should be a criminal offence to do so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calm down folks,

This title makes it sound like Heath Ledger's, Jared Leto's, Cesar Romero's and Jack Nicholson's joker should all have the same music.

All four performances are different enough that honestly the only similarity is the name and the clownish attitude to an extent.

Why is that true for the Joker and not for Batman? Zimmer is not knocking Affleck like the title makes out, he's just saying he would find it incredibly difficult to write *new* music for a batman film that would be different to the nolan films as he is thinking about Bales performance. </TEXT>

I'd love to see more colonial marine action but aside from assaulting an alien home planet I can't think of anything that would remotely work very well. In saying that, the book 'The Female War' would have made an excellent alien 4.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think A LOT of this is down to Scotts original idea in that in the original ALIEN the xenomorph was not just killing people but harvesting them and morphing them into eggs, as seen in the deleted scenes of the original movie.

Personally I prefer James Camerons take in that they are like an ant colony, but I think they went with the black goo mutation thing to enable both styles of xenomorph reproduction to exist in the same canon. 

I strongly believe the reason why he is working  on 5 (!) new alien films is to try and straighten out this mess. And while I get new films should add something to the lore and mythology, this mess never needed straightening out in the first place. There is no need to radicalise the series so greatly with Prometheus.

Still, I don't want to be too quick to judge as Covenant could be great, but claiming that he's going to make another 5 alien movies does not excite me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More power to you. You're entitled to your own opinions, and well done for standing your ground, and not being obnoxious about it.

I do greatly enjoy the game, as I said, Aloy is one of the best protagonists in recent memory, *not* because she's a woman. If that speaks to you more than me, cool. People are different, and debate and challenging opinions is what moves our society forward. 

If you liked her and having that kind of character speaks to you, you should also check out these games with interesting female lead characters:

Full Throttle (the supporting character Mo is great)
Final Fantasy X-2
Dreamfall
Mirrors Edge
Alice: The Madness Returns
Alien: Isolation

	<TEXT> I read the discussion, I just don't like the fact that people need to be part of a political movement to accept that women are equal, which honestly has nothing to do with video games. It's not the rest of the discussion, but your admission that you're a feminist and that most female protagonists rely on men for motivation which I disagree with. I just feel that was irrelevant to your core point that Aloy is a great protagonist. Unless a game is a political commentary I find it annoying when people put a political spin on games. The way you describe Aloy is like her being female IS the defining factor of her. 

It's like Gone Home, it's a great little game but the way feminists and LGBT communities went crazy when it came out. The games story touched on themes uncommon in gaming, but the point I'm making is that there are games that deserve commentary on feminism, I just don't feel horizon has anything to do with it. 

Please don't take what I'm saying as an argumentative post, I'm not wanting to pick a fight. I just believe that entertainment products should not be scrutinised and made into political points unless that was the purpose or there was enough relevant material in that product.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree with your sentiment that Aloy is a victory for feminists. 

Aloy brilliantly depicts a human being. Complex. Motivated. Emotional. Capable of incredible feats of strength. Not all humans are like that, but it should not be championed just because she is a woman as her sex is entirely immaterial to the story. It should be championed as realistic writing, and an incredible performance has created the most human protagonist in recent memory. 

Aside from the feminist angle I wholeheartedly agree </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi folks,

We live in a rural area and have a pug that's allowed to roam around our premises at night (our business yard is next to our home) and last night we tied him up to his kennel as our gates are currently being repaired. 

Anyway, we were awoken early this morning to find him being attacked by an Akita who had wandered up into our complex. Currently our pug is at the vet and while I am of course concerned for him now and coming home, I also have young children.  

I have heard these dogs being discussed on the radio before and I hear that they have a bad reputation. Should I be concerned about it coming back? Are they dangerous? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I resubbed to AoC to try it out again, and found that my ranger main had dropped from level 50 to 16 (she still had mounts and stuff which is why it was weird) and also had been renamed. It was her though as equipment, character model etc was exactly the same.  I couldn't retake quests I'd completed before etc. 

Initially I thought I'd been hacked but I still had about the amount of money I probably would have had, and Funcom when asked about it said they could prove no one else had logged into my account with IP address details. 

I have no idea what caused the problem but it was the complete washing of their hands of the situation that pissed me off. It was obvious something was wrong, but they wouldn't do anything to fix it.   </TEXT>

In my first example, the blood test scene in The Thing still stands IMHO as one of the most tense scenes in film. It's *exactly* why a good script, and cast, is all you need to make an incredible scene. 

In my second example, the first time I saw Saving Private Ryan, I had to pause the film after the first 15 minutes or so were over. That kind of filming had never been done before prior to that and honestly is the main reason why the film is so famous.  </TEXT>

Zelda is a great start to that and if Nintendo can pull off games of that quality from its first party line up of IPs, the switch will be a commercial success. Not Wii level of sales, but a success. 

Seriously though, I've been unimpressed with the switch so far, but if Mario Odyssey turns out to be good, and we see a new Metroid, and maybe the return of some other classics I'd consider getting one </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some companies are now charging for underlay by the bag, because if I turn up to a job and take pieces of underlay in, 'savvy' consumers think they are getting swindled because it isn't 'in the wrapper'. 

So you'll find some companies quoting for 30m2 of underlay where the client will only need 20m2 of carpet, so I am seeing this trend go the complete opposite direction to what you're saying, although you are 100% correct. 

Seriously folks, it doesn't matter if your underlay is a million pieces. If it's under the carpet and fixed to the floor, it doesn't matter. Don't let pride and ignorance cost you more for waste than is fair.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whilst technically true, most people expect to see a 'new' roll of underlay being delivered to their home when carpet is being fitted. When I've gone into jobs with scraps, at least 50% of the time the customer has pulled me on it and asked why they aren't getting new underlay. 

So, in hindsight while people think it's shitty practice to sell you the same amount of underlaybas carpet, each roll is 15m2 standard. If your room is 13' x 13' (4m x 4m) that is 16m2 and I'm going to need to open a whole bag of underlay for a single square meter (very nearly), which potentially I may not be able to use unless I go to a job where I've been given the key so the client isn't there. 

I do not do this, but this is now why some companies are now charging underlay out *by the bag* instead of in m2.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tutfted carpet hasn't been made on a 12' loom for years. Or 15' for that matter. It's either 13'1" or 16'4" (4m or 5m)

There are a handful of woven carpet manufacturers that still make a 12' wide roll, but where a roll of Wilton can take days to make, most tufting machines can produce multiple rolls of carpet in a day. 

Incidentally the reason why gauges etc are still measured in fractions of inches instead of metric is because tufting machines are an American piece of equipment is

This doesn't mean I don't value expert opinion as of course someone like you who's spent their life researching something is liable to know more about it than me, but to use your own analogy, it would be like a mathematician telling me 2x2 is 4 when an error here could alter the course of someone's life, and me wanting to verify that information with external sources and similar cases as people can and have made mistakes in the past.

M.D's *knew* smoking was a positive thing, M.D's (in the UK) *knew* Thalidomide was entirely safe to give pregnant women, and right now we *know* the MMR vaccine is entirely unconnected to autism.

The point i'm making isn't that people should not trust doctors, only that before undertaking **any** medical treatment, they should also check out the possible side effects and then once they've checked themselves (and educated themselves on that drug and it's pitfalls) can they then make an informed decision.

Why is that wrong? Why is me giving my daughter the vaccine in a different way wrong for that matter? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TBH the root of this problem has been caused by things like the Thalidomide disaster (yes I called it that) where a 'proven' medicine was later 'proven' to cause horrific defects in unborn children when a pregnant mother took the drug that was 'proven' to be safe for pregnant women.

Smoking was often touted as a medicinal health benefit for instance, and it's no good saying 'But look at what we know now!' because what we know in another 50 years may be different to what we know now and by that point it may be too late.

Just to be clear, I don't believe that vaccines cause autism etc, but you'd be a fool in todays day and age to trust everything you're told and not do your own research. For instances there is some slight controversy regarding the MMR vaccine in Britain that it may cause autism. After doing my own brief research online about it and speaking to doctors, the autism rate is far lower when the vaccines are applied separately and not in the single dose that the MMR is given as. I am happy because I have mitigated the small risk that there may be with the MMR vaccine, and by administering them seperatly my daughter is now immune.

The Anti Vaxxers just don't get that the tools are at their fingertips to make an educated decision instead of a panicky frightened one. </TEXT>
