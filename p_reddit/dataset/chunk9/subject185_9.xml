	<TEXT> [Adam Schiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff) spent 6 years as a federal prosecutor so he knows his shit. And, while he was doing that, he had some relevant experience:

 While an assistant U.S. Attorney he gained attention by prosecuting a case against Richard Miller, a former FBI agent convicted of "passing secret documents to the Soviet Union in exchange for a promised $65,000 in gold and cash.

And for my fellow SoaD fans,[ there this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Schiff#Armenian_Genocide):
 He has strongly pushed for signing of the US House Resolution 106 recognizing the Armenian Genocide. ... He continues to reintroduce the resolution each subsequent Congress.

http://www.kitploit.com/2013/09/iodine-tunnel-application-to-forward.html

 iodine lets you tunnel IPv4 data through a DNS server. This can be usable in different situations where internet access is firewalled, but DNS queries are allowed. 

 It runs on Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and Windows and needs a TUN/TAP device. The bandwidth is asymmetrical with limited upstream and up to 1 Mbit/s downstream. 

...

 Each DNS reply can contain over a kilobyte of compressed payload data.

And from [this article](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html) on the Trump Tower-Alfa Bank question:

 Eighty-seven percent of the DNS lookups involved the two Alfa Bank servers. Its pretty clear that its not an open mail server, Camp told me. These organizations are communicating in a way designed to block other people out.

Earlier this month, the group of computer scientists passed the logs to Paul Vixie. In the world of DNS experts, theres no higher authority. Vixie wrote central strands of the DNS code that makes the internet work. After studying the logs, he concluded, The parties were communicating in a secretive fashion. The operative word is secretive. This is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project.

...

Tea Leaves and his colleagues plotted the data from the logs on a timeline. What it illustrated was suggestive: The conversation between the Trump and Alfa servers appeared to follow the contours of political happenings in the United States. At election-related moments, the traffic peaked, according to Camp. There were considerably more DNS lookups, for instance, during the two conventions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, your answer is right there in your question:

 black ane white

Now, you obviously have a typo - you misadventurously plopped a space in "blackane white". And what is blackane? Consulting with [Dr. Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/-ane) we see:
The suffix -ane is used in organic chemistry to form names of organic compounds where the -C-C- group has been attributed the highest priority

And what is the most famous -C-C- group? CCR, Creedence Clearwater Revival, of course! And like all classic rock bands, the formula for their success was:

Music originally created by black people + played by white people = commercial success

So, the problem isn't that the children aren't grey, it's that they aren't being given guitars and drum kits. Stop trying to get them to produce melanin and get them to produce hit singles. </TEXT>
