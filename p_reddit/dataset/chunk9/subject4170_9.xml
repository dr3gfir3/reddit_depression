	<TEXT> I have to say I'm getting quite frustrated by how many people have apparently not bothered to actually read the article. She's not even coming close to saying they didn't cover it. She's saying regionalism tainted their story and there is a shrinking pool of local journalists available to report on the boring grind of what's actually happening behind these crises.

You seem to think your opinion of these places qualifies you to decide whether a crisis there gets thoughtful media attention. TBH that kind of proves her point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its depressing cities with huge abandoned sections

I reckon you've never been out of the extended D Metro. That's less than a third of the state.  And a good chunk of the Rust Belt looks like that, not just that part of Michigan.

[Flint doesn't have much more of a leaded pipe problem than any other large-ish city of age](http://abcnews.go.com/Business/sticker-shock-fixing-flints-lead-problem-hints-colossal/story?id=38869062). It was a horribly mishandled changeover in water sources (from Detroit's good water, mind) that created the crisis, not any uniqueness of Flint's infrastructure.

I get that you aren't being entirely serious, but as has been stated in this sub before, Flint is a sore spot when held up as an example of our state.  You don't hear me cracking about Florida Man. I know why *that's* unfair. 

Besides, I was merely pointing out how media coverage, etc. may color the perception of a place just as much for an out-of-stater as it would for a foreigner. </TEXT>

Take for example the above.  The line about Michigan applies to exactly one city with a population lower than 100,000 in a state with a hundred times that many people.  Flint is the seventh-largest city in Michigan.  It's behind *suburbs* of larger Michigan cities. </TEXT>

Define Ghetto.  Do you mean neighborhoods that look like something out of "The Wire?" Then yes, but the picture is more complex.  I'm speaking from personal experience only, here, but I know of an inner-city part of Jackson, MI that has a lot of white people but maintains a lot of the characteristics of a ghetto.  I'm writing this comment right now in a low-income neighborhood of GR (lower Creston for those in the know) with a lot of those markers (petty crime, vandalism, rich people don't come here), which is actually predominantly white.

Are you talking about slums and areas of high poverty? [Here is a tool from the Urban Institute](http://www.urban.org/urban-wire/poverty-race-and-place-map-your-metro) which actually maps poverty by race.  It's worth pointing out, though, that it focuses on the top ~60 metro areas whereas the [highest rates of white, and in fact *all* poverty](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/rural-economy-population/rural-poverty-well-being/poverty-demographics.aspx) in the United States are found in rural areas. </TEXT>

* Is this a third party controller? All first-party PS3 controllers are wireless but with a Mini USB cable for charging.
* Yes, but I (mildly) recommend an ethernet cable. I have a Slim hooked up via ethernet and a Super Slim on WiFi.  The former is quite a bit faster.

	<TEXT> According to Memory Alpha this puts the show's start in 2255.  Kirk started his five-year officer training in 2252 according to TOS "Shore Leave," making Lieutenant in '55 but not finishing the program until '57 according to "Obsession."  Could this have something to do with the officer training program / Starfleet Academy?  "Lt. Cmdr with caveats" sounds like she could be a cadet, but I think she might be over-ranked then.

It really feels to me like, failing that, it will be more of a Lower Decks series. </TEXT>

I don't believe in "bests" but Hideout (GR only?) has a hazelnut stout that is way better than it deserves to be.  I also second Expedition.  Bell's Kalamazoo stout is popular, but it's not my absolute favorite.  I am crazy about their cherry stout, but I'm not sure it's made anymore.

As far as stouts go, more will obviously become available as the weather chills.  If you're in any place with a plurality of local brewers, you're going to find a lot of hyperlocal variety in stouts, porters and scotches. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh.  It's important to note that the whole purpose of a formal IQ test is psychological, and every professional I know uses it for ADHD diagnoses.  

A normal or better score on the WAIS/WISC (most common IQ tests) rules out low IQ as the source of impairment, thereby indicating something more complicated is going on.  To put a more accurate point on it: the higher a person's IQ, the easier it is to put one's finger on a disorder.

This is part of the reason that some say ADHD correlates with high IQ, because a lot of people who have been formally diagnosed have also been administered the test and found to not be below-average.

This is so central to my concept of ADHD diagnosis and treatment that the idea that a psychologist/psychiatrist would rule out ADHD *because* of intelligence makes me wonder what that person is doing in the profession at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If anything, Michigan politics have shown a great amount of back-and-forth.  Michigan hasn't had a Democratic legislature and governor since the early days of the Reagan administration, and four of the last six governors have been Republicans (RRDRDR).  Flint's decline started during the tenure of the first of those six governors.

Last time Michigan Democrats controlled both houses, Michael Jackson's *Thriller* was tearing up the charts. Granholm was only our second Democratic governor since 1961 (our last six were RRDRDR). I'd hardly call ours a Democratic run state for the balance of Flint's troubles.

Speaking as a Michigan voter, your part about a Republican bringing back manufacturing jobs was *exactly* what Snyder ran on. Things went downhill (not for the first time) under Engler, and Granholm talked the talk about making things better, but proved herself laughably misguided. That was he political climate that elected Snyder.  

We've now had three two-term governors in a row who started out being loved and ended being hated. </TEXT>

They are also handy for keeping commodity prices low in times of trouble.

Also, the rocket part I mentioned is more NASA than DOD.

	<TEXT> The plastic trash bins are more flexible, which allows the trucks to pick them up with robotic arms without denting them, and are strong enough at their size while being lighter and cheaper than metal ones, which also helps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The US government has maintained a [strategic helium reserve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Helium_Reserve) since 1925.  [They decided to close it](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-canada-helium-feature-idUSKCN0ZK12Y).  This sent Helium prices through the roof, because we were basically making and holding all of it.  Of course, Now they found [a huge amount in Tanzania](http://arstechnica.com/science/2016/06/discovery-of-massive-new-helium-reserves-is-game-changer-for-medical-industry/), so there's that. </TEXT>

I feel like this (and "new crews" from earlier) might mean that we follow more than one ship as the story arc progresses, but this is the main one.  AFAIK the *Enterprise* was always the flagship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you on the second paragraph.  That said, IRL, the person who wrote the episode you quote had no idea we'd be able to videoconference with the ISS today.

Some of Enterprise's tech was more advanced than TOS's because those parts were [zeerusted](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Zeerust), to use the TV tropes term, meaning we've already developed too far to realistically have that tech look futuristic.  Even the TNG era had some of this--stacks of padds holding one book each, a computer system based on a mainframe, etc. </TEXT>
