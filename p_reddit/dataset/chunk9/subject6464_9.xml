	<TITLE> Types of Question in Tests </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-20 04:32:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are three types of questions you will encounter in tests.

The first type of question you will encounter is multiple-choice questions. These questions require you to find the correct answers from the answers you are given. I would cross out the answers that are incorrect. College admission exams uses these to give students their grades right away.

The second type of questions you will encounter are short-answer responses. These questions require you to write a word or sentence. These require some time to grade as these questions can have more than one correct answer. When I took Japanese, every test I have taken consists of short-answer responses. Your answer is correct if it follows grammatical and syntax rules.

The third type of question you will encounter are essay questions. These questions tests your knowledge of a certain subject. These take the most time to grade as everyone have their own rubies. Each essay is different in wording and the way it is written. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Algorithms Are Important When Doing Homework in College </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-20 04:18:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In college, we have homework that have to be completed online. We would input an answer and the program gives us instant feedback. This is a way to save time when computing final scores.

The programs check your answer using algorithms. Algorithms are a set of sequential instructions a program follow. They are used in calculators, especially graphing calculators. These calculators require an input and out comes the solution.

When I took calculus in college, some questions can be solved by inserting a complex answer. The software then uses algorithms to do its own calculations and determine if your answer is correct or not. For example, if a question asks for the derivative of abc, I would insert a'bc+ab'c+abc', the software then simplify the answer, and consider it correct. In a quiz, I inserted a correct complex answer and the professor reminded me to simplify it.

In accounting, the care if your numbers are correct and your accounts are correct. Sometimes, the software doesn't care about the ordering of accounts.

In logic philosophy, some questions can have more than one correct answer. The questions where you have use proofs only care when you get to the desired solution, similar to how it's done in geometry. </TEXT>

The first time I got suspended was during 6th grade when I sexually harassed my classmates in my PE class. I was given two days in-house suspension. I nearly did nothing that to sit there.

The second time I got suspended was during the finals in 9th grade. I wrote something racist and got a 5-day in-house suspension. I did nothing that taking the finals in the narrow room and get criticized by my PE teacher for my disrespectful behavior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I applied for college, I have take the SAT, the SAT II, and the ACT. I applied for six CUNY colleges, three CUNY colleges, and two private colleges.

I took the ACT to ensure CUNY english proficiency, but found out they accept SAT, Regents, and the diagnostic exams.

The SUNY acceptance letter arrived first. I got accepted by one of the colleges I applied. I was given a packet to fill out. I still wanted to wait for the other colleges. I didn't fill out the forms and ignored their emails.

The private colleges arrived next. Only one responded back. I didn't want to go because it's expensive. I later declined their offer.

The CUNY colleges arrived the last. Two colleges accepted me. I replied only one of them. The offer came a few days before my birthday.

The college I currently attend is a very selective one. Getting accepted is a privilege for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I applied for high school, I applied several good schools, specialized high schools, and the zoned school. The specialized high schools are applied separately.

I listed the first eleven high schools with schools that my parents view highly of and included the zoned school at the end. I told the counselor that I wanted to take the specialized high school. She told us that our teachers will do it for them, possibly to save time.

When I took the specialized high school exam, I have more than enough time to complete each question, but got a 437 with no offer.

When I waited for the ordinary schools, I got selected by Long Island High School, which requires me to take the subway there or take two buses to get there. I went to the consular to apply for an appeal. I placed the Chinese school in Chinatown and my zoned school. I later got put into my zoned school.

After the first week of class, I went to yumcha at our nearest restaurant. The owner's daughter said she got accepted to one of the specialized high school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to one psychic online, she said by 2028, we would expect two women running for presidency, a new systems to be implemented, and political shifts.

I asked the psychic about this, she said it's unclear but there's a possibly that there will be a balance between socialism and capitalism, and the congress wouldn't implant the policies but the local governments will.

I thought to myself that what that time happens, we may expect the Union to be dissolved. Any clues of such happening? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Will the US Turn Socialist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-16 02:44:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the 2016 election, we have seen Bernie Sanders coming out as a candidate. People liked him because of his populist social rhetoric. However, the DNC rigged the election, causing Trump to win.

Now that Sanders is going to these public forums to understand Trump voters' concerns, people are defecting from Trump to Sanders due to the fact that Trump cares about his cronies and himself and no-one else. Sanders is quite popular based on polling.

I have looking up psychics to see what the future holds. By 2028, there will be two females running for president. By 2029, we expect a New Deal-like plan that helps the people. The GOP is on its deathbed by then after we see how much they screwed the country up.

People know that if we stay with the current capitalist system, it will not make the US better off after the GOP loses it grip. By then, they would follow a socialist system based on Sander's rhetoric. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why There's No Charcoal Yakiniku in the New York Metropolitan Area </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Whenever, I think of yakiniku, I think of small pieces of marinated meats on top of an open grill. However, there aren't any restaurants of such that uses charcoal or a shichirin bucket grill.

Around the New York Metropolitan Area, we have Gyukaku, Yakiniku Gen, Yakiniku West, Yakiniku Futago, and Takashi. Gyukaku and Gen uses ceramic charcoal on smokeless grills. West and Futago uses electricity on smokeless grill. Takashi uses electricity on a grill that requires an air duct.

Charcoal is more expensive that electricity and gas. The restaurants in New York may have regulations on using charcoal. Burning charcoal can be hazardous, except when you use binchotan white charcoal. In Japan, it is common to see restaurants using shichirin filled with burning binchotan, with an air duct hanging from the ceiling.

Ceramic charcoal isn't real charcoal. It uses ceramic to produce a good taste when grilling meats. It's quite expensive. These restaurants uses smokeless grills to reduce operating costs. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why the American Dream is Dead </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-15 18:34:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After the 2008 financial crisis, America has turned to the worst. We see rising numbers of the homeless, the shrinking of the middle class, coorporates pocketing from the poor, and the 1/10 of the top 1% having more wealth than the lower 50%.

Before that happened, former President Ronald Reagan caused this mess. His policies ruined the middle class and enriched the top 1%.

Now that Trump became president, there will be crony capitalism that will rip-off the working and middle class. If people chose Sanders, he will definitely revive the American Dream by transforming the government into a socialist democracy.

Currently, the American Dream is the Canadian Dream. We see that in Canada there is universal healthcare similar to Europe and cheap colleges. Mobility there is better than the US. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I Value Quantity Over Quality </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-14 07:18:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a person who value quantity over quality. Quantity is cheaper but its grade is lower.

Whenever I choose restaurants, I would rather go to buffets than to go to fine dining restaurants. At buffets, I can eat a lot, but small restaurants have 10 items, while large restaurants have up to 100 items. At fine dining restaurants, I choose what I want to eat and pay for it.

Some fine dining restaurants, however, have lunch specials. These specials allow you to choose several items for one price. This is also a way to save costs.

When using public transportation, I would use transportations that are flat rate rather than using transportations that charge by zoning or by distance. Flat rates are like buffets, which charging by zones or distance is like eating at a fine dining restaurant or a buffet charging by weight. However, flat rate-based transportations can be slower than zone or distance-based transportation.

If I take a railway line that charges by distance and found out that the express trains are cheaper, I will take an express train to the closest station before the destination and the transfer for a local train. I found out that from New York to White Plains, I can take the subway and transfer for Metro North, take the subway and transfer for Greyhound, or take the subway and transfer for the Bee-Line Bus. I found out that the first choice costs me $15 at peak times or $12 at off-peak times; the second choice costs me $6.75 or $7.75; the third choice costs me $2.75 due to the free transfer. The first choice gets me there in 1hr 2min. The second choice get me there in 1hr 35min. The third choice gets me there 2hr 30min. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We figured out that Sanders is very popular that the current president. People find that his social programs are better than what the establishment has to offer. Trump will only care about his cronies.

Sanders is an anti-establishment senator and is going to the last mile to pass laws that helps the people, instead of the rich guys. He is willing to offer everyone free health care and college. He doesn't like what the establishment, blue-dog, and corporate democrats are doing. They are screwing up, making themselves lose all the time.

Fortunately, Sanders announced that he will run for 2020. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On Pixiv, I publish my songs from time to time. The songs are anti-establish as it does not reflect traditional genres.

The first song I wrote fits the genre nostalgia. It contains two stanzas from the Kochi folk song "Yosakoi Bushi." After the first song I created another mainstream song of the type about a famed yakuza boss. After that, I created a anime theme song using enka styles. It gained at least 100 views.

After the success, I wrote about Cartoon Network and Disney theme songs. These also gained high views. However, these anti-establishment ideas caused butthurt to trolls, saying that I am an insult to the music industry.

I have shown my ideas to my professors. They are just speechless. Some of the faculty members asked my about the singer Kiyoshi Hikawa, which I have known.

Now, after publishing my ideas of some alternative anime, I started to write enka theme songs for these shows. These shows might not get accepted by TV networks as it in considered anti-establishment or would be shown on undesirable time slots. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why Tipping in Bad </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-12 05:30:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Whenever we go to a restaurant in the US, we have to tip after a meal. However, there were a few restaurants that discontinued this practice.

Tipping wasn't necessary until the Great Depression. It short changes  waiters, and doesn't make them work better. The tip varies per party. They lower than the minimum wage this way.

In other countries, tipping is not accepted. You just pay for the meal and services are better. Sometimes, the food costs more and/or the restaurant charges a service charge. If you want to tip a person, you have to mask it and call it something other name than tips. Back in 2011, whenever we take the taxi from the bus terminal to our house, we pay the taxi driver 10 yuan instead of the base 7 yuan, giving him a 42% tip, for helping us with the luggage and having to spend more for gas.

The restaurant Ootoya stopped accepting tips since March 28, 2016. The just raised their prices to compensate the waiter's salaries. The Chinese restaurant Big Noodle Bowl included a service charge on your bill. You don't have to leave tips. The ramen restaurant Ichiran opened a store in Brooklyn. The receipt saids "we are a non-tipping establishment." The bowl of ramen is twice than that in Japan, due to higher market prices in NYC than in Japan. In College Point, NY, there is a buffet restaurant call The Buffet, the online menu shows that there are more than 100+ items. it also says that a 15% service on the price to cover the operating and administrative costs. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Politics in Classroom Lectures </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Currently I am taking microeconomics, which talk about personal decisions. The professor always throw in politics in the class. Even governments make personal decisions. He even made references about Trump and his personal decisions. I sometimes talk to him about real-life examples and he has an answer right away.

In Intermediate Japanese II, the professor always make references about politics. He has shown a video about a sinkhole in Fukuoka, which was fixed overnight. On the day after Trump was elected, he started make references of right-wing groups being open with their ideologies in Japan. When introducing a movie or show, we sometimes shift off a tangent and have a conversation about politics in Japan.

Some teachers avoid talking about politics as they want to stay neutral. However, some do talk about it. Last semester, there is a business law professor that tells the students the truth about our screw-up situations in governments, i.e. money in politics. </TEXT>
