	<TEXT> This part really got me:

"When the prison tried to break one of us, we all stood up. We looked out for each other. When they tried to divide us, and systematically discriminated against us, we embraced our diversity and pushed back. But, I also learned from all of you when to pick my battles. I grew up and grew connected because of the community you provided.

Those outside of prison may not believe that we act like human beings under these conditions. But of course we do. And we build our own networks of survival." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem is that trans women have been historically excluded from women's spaces -- a reality that contributes to violence against the trans community. Trans women face disproportionate levels of violence and discrimination. The organizers did a great job with so many things, but given the long history of exclusion, putting a trans person on stage early in the program would have helped a lot to set the tone, and having more trans voices would do a lot to heal the rift that isn't helping our movement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before you jump in with some mean-spirited comment about Chelsea's gender or suggest she should die, please remember that she is a human being. She has friends, family, and people who care about her. Regardless how you feel about the documents she released or the charges she faced, we can all agree that the treatment she has endured is inhumane. No one should have to go what she has gone through. When we excuse torture or degrading treatment just because we don't like (or don't understand) the person who is being subjected to it, we undermine all of our basic human rights, and encourage governments to use their power unchecked. Please, think critically before you condemn Chelsea, or anyone else. </TEXT>
