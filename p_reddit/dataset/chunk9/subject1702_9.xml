	<TEXT> LONDON (AP)  The London Marathon started five days ago, and Tom Harrison is nearly done.

It's not that he's a slow runner. It's that he's a slow crawler, particularly wearing his gorilla suit.

The man dubbed Mr. Gorilla is raising money for the Gorilla Organization  so far more than 22,000 pounds ($28,500) have been pledged.

He's hopeful of finishing the race Saturday, with his two sons expected at the finish line to celebrate his feat.

He ran the marathon last year raising money for gorillas, but is finding crawling much more stressful.

"It's shoulders, hamstrings, glutes, quads, from the constant crouching," he says. "We're not really designed to do that."

Harrison says the money will be used to protect endangered gorillas in Africa. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WASHINGTON (AP)  **President Donald Trump "has no intention" of releasing his taxes returns to the public, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said Wednesday, asserting Americans have "plenty of information" about the president's financial matters.**

"The president has no intention. The president has released plenty of information and I think has given more financial disclosure than anybody else. I think the American population has plenty of information," he said, inaccurately characterizing the president's disclosures...


**The comment came as the secretary briefed reporters on the president's new proposal to overhaul taxes.** Democrats have sought to use the tax debate to pressure Trump to release his returns, arguing the information is necessary to evaluate how Trump's tax proposals would affect his personal wealth and his business' bottom line.


Mnuchin declined to comment on how Trump would benefit from his proposals. He and other administration officials left the room as reporters shouted questions about how the plan would affect the Trump family.

Trump, a billionaire, owns a global real estate, marketing and property management company, which at the start of his presidency he placed in a trust that he can revoke at any time. His daughter and son-in-law, White House advisers, are also holding onto significant business assets. And Trump's adult sons run his Trump Organization...

	<TEXT> **"Justice Neil Gorsuch may face his first recusal when the justices in May take up a petition that involvesand features prominentlyone of his most famous dissents: the case of the burping 13-year-old student."**




"The case started back in 2011, when a physical education teacher at an Albuquerque middle school called for help over her school-issued radio. A 13-year-old seventh grader had generated fake burps, which made the other students laugh and hampered class proceedings, according to the panel decision. After the boy ignored her requests to stop, the teacher ordered him to sit in the hallway. There, he leaned into the classroom entrance way and continued to burp. She called for help."



"A school resource officer asked the boy to accompany him to the school administrative office. He told the boy that he was arresting him for interfering with the educational processa petty misdemeanor offense under New Mexico law. The officer handcuffed the teen and drove him to juvenile hall."


"The boys mother sued, alleging violation of her sons civil rights because of the arrest and a subsequent strip search in an unrelated incident. The divided Tenth Circuit panel affirmed qualified immunity for the officer and school officials on all claims.
Gorsuch, writing in dissent, said: The simple fact is the New Mexico Court of Appeals long ago alerted law enforcement that the statutory language on which the officer relied for the arrest in this case does not criminalize noise[s] or diversion[s] that merely disturb the peace or good order of individual classes. Any reasonable officer, Gorsuch wrote then, should have known that arresting a now compliant class clown for burping was going a step too far."



"In the high court, the boys counsel, Kennedy, argues: The petition argues simply that the state interest is obviouschildhood conduct that disturbs the peace of a school session is not criminal and children should be kept out of juvenile detention when possible. 
When the state interest against arresting children is balanced with the liberty interest of the child, the unconstitutionality of the arrest is obvious."


"Albuquerque assistant city attorney Kristin Dalton, representing Officer Arthur Acosta, asked the justices not to take the case.
While the facts underlying petitioners claims may be of interest because they are somewhat unique, the legal issue involved is nothing more than the application of New Mexico law to the qualified immunity analysis, she wrote. The Tenth Circuits application of qualified immunity was not irregular; rather, it utilized long-settled law."


"Gorsuch hasnt yet recused in any matter at the high court. He faced, however, an early test: Whether to recuse in a case in which Hogan Lovells partner Neal Katyalwho advocated for Gorsuch during his confirmation proceedingswas arguing. Gorsuch did not step down."

*THE* first 100 days are traditionally a time to reflect on accomplishments of a president, and Trump hasnt got a lot of those, Colbert said. He still hasnt filled his cabinet; he didnt repeal Obamacare; there are still Muslims.


*AS* of Monday, this week became a critical time not only for the president, but also for late-night; the W.G.A. overwhelmingly voted to authorize a strike, which could send Colbert and his fellow late-night hosts straight into reruns. Evidently, Colbert and his fellow hosts are still making hay while they can. Hosts on Monday night particularly honed in on the potential government shutdown: if Congress doesnt send Trump a government funding bill to be approved by midnight Friday, the government could stop in its tracks. As some have noted, that would make Trump the first president in history to have a shutdown on his hands within his first 100 days.



*WE* may have a government shutdown if Congress doesnt pass a budget, Colbert said Monday night. And Trump is so desperate to have something to show for his first 100 days that he just threw in funding for the border wallwhich may kill the bill and make the United States financially insolvent. So, Trump really is running the country like one of his businesses."

*ON* Late Night, Meyers also honed in on the possible government shutdown. If this were a movie, it would be called 100 Dayz and Confused, Meyers quipped, adding later, Are we sure the government wasnt shut down already? Because it was reported recently that President Trump has appointed fewer than three-dozen of the top 1,000 officials he needs to run the federal government. Under Trump, our federal government is staffed as well as a Duane Reade on a Sunday morning.

	<TEXT> LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP)  Arkansas' execution protocol includes three drugs, two of which are used in surgery and one that benefits cardiac patients. A look at the drugs:

___

**MIDAZOLAM**

Midazolam is the first of the three drugs administered to sedate the inmate. Because the state's supply reaches its expiration date April 30, Arkansas scheduled eight executions before then.

At normal adult doses of around 4 mg for routine surgery, midazolam can slow or stop breathing to the point that medical literature advises doctors to monitor patients closely. With a 500 mg dose listed in the state's execution protocol, Arkansas expects that the inmates will not be aware they are dying.

In federal court testimony earlier this month, doctors differed on whether midazolam is an appropriate execution drug, though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in 2015 that it is.

U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker had said earlier this month that Arkansas' execution protocol doesn't outline what would happen if the inmate were to remain conscious even if given a double dose. She also said the protocol doesn't lay out what executioners intend to do to ensure that the inmates are unconscious. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed her decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court let the appeals court decision stand.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that a lower court established that "midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain."

In typical medical settings, midazolam relaxes people and produces amnesia.

Using redacted drug labels, The Associated Press identified West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. as the likely manufacturer of Arkansas' midazolam supply.

___

**VECURONIUM BROMIDE**

The second drug, vecuronium bromide, is a muscle relaxant, but not in the typical sense. Rather than being prescribed for tightness or muscle pain, vecuronium is used to prevent muscles from moving so they don't interfere with surgeons. After receiving the drug, patients must be on a ventilator or they will suffocate because their diaphragm cannot move.

One doctor testified that being given vecuronium bromide without sedation and ventilation would be equivalent to being held underwater. The typical dose is up to .1 mg/kg intravenously, or 8.5 mg for the typical inmate set to die this month. Under Arkansas' protocol, executioners administer 100 mg, or more than 11 times the typical dose, five minutes after the midazolam is administered and once the inmate is unconscious.

The AP last year used redacted drug labels to identify Hospira, which was purchased by Pfizer, as the likely manufacturer of Arkansas' vecuronium bromide. The supplier McKesson Corp. has said it sold Arkansas the drug for use in inmate health care, not executions. A judge last week blocked Arkansas from using the McKesson-supplied drug, but the Arkansas Supreme Court put that order on hold.

**POTASSIUM CHLORIDE**

Potassium is essential for maintaining a proper heart rhythm, and levels that are too high or too low can cause heart trouble. Medical experts who testified before Baker said that the final drug, potassium chloride, causes considerable pain when injected and is typically diluted when given to patients.

A typical dose is 20 milliequivalents delivered over several hours. Arkansas uses 240 mEq immediately after the inmate is injected with vecuronium bromide.

The director of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Wendy Kelley, testified earlier this month that Arkansas was not charged for its current supply of potassium chloride. She said the supplier wished to remain anonymous and did not want to generate a bill of sale so there would be a smaller chance of being identified.

Fresenius Kabi USA, a subsidiary of the German company Fresenius Kabi, said that it appeared to have manufactured the potassium chloride the state is using...**From AP**

	<TEXT> LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP)  Arkansas' execution protocol includes three drugs, two of which are used in surgery and one that benefits cardiac patients. A look at the drugs:

___

**MIDAZOLAM**

Midazolam is the first of the three drugs administered to sedate the inmate. Because the state's supply reaches its expiration date April 30, Arkansas scheduled eight executions before then.

At normal adult doses of around 4 mg for routine surgery, midazolam can slow or stop breathing to the point that medical literature advises doctors to monitor patients closely. With a 500 mg dose listed in the state's execution protocol, Arkansas expects that the inmates will not be aware they are dying.

In federal court testimony earlier this month, doctors differed on whether midazolam is an appropriate execution drug, though the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled in 2015 that it is.

U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker had said earlier this month that Arkansas' execution protocol doesn't outline what would happen if the inmate were to remain conscious even if given a double dose. She also said the protocol doesn't lay out what executioners intend to do to ensure that the inmates are unconscious. The 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed her decision, and the U.S. Supreme Court let the appeals court decision stand.

Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in a dissent that a lower court established that "midazolam creates a substantial risk of severe pain."

In typical medical settings, midazolam relaxes people and produces amnesia.

Using redacted drug labels, The Associated Press identified West-Ward Pharmaceuticals Corp. as the likely manufacturer of Arkansas' midazolam supply.

___

**VECURONIUM BROMIDE**

The second drug, vecuronium bromide, is a muscle relaxant, but not in the typical sense. Rather than being prescribed for tightness or muscle pain, vecuronium is used to prevent muscles from moving so they don't interfere with surgeons. After receiving the drug, patients must be on a ventilator or they will suffocate because their diaphragm cannot move.

One doctor testified that being given vecuronium bromide without sedation and ventilation would be equivalent to being held underwater. The typical dose is up to .1 mg/kg intravenously, or 8.5 mg for the typical inmate set to die this month. Under Arkansas' protocol, executioners administer 100 mg, or more than 11 times the typical dose, five minutes after the midazolam is administered and once the inmate is unconscious.

The AP last year used redacted drug labels to identify Hospira, which was purchased by Pfizer, as the likely manufacturer of Arkansas' vecuronium bromide. The supplier McKesson Corp. has said it sold Arkansas the drug for use in inmate health care, not executions. A judge last week blocked Arkansas from using the McKesson-supplied drug, but the Arkansas Supreme Court put that order on hold.

**POTASSIUM CHLORIDE**

Potassium is essential for maintaining a proper heart rhythm, and levels that are too high or too low can cause heart trouble. Medical experts who testified before Baker said that the final drug, potassium chloride, causes considerable pain when injected and is typically diluted when given to patients.

A typical dose is 20 milliequivalents delivered over several hours. Arkansas uses 240 mEq immediately after the inmate is injected with vecuronium bromide.

The director of the Arkansas Department of Correction, Wendy Kelley, testified earlier this month that Arkansas was not charged for its current supply of potassium chloride. She said the supplier wished to remain anonymous and did not want to generate a bill of sale so there would be a smaller chance of being identified.

Fresenius Kabi USA, a subsidiary of the German company Fresenius Kabi, said that it appeared to have manufactured the potassium chloride the state is using. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WASHINGTON (AP)  "President Donald Trump will sign executive orders this week aimed at expanding offshore oil drilling and reviewing national monument designations made by his predecessors, continuing the Republican's assault on Democratic President Barack Obama's environmental legacy."


"The orders could expand oil drilling in the Arctic and Atlantic oceans and upend public lands protections put in place in Utah, Maine and other states. The Antiquities Act of 1906 authorizes the president to declare federal lands of historic or scientific value to be "national monuments" and restrict how the lands can be used."


"Administration officials on Monday confirmed the expected moves. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss the president's upcoming actions."


"Obama used his power under the act to permanently preserve more land and water using national monument designations than any other president. The land is generally off limits to timber harvesting, mining and pipelines, and commercial development."


"Utah Republicans were infuriated when Obama created the Bears Ears National Monument in December on more than 1 million acres of land that's sacred to Native Americans and home to tens of thousands of archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings."


"Republicans also objected when Obama created the Katahdin Woods and Waters National Monument in Maine last summer on 87,500 acres of donated forestland. The expanse includes part of the Penobscot River and stunning views of Mount Katahdin, Maine's tallest mountain."

**Republicans have asked Trump to reverse the two designations, saying they add an unnecessary layer of federal control and could stymie commercial development.**

"Trump's staff has been reviewing the decisions to determine economic impacts, whether the law was followed and whether there was appropriate consultation with local officials."

"Before leaving office in January, Obama designated the bulk of U.S.-owned waters in the Arctic Ocean and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing."


"The move was seen as an effort to put some finishing touches on Obama's environmental legacy while also testing Trump's promise to unleash the nation's untapped energy reserves."


"Obama cited an arcane provision in a 1953 law to ban offshore leases in the waters permanently. The statute says that *the president of the United States may, from time to time, withdraw from disposition any of the unleased lands of the outer Continental Shelf.*"


"White House officials said when Obama imposed the order they were confident it would withstand legal challenge, adding that the language of the statute provides no authority for subsequent presidents to undo permanent withdrawals. Environmental groups say a similar logic applies to national monuments and note that no president has acted to undo a monument designation made by a predecessor."


"The Atlantic waters placed off-limits to new oil and gas leasing are 31 canyons stretching off the coast of New England south to Virginia. Existing leases aren't affected." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In many respects, weve been heading in this direction for several months. While first quarter ratings data for 2017 showed Carlsons show at number 2  just behind OReilly  the real story may have been Maddow, who rode the wave of Donald Trumps tax returns to best Carlson for the month of March among the all-important 25-54 year-old demographic. With a March 15 interview with President Trump, Carlson should have owned the month. The cracks in Foxs 9:00 p.m facade become even starker when one looks at overall growth. In Q1, Foxs primetime audience grew 20% opposed to MSNBCs 61%.

All this means is that the trends were moving in Maddows direction before Carlsons departure. With her formidable opponent gone, the question becomes whether Foxs replacement for the hour, The Five, will be adequate to reverse Maddows gains. The evidence suggests it will not.

The most recent ratings data comparing The Five and Maddow are curious. Overall, The Five came in third, while Maddow came in at a distant seventh, but thats where the good news ends for Fox.

Among those coveted 25-54 year-olds, The Five fell to seventh in Q1, while Maddow bumps up to sixth. Yes, its not an apples to apples comparison, but you dont need to be a rocket scientist to figure that its not a renaissance of conservative millennials putting The Five on top overall, but rather, the loyalty of very, very old people. And one of the reasons theyre not so coveted is because, well, they consistently tend to die  which is generally bad for ratings.

Now you might say the Fox audience is baked in and would happily watch a very smart koala willing to make fun of Berkeley college students. After all, where can those Fox viewers go anyway. CNN? MSNBC?  The Blaze? While this may be partly true, The Factor interregnum last week shows the limits of this assumption. While OReillys ratings actually went up as his career spiraled to its ignominious end, Foxs cavalcade of potential replacements couldnt say the same. On April 11, during what became his last show ever, OReilly notched 3.6 million views. The very next day, guest host Dana Perino dropped to 2.8 million and Eric Bolling only managed to get 3.1 million the next night.

Its also worth noting that OReilly was critical to Fox as a spillover host, meaning that some percent of his gargantuan audience would stick around for Tucker. If Carlson cant match OReillys firepower, that spillover is going to shrink too. After all, it may be hard for Carlson to be as phony or contrived as he thought Bill OReilly was in 2003. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From ***HuffPost.com***


"As of Wednesday, Bill OReilly is officially out at Fox News, a turn of events that has some rejoicing. Even though OReilly has been ousted only after it came out that he and Fox had settled at least 5 sexual harassment suits over the past 15 years  and those claims began to hurt ad dollars  his termination still feels like a win in the ongoing battle against sexist men with huge media platforms."

"And yet Fox has announced that OReillys slot will be filled by anchor and commentator Tucker Carlson. While Carlson certainly doesnt have any highly publicized sexual harassment allegations looming over him (a marked improvement!), he has a well-recorded history of dismissing sexual harassment and women in general."

"Lets take a stroll down memory lane, shall we?..."

**1. He complained about Ashley Grahams political Sports Illustrated cover.**

Does it really need to be political? Carlson asked, after the Sports Illustrated made history with its 2016 swimsuit issue by featuring plus-size model Ashley Graham on its cover, prompting praise for celebrating women of all sizes.

Keep it out of my swimsuit issue, Carlson says via voice-over in the clip below. 

**2. He refused to apologize when a writer at his website, The Daily Caller, referred to the NYC Mayors spokesperson as a self-righteous bitch with a labia"**


In 2015, an email obtained by Buzzfeed revealed that Carlsons brother Buckley Carlson, a writer for his news site The Daily Caller, referred to called New York Mayor De Blasios spokesperson Amy Spitalnick as a self-righteous bitch. The email, which had been sent to Tucker, also speculated as to whether Spitalnick had ever been given a pearl necklace, accused her of having extreme dick-fright, and referred to her as LabiaFace. Oh, and it was sent to Spitalnick herself by mistake.  



When the email came to light, Carlson declined to apologize on his brothers behalf and quipped that the email had been meant in the nicest way.



**3. He claimed that Democrats made up the concept of sexual harassment.**


Yup. In 2006, during a segment of his old MSNBC show in which Democratic strategist Steve McMahon said that the Dems taking control of Congress would mean an era of a lot more fun, Carlson responded: 



A lot more fun? This is a group that made up the concept of sexual harassment. You look great today. Boom, Im charging you with a crime.  Do you know what I mean? Its not a group I associate with fun. You want a sex scandal, the Republican party, baby, thats where you go.



**4. He also showed that he actually doesnt understand the concept of sexual harassment at all.**


According to MediaMatters, on an episode of Hannity in February 2010, Carlson defended an ESPN analyst who had been suspended for making sexist comments about a womans clothes on air.


Because the sexist comments were made publicly, Carlson explained that the analyst had done done nothing wrong because: Sexual harassment by definition takes place in private.



**5. He blamed women for sexism in politics. 
On a 2007 episode of his MSNBC show Tucker, Carlson questioned the idea that woman have it harder in politics, citing the fact that most voters are women.**


He asked: If women were so anxious to have women in Congress, and there were so many great female candidates running, then why wouldnt Congress be 52 percent female?


Welcome to internalized misogyny and structural sexism, Tucker. 


**6. He told political writer Lauren Duca to stick to the thigh-high boots.**


After her Teen Vogue article on Donald Trump and gaslighting went viral in December 2016, Carlson invited writer Lauren Duca on his show. He then proceeded to try and devalue her opinions and political writing because she writes for Teen Vogue, and has written non-political pieces in the past.


You should stick to the thigh-high boots, he said. You are better at that. 


**7. He defended President Donald Trumps Grab em by the pussy comments.**


When audio of President Trump bragging about sexually assaulting women leaked in October 2016, Carlson claimed that the outrage over the comment was exaggerated.


Nobody is actually shocked by this and everyone is pretending to be, he said.


**8. He described Hillary Clinton as castrating.**

Because the idea of a female president is apparently the most terrifying thing ever, Carlson dedicated a segment of his MSNBC show in 2007 to talk about how scary Hillary Clinton is.


Theres just something about her that feels castrating, overbearing, and scary, he said. 


**9. He said the Day Without A Woman boycott was an attack on white men.**


After A Day Without A Woman took place on International Womens Day this year, Carlson declared in a segment that because the day was designed to avoid shopping anywhere but women and POC-owned businesses, it was an act of hostility and obviously an attack on white men.

	<TEXT>  **RACHEL MADDOW SHOW 4/19/17**

*Senator Elizabeth Warren talks with Rachel Maddow about the effect that civic activism has had on motivating members of Congress and thwarting Donald Trump's agenda.* ***Duration: 5:32***


**Rachel Maddow:** Do you feel like, on that Russia issue, on the issue of needing a special prosecutor or an independent investigation as you say, on some of the other policy issues that you've talked about just here tonight, do you feel like, the sorta 'people power' that we have seen in the streets, the new civic engagement for people on the center and the left opposed to this president, do you feel like that is the most effective lever for getting those things moving?"

**Senator Elizabeth Warren:** "Oh, absolutely."

**Maddow:** "More so than you and your colleagues in the Senate are advocating for them?"
 

**Sen. Warren:**  "Look, more is more. Are you kidding? I'll be out there, I'll shout at the top of my lungs about this. And I will encourage every one of my colleagues to do it, and my colleagues are getting stronger on all of these issues."

"But the key...I talk about going to the inauguration, seeing Donald Trump, with my own eyes, I actually wanted to see him, I wanted to think about him every single moment when I wake up, and everyday when I wake up."

"But the very next day, going to the woman's March, at Boston Common, and, and, Im thinking, completely into this, on a Saturday morning, it's cold out in Boston and I'm thinking, *how are we gonna fight back against Trump?* And at this point, I know we got to have an army. It's the only way we can do this, we don't have the votes in the house, we don't have the votes in the Senate, we gotta have an army."

"I'm thinking, *How do you raise an army, what does an army look like? Where does an army come from? What does an army look like in a case like this?*"

"And, so, as we're rounding the corner to go into Boston Common, 
I look up, and I'm seeing all these people moving through the common, women in pink pussy hats, and men pushing strollers, and kids riding bicycles."

"And I look over, and there's this man with this little girl on his shoulders and she's holding up this sign carefully hand lettered and the sign says, **I fight like a girl!** And I thought, *Me too, sweetie.* And, that for me, was the moment. I said, ***This is our army.*** And it did change from that moment, Rachel." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NEW YORK (AP)  "New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg urged world leaders not to follow President Donald Trump's lead on climate change and declared his intention to help save an international agreement to reduce carbon emissions..."

"...Instead of helping to re-ignite his political career, he said the new book offered a specific policy objective: To help save an international agreement, negotiated in Paris, to reduce global carbon emissions."

"The Trump administration is debating whether to abandon the pact as the president promised during his campaign. Under the agreement, the U.S. pledged that by 2025 it would reduce its annual greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels, which would be a reduction of about 1.6 billion tons.

"Bloomberg said he believed the U.S. would hit that goal regardless of what Trump does because of leadership at the state level and market forces already at play in the private sector."

"Washington won't determine the fate of our ability to meet our Paris commitment," he said in an email Saturday to the AP. "And what a tragedy it would be if the failure to understand that led to an unraveling of the agreement. We hope this book will help to correct that wrong impression  and help save the Paris deal."

"Bloomberg already plays a significant role in shaping some of the nation's fiercest policy debates, having invested millions of dollars in one advocacy group that pushes for stronger gun control and another that promotes liberal immigration policies. In the new book, which follows what a spokeswoman described as $80 million in donations to the Sierra Club in recent years, the New York businessman solidifies his status as a prominent climate change advocate as well."

"His policy repertoire aligns him with core values of the Democratic Party, although the Democrat-turned-Republican-turned independent has no formal political affiliation."

"In the interview, Bloomberg shrugged off conservatives who condemn him as a paternalistic New York elitist. He noted that policies he helped initiate in New York City  including a smoking ban and high taxes on sugary drinks  have eventually caught on elsewhere."

""My goal has been to save and improve lives," he said. "Some ways of doing that can be controversial at first, but end up being highly popular and successful.""

"In his new focus on climate change, Bloomberg directs particularly aggressive language at the coal industry..."

***Heres the official synopsis for The Keepers:***
From director Ryan White (The Case Against 8, Good Ol Freda) comes The Keepers, a riveting seven-part documentary series about the unsolved murder of a Baltimore nun and the horrific secrets and pain that linger nearly five decades after her death.


The series opens with the story of Sister Cathy Cesnik, a beloved nun and Catholic high school teacher in Baltimore who went missing on Nov. 7, 1969. Nearly two months later, her body was found  and, to this day, her murder remains unsolved.


The case returned to the spotlight in the 1990s when one of Sister Cathys former students  a woman only known as Jane Doe  came forward to share her experience of horrendous sexual abuse by the high schools chaplain. Incredibly, Jane Doe revealed she was also taken to Sister Cathys undiscovered body and told, See what happens when you say bad things about people. Despite this and testimony from other victims and witnesses of abuse, no one was held accountable, and the story was largely unreported outside of Baltimore.


Through conversations with dozens of friends, relatives, journalists, government officials and Baltimore citizens determined to uncover the truth, White pieces together a story that goes beyond the death of a beloved Catholic schoolteacher to encompass clergy abuse, repressed memories and government and religious institutions that he says at best, dropped the ball over the last 45 years  and, at worst, covered it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Former U.S. President Barack Obama on Monday makes his first major appearance since leaving office, having chosen Chicago, the city where his political career started, to emerge from a three-month hiatus from the public eye."


"Obama will meet youth leaders and promote community organizing near the same South Side neighborhoods where his own activism blossomed and propelled him to two terms in the White House that ended with Donald Trump's inauguration on January 20."


"Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who served as Obamas first White House chief of staff, said that he was proud that Obama picked Chicago to make his last speech as president and the first in his post-presidency: "*I think it reflects his emotional, as well as his intellectual, commitment to this city and seeing this city as his home*.""


"Obama's continued connection to Chicago is important to the city, which has global aspirations as well as a palpable insecurity about its place in the world."


"During the last year of Obamas second term, Chicago laid claim to its share of his legacy by beating out Hawaii and New York as the site of his presidential library."


"David Axelrod, a former top political adviser to Obama, said the decision to house the library in Chicago should have eased any concerns that its residents may have had about the former Democratic president's commitment to the city."


"But Monday's event, he said, is another important sign of the former president's strong links to Chicago. "*Hes going to be more visible moving forward,* he said. *I think this is clearly a coming-out*."

	<TEXT> PARIS (AP)  The final hours of many electoral campaigns are frantic affairs, dominated by last-minute pitches, late-breaking polls and massive social media campaigns aimed at drumming up turnout.

Not so in France.

Rules dating back more than half a century impose a 44-hour time out ahead of the polls' closure Sunday, meaning that politicians, journalists  and even ordinary citizens  are supposed to refrain from broadcasting any form of "electoral propaganda."

The Twitter feeds of France's 11 presidential candidates went quiet after midnight Friday. French television coverage was subdued. And if you're a journalist who has just received a newsworthy tip about one candidate or the other, you're just too late.

"The press can't publish such a story," said Pascal Jan, a professor of constitutional law at Sciences Po Bordeaux. "If there were a scandal, it should have been exposed Friday."

The national time out lasts from midnight Friday to 8 p.m. on Sunday in France and is intended to give voters time to reflect on their choice free from the distraction of surveys, radio commentary, and televised rallies.

The rules apply online as well, meaning that candidates and their campaigns can't do so much as post updates to Facebook or Instagram. The rules even apply to French voters  meaning that someone posting a pro-Socialist or pro-Republican message online could fall afoul of the law, at least in theory.

"It applies to all of us. It's totally forbidden," said Jan, although he acknowledged that, in practice, a single person posting wouldn't be sanctioned for expressing themselves online. "But if it became massive ... it would unbalance the contest and thus might influence the votes of those who were exposed to social media."

Amid chatter about foreign propaganda and so-called "fake news" possibly affecting the vote, French authorities seem to be keeping a close eye on potential violations of the law. Journalists have been sent repeated instructions about what is and isn't allowed in the last few days.

The various candidates' Twitter feeds, meanwhile, are frozen in time.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TALLINN, Estonia (AP)  One of the reasons the U.S. Congress has launched an investigation into Russia's alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election is to "prevent the same kind of thing happening" to its NATO and other allies, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Saturday.


Ryan spoke at a news conference with Estonian Prime Minister Juri Ratas in Tallinn, the Estonian capital, during a visit by a bipartisan congressional delegation to the Baltic NATO member and staunch Washington ally.


While the Republican speaker claimed that Russia's alleged meddling didn't affect the outcome of the election  won by U.S. President Donald Trump  he said its actions "cannot be tolerated."


"One thing we know for certain is that Russia meddled in our election," Ryan said. "This is a foreign country trying to meddle within the internal activities of a sovereign country or a democracy."



He stressed the U.S has a responsibility to share the results of the Russia investigation with countries like Estonia, which in recent years has faced aggressive Russian disinformation campaigns along with Baltic neighbors Latvia and Lithuania.


"What we're doing through our investigation process is to figure out exactly what is it they did and how they did it so that we can help, equip and assist our allies to prevent the same kind of thing happening to them," Ryan said.


He thanked Estonia  a country of 1.3 million  for its strong commitment to cyber defense and NATO, and for being one of the very few NATO members to spend two percent of its GDP on defense.



"We're here to say thank you for meeting that pledge," Ryan said.


Estonia's relations with neighboring Russia have remained cold and uneasy since the former Soviet republic gained independence in 1991. Among other things, bilateral ties have suffered due to Estonia's success at catching spies working for Moscow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The plan  draft legislation from House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Phil Roe, R-Tenn.  would deduct $2,400 from future service members paychecks to establish eligibility for revamped post-military education benefits. This was first reported Tuesday by Task   Purpose."

"Currently, the post-9/11 GI Bill offers full tuition to a four-year state college (or the equivalent tuition payout for a private school) plus a monthly housing stipend to any service member who spends at least three years on active duty, and to reservists who are mobilized to active-duty for extended periods. Troops wounded while serving are also eligible."

"Unlike the older Montgomery GI Bill benefit, the post-9/11 GI Bill does not require any fees or pay reductions for eligibility. The new proposal would change that, taking up to $100 a month from new enlistees paychecks for the right to access the benefit after they leave the ranks."

"The money collected would amount to a fraction of the overall cost of the veterans education benefit. Congressional staff estimate the move would bring in about $3.1 billion over the next 10 years, while total GI Bill spending is expected to total more than $100 billion over the same decade."

	<TEXT> TEL AVIV, Israel (AP)  U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis says the Pentagon will not disclose how much damage occurred when the military used its most powerful non-nuclear bomb to strike an Islamic State stronghold in Afghanistan.

The retired four-star Marine general says the Pentagon learned from its Vietnam war experience that it doesn't pay to judge the success of battlefield action in terms of the number of enemy forces killed. It was a reference to the so-called body count that was publicly exaggerated in Vietnam.

Instead, he says the April 13 use of the so-called "mother of all bombs" shows the U.S. doing "what was necessary to break ISIS," whether in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria or elsewhere.

Mattis was asked about the bombing by journalists traveling with him Thursday to Tel Aviv. </TEXT>

Others are equally concerned about the attention that is being drawn to 21st Century Foxs handling of the allegations by women inside the company.


Rupert Murdoch spent part of Wednesday trying to allay fears within his organization.
