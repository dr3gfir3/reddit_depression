	<TEXT> You are not!

I posted this yesterdayhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WWE/comments/5pz1at/jesus_christ_wweenough_already/

Even though it got a bunch of upvotes... Check out the comments. There is a LOT of support for your boy.

My main issue isn't really with RR, it's with the WWE for trying to force feed him to me.

And the kids apparently love him! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The house show I was at 2 years ago... He didn't get booed at all. The crowd went nuts actually.

But I think that's when he was still kind of fresh off The Shield... Rollins was the big heal at the time and RR was still playing the "best friends" with Ambrose angle.

I'm not sure what happened... But times have changed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are 100% correct. I'm not in here trying to spread hate on RR, but the fact is... He's not the best right now. But he IS getting all the best matches, and the fans are calling BS by booing.

Like I said in my original comment... They just need to stop pushing him so hard. Pump the breaks and let him grow an organic fanbase.

And I also agree that he should take time away to reinvent himself. A lot of great wrestlers (including his cousinThe Rock) have gone through a reinvention or two.

In a sick way, it would almost be beneficial if he were to have an an injury, so he would be forced out of action for like 6 months.

Hit the goddamn reset button with this guy already.

	<TEXT> I don't hear his cheers getting any louder either on TV or the House Show I attended. So I'm not sure I actually agree with that, as I've heard it with my own ears.

But I do agree that it's a bit reminiscent of politics... Like the way the DNC tried to force Hilary Clinton on America over Bernie Sanders (the real people's choice), and then ended up losing to Trump.

WWE should take a lesson... You can't force your choice on the fans. Ultimately, they pick who they like. And the more you try and force it, the more you risk negative consequences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This pretty much sums up my point.

I actually don't have a problem with Reigns. I just think it's ridiculous that WWE continues to try and shove him down the throat of the audience rather than let him develop a fan base organically.

The New Day is a good example... Love them or hate them, nobody could have really predicted the niche they filled or how popular they became. It had to grow over time and develop naturally.

It's almost like the powers that be in the WWE are trying to spite the audience by continuing to put Reigns in the spotlight. They don't seem to understand their own fans on this issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fucking Austin... Everything is getting more expensive.

Basically, we've lived here in our current apartment complex for 2 years with the same rent.

We were expecting a bump in our rates this renewal, but $130/month seems like a pretty big bump.

So we went online to compare other complexes in the area and found several advertisements for OUR COMPLEX advertising our exact apartment (same floor plan and square footage) for $80 less that the renewal rate they are offering us.

My thought was just to go into the office, speak with the manager and ask if a mistake was made and then show them the online ads.

Is there a better strategy I should employ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait wait wait... I was giving a serious answer to the question. Fuck all the whiney little bitch cry-babies who downvoted.

The TL;DR questions was... Why does Cena get more attention from the WWE than Kane? And I stand by my answer.

I personally don't think he's ugly... I fucking love Kane! But he's got that wonky eye and cro-magnun for-brow... He's not traditionally handsome like Cena is. They didn't put him in a mask for nothing, people. Issac Yankem scared people.

You dumb fucking fan boys who think they downplay his charitable efforts because it might be bad for the Kane brand are seriously fucking stupid. Seriously.

TV is a petty place. That's why there aren't very many ugly celebrities.

Cena is TV friendly. Kane isn't. Don't overthink it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, man... Good on you. One of the best things I ever did in my life was leave Orlando, FL and move to Los Angeles. The first year was TOUGH. But I did it. And I was very proud of myself when I was able to stick it out and make it work in a new city.

There was nothing particularly wrong with Central Florida... I actually love Florida and may return one day to retire... But just like you, I wanted a change. So many people tried to talk me out of leaving (even close friends), but I stuck to my guns, and it completely changed my life.

I spent 10 years in LA. To say that it was a transformative decade would be an understatement. I now live in Austin, TX and I couldn't be happier with my current life. In fact, moving to Austin was a much easier prospect because I had already jumped cities once before. Had I not been bold enough to make that move, I may very well be doing exactly what I was doing before I left Central Florida.

Now I'm fearless with regard to relocation. I'm not afraid of moving to another city and starting over again if I need to. Some people have lived in the same place their whole life and are crippled by fear thinking about having to move.

If I can offer you one piece of advice... If you have a job currently, look into transferring with that same company to wherever you want to go. I was fortunate when I was in Florida to have 2 jobs (1 full time 1 part time) and I was actually able to transfer with BOTH jobs to Los Angeles. And these were not glamorous jobs... I was an Assistant Manager at a movie Theater and a part-time Assistant Manager at fucking Blockbuster video. BUT... I arrived in LA with 2 jobs. I never had to worry about money. I never had to eat ketchup packets.

If you don't have a job right now, consider getting a gig in your current city with a large retail chain or restaurant group (or something along those lines)... Not only will you be able to save up a little cash for your move, but you will likely be able to transfer with them. If you have an income... Everything else (shelter, food, etc) is easy to arrange. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try to give myself 3 big goals every year. Things that are realistic and achievable.

My Goals   Reasons for 2017... 

**Start learning Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.** I'm out of shape and I don't enjoy typical exercises, but I am fascinated with Mixed Martial Arts and would like to also like to beef up my self-defense skills. BJJ seems like a good fit.

**Open a Savings Account and make regular monthly deposits.** I subscribe to [/r/personalfinance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/?ref=search_subreddits) and this is one of the number one pieces of advice given. I'd like to have a Rainy Day Fund for emergencies as well as start investing in 2018. My girlfriend and I both make a decent living, and it's about time to start saving some of it for the future.

**Travel to Iceland.** We've been invited to a [gay wedding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtgY1q0J_TQ) in Iceland. It will be our first gay wedding and my first big trip abroad. I've traveled extensively in America... It's time to take the show international. The only countries outside of America that I have visited are Mexico and Canada. Everything about Iceland is beautiful and I can't wait to visit, see the sites, and witness my friends get hitched. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Michael Cole is good as far as I'm concerned (not great, but good).

Mauro Ranallo just amuses me to no end. I admit it... I love him.

JBL is a straight 50/50. Sometimes I like him, sometimes I hate him.

Cory Graves has actual moments of brilliance and shows more potential than Otunga or Saxton.

I also don't miss Jerry Lawler and his dumb-ass jokes. </TEXT>

He's always saying the most obvious and/or idiotic thing at the completely wrong time. And when they put him in front camera... OH MY GOD. The guy is awkward at best. He NEVER looks comfortable and it's fucking painful to watch.

His stupid facial expression.

The bizarre gestures.

That shit eating grin.

It's like everybody on RAW is making an A+ and Saxton is scoring an F-.

He's dragging down the cumulative grade point average of the entire show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Downvote me straight to hipster hell, but...

What is the fucking point?

I live in Austin. I understand the disappointment, I even understand the anger and rage. I didn't vote for Trump and I'm not happy about him being the President. Buuuuut...

You have absolutely zero effect on anything by blocking traffic in Austin, TX. Seriously. You change nothing. You expose nothing. You aren't drawing attention to anything that can be altered via protest. It's a complete waste of time.

The only thing you're drawing attention to is yourselves.

Trump will take office.

Protesting can't stop it.

I hope these kids take it an extra step and actually get out and engage and start being proactive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funny. Okay so... I am an Office Manager for a software company in Hyde Park and I've been using InstaCart for almost 3 years nowbasically since they started. My girlfriend also happens to be a Shopper for InstaCart. So this story really interests me.

I noticed the new "Service Charge" thing this past week and wondered what was up.

I just called InstaCart. The gentleman I spoke to says that the 'Service Fee' still represents tips for the workers. I was very specific... I made sure he understood that I was asking if their shoppers and drivers still received the service fee and he said yes.

Was this a lie?

My girlfriend hasn't InstaCarted in a few weeks but she's picking up some shifts this week. Her tips are normally great... If they suddenly take a nosedive this weekI'm calling them back and screaming bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have also posted about this exact issue 3 times since yesterday afternoon and nobody responded to me : (

I called Apple Support and got the same explanation that they know about the problem and are working to fix.

This is infuriating. This is a piece of hardware that has stopped working because of a beef on Apple's end. Can you imagine if they released a software update and all of their iPhones just stopped working? Or MacBooks??

It's fucking absurd. And the Support Staff at Apple is completely worthless when it comes to

A. Explaining the issue.

B. Offering any solutions.

I'm starting to feel my love affair with Apple ending. </TEXT>

The explanation was that something at Apple happened yesterday effecting ALL 2nd and 3rd Gen Apple TVs, and that the Engineers had replicated the problem and were trying to fix it.

Is anybody else having this trouble? It seems kind of crazy. As of this morning, my Gen 3 is still borked. </TEXT>
