	<TEXT> Here's my two cents.

I honestly believe that re-releasing Journey on the PS4 was a mistake. One of the greatest things about Journey on the PS3 was the lack of social connectivity with the console, like the inability to take screenshots or broadcast footage live. This meant each experience was unique and your own.

Porting it to the PS4 made the unique Journey experiences too accessible to others. With live broadcasting and uploading video clips at the touch of a button, people could experience your journey through Journey...but they wouldn't feel how you feel. Where one sees a romp across high dunes, another sees wasted time.

Journey was great when you had your experiences to yourself. </TEXT>
