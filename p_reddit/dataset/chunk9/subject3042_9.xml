	<TEXT>  This movie seems like it's aiming to have a little more depth

They did try to give the first movie some depth, too. IIRC especially in interviews during production the director and writer mentioned how they would depict this society where nobody cares about dinosaurs anymore because they became common. So you would have kids facebooking in front of a T-Rex enclosure and not giving a fuck about the marvel of nature and science roaring before them. I think it was supposed to be both social commentary and a reflection of the current audiences that are sort of fed up and bored with seeing CG dinos and monsters because, unlike the 1993 audience of the original movie, we've all seen that shit a hundred times already. The movie still had all these themes but I don't think they came across as anything deep. </TEXT>

What do you mean by technical level? Citizen Kane was made by a master filmmaker whose technical proficiency cannot be disputed. Do you mean technology? Are old movies inferior to new movies because of technological progress that happened in the intervening years? By that logic, Mona Lisa is shit compared to a selfie.

	<TEXT> Take away the baggage (and largely overblown controversy) of being a whitewashed remake of a beloved anime and you are left with a somewhat flawed movie that could have easily been better or equally easily much worse. Ghost in the Shell ends up being quite average. Not as good as Blade Runner, not as bad as Aeon Flux. The movies futuristic cities with holographic advertisements and sleek robotic designs (some of which were done practically courtesy of the great Weta Workshop) are all wonderful to look at despite some too dim lighting. But visuals alone cant carry the movie. Its not that the plot is really a problem, though. The story is not original, but it does carry enough intrigue and potential philosophy to be interesting and even deep. Its just that the execution is lacking. The films pace often feels sluggish and immobile, the dialogues dont really flow or sound like real conversations, and theres practically no reason to care about anybody (or anything) on screen.

	<TEXT> Life is a welcome addition to the creature feature subgenre, but it has certain flaws that will prevent it from becoming anything more than that. The cast is very solid but the characters aren't compelling and actors of Gyllenhaal's and Fergusson's caliber are given very little to do other than shout into comm systems and be scared. There are also Prometheus levels of bad decisions and suspension of disbelief as the film's internal logic is inconsistent at best and nonexistent at worst. One sequence has a character trying to kill Calvin with a flamethrower, peppering everything around him with bursts of flames in complete disregard of what he might destroy in the process. A minute later, that same room's fire suppression system goes off from a single, much smaller flame, simply because it serves the plot at that point. Many scenes require the viewer to stop thinking and it's that particular brand of dumb writing that turns a potentially great movie into an average flick. It's only really elevated by the last five minutes, which display an intensity of survival and a darkness of tone that should have been present throughout.  </TEXT>

Aren't you contracting yourself a bit? Either it's a fresh concept or it's based on a comic book. I don't see how you can have both. (Don't tell me "most people never even heard of the comic book" because you could say the exact same thing about Guardians, which is why I made that comparison in the first place. The only thing GotG had going for it compared to Valerian is that it had the Marvel label. But you could say this has the Besson label, which still attracts audiences to a certain degree.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  James Gun is an incredibly talented director and a visionary for the Guardians series, which managed to make an amazing movie out of a group of comic book characters barely anyone had ever heard of. Luc Besson, as talented as he is, did make Fifth Element and Leon, but then went a strange direction with Lucy.

I don't understand why people keep bringing up Lucy as if that movie negates everything Besson did before it and makes him a hack forever onward. Gunn co-directed Movie 43 and his Slither was completely average, so let's not pretend that he's some genius, faultless director who outshines Besson because of Lucy (which actually wasn't half as bad as people on reddit make it out to be).

Also, let me briefly rant about Gunn being a visionary for GotG. First of all, that word completely lost its meaning a long time ago. Every other trailer has "from visionary director such and such" these days. And second, let's not pretend like GotG is solely Gunn's baby. I don't doubt that a lot of his sweat and tears went into the movie and it's obvious he is very passionate about the franchise, but don't think for a second that he had full control and called all the shots. GotG is not his vision. It's an adaptation of someone else's vision filtered through so many Marvel and Disney board room meetings that it would make your head spin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bonjour Mr. Besson. I am excited to see your new movie Valerian. The source material was obviously very influential and many movies have borrowed stuff from the comic book. How did you and your design team approach the visuals of Valerian to make it look different to modern movies but also keeping the look of the comic book? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a couple of things they could still do with the concept of toys coming to life. I've had a couple of ideas just off the top of my head. It's just that none of those ideas have any real emotional resonance, which I feel was already done extremely well in the first three movies. And none of those ideas really warrant a full length film.

So, for example, I guess they could explore 3D printing. They could have a lot of fun with that. The kid could design and print her own toys according to her imagination, or make accessories for the existing toy characters. Or the toys could even be doing all that on their own. I don't know, it could be fun and it would be relevant to our times.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not going to pretend that I won't watch the movie. Of course I will. Of course I want to see what they came up with. But I also really, really don't. 

People like to say that sequels/reboots ruin the original movie and usually that's total bullshit. Don't like the remake of Total Recall? Just don't watch it and stfu. But with Blade Runner it's different. Blade Runner has a core mystery that has kept audiences guessing for more than 30 years. Is Deckard a replicant or not? It depends on what version of the movie you watch and how you interpret it. This question is the lasting legacy of the movie. Yes, it was visually groundbreaking, but then again, so many movies were. It's the mystery that has kept everyone so interested. And the sequel ruins that. I don't even have to see the movie to have Blade Runner ruined. Just the fact that Ford is in it playing Deckard is enough to ruin the original for me. He's not a replicant. Thanks for answering that for me, Hollywood nostalgia machine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I usually see only one 3D film a year and the past two years were Star Wars. I expect that trend to continue with episode 8. I think of 3D as a sort of carnivale ecperience. Like once a year I go all out, buy the most expensive movie ticket for 3D, the biggest popcorn, the biggest soda, and just go have fun. But that's an approach that only works if I do it seldom. The fun and novelty of 3D wears off quickly no matter how well it's done amd the price is too damn high.

I actually broke my once a year rule and saw Dr Strange in 3D, and I kind of regreted it. The presentation was not very good (too dim) and some of the visuals were so crazy that adding another dimension to them was distracting in that it was one more thing for the eye (brain) to process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this video is a testament to how big a mess this movie actually was. To think that the best scene, the one that everyone raved about the most, was just a last minute afterthought, is mindblowing to me. No one thought of showing Darth Vader in action during the entire process of preparing this movie? What were the writers of this movie thinking?

I was also taken aback by the part when Edwards discusses his process, where he just has cool scenes in his mind and then he has to link them together somehow. That's not storytelling. That's a fanboy with toys acting out some fantasies and then stitching them together with some plot. Pre-visualizations and action scenes dictating story. What is Hollywood doing?  </TEXT>

 I do not think it's PC or politically correct to have a crew that reflects the diversity of the people watching the show.

Considering how many minorities watch mainstream TV and movies versus how those minorities are usually represented in said TV and movies, I think Trek is pretty fucking PC.
