	<TEXT> The Canadian Rockies are composed of layer upon layer of [sedimentary rocks](http://i.imgur.com/F0cvLbp.jpg) (sandstone, shales, limestone) that were deposited billions of years ago. It's a long a complex story but to summarize... skipping ahead hundreds of millions of years... as the super continent [Pangea](http://i.imgur.com/VoKXjIt.jpg) rifted apart, the west coast of ancestral North America accreted numerous allochthonous (found in a place other than where they and their constituents were formed) volcanic islands, etc (much like a snow as it builds up in front of a shovel). It wasn't until Vancouver Island, etc., (part of a terrane known as Wrangellia - labelled 'W' in the following graphic) were accreted that the Canadian Rockies were pushed up from the beneath the water. [Here](http://plate-tectonic.narod.ru/terranesswamer1photoalbum.html) is the graphic. Search for "Where Terranes Collide: The Geology of Western Canada" for an older, yet good introduction to the topic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is much speculation due to the large degree of uncertainty, however, there are some major themes that are generally accepted. Solar luminosity would have been lower^[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faint_young_Sun_paradox) , and the oceans would have been shallower, with lower bathymetry, as a result of a higher heat flow, and therefore eruptive composition of lavas leaning more favourably towards a Komatiite composition (very low silica content). There is evidence to suggest that prior to the dominance of  chlorophyll-based organisms, retinal-based photosynthesis may have dominated resulting in purple oceans^[2](http://www.astrobio.net/biosphere/did-earth-have-purple-oceans/) . 

Though there are newer editions, I highly recommend the following, free, text book, [Earth as an Evolving Planetary System](http://wzanews.com/IMG2/book/general%20geology/11.pdf) (pdf) which may provide you with the detailed answers you are looking for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not Jade. It's certainly not nephrite, which belongs to the tremolite-actinolite-ferro actinolite solid solution series, due to its colour and texture, etc. Nephrite is limited in colour with only components of white (tremolite), green (actinolite) and black (ferro-actinolite). 

It's not Jadeite either as it a) lacks the sugary texture you see in Jadeite b) Jadeite does not change colour c) A piece of Jadeite that consistent in colour, that transparent, etc. would be worth millions d) That specific [pink and blue](https://www.gia.edu/gia-faq-jade-pink-blue) are not typical [colors of Jadeite](http://masonkay.com/colors-of-jade)

	<TEXT> Not really, but kind of. In most cases there are definitely tell tale signs that an eruption is likely as magma begins to ascend. Movement of magma will generate detectable earthquakes ([harmonic tremors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmonic_tremor)), the ground may deform, thermal anomalies may form, and changes in the temperature and chemistry of the groundwater and spring waters may appear. 

As far as timing older events, there are a number of methods to date individual lava flows. While there are certainly exceptions, and uncertainties, I wouldn't go so far as to say we 'don't know shit about timing.' </TEXT>

A serendipitous movie of an occultation of Io by its neighboring moon Europa when the team re-observed Io on the night of March 7, 2015 for a follow up to the work done for the published study. Europa happened to pass in front of Io as observed from Earth. Loki is the bright volcano on the left and Pele the other one on the lower right. Europa appears dark because the water ice on its surface absorbs the incident sunlight at the wavelength used. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I'm aware, the oldest DNA recorded was found in Greenland ice, estimated to be between 450,000ka - 800,000ka. 

Diminishing returns

By comparing the specimens' ages and degrees of DNA degradation, the researchers calculated that DNA has a half-life of 521 years. That means that after 521 years, half of the bonds between nucleotides in the backbone of a sample would have broken; after another 521 years half of the remaining bonds would have gone; and so on.

The team predicts that even in a bone at an ideal preservation temperature of 5 C, effectively every bond would be destroyed after a maximum of 6.8 million years. The DNA would cease to be readable much earlier  perhaps after roughly 1.5 million years, when the remaining strands would be too short to give meaningful information.

\- [Genetic material can't be recovered from dinosaurs](http://www.nature.com/news/dna-has-a-521-year-half-life-1.11555)

As far as soft tissue preservation, structure and texture can certainly be preserved depending on environmental conditions for a considerable length of time. For example, the soft tissue preservation of Precambrian ([540Ma](http://www.geomore.com/wp-content/uploads/GEOLOGIC-TIME-SCALE-COURTESY-GSA.jpg)) organisms: [Exceptional preservation of soft-bodied Ediacara Biota promoted by silica-rich oceans](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/early/2016/10/03/G38542.1.abstract) </TEXT>

Unfortunately, there is simply too much information for me to even being explaining, however, it's fairly intuitive / user friendly.
[Here](http://i.imgur.com/bYIL0Jy.jpg) the terrane box is situated on Wells Gray Peak, I've simply selected the External Provider (located to the right of the Legend box) as Google Hybrid and selected from within the legend box Geology -- terrane transparent as well as faults, and bedrock geology -- bedrock labels

You can play around with a lot. In the following example I've simply zoomed in, switched the External Provider to Google Physical, and turned on the Geology, Bedrock transparent along with the labels. Simply hovering with 'pan' hand over the region of interest brings up the specific details of each as shown [here](http://i.imgur.com/hnRf77H.png) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/EqFSjyi.jpg).

You can turn on all sorts of minfile data / reports, regional geochemistry samples (RGS), showings, past producers, productive mines, the list goes on and on. Have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In truth, the picture isn't so clear cut. *Generally* speaking, while the amount of volatiles present in a magma are what drive explosive eruptions, it's the viscosity of the magma, that determines whether an eruption will be explosive or not. At low-viscosities (think basalt ~50% SiO2) the gases are able to migrate through the magma and escape to the surface. However, in more viscous magmas (think rhyolite ~70% SiO2), the high polymerization acts to impede the migration of the gases, resulting in increased pressures subsequently leading to explosive volcanism. 

Exceptions, for example, could be a silica rich magma that degassed which would result in an obsidian flows, or a basaltic magma coming into contact with ground water (see: [phreatomagmatic eruption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuff_cone)) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *about* 81%

The author, [Steven M. Stanley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_M._Stanley), presents some convincing arguments within the paper, and while I disagree with some of his assumptions I don't think they're unreasonable. The value of ~81% is arrived at through the use of a genus-level rarefaction curve for species losses in major mass extinctions and then "shifted downward by 4 percentage points, to 80.581.5% (dashed line), to account for clustering of extinctions within certain taxa" [figure 5](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/09/28/1613094113/F5.expansion.html)

He notes how previous authors (Raup, and Sepkoski) recognize that some of their analysis could be considered dubious, and discusses how their results would have artificially elevated values by erroneously combining two separate events as one (combining data for the Guadalupian and terminal Permian crises). Given that Raup's actual estimates were reported as 8896% (often rounded to 9095%) and considering the aforementioned, 80.5-81.5% certainly seems reasonable.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of comments disregarding glacial links; however, that doesn't mean that glacial activity did not contribute to its present day formation. Immediately to the left there appears to be what could have easily have been a cirque glacier. Like rivers and streams, alpine glaciers don't forge their own paths, they follow topographical lows along faults, basins, etc. 

I would argue that while the initial feature is likely structurally related (fault, fracture, eroded dyke - note its orientation parallels other structural features, etc) that glacial activity has played a significant role in the past. The region has been exposed to extensive glaciation through several glacial-interglacial events via the Cordilleran Ice Sheet (note the rounded top - an indicator that glaciers may have once topped this mountain). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the most part I think we are on the same page, however, our definitions may be what are leading to our hair splitting. 

Yes you need a path for the magma, but no you don't necessarily need to form faults prior to magma ascent and independently to the location where this magma is ascending (otherwise, the Emperor seamounts would have had a hard time to be formed).

Magma ascent through mantle upwelling does not need faults (obviously), however, once the magma reaches shallow depths, without some form of tectonism (deformation of the crust) it cannot continue to ascend. At deeper depths, stoping may occur, and as the crust warms it will deform through extensional faults, fractures or fissure (all forms of tectonism) which permit doming / bulging of the crust in order to accommodate the underlying magma. Thus far, there has been no volcanism. Over pressure may fracture the rock within the crust leading to magma injection and the formation of feeder dykes eventually permitting it to reach the surface ([this applies to hot spot volcanism^[1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n8/images/ngeo1878-f3.jpg), arc volcanoes^[2](http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/41/7/767/F1.large.jpg) etc.]). Once it reaches the surface (or is very near the surface) it is volcanism. 

Now that volcanism has been generated, through a generalized sequence (tidal heating - upwelling - tectonism - volcanism) crustal loading can generate new stress regimes and bukling, overprinting the previous events and leading to orientations that are regional rather than global. As I stated previously, part of the reason I didn't wish to go into much detail is due to the non-unique nature of the problem. Until you can bring me a seismic survey and some core samples there a plethora of non-unique solutions that are all plausible explanations as is clearly stated in the introduction of "[GLOBAL LINEATIONS AND REGIONAL STRUCTURAL  MAPPING  OF  IOS PATERAE AND MOUNTAINS: IMPLICATIONS FOR CRUSTAL STRESSES AND FEATURE EVOLUTION](http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2016/pdf/2355.pdf)" (2016) (pdf).

My initial point concerning Io, however, was that you cannot have volcanism without some form of tectonism preceding it, after which you can have all the crustal loading you want to give rise to further volcanism. Given the above (an attempt at clarifying definitions), is this point still disputed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I guess different labs have different definitions of what tectonic activity is... It's not that important, though.

a) No they don't, it's well defined. Again, you can have tectonic activity without plate tectonics, but you cannot have plate tectonics without tectonism.

b) It's actually very important so that we're at least on the same page and not talking past one another. You don't get to brush its importance aside because you were shown to be, very clearly, incorrect.


As for Io, I relented even discussing the topic because so little material is available, often done by a handful of researchers, and can be contradictory (it's also based on very limited data sets). That being said...

You're unnecessary smarmy attitude doesn't get you a free pass around the basics of a first year geology either. Volcanism does not occur, cannot occur, unless there is a pathway for the magma to ascend - there's no arguing that, it's a simple physical constraint (or in your own words, "that's basic logic"). So I would again state what I previously stated noting that nothing you have presented contradicts the following, or my previous comment:

Io's crustal tides, driven by tidal heating, result in tectonic activity which then provide pathways (faults) along which magma can travel, subsequently reaching the surface leading to volcanism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's incorrect, tectonics is about how the crust deforms whether or not that includes plate tectonics or not. In other words you can have tectonic activity without plate tectonics, but you cannot have plate tectonics without tectonism. You cannot have wrinkle ridges, fault scarps, and many other landforms without tectonism; however, you can clearly have them without plate tectonics as is noted by features on Ceres, Mercury, our Moon, etc.

As per the [Lunar and Planetary Institute](http://www.lpi.usra.edu/education/explore/shaping_the_planets/tectonism.shtml):

**Are there tectonics on other planets?**
Like Earth, Venus and Mars are believed to have hot interiors. This means that they are continuing to lose heat. While their surfaces show evidence of recent deformation  tectonism  neither planet has plate tectonic activity because neither planet has a surface divided into plates.

Io's internal heat is driven by tidal heating, however, its volcanism is a result of tectonism (volcanism is a form of tectonic activity?), much like the volcanism in Earth's East African Rift. As [Turtle et al](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2000JE001354/abstract;jsessionid=CBB4116C00C6EE9E41956AD476800C31.f03t04) argue:

The large fraction (40%) of mountains that are associated with paterae suggests that in some cases these features are tectonically related.

An example illustrating this is also within [Io after Galileo](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/68/2/R02) which states the following:

the relationship between mountains and paterae... indicates that many paterae are formed as magma preferentially ascends along tectonic faults associated with mountain building. [see figure 'a'](http://cdn.iopscience.com/images/0034-4885/68/2/R02/Full/rpp164819fig08.jpg).

Io's crustal tides, driven by tidal heating, result in tectonic activity which then provide pathways (faults) along which magma can travel, subsequently reaching the surface leading to volcanism.

	<TEXT> I can't actually comment on variability between batches as this is my first taste of anything Aberlour. I've wanted to venture more towards the other side of the spectrum away from the more typical Islay's (smoke and peat) to the more fruit and sherry bottlings. After a bit of research I opted for Aberlour's A'bunadh and have no regrets in doing so. 

As for speculating between batches I would suspect that some degree of variation is likely to exist, but that there would not be enough to dissuade one from purchasing a bottle no matter the batch. Had the A'bunadh been more complex I could easily see myself rating it in 90's. The lowest I would rate it would likely be 87, however, the finish was simply too good not to pull the score up by a point (I had initially rated it at 88). All that being said, I can't see anyone rating it below 85 no matter the batch, and as far as I'm concerned anything over 85 is easily worth exploring.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I was trying to recall who's argument it was but couldn't. It was, as you have suggested, Kemp et al. (certainly not mine, I'm simply reiterating from past lecture material that managed to stick). Very insightful points of discussion. Given your knowledge, I suspect you have far more than an undergraduate degree. May I ask what your area of focus is in?

If temperatures were similar enough to modern values (roughly speaking) does this not imply a setting that would promote plate tectonics much like our modern plate tectonics? If not, why not? This doesn't appear to be the case however with some studies suggesting drip tectonics, etc. and the onset of modern plate tectonics around [~3.0Ga](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v8/n7/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html).

	<TEXT> Thanks for the update, I was unaware of the analytical artifact. It's been a while but I recalled parts of this debate from one of my courses during my undergraduate degree. 

Also the oxygen isotope data from the Hadean zircons cannot be used to infer a granitic crust, only that there was liquid water.

Wasn't that exactly what Wilde et al. did in their paper, "[Evidence from detrital zircons for the existence of continental crust and oceans on the Earth 4.4Gyr ago](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v409/n6817/full/409175a0.html)" though somewhat indirectly... 

"*We found that the zircon is zoned with respect to rare earth elements and oxygen isotope ratios (18O values from 7.4 to 5.0), indicating that it formed from an evolving magmatic source. The evolved chemistry, high 18O value and micro-inclusions of SiO2 are consistent with growth from a granitic melt,  with a 18O value from 8.5 to 9.5.*"

Although the 18O values are assumed to be weathered at low temperatures, forming clays that are later melted to produce granite which crystallizes minerals with high 18O, another mechanism is possible that produces these values without low surface temperatures. 

Early basaltic crust weathered under a CO2-rich atmosphere would produce carbonate minerals and clays. The weathering occurs at 100-200C (cooling as CO2 drawn-down into carbonate minerals) forming carbonate minerals with high 18O. Subsequently these altered basalts are melted by further basaltic intrusions and radiogenic heating to produce dioritic intrusions
which crystallizes minerals (including zircon) with high 18O.

Hf perhaps isn't the best indicator either for continental crust as the Earth and Moon share very similar Hf values with the obvious note that the Moon has no continental crust nor plate tectonics.

As far as I'm aware it is possible that Hadean detrital zircons record Earth having settled down to a modern like planet (plate tectonics, low T oceans) by 4.4 Ga; however, it is equally possible that Hadean detrital zircons record the draw-down of a massive greenhouse atmosphere, a stagnant lid lithosphere (and deep mantle melting because the mantle was hotter) and a largely
basalt crust that locally was remelted due to high radiogenic heat production and contact
metamorphism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would be hesitant to accept delta O-18 values in zircons as support for a felsic crust or the presence of liquid water. Because there can be multiple mechanisms for creating the same isotopic values we cannot rely solely on a single line of evidence. For example lunar zircons have been shown to have similar heavy oxygen isotope compositions as those of Earth. Providing our understanding that the Moon has had neither liquid water or felsic crust, the evidence in support of these features on Earth becomes far less certain, and clearly other mechanisms can be responsible for elevated delta O-18 values in zircons.

This implies that there is no support for the presence of an ocean on the surface of the early Earth and as the ocean appears to be an essential ingredient for the plate tectonics, there is no basis for belief that this mechanism was operating in the early history of the planet. -[NASA](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20080030961) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Under the assumption that the early solar system was habitable there is absolutely no reason to invoke *panspermia*. There is good fossil evidence for life as early as 3.5Ga, and potentially earlier as this study ([and others](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/life-on-earth-likely-started-at-least-4-1-billion-years-ago-much-earlier-than-scientists-had-thought)) suggests that are in good agreement with [abiogenesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis). 

The point is that if life is capable of evolving in an early inner habitable solar system then you don't need a delivery method because it's already there to begin with. On the other hand, if the early inner solar system was not habitable I could see at least some *small* reason to suggest panspermia may have played a role; however, the vast majority of evidence simply does not support the latter.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fail to see how the *potential*\* discovery of 3.7Ga microbial fossils further supports panspermia. It seems like an unnecessary leap altogether, only complicating the picture (Occam's razor). Rather than invoking the complexities of panspermia, why not simply suggest that the early solar system was likely habitable (ie. Earth, Mars, Venus)?


"Nutman and his colleagues urge great caution and skepticism. "The problem is that structures that look similar to stromatolites can form without the action of living organisms," Allwood writes, and within today's fossils "there are no organic or cellular remains." 

And for good reason. His previous findings along similar lines (dating back to [1996](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v384/n6604/abs/384055a0.html)) have not yet been convincing enough to be accepted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Colour: Somewhere between white wine   pale straw

Body: Full bodied, rich and soft

Nose: Fruity - Green apples and peach, campfire smoke, peat, and a hint of vanilla in the distance

Palate: A burst of honeyed fruits with citrus: lemons, oranges, and peaches. Tobacco smoke and pepper begin to emerge.  

Finish: Lingering flavours of tobacco and sweetness with a bite of pepper. 

Score: 88/100

Notes: Matured in refill European and American oak casks, with an ABV of 48% (compared to 43% for the
16 year old) this celebratory scotch and tribute to Alfred Bernard's visit to the distillery is beautifully balanced.
A fitting tribute indeed, and well worth experiencing.  </TEXT>
