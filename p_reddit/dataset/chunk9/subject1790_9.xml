	<TEXT> One of the interviews I've listened to in the past few months had an old coal miner talking about how he tells people to get out of there and do anything else and a younger guy who said he didn't care because it's what his family did.

There was another story I read last year about a small town in Maine that refused to open a call center because it wasn't something they did in that town. A lot of rural towns think they need to have these masculine jobs for locals to work at. 

That view of work along with technology infrastructure are both things that need to change if rural America wants opportunities </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It always makes me think about a comment I saw about the issue of rural areas being left behind: that for a lot of the country they don't view it as a problem that needs to be fixed.

It is interesting that Clinton seems to be the only mainstream person who pushes for rural areas to get technology infrastructure. It is keeping companies from expanding into these areas and until it gets resolved you will see these places continue to lose population  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former S.C. Police Officer Pleads Guilty In Shooting Of Walter Scott 


http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/05/02/526580300/former-s-c-police-officer-pleads-guilty-in-shooting-of-walter-scott

The AP reports that Slager facing a possible sentence of life in prison and $250,000 in fines, but that prosecutors "prosecutors are proposing a sentence based on federal guidelines for a second-degree murder conviction, which recommend more than 20 years."

This was the part I was referring to. Is that from before the plea deal?  </TEXT>
