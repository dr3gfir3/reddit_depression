Let's say Tracer just used her last blink to blink forwards, unloaded her guns into a target, and they have 10 HP left. How does she finish them? She can't.

	<TEXT>  Anyway I just believe they can do all that stuff without any cause to delay any system.

Then address my examples. What if the old client simply does not allow a new feature to be implemented. Should all players then be denied the feature? 

I *can* judge this, because I work in this industry. And these things I'm talking about are what Riot has said themselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, they really can't. I'm a software developer. I know how this stuff goes. Riot has a billion and one things to do. They can't afford to keep old shit around just for the sake of players like you who prefer the old client. It stops them from moving forward.

Think of it like this: there's the upcoming 10 ban system. Now, if they have to maintain the old client in parallel, it takes longer to get the 10 ban system released because of the old client being hard to maintain. So **everyone** has to wait an extra two months before they get the feature they want. This is bad for the game and bad for the community.

But even worse: what if there's a critical issue in the old client that completely prevents 10 bans from being implemented? Now you can't publish that feature for **anyone**, just because a small percentage of players prefer the old client. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm having to look at uni's I want to go to next year and choosing the right course and that is freaking me out to start with.

As a 29-year-old who studied 4 different things before figuring out what I wanted, this drives me insane. An 18-year-old should not be expected to know what they want to do with the rest of their life. But sadly that is how society is currently structured, and there's not a whole lot you can do about it.

If you can, it might be a really good idea to take a year off before you go to uni and maybe do something like working retail.

 But I can't tell them I'm upset they're leaving because I want them to peruse their dreams and do what they want - I don't want them to feel bad for having a life.

A big part of having mature conversations with your loved ones is understanding that you can say you are unhappy about something without blaming or making the other party feel bad. It would be healthy for you to tell them you will miss them.

Relationships take work, but if your instinct is that your boyfriend is not a good presence in your life, it may be time to move on. Even if that is scary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a really great article on /r/programming about this just the other day! http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/04/09/six-programming-paradigms-that-will/

But most of those suggestions are very much "out there" - they're basically a bunch of esolangs (esoteric languages) that exist more as experiments than anything else.

So if you want something useful that has a future, functional programming is absolutely the way to go. I would suggest Clojure - it strikes a really nice balance between hardcore functional programming (it's a Lisp)   real-world usability (many, many companies use it in production; it runs on the Java virtual machine and has a JS version called ClojureScript). [Clojure for the Brave and True](https://www.braveclojure.com/clojure-for-the-brave-and-true/) is the best programming book I have ever read.

EDIT: The reason I (and others) suggest FP is this. It's a completely different way of thinking about code. All four of the languages you mentioned ultimately boil down to *imperative* code. That means they do things by giving a list of steps to take; the result is implied by the steps. FP is *declarative*. This means it boils down to saying what the result looks like; the steps are implied by the result. It will bend your mind, I promise. :)

It has a fun second benefit, which is homoiconicity, the favoured buzzword of Lisp hackers. The TL;DR is that the way the computer represents your code internally looks almost exactly like you represent the code in the text. That means the language can make it really easy to let you write code that _produces code_. You can do absolutely mind-blowing shit like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't play Shattered, but I think your questions are pretty general. Shattered players feel free to correct me.

 Lately I've been saving my potions trying to find scrolls of identify but I feel like I just end up dying with them later on. Is it better to just drink them or throw them to see what I've got?

Just drink them, for the most part. You can often tell which ones are the healing pots - you tend to get way more of them than any other type. You can also use deduction to figure out things like fire pots - you will always guaranteed get at least 1 fire pot on a level with a wooden obstacle. So if you have 3 identified potions and 1 unidentified, and you've cleared the level, and there's a wooden obstacle, it's a fire pot.

 Is it better to basically fully explore all the levels up to Goo before trying to fight it?

You should be fully exploring every single level! Until the late game, anyway. You get little enough loot already, no sense in further limiting it.

 I feel like I'm not increasing my strength that much. It might be because of question #2 about the potions but it feels like I'm finding a good amoung of weapons and armor I simply can't use.

You guessed it.

 Should I wait until I've basically collected everything within a level before using scrolls?

This is what I typically do. You don't want to wait too long on identifying things, but if you read an unidentified scroll and discover it's an identify scroll, and you have nothing in your inventory to identify, you lose out.

 Or is it simply a case of search only when it seems like there could be a room/hallway attached?

You will get too hungry if you search every room. Better to search the ones that seem likely. You build an instinct for this over time. </TEXT>

I think the hard part is knowing when _not_ to heal. This game so often comes down to a knife's edge, and that means you might lose a fight that you could otherwise have won if you stop healing that Rein because you thought he was dead for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a universal problem in online games. It goes a little like this:

* The goal of the game is to complete X objective.
* A "meta" exists, which is a generally accepted set of strategies that _usually_ maximise the chances of achieving X.
* Therefore, following the meta will _on average_ maximise your chances of victory.
* (Here's where it breaks down.) Therefore, _an individual_ player _not_ following the meta means you _will_ lose.

Essentially, people become more concerned with playing the game "correctly" (i.e. according to their subjective interpretation of the meta) than with playing the game _successfully_.

If you want to see proof, go try to play Hanzo in a competitive Overwatch game, or jungle Karma in League of Legends. </TEXT>

No. As far as your computer is concerned, your keyboard is a stock standard Microsoft 104-key. All a keyboard is is a device for emitting keycodes. Your "keyboard" could be a DDR dance pad, for all your computer knows; all it really knows for sure is that it is receiving keycodes. 

However, if you start programming macros (multiple key outputs in a short time from one shortcut), then yes, this can be detected (because you as a human cannot possibly type the same 7 characters a millisecond apart over and over).  </TEXT>

Messages are more effective when they are focused.

You can split hairs about the exact wording they should have used and the cost/benefit breakdown for different phrases, but the phrase as it stands is close enough to what the movement wanted to achieve: stop the police from getting away with killing minorities.

	<TEXT>  On one hand there is the problem that (as far as I know, feel free to correct me), many developers are poorly paid for their time and are very stressed (for example at EA, but that might be an extreme).

Not true.

 The other problem is that I kind-of already have some experience in these other STEM fields and don't want to completely abandon them.

This is called the sunk cost fallacy. Forget about the past. Think about the future. What do you want to do? Then do that.

Don't go study chem. Either study one of those computer-related degrees at your uni, or go do your military thing. You don't necessarily need a degree - I don't have one. If you can show a potential employer that you made an app with hundreds of downloads, you're already doing better than most computer science graduates. </TEXT>

As for whether it's legal... IANAL. But the law consistently lags behind what technology is capable of. We still have laws that treat digital media as if it's the same thing as a physical object! So there might be some archaic laws that make it illegal. However, no-one is going to bother to sue you. Why would they? You're not selling anything, you're not claiming their work to be yours...

	<TEXT> So first off, I would say your post title is misleading. When we talk about "efficiency", we mean code that executes fast   uses few resources - in other words, we're talking about _performance_. What you're asking is more about how to organise   structure your code.

---

_Structure_ your code. At the moment your main function does the following:

1. Fades in the console.
2. Sets up data (rooms, items, text, etc).
3. Creates helper functions.
4. Adds event listeners.
5. Runs the main game code.

This is incredibly confusing to read as there is no separation between one thing and the next. So the first quick win: break each of those sections out into a separate function, and in your main function, call those five functions in turn. Your main function should look something like this when you're done:

    $(document).ready(function() {
      displayConsole();
      initializeData();
      attachListeners();
      runGame();
    }

You don't actually need to make a function like this for your helpers - just declare your helpers before you call `$(document).ready()`.

---

You're currently making a bunch of variables like `strangeRoom`, `zombie`, `sword`, etc and just sticking them in the global namespace. There's a few issues with this.

Let's say you wanted multiple zombies. How would you achieve this? Would you just make `zombie1`, `zombie2`, `zombie3` etc? If so, how would your combat code look? You'd have to add code to every place that references a zombie to check for every single possible zombie variable... And if later in your game you choose to add a fourth zombie, you have to go back _again_ to every place that references your zombies and add an `if (zombie4)...`.

You've also probably noticed that adding a new room, item, etc requires a new set of branching `if` code to handle that object. What if you could just set up your game code once and then just add objects to extend your game?

To this end: put your game data - items, rooms, enemies, etc - into collections. You probably want a big ol' object that looks a bit like this:

    var gameData = {
      items: [
        {
          name: 'sword',
          combat: true,
          owned: false,
          // ...
        },
        {
          name: 'torch',
          combat: false,
          owned: false,
          // ...
        }
      ],
      enemies: [
        {
          name: 'zombie',
          // ...
        }
      ]
    }

Say you wanted to check how many enemies still live - you could just do `gameData.enemies.length`! Easy.

If you think along these lines, you should be able to see how you can start to re-write your game logic (all those `if`s) in a way so that they don't look up fixed conditions (`input == "open old door"    currentRoom == strangeRoom`), but rather dynamic ones (`input == room.input    room.accessibleRooms.indexOf(currentRoom) != -1`). And similarly, instead of executing fixed code, you execute code dynamically that you store in the game object.

---

An actual performance concern: the way your game code is currently structured, you are checking more than 30 `if` statements for every user input! Obviously, if `input == "look end table"`, it cannot also be true that `input == "look bookshelves"` - so why isn't it an `else if`?

Assuming you leave your input checks as they are, once you find a match (e.g. `input == "look barrel"`), you should `return` after executing the relevant code so that you don't run through several dozen `if`s that you already know will not be true.

---

Ultimately, for the current functionality, your core game code should be maybe... 20 lines? But you should have a bunch of game objects, each one with its own related game code to execute. Something like this:

    rooms: [
      {
        name: 'lounge',
        commands: [
          {
            input: 'look chair',
            result: function() {
              // do stuff
            }
          },
          {
            input: 'look end table',
            result: function() {
              // do stuff
            }
          }
          // ...
        ]
      }
    ]

My examples aren't great just because there's so much you could improve! But hopefully this gives you some idea of what you could do.

EDIT: I'm really glad this post is getting positive reactions, but I just thought I should reiterate: this is by no means an exhaustive guide to how you should structure code. I tried to give some useful, more or less standalone pointers. </TEXT>

Not everyone agrees with the idea of the "greater good". Libertarians believe in personal liberty above all else.

So if you can conceive of a way in which your organs have utility to you after death, then a libertarian view would say you have the right to hang on to them.

	<TEXT> It's just a slur people use when you don't meet their arbitrary definition of "how the game is supposed to be played".

Picking Hanzo, for instance, is considered "trolling" by many, because whether you're good at Hanzo or not doesn't matter, and whether you win or not doesn't matter - all that matters is that you play the game "correctly". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We strongly associate the sensation of mint with coolness   freshness. Naturally, toothpaste/mouthwash companies want you to feel fresh when you use their product, as that will make you trust it more - so they flavour it with mint.

Mint contains a compound that is sort of the opposite of capsaicin (found in chillies) - it tricks your body into thinking it is experiencing cold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's important to analyse how we tell stories, among other reasons because children base their world view on what they see in stories. If they repeatedly see the woman being the gentle pure virgin who must be rescued by the strong brave man, it stands to reason that they would begin to view women as helpless, weak, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, interesting!

As I said, look to text-based RPGs. Pokmon games do this.

There's also one particular instance of it being done in voice: Fallout 4 features a robot character who will call you by name, if your chosen name (male or female) is one of a list of names they recorded audio for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My point is: just because you don't _know_ you're being racist doesn't make you not a racist.

And as for the "but worse things happen!!" argument: you can take that to absurdity. By that sort of reasoning, all scientific research not related to climate change or cancer should stop until we have fixed global warming   cured cancer. </TEXT>

What do you think colonists in the 17th century thought of black people? Did they think they were being cruel to real human beings? Or did they think they were justified in treating them as "apes"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the name for proper grown-up typing with all your fingers.

The short version is: every key is assigned to a specific finger, and you only ever hit that key with that finger. This lets your hands stay in basically one place, which in turn increases comfort and efficiency. And because you only have a small number of keys assigned to each finger, you don't have to look at the keyboard to type. </TEXT>
