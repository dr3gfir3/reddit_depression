	<TEXT> Emotionally, mentally, I've been having a rough time lately. Books have been an excellent way to put my stormy mind at ease, to simply read the words and picture the story in my mind. I use it as a way to relax, I don't spend too much time analyzing deeply what I'm reading but instead let the story take place in my mind like a movie. It's honestly quite pleasing </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm curious to know what you guys think. From what I gather, this is considered one of the worst things introduced to the show right? I read all the way through the All Out War arc and don't remember anything like that. Huh. Must be Gimple and his silly ideas lol </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you watch a show from the POV of a slutty character? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Like, let's say the show is not erotica but instead an action, mystery or horror or whatever.  But see, the main character in this show is an utter slut. Sleeping with strangers, offering blowjobs behind bars at 3am, that kind of stuff. The plot would not revolve around that, but who's to say that the main character can't shove things in places where things aren't meant to be shoved? 

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I just finished season 1 of The Missing and it broke my heart. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Jesus, this was unrelenting. I knew a heartbreak was coming and it was still  devastating to see that last episode. This show, IMO, is up there with the likes of True Detective and The Killing. I want to say though, that I quickly grew fond of Julien Baptiste. He was such a good man and I like that he had a really good heart, it's refreshing to see after all the gruff type detectives lately. I highly recommend this show, 10/10 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 3x01 of BCS was slow, without much plot advancement. On the other hand, TWD had a *fantastic* season premiere back in October. Look up reaction videos of TWD. Did fans of BCS feel such strong emotions yesterday? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do these games require a higher skill level? I ask because everytime I try to play them I get destroyed. 

I can hold myself up in Attrition, Live Fire, Pilot vs Pilot and so on, but those 2 games modes, the most objective based, I just suck. Do you guys have any tips? I play alone and without a mic so I can't really rely on teamwork </TEXT>
