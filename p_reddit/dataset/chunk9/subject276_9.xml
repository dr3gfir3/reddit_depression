DD should have been taken out, he was too much of a liability towards the end. 

Would have liked Gray to come on instead of Ulloa. 

Where do we think Ulloa is going to be next season? I doubt King is going anywhere anytime soon, but do we think he'll realistically be getting much time next season? I doubt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 23andme has become more advanced and now runs your DNA through health tests that will tell you if you're likely to get Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, if you have some sort of food allergy, etc. They sell the data ("without your personal identity attached") for further research. 

For those that test "likely" for having Alzheimer's or Parkinson's in the future, will they see their insurance rates preemptively increase? 

Based on the amount of tests they run and results they give, I find it hard to believe $199 covers everything. Why do I get the loyalty shopper store reward card vibe from this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It actually isn't. You brought up the subject of this being scientific and a mental illness. When you search scholarly articles for transgender being a mental illness, there are quite a few that loop in being gay and bisexual as mental illnesses as well. They're pretty closely aligned in an argument like this when you start researching. 

Funny that actually searching for additional sources somehow leads to "being an instant loss in a debate"    </TEXT>

A person being transgender likely has no negative effect on your own personal life. If "normalizing" it is something that would allow them to enjoy their lives without being attacked simply for being whoever they want, I don't see the downside of it.  </TEXT>

I get what you're saying. But why should anyone's feelings dictate how a person lives their life? Chances are you'll never meet that person and they won't have any affect on your life, why the uproar?

I really wouldn't say that's too far off. The average personality of someone in r/politics is much different than your average user in r/t_d. While this obviously does not apply to all users at r/t_d, it isn't exactly a secret that some awful people use(d) that sub as a place to push their hated for different kinds of people (hence 3 if those 5 subreddits). Most of that sub is shitposting, so seeing 4chan isn't particularly surprising either.  </TEXT>
