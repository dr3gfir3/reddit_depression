How do you like programming on an ultrawide compared to multiple monitors? Does it play nice with window placement shortcuts? (Not sure what's used with KDE, I use GNOME + Put windows) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I edited my comment with what I'm pretty sure the actual reason is. Calling an index of an empty list throws an error, breaking the function. So that's why it's using an `and` rather than an `or`.

Your English is perfectly understandable, no need to apologize! Regarding spaces, you'll wanna place it on a new line for it to format properly (if you use RES you can view my formatting directly by using the 'source' option).  
ex:

    def merge(A,B):
        if A !=[] and B !=[]:

	<TEXT> As far as I can tell, you use `and` because merging an empty list with a populated one would effectively do nothing, so you make sure that neither list is empty first so the function has an actual effect.

E: Calling any index of an empty list throws an error, that's likely the reason.

Also, you can place 4 spaces before code for better formatting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The code you wrote would only print the string `1`, you should call the number as a string and use the same number as a multiplier for the print statement.  
Try something like this:

Just to clarify, you want an entirely new file with this format:



last_name | first_name | average
---|---|----
Noether | Emmy | 95
Dick | Philip | 85
Curie | Marie | 90

From a file formatted like this:  


last_name | first_name | midterm | final
---|---|----|----
Noether | Emmy | 90 | 100
Dick | Philip | 70 | 100
Curie | Marie | 85 | 95

Right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh what he's referring to is a [very real and interesting phenomenon,](https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=132798) I'm just questioning the method of how he's saying it works (just like you are).  
As far as I remember from thermo, impurities in water lower freezing points because it disrupts ice lattices and keeps their formation from being entropically favorable (and raise boiling points by giving the liquids something to adhere to). I'm rusty though.

Also I think you meant supercooled there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not so sure that a nucleation crystal can induce crystallization if the impure sample's freezing point is below the temperature of the ice. It's not just a supercooled solution at that point, that wouldn't be effective.  
E.g. I don't think salt water freezes if you introduce pure water ice shavings.

I'd be pretty excited to be proven wrong though! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok!  
The data is from a cyclic voltammetry experiment. Basically varying the voltage (Y vals) and measuring the current (X vals) flowing through a solution. An example would be starting at 0 volts, sweeping up to 1 volt, then down to -1 volt, and returning to 0. That would be a "run," I isolate them since a molecule may break down and I'd see less of a response on subsequent runs, hence why I they're separated.

The software used to collect data outputs a .csv file, and while I could probably wrangle the data some other way, I'm writing this program for colleagues who also had to spend time working up the data to a usable format but are used to just using something simple like Excel. (Hence why I made the work flow video)

I'll make a top level comment linking sample data in the original format and update tomorrow with examples of how the data is presented. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to clarify in case it wasn't obvious, this will work from any directory, not just ones that are subdirectories of your current location, as long as you define the full path.

For example:  
You're in /home/john/Documents/stuff_to_format, but you have a script in /home/john/python/format_scripts that you want to run, typing the following line will still work

    python /home/john/python/format_scripts/name_of_file.py </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you mean how it looks in the text editor or the output?

For the former, depending on your environment when you it will automatically wrap to a new line. Emacs, Vim, and Sublime do this by default.

For the latter, I'd recommend adding a newline `\n` occasionally if your environment doesn't do text wrapping for the output. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Splitting a .csv File Into Segments Based on Y-Value </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm not sure if this belongs here, but I'm basically looking to automate [this process.](https://youtu.be/rU0EtnfCsc8?t=34s) I already got the header and third column deletion automated fairly easily, but now I'm stuck on how to go about partitioning out the rest of the data into segments as shown in the video.  
I'm thinking using something along the lines of [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4956984/how-do-you-split-a-csv-file-into-evenly-sized-chunks-in-python), but I don't know how to go about having it automatically find that initial Y value and use that for the number of lines to cut and paste.  
Perhaps [in the last for loop](https://github.com/subject7383/Princeton-Applied-Research-M250-270-electrochemistry-data-cleaner/blob/master/cleanCloner.py) something like this can split the data inline, but from there I still don't know how to line them up in separate columns.  
    
    if row[1] == starting_value:  
        outFile.write('\n')

Thanks for any help you can offer! </TEXT>

The two things used in the screenshot are screenfetch and conky; other than that you should look into things like OSMC/kodi for dedicated media streaming. I did that with a pi2 for a while, and other than not being able to decode my H.265 media it was pretty great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His poetry is alright, but I don't really like his novels.  
As you noticed and as someone else mentioned the prose is simple and it's easy to get through (that's not a bad thing in itself), but upon finishing it felt like I'd wasted my time, there's usually a few decent statements about drudgery but the characters feel like they don't develop, so reading the book itself feels like a sisyphusian effort. The backdrops shift but the characters don't, they keep doing the same things in different places; the book ends and all you can imagine is that he goes off and finds another shit job with another shit boss, and another woman to complain about, rinse and repeat until death.

What really left a bad taste in my mouth was that he comes off as kind of a self important asshole and it detracts from the message. It feels more like he's bragging at a bar rather than painting a story. Which, I suppose is his allure, but it's not my thing. </TEXT>
