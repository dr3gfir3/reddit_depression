	<TEXT> So would this be a step back to pre Obama times under Bush or worse?

While I'm of two minds between private health care under an administration that provides universal healthcare like here in Ireland, a system where someone might die simply because they don't have enough money is absolutely mad. Is he not screwing over the working class people that voted for him? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The more dangerous aspect of that is when you include preexisting conditions as an excuse not to provide cover, you can constantly add to the list of conditions. It's shocking really.

From the UESP. So yeah you're right. Basically if you are caught with the armor the Ordinators essentially place a lifetime bounty on your head. Pretty rough. But only if you talk to them it seems. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Indoril Armor: A concept more beautiful than its design. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-03 23:56:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since I first stepped foot in Vivec, I longed to own a set of Indoril Armor. It was magnificent, strong but not to heavy, and medium armor was always my favorite armor class. And it was beautiful, Christ I don't think I have ever admired a set of Game armor since.

But what struck me most was the fact that I couldn't have it.

You couldn't buy it because it was for guards only. But I found a set in the temple so all was well. But I was attacked each time I put it on. This beautiful armor I couldn't have.

So I made it my mission to get it. I was going to walk around the cantons wearing a full set of Indoril and no one was going to stop me. There just had to be a way of joining, a way to legitimise the ownership and use in front of Vivec Guards. But no. After spending weeks completing every Vivec related quest I still came up empty handed.

And that's when it struck me. 

The armor was designed to be forbidden. It was never intended to be allowed. Outside of cheating you can't wear a set of the armor legitimately within Vivec without incurring the wrath of the guards. Sure you could wear it outside but never within.

It was a moment of gaming genius. Concept design at its most brilliant. Here we have a set of armor, beautiful as it may be, that your character is not allowed to wear. No tricks. No quests. No "complete these missions and you shall be rewarded". Just no.

Because this was a part of the world you are in. These are the rules. To be immersed in a place where you must accept the laws. The armor wasn't designed to act as another tier on the scale, it was a holy set of armor and our character did not deserve it. There was nothing more immersive than that. 

The developers were clear on this one. This is our world. This is our story.
