	<TEXT> Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Heaven, God went missing for six days. Eventually, Archangel Michael found him on the seventh day resting. He enquired of God, 'Where have you been?' 
 
God pointed downwards through the clouds. Archangel Michael looked puzzled and said, 'What is it?' 
 
'It's a planet,' replied God, 'and I've put LIFE on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance.' 
 
'Balance?' inquired Michael, still confused. 
 
God explained, pointing down to different parts of the Earth. 'For example, North America will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while South America is going to be poor; the Middle East over there will be a hot spot, and Russia will be a cold spot. Over there I've placed a continent of white people and over there is a continent of black people.' 
 
God continued, pointing to the different countries. 
 
This one will be extremely hot and arid while this one will be very cold and covered in ice.' 
 
The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to another area of land and asked, 'What's that?' 
 
'Ah,' said God. That's the North of England, the most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful people, seven Premiership football teams in the North West alone, and many impressive cities; it is the home of the world's finest artists, musicians, writers, thinkers, explorers and politicians. The people from the North of England are going to be modest, intelligent and humorous and they're going to be found travelling the world. They'll be extremely sociable, hard-working and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world as speakers of truth.' 
 
Michael gasped in wonder and admiration but then proclaimed, 'What about balance God, you said there will be BALANCE!' 
 
God replied very wisely, 'Wait till you see the bunch of tossers I'm putting down South! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok first of all, before I get on to my point, can I just say how much I love and enjoy this subreddit. Its very rare that I miss a day without checking it out and going through people crazy theories etc and I love the whole community feel about it, which makes it a joy to be a part of. 

However, as much as I love this subreddit there is one aspect that annoys the bejesus out of me. 
The desire to make EVERY aspect of the book fit into a real life sense of meaning. 
What I mean when I say this is that, some fans have the habit of wanting to analyse every detail of the book and catch every little loophole or mistake that JK may have made in the book.
For example I have just come across as post that points out that Lupin wouldn't have made the mistake of missing his wolfsbane potion because of his character and that the fact that the event just 'happened' to occur on a full moon.

IT IS A STORY. Thought up for purely entertainment purposes, without little loopholes or some characters not acting as you know they would in later books or things happening in certain dates or certain things happening then there wouldn't be a story at all! There episode be no meaning behind the words and it wouldn't flow and it would be boring and I guarantee this fandom wouldn't exist (or be as large) because there would nothing to get excited about. 

I guess what I am trying to say is stop over analysing everything in the series. Yes the little details are great and it's super exciting when a new fan theory comes out or JK lets something else slip about the magical world that makes us fall in love with it that little bit more (if it's even possible). Like I said in the beginning that's what makes me love fandom and this subreddit but sometimes we have just got to let the MAGIC BE MAGIC. Because over analyising can sometimes take that MAGIC away and that kind of defeats the purpose of the books. </TEXT>

I ended up going out with one of my coworkers for about a year bit things started fizzing out when I went to university and had to concentrate on my studies more than him, we eventually ended on even terms and now he is ones of my closest friends. I don't think that would of happened if we hadn't been seeing eachother in work so it worked out great, as for you having to go on holiday with her then maybe it will be the start of your healing/friendship stage with eachother?  </TEXT>

Surely if Dudley knew he had thid ability he would either a) be increasingly curious and want to go to hogwarts, having a signature tantrum until he got his way or b) having grown up with the notion that magic is evil, he would think he was abnormal and that would have a great physiological effect on him  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a rather fun idea to play around with given his mother and fathers hatred of all things abnormal in the world. So imagine this scenario: 

It's the the morning of Dudley's 11th birthday, all 36 birthday presents are surrounding him. He feasts on his breakfast at the table, being doted on by his parents, when there perfect scene is interrupted by the ruffle of wings and hoot of a bird as it flies through the open window and drops a parchment envelope into the middle of the breakfast table, the hogwarts wax stamp glistening...

What happens next?
