	<TEXT> my username is "subject5882" because i have had a crush on gary oldman since seeing him in "rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead" in high school.

my period just started this morning. i've always got nice big slimy bloody snot looking clots on the day two, if you don't mind waiting for photo proof.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nope! she just doesn't use reddit. she is also objectively a lot more attractive than i am. there is probably correlation between those things. 

more than one woman exists in the world, my lil buddy . ;) some of us are even friends with each other! </TEXT>

so i actually have no interest in fucking her
