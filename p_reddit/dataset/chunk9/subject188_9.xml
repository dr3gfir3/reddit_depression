	<TEXT> I jump music a lot. I've been listening to Awolnation, The xx, The Naked and Famous, Miike Snow, Bob Dylan, and Neil Young a lot lately.

Any suggestions from your end? What do you like? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a big fan of alternative/indie music. Classic rock as well. Some electronic. Pretty much most music besides 99% of rap and country :) </TEXT>
