	<TEXT> A stun grenade can cause burns as well but certainly not to the extent of a WP grenade/flare which can be used to scuttle equipment. A chemical weapon is usually defined as a "toxic chemical" that can cause death, not an incendiary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on the receiving end of a mortar attack and it was pretty terrifying, that doesn't make them a chemical weapon. You guys are reaching too far with this "WP is a chemical weapon" stuff and it's honestly going to turn off people that are unfamiliar with this subreddit. It's almost a meaningless point to argue as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly just educational shows with the occasional show for entertainment. I'm not letting them sit around and watch TV all day and I don't let them watch shows where the characters are too stupid (sorry, SpongeBob). 

I don't know about intelligence but their behavior is better when they don't watch TV all day and avoiding certain shows. </TEXT>
