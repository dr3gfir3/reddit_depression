	<TEXT> Seconding pityriasis rosea. I had it and it was misdiagnosed twice as ringworm. Got a biopsy done and confirmed for pityriasis rosea. It can't be "cured" per se, you just have to wait a couple months for it to go away on its own. But of course, this is coming from some rando on the internet so I'd advise a trip to the dermatologist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically this, but a few edits. 

Shirley Turner and Andrew Bagby were never married. They had a very rocky relationship and he had recently broken up with her. 

Turner drove from Iowa to Pennsylvania to meet with Bagby, murdered him in a park, and drove all the way back to Iowa in one night.

When Turner learned she was being looked at by police, she fled to her home in Canada. The Canadian justice system was slow moving to extradite her. 

While extradition was pending, Turner gave birth to Zachary - a child she revealed to be Bagby's. Bagby's parents up and moved to Canada to try for custody of Zachary. 

Finally, the Canadian courts put Turner in jail and granted temporary custody to the parents of Andrew Bagby. However, this did not last long and Turner was released on bail. 

Turner and the Bagby's then shared custody of Zachary, meaning Andrew's parents had to raise his son with his killer.

On a day when Zachary was in Turner's care, Turner drove to her most recent ex's house and, attempting to frame the man, left photos of herself and Zachary and a used tampon. Afterwards, she drugged Zachary and herself with Ativan and jumped into the ocean.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It usually happens in smaller breeds when an anal sac is impacted. The fluids become stagnant which is a perfect breeding ground for bacteria. Bacteria leads to infection, which leads to abscess, which leads to rupture.

This can all be prevented by emptying the sacs regularly. You can have them expressed by a vet or do it at home, there's plenty of videos to teach you how. I have 3 dogs, but only my Yorkie needs routine cleaning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just playing devil's advocate for a moment...
You said you "can't feel sorry for him for doing that to not only the police, but those people." Even though he was a victim of the same thing on a much larger scale? Didn't his own government send him out and let him be traumatized to the point of PTSD? 

Sorry if that makes no sense, but having no sympathy for this man seems a little obscene to me. All in all, this looks like something that could have and should have been stopped a while ago. He was hurt, and now he's hurt other people to end his pain. It's a shame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm the type of person who would stop their car for a family of ducks, but I know better than to stop on the lefthand shoulder of a highway. This woman was just looking to do something humane but ended up with the drastic opposite. Hindsight is 20/20, and I bet this girl regrets her navety every day. Unfortunately, regret won't bring back two lives...

However, I think that life in prison is somewhat drastic. This woman had no intent to take any lives or harm anyone in any way. She should have to face some consequences, what they are I have no idea. All I know is that whatever justice it is will be slow. This is the same country that [let a woman take refuge to get away with murder, only then to go on to kill her son and herself,] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Zachary_Turner) after all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So many aspects of this video are rage inducing. Not only was she being disgustingly racist, but she was basically letting her young children play in a parking lot while she screamed swears and slurs in front of them in public. How is that in any way a good example? Those poor kids.

I was also pretty upset about the bystanders. At least two or three people walked by during this video, none of them said or did anything. I'm sitting at my computer itching to scream at this woman to shut the fuck up and take care of her kids. The bystanders are just enabling that kind of behavior. 

The comments on the video are pretty awful too. Just by scanning a few of them, I've seen a bunch of "if black people can say it, why can't white people?!" arguments. This woman wasn't using it in the context those commentors are referring to, she was using it as an attack and an insult. She was trying to belittle his existence as a human being, the arguments being held in the comments are unnecessary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, that wouldn't be racist. Racial stereotypes are the ones that are considered racist, considering that they're based on race. 

Like the "black people like watermelon" stereotype. I don't know the context, but to me watermelons aren't anything to be ashamed of enjoying, and yet black people get offended by that.  </TEXT>
