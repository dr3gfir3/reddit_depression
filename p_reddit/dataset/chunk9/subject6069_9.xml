	<TITLE> Hiking the Smokies - from Tennessee to North Carolina? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-26 00:05:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! I have a project in Nashville on June 8th, then another one in Fayetteville, NC on June 12th. So I'll have a few days between them, as you can see. My thought is to bus East near a good trailhead in the smokies, hike and camp for a night or two, and end up somewhere that I can catch a bus onwards to Asheville. If anyone has trail suggestions, advice on reaching good trailheads, particular peaks or campsites to visit or avoid - please let me know!
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1 - Yes, they're too dense. Nothing weird about that. Again, ice cream: taking a bite, enjoying it, then taking another bite is great. Cramming a giant wad of it into your face is extremely cold, painful, and unpleasant, and doing it too many times can make you feel sick. Or for horror films: well-paced scares? Great. Zombies jumping out of every available crevice each time the characters walk past one? Quickly predictable and boring, no longer tense. Have you seriously never heard the phrase "too much of a good thing"?

2 - Yes, I do understand what comedic timing is and cramming the jokes into tiny spaces *kills the timing*. The jokes don't flow because they are just spit off rapid fire at the same pace regardless of what the joke is. They don't have the right timing to make the joke work much of the time. Jokes that need to breathe or need slight pauses don't have them. Everything is just crammed into whatever tiny space it can fit in.

4 - It definitely used to have an improvised feel, especially early on. It was originally an improvised show when it was on the local network. The hosts chuckle at each other's jokes, they wait until the audience actually sees what they're talking about. and they don't all start singing songs at the exact same time. [They set it up so that they play off of each others' jokes.](https://youtu.be/Bhg2ofmCSaY?t=916) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll just explain it for you again:

 - Any pause in the show is packed with jokes, to the point where if you're laughing at one you miss others
 - They aren't timed properly (see: comedic timing) as a result of the editing and the need to cram more jokes in during each pause in dialogue 
 - The jokes are crammed in to spaces where, at times, they refer to things that haven't been shown on-screen yet
 - The show has lost its improvisational feel as a result of this, which, in my opinion, is to its detriment.

This is how "too many jokes" becomes an actual point of discussion instead of a throwaway phrase used by people who have decided to be dishonest and obnoxious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I completely stalled out on One Hundred Years of Solitude, so I picked up something light and quick to get over the hump. It's **Pines by Blake Crouch**. To be honest - it's not very good. It has the issue I run into with some Stephen King books where every character talks in the same voice - everyone's witty and clever in the exact same way. This was an issue with the other book of his that I read, Dark Matter. Another issue in both books is that they read more like screenplays than novels. The type is huge, the sentences are

much of the time

spaced out

like this

seemingly just to fill up the page. This makes it feel like a very low-effort affair.

The story also isn't as engaging as I'd hoped so far. It reads a lot like the Twin Peaks fan-fiction that it is. The writer is really, really trying to make his narrator and characters "quirky". One particularly egregious scene is in a diner where the narrator begs the bartender to serve him a steak even though he doesn't have money. Finally she relents and brings it to him. He then says something like "you know what I do when I order a steak rare and it comes out well done? I send it back". This is intended to evoke the coffee + pie lines from Twin Peaks, but it's a piss-poor attempt that makes no sense since he just begged for the steak for free and has no room to be picky about it. It feels shoehorned in.

To be honest, had I realized this was the same author as Dark Matter before picking up the book, I most likely would have passed on it.

I plan to finish it anyways, this coming week. I was busy with a work project so I didn't have time for much reading last week - thankfully I was a book ahead so I'm still on track! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I understand it's a bit of an overstatement that there's an "open ban" on atheists holding office. There may be a law on the books but is it enforced? From what they said about Texas on The Atheist Experience, it's technically a law but only in the way that those quirky old laws are still laws, where you can't use the sidewalks on Sundays in Pittsburgh or use an adze before dawn in Idaho. Basically it's in the legal code but has no teeth because it's been overridden by regulations and rules created further down the line. But they don't "erase" laws, they just become unenforceable. </TEXT>

 There's a pretty important distinction to make here between what has typically been meant by "paid protester" and what the article actually describes.

Were they *technically* paid? I guess, if you consider getting reimbursed for your entry fee as being paid. But again, that's not what is insinuated by "paid protestor". The people the article refers to walked away no richer than when they arrived. They just got to go to a free event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That rings to me as basically being the same thing as paying their entry fee, because this is also in the source:

 The email noted that to attend the event required joining the coffee club and paying $25. "If someone does have to pay, the Party is willing to reimburse the expense," the email stated.

So essentially, since you have to be a member to attend, they are paying the attendance fee. When I heard "paid protestor", "reimbursed attendance fee which also happens to give you membership to a coffee club" is not what comes to mind. I would agree with the OP that it's semantics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which does not account for the fact that SCOTUS only hears cases that are contentious in the first place. They turn down the vast majority of cases that come before them because there isn't enough doubt in the lower court's decision to make it worthwhile to hear those cases. So this 80% figure is misleading. It's similar for other district courts because the cases that SCOTUS hears have enough doubt to make it worth hearing, so you'd expect the high overturn rate that accompanies all circuit court decisions that go to SCOTUS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, it's pretty clear that this was always intended to be a starting point to expand from. At first it's a temporary ban that focuses on certain countries. Then it becomes a wider, indefinite ban over time as people adjust. Same deal as the Patriot Act. These policies are designed to expand, not expire. That's why it's good that this hasn't taken hold yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I know it was always pre-written, but previously the lines were delivered in a way that most often made it feel like it was natural flow, and they tended to be based off of what the audience had actually seen onscreen already. That's what I mean when I say "constantly reminded" - in the older episodes you can forget that it was pre-written much of the time, whereas in this season you really just feel that they're reading off of a script. In season 11 they will start referring to things that haven't happened yet, which you only see a few seconds later. There was also *some* improv in the older episodes, just not a ton. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really want to love the new season - but I find it to be unwatchable. Not because the character voices are new, not because of any casting choices, and not because the riffs aren't funny (there are PLENTY of really good ones) - those are spot on in my opinion. 

It's the pace and the timing. It's overwhelming. Not a spare second of silence goes by without commentary. It's just too much - 3 to 4 jokes per 10 seconds of time is too many to process. If you laugh, you miss the next comment. If one of them is clever enough that you need to think about it for a second, you get derailed because the next joke is already halfway done. Many of the riffs rely on things that haven't appeared on-screen yet, so it kills the vibe of "three guys riffing" and reminds you constantly that the jokes are pre-written. Since they're trying to cram 5 jokes in, they don't give any of the jokes proper timing and they just rush through them. 

This is not how the show used to be. It's frankly exhausting to watch the new season. I watched the first 2 episodes and I read here that it cools off later in the season - people pointed to episode 10 as a good example. I'm 20 minutes in and nothing about it is different. Way too fast-paced, way too many jokes instead of just keeping 1/3 of the premium-quality ones, and the timing is still completely off in many cases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **How to Stop Worrying and Start Living, by Dale Carnegie**

This is one of the most stressful periods of my life and I am hoping this book can help. It has already given me a few interesting ideas - for example, living in "day-tight compartments" where the past is sealed off and the future is curtained - the idea is to live within this day and not focus on the past or dread the future, which is something I find myself doing ALL THE TIME. It's pretty much common sense + illustrative examples, but the common sense is packaged in ways that help you to visualize and implement it rather than just looking at is as a cliche.

Also chipping away at **One Hundred Years of Solitude, by Gabriel Garcia Marquez**. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, the timing is really off on some of them. Lots of them. Going back and watching the older episodes, most of the time it feels like comments they *could* have thought up on the fly due to the timing (though I know most of it was written) - it felt more natural. For the first few episodes (all I've seen so far) much of the time the joke starts RIGHT AWAY when a scene cuts or it sometimes starts even *before* the scene, so it just reminds you over and over that writers came up with the jokes ahead of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My only issue is that the riffing is dense and fast for all the episodes I've seen so far (3). Just for comparison's sake I went back and watched The Crawling Eye - there are times where 30-45 seconds go by without commentary and it makes for a much better experience. It's actually kind of exhausting watching these new episodes because so much is constantly being thrown out - I can't relax with them like I do with the originals. I've heard it gets less frenetic as the season goes on though, so that's good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is definitely the furthest I've made it. I think what doesn't click for me is the writing style. It was most likely an intentional choice by the author, but no event stands out from any other event - it is basically a big list of happenings, one after another after another, so that they all blend into each other. I like the magical realism and there are some beautiful passages for sure - I just find the experience of reading it to be a bit of a slog since it's just basically a bunch of things happening without a real feeling that any event is particularly significant. Again, could have been an intentional choice by the author, but still tough to get invested in (for me anyways). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This week I read the first big letdown of my year so far. It was **In the Dust of This Planet** by Eugene Thacker. It seemed like the perfect convergence of interesting things - there was a radiolab episode about it, it was apparently one of the influences on Rust's character in the True Detective, and I am a major fan or horror films and writing, so I expected to love it. I did, for the first 10 pages or so. Once the prologue ends, it quickly got extremely heady and tedious. It was dense, and I often had to slow down to parse what was being said, but the thing is, each time I did, the information I was rewarded with was not really worth the effort. I kept thinking to myself "OK, maybe you're right... but so what?" It felt like an ultimately empty exercise. I wanted it to delve into specific, concrete, meaningful ways that horror intersects with philosophy, but instead, it was a philosophy book that only occasionally directly interacted with horror. I think my expectations did me a major disservice with this one.

This week, I *think* I'll be struggling to finish **One Hundred Years of Solitude**. This is my third attempt - it has just never clicked for me. But I'm more than halfway done so I'm going to push myself to get it done this time.

e: I'm also very much planning to read more of Octavia Butler's stuff after reading her short story *Bloodchild*. It was so disgustingly perfect. Short sci-fi doesn't always work for me because a lot of times there just isn't enough time to establish the world and its rules before the story ends, but this one balanced it perfectly, giving just enough info along the way. I am still cringing thinking about some of the scenes though - it's truly putrid. The alien life in this book is very vivid and much more interesting than your typical alien is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I have tried three times to read this book, and I have never been able to finish it. I agree - it's something about the way it's written. Basically, nothing seems to be any more important than anything else, so nothing is memorable or particularly interesting. The book is basically a giant list of things that happened with no real flair or dramatic tension to build up to events. It's just "this happened. then this happened. this this happened." All three times I have tried I have thought I might finally see the magic that people get from the book, but it has never happened. I thought maybe I just had a bad translation, but there's only one and it was approved by the author, so it must represent the way he wanted the book to flow. It just does nothing for me though.  </TEXT>
