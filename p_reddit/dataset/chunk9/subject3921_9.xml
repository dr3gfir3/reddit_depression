The fourteen men in the gear-filled tent stared at us. Cristina had caught them in a bind; as members of a grey-class mission, they wore clothing and had adopted mannerisms to look every bit typical members of the Vanguard, and they were duty-bound to maintain those roles just as much as they were duty-bound to obey the orders of a superior officer. To demand credentials or question her would expose them as not truly Vanguard if she was an impostor trying to fool them. Furthermore, if she offered proof of her status, it would expose *her* as not truly an Amber soldier on a grey-class mission, for she was required to hide her identity as well. It was a simple logical trap, but genius in execution. She perfectly held the manner of an impatient officer to the point that even I had to wonder if she had once been a military commander.

But her trap was not sufficient to gain full authority. One of the menlikely the local leadernodded her over to a computer pad lying on a crate, and the other thirteen started going about their business again. Their Centurion had opted for a tentative escape from the logical loop; he'd given Cristina what she'd asked for, but no more than that. If she insisted on orders of graver importance, he would have the impetus to challenge her further.

For the time being, she gave a slight bow and then proceeded to transfer the information from their computer pad to hers. I stared at her back as she did this. As we had been on a grey-class mission ourselves, it'd been quite some time since I'd bowed in the manner of my culture. How had she known to do that? It was a subtle affectation, but one that supported her unspoken claim without violating the need for anonymity, for it was part of both Empire and Amber culture in different ways. I also realized that the small acquiescence that the Centurion had given her would grow, and that she was aware of this. Thirteen others had seen her give an order and have it followed; thirteen others would later assume she was in her rights if she gave commands elsewhere. As much as I hated to admit it, we Amber soldiers were prone to following authority.

Standing there and watching her effortless chameleonic integration into the chain of command, I began to feel again that which had crept upon me in our early experiences with Conrad. I knew little, and what I'd been told by these personages of importance was never the full story. Only knowing enough to do my job had been good enough back home, but out here, nowI approached her while the other men began stuffing ammunition into their pockets and heading out. "Why didn't you call off the attack like you said you would?"

Watching the data transfer, she responded without looking at me. "You think I could just walk in here and turn back the tide on force of personality alone?"

"But you said"

"It'll take time, Venita." The pads beeped, and she stuffed hers back inside her jacket. "We may have gotten here too late. And besides, that was before I saw this world." She glanced at the nidorous yellow sky outside and then at me. "It's been my experience that a place tends to reflect the beasts that dwell in it."

I couldn't accept that. "But the factories and facilities she builtthey were made for thousands of people like us. Not just for her."

"She may have been a good person at one time," Cristina murmured, her gaze elsewhere. "But time does strange things to immortal minds."

A hot wind came again, and I gripped the helmet under my arm against the rumble of distant nuclear detonations. From what we'd gathered of the strategy from the factory's files and network data, the bombs were intended to clear as many clouds of spheres as possible. Other tactics would be needed to break the massive Shield around the mountainous citadel.

With that searing breeze came a reversing stream of soldiers; the fourteen and all of my team and Caecilia's entered the tent ahead of Conrad, who had somehow followed us. "Ah, I see you've found them," he said, patting my shoulder condescendingly before giving an address. "You all recognize me, of course, and I want you to know I've returned in your time of need to help you against what my wife of a thousand years has become."

I grimaced, but the fourteen men who had only tentatively accepted Cristina now stared wide-eyed at this face out of our legends. They, too, had known Conrad's appearance immediately, and his dozens of followers outside were enough credence to prove his identity even more than his relation to our enemy of the moment.

"How many of us are there?" Conrad asked.

"About a hundred thousand," the Centurion replied after a moment's internal deliberation. "Deployed strategically among the Vanguard's million or coming up from the rear as they can."

"Very good." He approached a small metal table in the center of the tent. "Is this the map of the area? Show me the current strategy."

We were chagrined that Conrad had come in and stolen further power, but we still looked over shoulders as they reviewed the plan for the offensive. Apparently, communication was difficult with the Plant God's bio-titans and completely impossible with the inverted amethyst pyramids, but all the factions did seem to know that survival and returning home required destroying the Enemy that had been drawing us all inexorably closer. Now there was nowhere left to go and we were to be ground up by attrition unless we smashed our way in and destroyed the Heart at the center of the citadel. The current plan was to focus all efforts on a single part of the Shield and thereby hopefully penetrate it.

If a breach could be opened, as many riders as possible would speed inside, leaving the slower tanks and artillery behind. From the schematics our world had traded for, the inside of the citadel had far fewer defenses, and the riders would have a six-hour journey down to the crucial nerve centers of the place. That meant that once they were in we would have to hold out for that duration and switch the attack into an entrenched defense intended to keep the Enemy's airborne and ground-based forces from getting inside its own fortress.

"And you think this will work?" Conrad asked.

The Centurion who had explained all this glanced around at us with heavy concern. "It will succeed. That's not the issue." He fought back visible bitterness and added, "The cost will be very high. We are outgunned and outnumbered by an absurd ratio. The plan is solid, but those riders we send inside will be the likeliest to survive. Those of us on the surface will be completely surrounded for an interminable length of time. The spheres alone nearly destroyed our world in ninety minutes, and we'll have to hold out here for more than six hours." He snapped tall and gave a sudden salute. "But we accepted this mission knowing what it meant, sir. Every minute we buy with our lives is another minute the riders will have to deliver the nukes where they need to go."

The other thirteen men saluted as well, and I looked to Caecilia as I thought of her similar assessment during the Siege of New Rome. Her expression was confident for those around her, but I could tell she'd just realized we would probably not be returning home. I wondered if I would ever see my grandfather again. To hear one of his silly stories one last time would have been wonderful. He'd taught me the song all military caste members sang when they went into battle expecting to die for a worthy cause, but I'd never expected to one day have cause to sing it myself in earnest. Would we

"No," Conrad laughed. "There's no sport in slaughter. I've brought the big guns, both literally and figuratively, to help boost your chances. My man Trajan here is carrying all the parts for a weapon of disastrous power"

I exchanged glances with Flavia beside me. How had Conrad found out about that?

"and we have been graced with the presence of this era's one-in-a-trillion, our thousand-year-anomaly. Perhaps equal in power to the Machine Empress, she will not be able to do it single-handedly, but she will certainly be our greatest hope."

My look to Flavia became an awkward turn back to the gathered circle as I realized Conrad was talking aboutand pointing at*me*. The fourteen looked on in wonder; Caecilia and her team looked at me in confusion; Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia straightened with alarm; Septus seemed confused and hurt; Noah smiled in support; Cristina gave me a concerned nod of warning. This was another move on Conrad's part, and I had to understand his intent as quickly as I could if I was to outplay him.

The local Centurion motioned to his men, and they opened a nearby crate. "The attack is already on," he said to me with awe, his words punctuated by the last echoes of the nuclear assault. "But we do have treasures as yet undeployed. You must accept our gifts."

I felt like Valerius in the tent of the Barbarian Warlord from the old myth as shining armor and weapons were produced by those putting their faith in me to win the day. I'd never been good with presents, and this was the most awkward I'd ever felt in my entire life. I was more than happy to fight and die alongside these men for the sake of our world, but why did they all have to look at me and give me things? Burning bright red, I accepted the gear and mumbled thanks.

The first was a set of jade chest armor like that I had seen on the supposedly dead woman on the other side of the base that morning. Noah came forward with a grin. "I wonder how this got here. It generates a protective field that'll keep more than just what it covers safe."

"You've seen it before?"

"Worn it, even," he laughed, lifting one of the weapons they had given us. It was a sapphire rifle of the kind the engineering caste had restructured to create our deadly turret weapon. Noah regarded it for a moment and then threw it to Sampson. "Careful where you aim that thing."

Sampson hefted it with rare glee. "If it's anything like the turret, I'll hardly need to aim it at all."

Cristina watched us gather up these special weapons, but said nothing. There was only one jade chest piece, and Conrad bade me put the glittering armor on outside my jacket. "They're going to need to see you, Venita. You need to stand out."

That was the last thing I wanted to do, but I had some idea what he was going for. If this was to be anything other than a doomed battle, building a focal point of hope would be important. I just desperately wished that I didn't have to be that point.

Catching my attention for a moment, Caecilia asked quietly, "What's all this about? Why does Conrad think you're equal in power to the Enemy?"

At that, I did feel a pang. "There's no time to explain, but I haven't lied to you. Something's happening to me, and I'm only beginning to understand it myself. I don't actually think I'm up to the task Conrad is forcing on me, but"

"You *are* up to it," Caecilia interrupted with fire. "To me, you'll always be the girl that stabbed someone with her own broken arm to win the day for her team." She indicated our two squads. "This is the heart of our world, its vital force, our best and brightest. We're all here to back you up, come what may, and if it's still not enough in the end, it's been an honor serving with you."

I swallowed down a sudden rush of emotion. Did she know that she was like a big sister to me? "And you," I told her, returning the greatest compliment one of my caste could give.

While the others continued examining the gear options, Trajan slunk by and muttered, "You just had to overshadow me and my turret, eh?"

"Keep it in your pants," I told him, initially returning his grin before it began to dawn on me that they were each saying goodbye in their own way. Paulinus gave me a nod of support, and Larentia promised to fight to the end, but I could tell that these were aspirations to fight bravely and earn our last namesnot aspirations to succeed and win the impossible battle ahead.

Stunned rather than energized, I took refuge among my teammates as they finished loading up. We were armed to the teeth now, each carrying as many guns and as much ammunition as possible, but it seemed paltry in the face of the millions of spheres and biomechanical animals likely descending on Northern Point base at that moment. Now that the nuclear attack had ended, the fight would begin for real. Unlike Caecilia's Dangerous Four, I did not want to say my goodbyes. Celcus, Flavia, Sampson, Septusmy family would stick close to me, and I would keep them alive no matter what it took.

As for Noah and Cristina, I had learned something about history from both of them, and I had an understanding that they would both be fine, for this was not their story. As we headed out, they became part of the less-mobile but heavily-armed thousand we had brought with us; those who were now almost completely led by Conrad and his important lieutenants or who were part of Cristina's secret counter-movement. The fourteen local grey-class men were ordered to accompany us, an order which they were happy to follow because of my presence.

The mottled yellow sky impressed itself upon my awareness as we twenty-three Amber soldiers stepped out into the unhealthy environment of that industrial world with sharpened purpose. We had thought to fight a battle and go home, but that no longer seemed likely. The order of the day now was making a legend together; making a story worth telling for a thousand years. *Someone* would know what we did here today, even if it was just the Machine Empress herself or her faithful artificially intelligent defense system.

Above dirty metal ridges covered with strange growing biomechanical tangles, the horizons were blackened with approaching clouds of darkness. I'd seen them enough time to recognize the swarms of spheres, but I'd never seen the floating mountains among them that seemed to act like carrier ships.

"These ones will be smarter," Flavia shouted as we ran through the hectic base toward our bikes. "Remember how the spheres get individually less effective in numbers? It's very likely those mountains are massive processing centers to help counteract that effect."

Celcus regarded the men on the steel walls firing at approaching legions of cybernetic animals on the ground. "How do we fight both air and land at the same time?"

Reaching our bikes, we donned our helmets and climbed on. Caecilia ordered over the radio, "We'll stay mobile, outrun the ground forces, and focus on the incoming air assault. Look for a good place and opportunity to set up the turret. It's about time that thing did some good for once."

As strange as it was, I wasn't nervous about the battle. At some point, danger and warfare had become my way of life, and riding out of that base on alien ground among tanks, bike squads, and helicopter air support made me feel right at home. This was struggle; this was mortality. I would get at least one new scar today to go with the dozen others, and I was alright with that. No, what made my heart pound in my chest this time were the eyes and expectations upon me. Why had Conrad put the spotlight on me like that?

The first danger was a surprise tactic from the Enemy. Just as we left the gates, a rain of canisters arced down and hit the ground around us, releasing sickly brown fog. My jade armor did not help against this, and I began coughing along with everyone elseuntil a plant titan stomped by overhead and sprayed us with gaseous antitoxins it had bio-engineered in mere moments. I gazed up at the leafy chest of the enormous beast as it continued on past us. I knew little of the Plant God save that it was an old enemy of the Empire, but what beautiful wonders it turned out our enemies had! Inverted amethyst pyramids clustered in the sky above, equally awe-inspiring while awaiting the proper moment to strike. Below themand to either side of uslegions of Yngtak survivors kept the spheres away from the amethysts with directed surface-to-air energy lance fire. Around *them*, tanks and artillery fire held the lines on the ground.

For all its supposed lack of command structure, this offensive was beautiful in its execution. If the Vanguard had been lifelong soldiers like us, they would have realized that somebody *was* in charge. To us, the organizational elegance was obvious.

It was also obvious that we were severely outmatched in every possible way, and that our attack was therefore temporarybut the moment did come, and waves of amethyst pyramids smashed themselves into the Shield. We watched in horror as we realized their method of attack required self-sacrifice; spherical bursts of purple energy dissolved each amethyst and the space around it, disintegrating whatever overlapping barrier it was that the Shield was constantly refabricating. A hundred or more amethysts soared in for suicide runs until one got through a re-knitting portion of the wall of laced energies. That one was enough, for it disintegrated itself against an already strained local generator on the mountainous citadel's exterior. A hole opened in the Shield, and those that had been selected for the internal mission rode inside at top speed.

That part had been simple. With relief, we covered their rear and began turning away, but the Shield refabricated itself rapidly and separated part of our group. Riding alongside the shimmering barrier, we shouted over the radio to Sampson, Larentia, and three of the fourteen men from the tent who had all been caught inside the wallbut there was nothing for it. Caecilia ordered them to proceed using a hand signal, and, with heavy hearts, they turned and rode after the squads infiltrating the underground areas of the fortress.

I watched them go as long as I dared. Sampson! Separated from me, he was at risk. But hadn't they said that those entering the base had the highest likelihood of survival? I steeled myself against the wrenching in my heart. It was time to turn and fight. Just like they had back on the lifeless factory world, the spheres would swarm down those tunnels after our comradesif we didn't stop them here.

The Enemy behaved as we'd predicted. With our forces so close, it didn't dare let down the Shield, which meant its own forces could not get inside as long as we lived. Better than that, with our backs to the wall we had only one direction to defend. The Enemy's Shield was the only thing on this world allowing us to prevent being completely surrounded.

Strangely enough, we had nearly three minutes of silence and calm as our riders, tanks, helicopters, plant titans, Yngtak energy lancers, and amethysts slowed the charge, stopped, and turned to face the massing forces on the horizon. I had a chance to plant my boots on the corrugated metal ground and consider how far we'd come; never before had we *stopped* or *been stopped.* We'd always relentlessly pushed forward, always kept moving, and always found a way to survive, but this was different. For the first time, we were cornered, and our survival depended entirely on men and women we'd never met.

"Set it up," Caecilia ordered, and Trajan and Paulinus climbed off their bikes to assemble the sapphire turret on a small hexagonal-chrome hill at the center of our massed defenses. They slammed the base components into the ground and built it as sturdily as possible. Even through my helmet, I could hear that now-familiar whine as Trajan prepped the triggers and the device began drawing energy from the surrounding space. A plant titan moved away from in front of it as frost touched its verdant feet; a tank rolled out of the way as ice began raining down from the air itself. The whine reached a peak, and the turret was ready.

"Mark for six hours," Caecilia radioed, her tone confident, but her voice trembling ever so slightly. I couldn't blame her: that duration sounded absurd in the face of what all of us were staring at. The hills swarmed with loping cybernetic animals of all kinds, while the skies were more black than yellow now. This entire planet had turned against us.

Flavia asked, "How many flying mountains do you count? I see ten."

"Eleven," Celcus replied. "No, twelve."

"Oh, only twelve?" Trajan commented, swinging his turret left and right experimentally in preparation. "I was expecting a real fight."

"That's a good point," Caecilia said, responding to the unsaid portion of Flavia's assessment. "If we can somehow take out those carrier ships, we might end the danger from the air." She glanced straight up. "If we clear the way for the amethysts, do you think they'll understand?"

We could only hope. All eyes were on Trajan as the swarms came within range; the gathered million men had all seen us set up the turret and freeze the surrounding terrain, and I could hear Conrad's voice on one of my radio channels aggrandizing us and pointing out *the girl in the jade armor.* This was about to be a valley of death, but he was promising them life.

As the plant titans began kicking and stomping cybernetic animals at the perimeter of our forces, Trajan asked, "Now?"

"No," Caecilia told him. "Let the mountains get closer."
 
As Yngtak energy lances began sending up flak at the first black swarms, Trajan asked, "...now?"

"No," Caecilia told him. "A little closer."

As the tanks began firing into their hastily chosen killing zones and as we began readying our own rifles for the approaching spheres, Trajan asked, "Seriously?"

My Centurion shouted, "Now!"

It wasn't silence that fell, not exactly. It was more that the air itself temporarily became thin to the point of attenuating all sound. I'd been thrown about by the power of that weapon before, so I'd known to expect it, but I still caught the rusted ground with my boots and held my breath against my lungs being emptied by the sudden reversal of pressure. The plan had been to clear the way for the amethysts, but, as Trajan loosed the power of the weapon on the leftmost target, the sky became cyan and pure effulgent white exploded like a dozen suns out the back of the floating mountain. Its core blew away like crackling ash, its bulk began to fall, and we stared in horror and awe. The shockwave hit us four heartbeats later, and currents of dust threatened to choke all witnesses.

Shivering from the cold, Trajan radioed over the growing whine of another charge, "This weapon is *awesome!*"

My throat burned with a shout of encouragement to match the thousands of others around us, and he took our cue to turn and fire again. This time I saw the tracer lines left behind by the railgun-fired dodecahedrons, and this time I looked away as a second, third, and fourth Sun appeared in the sky. This target was closer, and the blast waves were deafening. All sight was obscured by hurricane winds filled with rust particulates, and the impact of the falling mountain's mass nearly knocked me from my bike.

"Again!" Caecilia shouted.

But Trajan responded, "I'mI'mfrozento the handles"

To my left in the waves of dust, she motioned us forward, and we briefly ditched our bikes to run to his aid. The hill was slick with ice, but less so in the safer zone directly behind the turret, and a dozen of us clambered up to smash the ice around Trajan's gloved hands and warm him as best we could. The isolated blizzard around the weapon grew fiercer with the rising whine of its third charge, and, as frost grew along my visor, I was forced to admit, "I don't know how many times we can fire this thing right now."

"It doesn't matter," Caecilia responded. "They're retreating. Get back here and regroup."

We carried Trajan among us until we reached the others, and only then did we get his gloves off and assess the damage. The skin of his fingers and forearm had been flash-frozen, but his hands appeared to function otherwise. He insisted he was alright, but it was clear he could not personally fire the turret again without severe risk.

Flavia spent those minutes watching the horizon. "What are they doing?"

The Enemy's ground and air forces both had retreated to a certain distance and now remained there unmoving. It was eerie to see whole mountains simply hanging in place like that; while on the move, at least they'd had the appearance of flying somehow. Now it was clear that they were agravitational like the spheres, and their unnatural looming forms chilled me more than the blizzard we'd brought upon ourselves.

"I don't think we can consider this battle over," Caecilia said aloud. "But we did buy some time. The Enemy might be devising a new tactic or bringing new threats from elsewhere. We have to be ready." She regarded the nearby snowstorm. "Move that turret as soon as possible. Camouflage or hide it somehow. I don't want the Enemy to have a bead on our primary defense when it makes a move."

The hostile bulk surrounding us had moved back, but testing began in its place. Groups large enough to pose a serious threat but too small to warrant firing our primary weapon moved in at various angles, and the Enemy soon figured out that we could not effectively use the turret against ground forces or anything that was too close. Waves of spheres moved in very low to the earth to support the cybernetic creatures slinking over the hills, and it was against these that our tight semicircle fired for over an hour. For a time, it seemed that we might actually survive the day if we could just remain focused, keep our formation tight, and control the flow of the fight, but the carrier mountains brought a new weapon into play once they began moving again.

Caecilia had been correct in having us move the turret, for the first long-range beam attack melted the small hill it had been previously placed upon. The red line of light appeared to be a slowly slicing pinpoint weapon, and anyone with binoculars was immediately ordered by Conrad to watch the distant mountain ships and call their aim. I couldn't see them, but those that could described the weapons as heavy mounted cannons that couldn't move on their own. The entire mountain had to rotate to aim the beams, and that meant we had a short time to avoid their intended destinationsbut there was only so long we could keep all of our forces moving and fighting at the same time. One by one, we began to lose our tanks and artillery, and, by the third hour, it was clear our strategy was a losing one.

When one of them got hit by a beam and burst into flames, the inverted amethyst pyramids seemed to respond to our desperation with some of their own. As a cloud of darkly glittering purple facets, they flew forward without warning. The Yngtaks did their best to shoot down spheres in the way, but a great many of the gemstone beings detonated too early, were shot down by beams, or were overwhelmed by drilling and cutting spheres. The thirty-odd that got through impacted and dealt critical disintegration damage to six carrier mountains as we watched with fists clenched, but that left four remainingand a battlefield littered with broken amethyst fragments.

They'd been our air deterrent, and, with their loss, our formation began to unravel. There was no more unnecessary chatter or hopeful camaraderie. One by one, hills were lost. Bit by bit, we were forced into a smaller and smaller region. All our heavy machinery had been destroyed, the amethysts had been lost, and we were down to two plant titans battering away legions of metallic creatures trying to swarm in and tear us apart. There were still nearly a million men on foot or bikes around us, but I could feel the pincer closing nevertheless. The careful collaboration of elements we'd relied on to survive half of the six hours was now breaking down, and the fight would soon directly rely on our gunsand I'd already experienced once before the meat grinder that would follow once the ammo ran out. Three hours had never sounded more like eternity.

Celcus, Flavia, Septus, and I were slinging our rifles forward and prepping ammunition for quick reloads when Conrad's voice echoed in my helmet. He asked calmly, "Don't you think it's about time you did something?"

When I realized he was talking on a private frequency just to me, I stopped readying my guns and looked around for his cadre. "What would you have me do?"

"I don't know," he said with audible excitement. "That's up to you. We're all waiting, and the longer you let this go on, the more people will die. Are you going to wait until everyone else is dead and the ones you love are about to be torn to pieces?"

Reflexively, I muttered, "Bastard."

He just laughed.

But was he right? Did I have the power to do something against the inevitable? To Flavia, I asked, "What would our best tactic right now be if we could do anything?"

Using her unbroken arm to lift her rifle and pop a shot off at a stray sphere that had gotten past the curtains of fire, she responded, "If a small team could ride out unnoticed and reassemble the sapphire turret somewhere closer to those carrier ships, we could take them out with a surprise attack."

"We only managed to fire it twice before it froze Trajan to the controls," Celcus countered, backing up near me as he retreated to get a better firing angle at an incoming cybernetic worm-thing twice as tall as a man. "There are four ships left!"

"Then whoever fires it dies in the process," Flavia said calmly. "That's just how it is."

Septus' voice joined our conversation. "I'll do it."

Caecilia interjected: "No. There are four of you and four shots needed. Take turns. And go now. We won't last another hour like this. Every second counts." After a moment, she added, "We've got two airborne helicopters left. Forget riding, you'll never make it. Flag one of them down!"

It took a bit of channel-changing and radio attempts, but we got one of the helicopters to land so that we could climb on board with the turret components. I hadn't been on one since the chopper that'd taken us to confront Legate Blue, and that'd led to our disastrous dealing with the Regret Demon. I shivered at that bad omen as I helped Flavia climb on after Celcus and then hooked myself in next to Septus. There would be no using the seats on this flight, just the safety hooks, for we needed our full range of motion.

The pilot kept us low to the ground, just above the swarms of creatures but just below the greatest density of the spheres. At these we carefully took aim, and any who came too close exploded in our rifle sights. A red beam sliced the air nearbybut we were not the target. The Enemy had not caught on to our plan, and the helicopter was obscured from sight from the carrier mountains by their own clouds of airborne attackers. We flew out behind the bulk of the battle and set down upon a high position; the pilot pulled back and hid behind the ridge to avoid drawing attention.

Those moments setting up the pieces of the turret might have been the most surreal of my life. Under a bile-yellow sky on a jagged bio-metal ridge marked by a mercury waterfall, I helped construct a devastating weapon in the shadow of four floating mountains. As Cristina had once said, the artificial intelligence was a reactive entity, and it would never see this coming.

But it *had* noticed the absence of the turret from the main million. As we ratcheted the last pieces into place and the incredible gun started to whine, the mountains began moving away from us. Without our primary defense, they could get closer to our people trapped against the Shield, and those mounted beam weapons grew murderous at such a short distance. There was no time.

Grimacing as she used both hands, Flavia took the first shot.

This time, the devastation erupted *toward* our forces, and the first of four behemoths fell just outside their perimeter.

Septus shook with desperate anticipation as the turret began charging again. A widening radius of chill grew around us, and we clustered in the small safe zone behind it. Every second meant further fatalities among the million down below, andthe second shot wiped away the top of the second mountain, sending it crashing atop one of the last remaining plant titans.

Celcus remained calm and focused as he gripped the ice-covered weapon during its charge cycle. The mercury waterfall nearby froze solid; silence fell. The instant the whining reached its peak, he pressed both triggers, and the third mountain of four exploded completely and utterly.

"Good shot!" Septus exclaimed, raising his hand in a fist.

But the fourth mountainthe last carrier shipdeveloped a proper reactive defense.

Our hearts sank in our chests as a partial hemispherical Shield weaved itself together around the side of the mountain facing us.

"No," Flavia shouted. "*No!* The turret requires time to set upwe'll never get a shot past that Shield no matter where we move!"

The last mountain took up final position over the million men on the ground, and streams of spheres began pouring out to augment the beams firing straight down into the legions below.

Septus' voice was hollow. "What now?"

"There were just too many," Celcus breathed, just as stunned by our total lack of options.

Flavia looked to me, and I locked eyes with her through our visors. There was one option left, but personal feelings would not let her state it.

But I had to. Even through my gloves, the top section of the turret was freezing cold. Disengaging it, I removed the long sapphire gun barrels and took the only part that mattered: the core. "We use the helicopter to get to that mountain, we drop me off, and then you three escape."

"What?" Celcus asked. "What kind of plan is that?"

"It's what Otho said when he gave this to us. The core can be overloaded when you *really* need something destroyed." I pushed small buttons in the sequence our engineer advisor had indicated, and a low hum began vibrating the sapphire core.

"That's not how we do things!" Septus shouted. "You can't just leave us behind. We're going with you."

As the pilot came up to retrieve us, I shook my head. "To make sure the job is done, I have to get this as deep inside that mountain as possible. I'm the only one that can."

We climbed on board and began lifting away from the ridge. Celcus and Septus continued to argue, but Flavia said nothing until we were nearly to the mountain. At long last, she cut them off with a bitter assessment. "She's not wrong. Guns will be useless against the incredible resistance she'll encounter inside. Venita's only hope is to run as fast as she can, drop off the core, and then run even faster back out. She *is* the only one that can do this. We would just slow her down."

My family watched me in muted sorrow.

Was this what Conrad had meant by doing something?

The mountain wasn't defended from above, and the pilot mouthed *good luck* as he curved around to avoid spheres coming up from below. Using my multi-tool to loosely hold the loudly humming sapphire core, I gave the people I cared about most in the world one last lookand jumped.

	<TEXT> That's great feedback. Thanks a ton for taking the time to write it. I think you're right, too, this series had a very kinetic flow to it that I've slowed for a time as Venita starts to grow as a person. Unfortunately for her (but fortunately for us) time's up and the crap is about to hit the fan.

Thanks for getting your girlfriend into these stories, I hope you'll both enjoy next week! It's going to be very long. </TEXT>

The room the four of us had chosen for training held the shape of a long and flat storage tank. Very similar to the space the Yngtaks had been held in, it could have supported our full thousand men, but it was one of dozens of such unused spaces and nothing had been inside it when we'd found it. It gave me the distinct sensation that I was inside an empty airplane hangar. Closer than those distant walls, though, my gaze bored into the upright metal plate before me. I called forth memories of those I lovedand, wrapped in those energies, gave the smooth chrome a solid punch with my gloved hand.

While Celcus and Sampson stared, Flavia moved forward on her crutches to study the silvery fist-print. "It's hot," she declared, pulling her finger back quickly. "Probably from the stress on the metal itself." She turned her head and narrowed her eyes at my undamaged knuckles. "It's not just strength. You'd have to be more durable as well to not break your hand doing that."

It was rare that I felt this way. I was not immune to fear or anticipation, but, at that moment, I was actually *nervous.* What would they think of me? Asking them to accept that I romantically loved each of them had been harrowing enough, but now something even stranger was happening to me.

Sampson clenched a fist and tensed his bicep to emphasize his thought. "You do that by thinking of the qualities *we* possess?"

Honesty had not failed me in the caves. I decided that I needed to tell them everything now that I had told them anything. "Well, for that punch, mostly thoughts of you." Quickly seeing the confusion on their faces, I elaborated, "When I need to be smart and analytical, I think of you" I looked to Flavia. "and when I need the self-awareness to balance more than one of these traits at once, I think of *you.*" My tall man met my gaze with growing understanding.

Celcus sank into thought. "So you take on the strengths of those around you. Is it possible this is just a psychological effect? Maybe you can do these things because you believe you can."

Sampson gave a proud chuckle and raised a hand toward the damaged metal plate. "You think *that's* just a product of belief?"

"Human beings have been known to exceed their limits under extreme stress," Flavia mused. "And of course we were trained to call upon those more costly layers of endurance at will. That may have helped her reach this place, but, no, this is beyond adrenaline factors. If she'd broken her hand with that punch, I'd have considered it likely, but no amount of stress can make bones and skin hardier."

My gaze kept jumping to each of them as they spoke. My fate was in their hands in a very unique and personal way. What if they chose to hate or fear me? What if

"Has anyone felt a drain during the events in question?" Celcus asked, emerging from his deeper thoughts to look us in the eyes. "Venita's described a handful of miracles in which she drew upon our strengths, but I don't recall feeling weakened during those moments."

Flavia froze halfway to speaking before reconsidering her words. "I hadn't thought of that." Looking down to spend a moment recalling, she then continued: "I didn't feel weaker, either. Sampson?"

"No."

"Then that means she's not taking something from usshe's instinctively restructuring her own biology on the fly. But how? Where would that energy come from?" Taking a moment to study my face, she said in our formal dialectwhich we had not been able to use in quite some timea small modified phrase of wonder. The saying was normally *it is beyond belief, but my eyes prove it*; her statement was closer to, "You are amazing."

My cheeks burned as I became acutely aware of their eyes upon me. That heat was matched only by the furnace in my heart. Desperate to shift attention away, I said, "Energy? There's a sort of colored fire that burns in me."

Flavia took that in stride and moved closer on her crutches. "Where?"

I pointed to my heart.

"And what color?"

I wasn't sure why I found her line of questioning surprising, but I also realized that she couldn't see or feel it the way I could. "Blue."

She moved very close, as if in an attempt to see the fire through my very eyes. "What *kind* of blue?"

Cheeks warming again due to her nearness, I gulped away a catch in my throat and offered, "Lighter than cobalt, darker than cyan. Maybe azure to turquoise depending on intensity."

"No hints of purple or green?"

I shook my head.

She blinked, took that answer, and moved away while thinking.

Celcus asked, "Should we tell Septus? It doesn't feel right doing this without him."

"I haven't known him as long as you," Sampson countered, "But that likely makes me more objective. Anyone who listens to Conrad can't be fully trusted. This is too big. Too important."

My embarrassment at receiving personal attention faded in favor of my strategic senses. "I think Conrad already knowsor at least suspects."

"Yes," Flavia said from ten paces away while facing the empty distance of the white-lit hangar. "He noticed you almost immediately, and his focus has only increased. I think he knew something was different about you from the moment your hand let us into his medical facility." She turned around suddenly on her cast-clad leg. "This has to be why your hand gets access from these places! Perhaps your biology reacts to what the system is looking for, or maybe there's some other element in you that only" She froze.

Celcus and Sampson were thinking it, but I was the one who asked, "What?"

"It's you," she breathed, staring at me. "That thing Conrad said. The Sixth Millennial."

I didn't want to be different. I didn't want to be set apart from my family. "No."

"Yes." Flavia hobbled forward. "What would the Machine Empress design her systems to look for in her absence if not the one thing that nobody else could replicate? A spark of some sortor a flame."

The words struck me like a hammer, and I lost all sense of where I was as I removed my glove and stared down at my own hand. I could see and feel blue fire moving along the nerves of that limb, palm, and digits; I could clench that energy and gather it up to strike, defend, or transform. It was emotionthe energy of emotion released from the mental realm and set ablaze in the physical.

I still wore both my arm braces, but I doubted I needed the therapeutic one any longer. The multi-tool had become an extension of me, while the brace for my formerly broken arm had reached the end of its usefulness. There was someone else who needed it more. Carefully unclicking it and removing it, I handed the arm brace to Flavia. "For your broken arm. Let's get that cast off."

She seemed taken aback by the gift. "You don't need it?"

"I don't think so. Not anymore."

"Then forget the arm," she said with excitement. "I'll use this thing on my leg so I can finally walk without crutches again."

Celcus asked, "It can be resized like that?"

Already lifting her uniform's pant leg and cutting with her combat knife, Flavia used a term we had learned from the Vanguard: "Duh."

We helped her remove the cast completely, and nobody mentioned the rather odious release underneath. The automatic systems inside the brace adjusted quickly to encircle, clamp, and support in the right places, and she stood with a mixed sigh. "Ah. Hurts a little, but not with bone-pain. I think I'm just lucky it wasn't a worse break."

"I would have given it to you sooner if I'd have thought it could be used on your leg," I told her, genuinely apologetic. How could I have failed to think of that? Her injuries had been sustained saving my life!

"No. My leg needed time to heal, and we've still probably put it on a little early, but I'm willing to trade some pain for mobility that might keep me alive in the coming days." Celcus and Sampson both agreed with that, and the three of us watched as Flavia limped around the empty hangar with an exuberant smile. Raising her good arm, she aimed her pistol at the far wall a few times, testing her stance. "I am half a warrior again."

"Just half?" Celcus called over with humor.

"Half an Amber soldier is more than enough."

For the next half an hour, my newly mobile beloved ran me through my paces like I was a first-year cadet, and, in some sense, I wasonly this academy was my own changing mind and body. At first, I was just happy that the people I loved accepted whatever this was, but then I, too, began sharing their excitement.

Clicking her wrist-watch and comparing that number to our measurements of the hangar, she declared in Empire units in case Vanguard soldiers overhead us: "Twenty one point one kilometers per hour. Not bad, but clearly a normal speed for a fit female our age. You weren't the fastest of us, either." She readied her watch again. "This time, think of Porcia. Go!"

I set off around the lap we had demarcated with my thoughts focused on the fleetest of our family. She was gone, but her essence remained in my memories, and I could feel Septus' love for her keeping her with us as well. Celcus shouted; Sampson clapped once in surprise. I ignored their reactions in favor of reliving the adrenaline of the run I'd made against Conradand the lap was over before I could even really register beyond that.

Flavia lowered her wrist-watch. "Venita."

Panting, I asked, "What was the speed?"

She answered slowly, as if haunted. "You didn't run the whole lap."

"Of course I did." I gasped for air as I regarded the course. "I took each corner." I took cues from my beloved men. "Celcus and Sampson saw me run the whole thing."

Flavia accepted their nods, but still shook her head. "You did go fast. Nearly double. I'd guess thirty-five to thirty-seven kilometers per hour. Amazing speed matching some of the best Amber sprintersmale ones, in fact. But *you didn't run the whole lap.*"

Confused and increasingly unhappy, I could only tell her, "I don't understand what you mean."

She didn't seem to be able to blink. Her blue eyes remained on me; glinting moisture brimmed. "I don't understand either, but you've done it once before."

"Come on now," Celcus said, stepping between and breaking our line of sight. "I saw her take each corner. How could she have turned four times but not run the whole lap?"

She gripped her forehead and turned away. "I think maybe I'm just tired. I'm going to go rest in my room."

As I recovered my breath and watched her leave, I realized that I had seen through her eyes before and thus had some idea what was bothering her. She saw the world in a flurry of connections; a spider web of logistical axes bound by colored sums of a thousand hues and countless possible moments refracted like light through a prism made of time. She had never told anyone this, though I'd somehow drawn that aspect of her to me and seen through eyes tinted with her perspective when I'd raced Conradbut I myself had been the one thing I had not been able to observe. What had she seen in me with her unique vision that had disturbed her so?

"Yeah, time for a break," Sampson said, heading off as well.

Only Celcus and I were left, and he asked as casually as he could, "You and Sampson have fun last night?"

Snapped out of one frame and into another, I immediately replied, "Yes," before thinking better of it. "Well, we went for a walk. Does that... bother you?"

He tried to smile, but his answer was serious. "Not yet. I just hope you realize you're going to have to make some decisions soon. Let us know what you feel so that we don't have the wrong expectations."

What *did* I feel? I'd just taken off my arm brace, and that gave me the words. "To deny any of you would be like cutting off one of my limbs. I can't do it."

His awkward shrugging and the masked pain on his face nearly broke my heart. He asked, "Do you still feel the same about me?"

I did. "I do." I did my best to convey everything I felt for him through an upwardly aimed kiss; my tall man had needed that, and he left with a lighter and reassured step. He was not wrong. I knew that I would have to do something soon. I'd been hoping the coming battle would delay personal decisions, but it was our instructors had told us: life doesn't stop for war.

On my own journey through the halls, I remained quiet and brooding, but I could certainly feel the wordless attention of passersby. Human and Yngtak alike had seen me involved with the impossible, and I suspected Conrad might have been preaching something about me. Worse, I had no makeup to dull my appearance like I usually did back home, and I felt rather naked. One of the unpaired Vanguard men tried to stop and talk to me with a grin, but I made a polite excuse and practically ran away. Why did people have to look at other people that way? I just wanted to be an unremarkable part of a group. That way

That way I would never be alone. If I never took a personal risk, I would never risk losing the group, and I would never have to feel like I had felt *back then*.

My feet no longer took me forward. Frozen in the middle of the hallway, I became aware of a fear that had likely been holding me back my entire life. I had not known myself. I had not had personal courage. I had not had the support and love I'd neededuntil now. My grandfather was a wonderful man, but he had not been able to fill the roles of an entire family. Now I had siblings in Trajan, Larentia, Paulinus, and Septus; an older sister in Caecilia; beloveds in Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia; a friend in Noah; andstrangest of all for me to recognizetwo crucial figures that fulfilled two very different but highly linked roles.

Conrad approached down the hall as I stood waiting; he waved off his three lieutenants and they continued on, leaving us alone. He stood in silence, intrigued, until finally asking, "Patience is not one of my virtues. Out with it girl."

As strange as it felt to consider this man as a partial filler of the missing role of father in my life, I had to say it: "You've been trying to push me to improve, haven't you?"

His flat lips curved into a smile. "I'll admit that, yes."

So it was true. I felt numb as I probed further. "Why?"

His head had gone from military near-baldness to hosting a short layer of brown hair in the time that I had known him; he ran his hand once through this now as he considered me with an only mildly unkind snicker. "Do you think it's coincidence that the Sixth Millennial walked up to my door in humanity's hour of greatest need? Me, the one man above all others who knew the Fifth inside and out?"

So that, too, was true. I took a moment to breathe and guess at all the things I did not know because I had been raised not to ask questions. Darkness and light both had been glimmering outside the narrow purview of my personal concerns. How light? How *dark?* "Tell me all this isn't just to challenge me."

"Not all of it, no," he said wryly at first; his smirk abruptly fell into dead seriousness. "But I did send the signal to resurrect my wife because of you."

Cristina's desperate *why now?* echoed in my ears, and I took a step back. "You"

"I suspected you from the very beginning," he continued. "But I knew for certain when you helped me lift that door and free the Yngtaks. Not only did the energy you released heat the entire hallway full of water, I swam back there after and found your handprints on the bottom of the door. The outline of your fingers in *solid metal.*"

I couldn't deny it to him or to myself, not after what I'd done in secret only an hour before. The agenda behind this, though, had to be darker than I could imagine. "You'd wake the monster behind the spheres just to spite me?"

"No." He shook his head sadly. "No. Look around you, Venita. These facilities were built to hold thousands, or even tens of thousands, not one woman. While I lost myself in dreams and nightmares, merciless boredom and hollow wonder eternal, Gisela built an entire empire for a people that exiled her long ago. More than that, she developed the technology for resurrectionDeath defeated! Truly slain!but then set the system not to bring her back unless I desired it, unless I came out of my eon of ennui and wanted to see her again. This was always a woman, not of evil, but of strong emotion. Whatever she may have become over centuries of solitude, she will never be a monster, just a worthy opponent."

The facilities.

They'd been built so absurdly large.

I'd never understood it.

I'd wandered the floors, explored their labyrinthine depths, and marveled at the redundancy.

I didn't trust Conrad, but I trusted that assessment of these factories and hospitals. They'd been built all over the region for capacity far beyond the needs of one lonely exiled Empress. "But we're set to attack her main fortress."

He nodded carefully. "We've been sending teams ahead with vehicles, supplies, and pallets of gear. They still can't come back until we win the day, but they *can* stock the million soldiers already laying siege. I've told them to spread the word that The Machine Empress of Mankind is about to resurrect."

A shiver of confusion ran through me. "Have I misread you? Have you done all this with good intent?"

"You misunderstand." His smile became subtly mocking. "They'll take it as an urgent omen of doom, not as a relief that this will all be over when she wakes up and turns off the artificial intelligence defense forces. They're making a grave error at my behest, and they'll deeply regret what happens after."

Regret. I stepped away with abject horror. Conrad's smile deepened as the full weight of what was happening hit me. We'd made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost had been our inevitably coming across and waking our immortal Imperator. My world had made a deal with the Regret Demon, and the unknown cost would be a war with what the others had called a force on level with a god. The Fifth Millennial, Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind, would easily destroy our Amber Worlds if so enraged. We'd been barely surviving trips across small portions of her realm. What could possibly stand against her in outright war?

"Yes," he said quietly as passersby approached. "Things are going to be very hard for you shortly, but I think you'll rise to the task. If not, at least the battles will be entertaining as hell." Acknowledging the passing soldiers, he nodded and headed away, completely unperturbed by our conversation.

Don't panic. Think. *Think!* If my father figure was a manipulating bastard, then I needed his opposite. Bursting into her room after a mad dash, I shouted, "Cristina!" 

She looked up from her handheld tablet device. "What's wrong?"

Hitting the button to slide the door closed behind me, I told her everythingthe testing, my discoveries, Conrad's tauntingand she listened and nodded along, unsurprised at any of it. "Sit down, Venita."

I had never had the spotlight so directly focused on me by the course of events before, but my panic began to fade as I sat on the floor next to the bed and she began braiding my hair like she had that day at the river.

"Conrad told you what he told you for a reason," she told me with calm focus as she layered my hair back and forth behind my head. "He's being both honest *and* manipulative. That's what makes his moves so effective. If he was lying, we could just find the truth, or even ignore himbut I have no doubt he believes what he's told you. Furthermore, he's calculated that revealing his intentions furthers his goals. Otherwise, he wouldn't have said anything."

Taking a deep breath and focusing my sight on the opposite metal wall, I asked, "So he wanted me panicked? Wanted me distracted?"

"I don't think so. It sounds like he's purposely given you fair warning. He wants you to grow stronger and face off against the Machine Empress. We can only speculate as to why, but, for the moment, our agendas align. We should work on getting you stronger." She tugged down a few times before resuming. "In the meantime, our mission will be to insert ourselves in the chain of command at the siege. *Somebody* from the Amber Worlds is in charge, despite the million men at large not publicly knowing."

"Noah can sense Amber people," I told her. "Or, rather, he *can't*, so he can pick them out of a crowd."

"Mm-hmm. That's perfect. When the offensive begins, we'll join the tide, but we'll move to find the Amber soldiers and lie our way into the chain of command. After all, you *are* from Amber Three, and we'll know so much they'll have no choice but to believe us. The inability to get home means they won't be able to confirm with their headquarters any more than we will. Then we'll call off the attack."

All the terror that Conrad had instilled in me was gone. It was a solid plan. "It might actually work."

"It will." She began working the longer ends of my braid. "Right now, it sounds like you've got other things to worry about. Romantically, I only ever loved one person. Saw him in those Kansan wheat fields in his soldiering gear and decided he was it. But you've got yourself into a very tough situation. A team can't go into battle with confusion or pain between its members. And who knows who'll be part of the coming twenty percent? You have to live and love while you can." She stopped just short of finishing my braid, and I guessed she was thinking of her lost husband.

"They calculated a twenty percent loss rate for the offensive?" I asked, turning my head to the side to look up at her.

"No," she murmured. "Twenty percent survival rate."

For the second time that day, true dread snaked its way around my heart. "Twenty percent? *One in five?*" There were five of us left in my squad! What if I was the only one who lived? What if all the

She snapped back to awareness and tied the end of my braid, finishing it. "Don't let it get to you. It's just an estimate based on an incomplete model. We'll survive. We're not going to bear the brunt of those losses, remember? Our mission is orthogonal. And I would never send you into a murderous slugfest like that. The day is never won solely because of guns."

"They sure help, though." Pushing the dark snake away from my heart thanks to her calm confidence, I frowned. "How do I choose?"

She let me up, and stood to walk me out. "That's up to you. Nobody else can tell you how to live." After activating the door and peering left and right, she told me, "It's clear. Nobody saw you. I'm concerned he may have provoked you into running straight to the leader of the secret opposition faction, but, if you did have a tail, you lost them."

That brought a smile back to my face. "I do run pretty fast these days."

"Go." She pushed me on my way. "And don't worry. We'll survive what's coming."

I made it decently far away from her quarters before anyone saw me; meanwhile, I became preoccupied with the choice ahead. How could I possibly refuse what I felt for any of my three beloveds? Was it as simple as choosing the one whose potential loss most terrified me? That seemed like an odd thought in many ways. Something vital would be cut from me if I lost any of my threebut something vital would be cut from *them* if I remained vague and indecisive.

While wandering the halls, I heard the words: "It's better than *nothing!*"

I was walking along the second floor subsection C toward Sampson's quarters when a prickling along my skin stopped me in place. Without any other warning, two bloodied men in unrecognizable clothes fought hand-to-hand past the T-junction ahead. Shouting and punching one another, they were definitely engaged in a real and vicious fight. I only got a good look at oneand even then I saw only black hair and fierce eyesbut I absolutely heard him yell, "The way *you* run things maybe!" The two combatants moved beyond the end of the hall and out of sight.

Dashing forward, I looked left and right down the junction, but they were nowhere to be seen. Had they fought around a corner or into one of the nearby rooms? I heard nothing, and the hallway was silent.

*What?*

To quote my Vanguard friend Sol: what *the hell* had that been?

The hair on the back of my neck remained charged as I stood in that silent hall. I had the distinct impression of water flowing back into a hole and sealing it up; or of a plane flying over, full of lives that were crossing close by but which would never interact with mine.

"Venita," someone called, and I turned to see a doctor I recognized approaching. "Did I hear right that you and your friends cut off Flavia's leg cast?"

"Yes. Is everything alright?"

He came close and gave me a strange look. "You know people don't normally do that kind of thing themselves. They usually get a doctor."

Some of his past comments and suspicions came back to me, and I had the sudden notion that he was somewhat cognizant of our differences from the rest of the Vanguard. "Oh, um, we didn't want to bother you."

"Is that so." He took in a long draw of breath through his nose and let it out over the course of several seconds. "Well, bother me in the future. It's why I'm here."

"Of course. Thank you." I watched him head on further down the hall before I resumed my course. Rather than head to Sampson's room, I chose my own, and I closed the door to find myself in rare solitude I had not experienced since that night at Conrad's medical facility. This factory had rooms for thousands of people, and thankfully so, for the Yngtaks alone took up two entire floors. I was tired of walking the crowded halls and running afoul of others. For the first time in a long time, I actually wanted to be alone. In that room, only I and my thoughts had motion.

But this room had a mirror.

As I sat and stared at myself in the lower corner of that reflective surface, I couldn't help but see the battered and scarred body I'd earned for myself by surviving this far. My temple had been drilled into; my cheek had been shot through; my arm had been broken twice; my face had been beaten and kicked to a pulp not too long ago; more and deeper pains the longer I looked. I could die, and so could the ones I loved. This was mortality.

But this room had a mirror.

Throughout Conrad's entire facility, deeper and deeper into the Earth, every single mirror had been removed. I was the only one that had noticed, and even then I had not really picked up on itand not until that moment. I couldn't put it into words, but, in that quiet realization, I saw the path to defeating my horrible mentor. It would take time and careful strategy, but I suddenly saw him for what he really was, and that gave me the edge.

The alarm jarred me from sleep the following morning. The offensive was in motion, and the Coalition Alliance would be moving to assault Her Glory's stronghold in less than three hours.

Focus on preparations took over, and I had no time for anything but a warm touch for each of the three people I loved before we donned our helmets, climbed on our new bikes, and rode out alongside tanks and supply trucks, beneath jets and helicopters, and ahead of legions of Yngtak foot soldiers that had been re-armed with the energy lances the spheres had previously taken from them. Our thousand men would not turn the tide alone, but we were armed to the teeth with freshly fabricated vehicles, guns, ammunition, and morale.

Her Glory's homeworld held a nightmare landscape. Spiky growing arcs dotted dark hills under a diseased-orange and bile-yellow sky that gave us only chill winds as greeting. The very earth seemed absent; corrugated metal had grown in its place. A river of mercury ran beside us, and we avoided it with apprehension. This was a world overrun with industrial machination, and I found myself rethinking the possibility that the ancient Empress could be a person of good heart. Our way was paved with the destruction of cybernetically-enhanced animals of the kind that had exploded and killed Porcia, and mortars from nearby Vanguard positions created a constant rain of flaring light. We approached what could only be her citadel: a massive mountain encased in a globular shimmering shield whose glimmer I recognized from the skies of my youth.

We presented ourselves as reinforcements at an enormous base in a highly defensible chrome valley; called Northern Point for its proximity to the enemy fortress, it would be the launching point for the nuclear-equipped jets, many of which had already taken off. More Yngtaks joined our own here, and I rode open-mouthed alongside my small family of Amber soldiers as I took in the might of the Coalition Alliance. Inverted amethyst pyramids floated overhead, while giants crafted from plant matter lumbered along the earth-bound paths. In the base with us, Noah gawked at a pale-skinned and white-haired woman in jade armor and told me, "That's gotta be the dead woman that helped Alek Staley's people on the first Exodus!"

I was glad for my helmet, for it hid my awkward stare. Dead? She was walking around! She was expressionless and white as bone, sure, but she hardly seemed dead. If she was, it was not fair in the least. Why was it that Death had so many exceptions for everyone but me and the ones I loved? Putting that thought aside, I told Noah on a private channel, "Alright. We're here. There's not much time. Let's find the Amber chain of command."

He replied an affirmative on the same channel. He knew that only myself, my three, and Cristina were aware of our real mission; Caecilia, Trajan, Paulinus, Larentia, and Septus would have to remain in the dark for the moment. I ached to tell Caecilia, for I trusted her capability in all things, but I had not had the opportunity to catch her alone and there was no easy way to speak privately to her now without raising suspicion.

We stood next to our bikes and watched the frantic preparations until an unassuming young man in non-descript clothes passedand Noah gave a subtle nod in his direction. Cristina followed Noah and me closely while Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia maintained an inconspicuous rear guard. We tracked the young man to a tent in a rear corner of the base that was nearly out of sight behind stacks of equipment crates. Within, we could see the movement of a dozen men, and Noah indicated that all of them were from the Amber Worlds. I wasn't sure what the plan was, and I turned to consult only to find Cristina pushing right into the tent.

We stepped in after her to back her up; fourteen soldiers stared at us. They had each been doing something with gear and weapons, but had stopped upon our intrusion. Hot winds surged behind us as the first nuclear strikes detonated in the unseen distance outside the tent; a great rumble shook the flat corrugated metal under our boots. The attack had begun, but it was not too late to call off the offensive.

Without missing a beat, Cristina took control with the manner of a seasoned officer, but she said no such thing. Holding out her tablet device, she ordered, "Give me the complete Vanguard roster. The full million. I want their finders after this is over."

It took three months to get them to trust me. Three months spent in virtual isolation; three months spent eating one step better than garbage just to survive. I figured makeshift prisons run by Chinese rebels would hardly be luxurious, but those three months will haunt my sleep if I survive this. Until the day this struggle ends, there are far worse nightmares to faceand while awake.

That Starbucks, that day, those seven Venti coffees; I broke something in myself three months ago while sitting at that table guzzling stimulant. Out the window and across the street I could see ramshackle ghettos, while on my side of the divide everything was clean, bright, and happy.

Each coffee subtly changed that dynamic.

I would say that the ideal level of caffeination for busy-bee workers is somewhere between half a Venti black coffee at minimum and two full ones at maximum. While in that range, every sip I took gradually shrank my awareness in a way only an experienced caffeine addict could notice. Creativity and thinking outside the box became slightly harder while focusing on specific mundane tasks became slightly easier. In that regard, I almost became more concerned with writing down my changing symptoms than with actually drinking the coffee.

It took an act of will to force myself to proceed. I'd kicked caffeine for the first time in years, but now I'd given myself back to it, and my brain was very happy with the flood of energy. It wanted to enjoy the high; it did not want to keep drinking with the specific intent to make myself sick. Nevertheless, I began gulping more even as my pulse rose and my fingers began subtly shaking.

The third full coffee brought the change in the world's tone to a noticeable level. The bright colors had faded in favor of greys and browns, and the street outside was dingy and cracked in small ways I had not noticed before. The ghetto across from me remained horrible; I watched a haggard mother hang laundry on a high rope strung between two rotting wooden spires.

Each breath brought that surge of fire I recognized as the limit of caffeination, and I had to carefully regulate myself to keep my heart rate down. For now, I was still fine, but I was only at three of seven coffees. Taking a deep breath, I chugged the fourth.

The tilt in my perceptions nearly made me slide from my seat. The world had not shifted physically, but my sense of myself within it certainly had. Looking around, I sighted for the first time bits of garbage, rust, and decay on my side of the divide. People walking on the streets didn't seem to notice; one stepped in what looked like dog excrement but continued walking without bothering to scrape it off. I watched three workers inside the Starbucks itself ignore a small pile of trash that customers kept stepping on.

But still I was submerged in a long, deep, and slow river of complacency. My body was agitated, but my mind was full of excuses not to notice, mention, or otherwise regard these strange discrepancies.

Downing the fifth coffee rapidly as a way of surprising myself and breaking through that submersion, I clutched the edges of control to stay centered. Each gasp brought oxygen, while each exhalation brought fuzziness at the edges of my vision. I began to feel claustrophobic and unsafe. Rusted corners and smelly bits of garbage made themselves prominent in my awareness; I slung my bag and grabbed my two remaining coffees and stumbled out onto the street.

The sub-provincial city of Guangzhou no longer looked to me as all the others that I had visited. I could see character now, mostly in aged buildings off the main path, and the bright colors and cleanliness had been stripped away. This place was run down and industrial, and I had not seen it as such until my fifth coffee.

The sixth filled me with very unpleasant internal heat. I'd come here ostensibly to investigate a claim that had caught my eye; I was within a block of that location, and wandered along my side of the street opposite the ghetto to investigate the site of the supposed accident. It was a simple alleyway, much like the one in Jerusalem, but this one held stacks of garbage and low pools of unidentifiable filth. I braved the muck to search the walls, and, this time, I was ready when I found the unknown invisible vines.

Here goes nothing, indeed. I kept my eyes on the wall and downed my seventh and final coffee.

The pain in my head became two directed blades moving through my forehead and temples. I winced, but kept my gaze forward. I needed to see this. If seven coffees didn't blow open the flaw in the lie, nothing would. Someone had pulled the wool over my eyes, and forcing it out of my system was the only way. Shivering horribly and fighting a body-wide surge of dangerous over-stimulation, I watched with triumph as patchwork lines began to weave themselves into existence before me.

It was the same material that the doctor in Zimbabwe had found in Kudakwashe's throat. I knew it immediately. It ran along the walls like vines of ivy, but, as the doctor had said, it looked to be some sort of neural tissue. Somehow, it had the ability to hide itself from perception. This was what I'd stabbed into on that Zimbabwean rooftop, and this was what had made everyone around it scream and run at me to defend it. How had it done that? Did it generate some kind of neural field to blanket our senses? What *was* this stuff?

Clenching my fists to keep a hold of myself against the tide of caffeine, I followed the neural vines higher and higher with my sight. They'd grown over this building, in the alley in Jerusalem, and high up in Zimbabwe. Where else might these spots of infection be growing? I stepped out of the fetid alley to follow its run further, but froze in horrified awe as I got my first unedited visual of the sub-city. There were two perceptions there; one, the faux clean clone, the other a monstrously overgrown hive. My vision flickered as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing: *a veritable jungle of hanging neural vines, conduits, and pillars had grown across the entire city.* Thick masses hung between high buildings; curving nerves spread out fractally along nearby streets.

The shock and the caffeine combined were too much. I fell to my knees at the whim of a body-wide seizing vomit. Worse, the pain in my temples had become what felt like motion, and a writhing therein made me scream and grip myself to fight for sanity. Static blurred my sight, random voices shouted in my hearing, and two long worms of strange tissue burrowed out the sides of my eyes, fell to the dirty street, and shriveled up.

Drops of blood fell straight down from my vision as I stared at what had just crawled out of my temples and died on the ground before me. The caffeine wracked me with pain, but I knew now that I'd done it: I'd poisoned myself hard enough that my perceptions had finally become clear. What the hell were they? Parasites? Entities in their own right? Or just some form of connection to the previously invisible neural jungles growing all over the world? Had the human race evolved some sort of literal group hive mind, or were we under attack by something else?

The madman.

He'd written of this.

He'd been intent on cutting the neural fibers out of my eyes directly. That's what he'd done to himself, and that was how he'd gained the ability to truly *see.* I'd chosen another route, but it had not been without its risks. I threw up twice more before losing consciousness on the sidewalk. Four hundred and fifteen milligrams of caffeine in a Venti black coffee, and I'd had seven. Five grams was a potentially lethal dose, and I'd had at least sixty percent of that. I descended into darkness with nothing but a small hope that my years as a coffee addict would see me through this.

The first question I became aware of was simple. "How did you do that?"

Several periods of blurred consciousness brought me to waking in a sealed underground parking lot that looked like it had never been finished. The man who had spoken was not present, but he soon visited with food and water. He asked again in perfect English, "How did you do that?"

I shook with the after-effects of caffeine near-overdose, but managed to respond, "Do what?" He kicked me in the ribsnot too hard, just enough to show that he was seriousand I said, "I'll tell you, just please clarify!"

He moved his wrinkled but hardened face closer and tapped my temple. "Removed your blinders."

"Ah." I winced at his touch before realizing the implications of his question. "Wait, you're aware of them? Do you also see the world as it truly is?"

He gave me another sharp kick. "I've tortured better men than you until they wished for death. Understand your position. I ask, you tell."

"Sure." I nodded in acceptance. "I, uh, took sixty percent of a lethal dose of caffeine."

His glare was sharp. "How did you calculate a lethal dose? The same amount for others may kill them."

"It was just a guess based on articles I've read," I protested, staving off another kick. "I've been addicted to caffeine for years, so I may have withstood it better."

He pulled back. "So her story was true. She watched you from our side of the border, and she said you drank coffee until you became violently ill."

I held up my hands to ward off the bright light that his change in position had cast upon me. "Yes!"

Now a silhouette, he asked, "And what did you see?"

"Look," I told him, trying to think quickly. "I don't think you and I are enemies. I've been pursued by crazy people, got my finger cut off, my ear sliced, some guy wanted to cut my eyesI have *no idea* what's going on, but I do think the human race is in serious trouble. There areGod, there's like some sort of infestation out thereit's everywhere! I think we're under attack!"

He gave a dark laugh and moved away, saying, "You just saved your life, and you don't even know why."

A door slammed somewhere distant, and I was left alone in a poorly lit crumbled stone prison. I walked the length of my confinement for a few hours, finding a scattering of shitty fluorescent lights illuminating empty parking spots and incomplete stairwells. Some of these stairwells led up toward daylight very *very* high up, but nothing but sheer concrete and the occasional rotting foothold presented itself. They had no guards on this exit for a reason: the climb was suicide.

An entire month passed before I received my next visitor. I was self-aware of the effects that solitary confinement was having on me, but this was no hallucination. The same man opened a door, but only his guest came inside; that creature that had once crawled out of my severed pinky finger now skittered into the room on bone-white blade-like legs. Ivory eyes watched me unblinking, and I heard its voice in my head again: *Are you done playing the fool?*

There was no escape this time, but I still moved back a few steps. "Yes." After a thought, I added, "I understand what you meant now by my senses betraying me. I've seen it."

*Yes. You have. The question now is whether you are a double agent. It is exceedingly rare that a human being breaks free from the Entity on its own. Would you have us believe you are just that smart?*

I looked past the Bonewalker toward the door where my human former interrogator stood. He seemed very uncomfortable with the creature's presence, and nodded for me to speak carefully. I finally said, "A little smart, but mostly just way too addicted to caffeine."

It seemed to accept that answer. *You spoke of a man that tried to cut your eyes.*

"Yeah?"

*Describe him.*

I gave it the best description I could of the man with the wild glee and surgical knife, but I couldn't tell what it thought of my words. It left immediately, this time jumping into a small open wound on the man at the door's arm; he shivered, pulled a bandage over it, and closed the door.

Was he a guard? Or someone higher level? If the crazy doctor was someone this group wanted, then I might have been regarded as a very important prisoner. Indeed, the quality of my given food rose, and guards came in to play cards with me and keep me company. I understood that this was both luxury for my information and a test of my true character; I made sure to be completely honest about every single thing they asked me. I had nothing to hide. I even told them about the breakup, and my hollow reactions to it.

At the end of the second month, the Bonewalker returned. This time, I was in the open-topped stairwell standing in the rain, but it didn't seem to care about the falling liquid. *The guards seem to think you're not a liar.*

I'd had plenty of time to craft my strategy. "Tell me one thing. I assume the Entity is something related to the neural fibers growing all over the world. Are you opposed to it?"

The creature's ivory eyes gave no hint of connotation or elaboration. *Yes.*

"Then that means we're on the same side," I told it, taking a risk. "Regardless of whatever organization or power structure you've got control of."

*You would choose the more personable of two dooms?* it asked. *You will remain untreated, for it can sense the blood-bond. None of my humans can ever truly be a part of its society.*

There was a chance I would come off as a double agent fishing for information, but I also genuinely wanted to know. "How much do you control?"

*Thirty percent.*

So the ghettos had been made terrifying in our perceptions on purpose to separate us from the opposition. "Thirty percent of China, that's a sizable"

*Of the Earth,* it responded. A clicking followed, a sound I took to be laughter. *You're not a double agent. You're too full of yourself, like most humans. Know that you will be watched, and if you betray us, you will die in the manner you are most afraid of.*

Could it see that? Could it see my fears? I gulped as it crawled away without another word. And what of being watched? Did it mean I was to be released?

The third month was full of tension and confusion. Gone were the guards and the visits. Had I done something wrong? No. Finally, the man who had first interrogated me dragged me out the door and up a long set of stairs to release me into a moderately disheveled area that I might once have seen as ruined and horrible. After undoing a temporary pair of handcuffs, he told me, "That doctor has a special interest in you. Let him find you, then bring him to us. He is very important to this fight."

I nodded, and accepted money and a folded set of clothes from him.

"And take a shower," he said as a final note of goodbye. "You reek."

I did reekbut there was wind to carry the smell away and a sun in the sky. I was free.

Wandering the streets and watching the poor go about their lives the best they could with what they had on hand, I realized that life was precious. I'd been doing nothing with it since I'd been hollowed out by someone I'd loved, and yet here there were people that did not have the suits or the offices or the coffeepeople making do, raising kids, and having afternoon chats from window to window. This was the Bonewalker's territory, and it was not altogether bad.

The divide between territories was stark. Neural masses hung from building to building directly across the final street, and I could see raised lines of parasitic flesh along the temples of passersby. My God, it hadn't been a caffeine nightmare! Seventy percent of the Earth had been overtaken by an infection of unknown proportions, and the other thirty percent held fast only under the vicious rule of the Bonewalker. Where was the human spirit in all this? Where was *our* faction?

Eyes were upon me even thenfrom both sidesso I resolved to keep my counsel to myself. If there was to be one at all, I had to be the start of our faction. I'd figured this out myself, freed my own perceptions through risk and calculated daring, and I'd dodged the Bonewalker's control as well. I knew who my first true ally would be, too: the very man that creature wanted.

Who are you, Doctor? What do you have that both these nightmares want? I've left enough keywords in this for you to find it, and I know you're obsessive enough to contact me despite the risk. I'm back in the States, and I have a suspicion you know where to find me.

A haunting song marred far-flung and oddly colored skies doming ancient ruins seen only in my dreams. The notes were simple; a dirge, not to honor long dead ancestors, but to mourn those still living who were unaware their remaining time was tragically short. Between these ruins a train barreled ever faster down tracks that led only over the edge of a cliff. The passengers on board were all too lost in dark premonitionsgazes each absent, sights on the distance, seeing nothingto notice and warn the unseen engineer whose intent they had all been told to simply trust. *All part of the plan*, they murmured to each other while unable to pull themselves away from their own gloom and look one in another in the eye. *All part of the plan*.

The events of our first secret meeting repeated themselves endlessly in my thoughts. My adoptive mentor Cristina had bid us gather those we could trust to discuss the first collective efforts to resist Conrad's rise to power. Notably absent had been a full half of my family in arms.

The factory contained an entire open world of machinery, production lines, control stations, and assorted spaces all under one massive natural stone roof. It would take us weeks to explore it all, but, for now, we only needed to understand the wide circular control station on the central platform. With Celcus, I stood above and behind it on a catwalk watching Conrad as he in turn watched tech people studying the numerous newly awakened consoles. Bitter resentment and humiliation boiled behind my neutral gaze.  Because of the incident at the second gatebecause of what the others had seen me do in full public view in a moment of crisishe now had at least thirty followers. I wanted to glare, but Cristina had advised me to keep my dislike to myself. Indeed, as she had specifically warned, he had already used knowledge of my past against me. Giving him anything was a mistake.

The biggest surprise at the meeting had been the seven newcomers I had not met, a squad of New Exodus Vanguard riders who had been looking for an opportunity to speak to us in private. "I know you," their leader said to Cristina and Noah. He was on the young end of his twenties but deadly serious in action and intent, a manner emphasized by a long burn scar up the right side of his face. "You probably don't remember me, but I was there on the First World when it happened. I was among the citizens that you and your group led through the city when the white hole began destroying the planet." He touched his burn scar. "I followed you then, and I survived against all odds. I'll follow you now, and so will my squadmates." His six companions stood in grim solidarity.

Cristina gave them a calm evaluation before clasping each of their wrists in succession. I noticed the physical touch was very deliberate, a way of making the bond real. "We're glad to have you. Conrad is not evil, but he *is* a danger. Get close to him and become part of his support base. We must begin a campaign of careful information management. Our identities and agendas must be held close and shared with no one. Understood?"

They did understand. One said, "I don't trust anyone immortal. How can they possibly know what we mortals go through?"

Cristina had nodded at that, but I'd seen a strange sidelong glance from Noah that had left me unsettled.

Returning to the present moment and trying to focus on something elseanything elseI found that my thoughts were stained by our Imperator's other words to me in the meat grinder. "Celcus, do you like what we do?"

He leaned a little further forward on the railing. "What do you mean?"

"We trained to be police, to protect and serve the local community. But the second that danger hit, the military took us over, and we've been soldiers ever since."

"I do think about that sometimes."

I moved forward and leaned on the railing next to him. "You do?"

"Yeah. This is not the life I expected." He kissed me on the forehead. "But among the paths presented to us, we chose the best we could. I don't regret being here, knowing you, even if we die tomorrow."

My bitterness ebbed in favor of warm acknowledgement. "That's a great way to put it. I was thinking myself that after all this, once we get home"

"Venita?"

I turned at the interruption to see Noah standing at the end of the grated walkway with a strange expression on his face. I asked, "What is it?"

He glanced past me at Celcus. "I need to talk to you for a momentalone."

"Of course." I looked to my tall man, and he headed off in the other direction. A moment later, I turned back around. "What's wrong?"

Noah approached with apprehension. "I think you're the appropriate person to help me with this. I sense a great number of people in pain somewhere near. Best guess is that they're being held prisoner here in the complex. Thing is"

I understood. "If you just go find them, you'll give away that you can sense emotions."

"Yes. And Cristina advised me not to reveal anything that might boost Conrad's understanding of us. In fact, we can use this to attribute an ability to you that you don't actually have, *decreasing* his understanding."

My smile was slight, for someone was apparently in pain at that very moment, but I was glad we were all in this together. "Let's go find them and then craft an appropriate excuse."

"Be warned," he said as he led the way along high narrow metal. "There's something different about them. There's something off; something I vaguely recognize but can't place. The color of their emotions is wrong somehow."

What did *that* mean? Readying myself for anything, I ducked down into a low wide ventilation tunnel. Great fans moved air past us as we crept through the maze of technology under the earth. I was reminded of the excessive extra underground floors of the medical facility in which we had found Conrad, but this place was dirtier and had not been intended for human habitation outside of the main areas. As we moved laterally and down in search of a way to get closer to Noah's sensed emotions, we began alternately crawling and swinging between ancient pipes and over mysterious dark gaps that opened down only onto steam lit from below by bright purple. Two hours into this strange spelunking, we hit as deep as we could go, and along warm rock on which human feet had never trod we found an enormous biotechnological vein pulsing with violet energies.

Noah stared for nearly a minute, simply taking in the subterranean wonder. Thirty times his height to carry enough power for a factory of this size and design, the vein ran past us and curved up toward the central control station in the distance. As he studied it, his expression grew concerned. "It's alive."

"Touch it," I told him with nearly the same wonder I'd experienced the first time. "It responds. It's aware of us."

"I know," he let slip under an unblinking gaze. "I can feel it. In some primal manner, it has emotions. This explains a vague omnipresent feeling I've been having ever since we left Amber One."

"Is this what's in pain?"

"No." He finally broke off his fascination to wipe sooty sweat from his forehead and look straight up. "Whoever they are, they're above us."

We searched for a path, and found it in the form of a series of maintenance ladders that began taking us where we wanted to go. Without the need to follow a circuitous labyrinth, we approached the unknown location directly, and eventually emerged onto the lowest finished basement level with a shared sigh and mutual slumps against opposite chrome walls. He was not as trained and fit as an Amber soldier, but I'd been running at the end of my endurance for weeks, and I was more than happy to have an excuse to rest for a moment. Breathing hard, I managed to ask, "Where from here?"

Red-faced, he indicated the end of the hall to our right with a tired tilt of his head.

"Then we'll check it out," I panted. "In just a second."

He laughed weakly and slid lower against the smooth wall. "It's good to see you whole, by the way."

I brushed beads of black sweat from my eyebrows before replying, "What do you mean?"

"Seeing real happiness in others is rarer than you might think." He looked directly at me as he spoke, and I could tell he truly saw. "You've got doubts about life and death and the battle ahead I'm sure, like we all do, but I'm glad you don't doubt *yourself* anymore."

His words in the caves of drunkenness had not escaped me. "Thanks for the warning that one night. You know the one."

He quivered with exhausted laughter. "Yeah, I know the one. And you're welcome. There was a time when I might not have said anythingperhaps out of fear, or to avoid an embarrassing social misstep, or just because of self-imposed solitudebut not too long ago I learned that taking risks for the people around you is worth it no matter the outcome. Life doesn't matter unless you're actually living."

Funny that the emotion-senser's emotions mirrored my own. "I couldn't have said it better myself."

"Eh, author words."

We'd never talked much about his past. "You were a writer?"

"In another life. It's easy to write stories when you can literally see the emotional threads of existence floating like so many colored fogs over the city at night."

My half-remembered dream of colored skies over ancient ruins came back to me for a moment, but I had no coherent thought to add to the conversation before someone's shout echoed past us. We both pushed to our feet.

Noah called out, "Hello?"

The voice switched from its previous unknown language to common English. "Be you Empires? Or sister-Earths?"

"Perhaps neither," I responded as we rushed as quickly as we could manage toward a very wide and absurdly sturdy metal slide-wall that had frozen open about a hand's span from the floor. As I got closer, I decided to amend what I'd said, for I'd forgotten we were still operating with assumed identities. "From the Empire, but just people."

"Then well met," the voice called out from the gap. "We have managed to raise this wall-door a small measure, but no further, and we have thus been trapped here for quite some time."

We both got down on our hands and knees to peer under, and I nearly lost my balance when I saw a hairless yellow face flat against chrome staring back at me. His very human-like white eyesminus eyelasheswere on my companion. "Is that Noah?"

"Not exactly."

"As it often is with you, old ally."

Noah grinned. "How did you end up here?"

"We were captured at spear-point by black spheres some time ago," the yellow man explained with thinly veiled sorrow. "There are nine hundred of us in here with no food or water. The situation is not favorable." He took a moment for a dry swallow. "It is good to see a familiar face."

While he and Noah talked, I took action. Heading back down the hallway and up a long ramp, I traced my sense of the place until I found a retracted bridge. Touching the nearby square in the wall and receiving a green beep in return, I waited until the extended catwalk locked in over the wide violet-steam gap before I jogged across and found myself one hallway over and a long ladder down from the wide central public space. We could have gotten to our destination far faster if we had known exactly what we were heading toward, but we'd climbed down multiple levels before we'd been able to triangulate our objective.

In short order I had the hallway filled with men prying at the door and trying to lift it, but it was twenty times the length of a person and looked to weigh several tons. Excited but feeble yells came from behind it often, and we considered our options for a few moments before somebody removed a hatch from the wall and hit a specific pipe repeatedly. We all jumped back as a light spray of water arced up; a small stream burbled down under the door, and the yellow-skinned men and women beyond began shouting praises and thanks.

Finally, I had a chance to ask Noah, "Who are they?"

"Yngtaks," he whispered back. "I don't personally know much about them, but I heard they come from a place of floating continents and eternal light. They also live under an authoritarian theocratic society."

Carefully making sure nobody could hear me, I asked, "Theocratic?"

"Religious."

Interesting. Yngtak society must then have been the exact opposite of our own. We'd had no concept of religion at all, while they held it up as primary.

For the moment, there was no getting in. I watched in masked wonder as men placed small amethyst pyramids against the metal and tried to activate them from afar with rods, but the gems would not comply. I'd heard some mention of these amethyst suicide devices, but only then did I connect them to the fields of growing gemstone life we had ridden through. Each member of the Vanguard was carrying a tiny baby amethyst pyramid as a last resort to escape fates worse than death; a wise precaution in the cruel multiverse. Some Vanguard soldiers believed they disintegrated the bearer, while others believedlike Cristinathat they teleported the victim to some extremely distant unknown location. In either case, using one meant that person was effectively gone. It was akin to playing with unstable explosives; I cringed with horrified anticipation each time someone tried to disintegrate a hole in the door, but the amethysts refused to be wasted so.

"This didn't work on the front door during the attack either," someone complained. "These things are semi-sentient and don't want to pop alone."

While others ran back to start fabrication of a mechanism that might lift the broken door, I volunteered to stay with the Yngtaks. For a short time, I was left alone with them, and I sat with the one Noah had called Larry and talked under the door with him. He seemed remarkably level-headed, and, at some point, I worked up the courage to ask him, "What's it like living in a theocracy?"

"We have lost our homeworld, so we no longer live *in* one," he responded with a sigh. "But like any other way of life, it has positives and negatives. We are just lucky that our Goddess is real and lives in the same physical way that we do."

A female God? And a real one at that? I leaned down further to see more of his face. "What, really? Who is she?"

"All around us. She built this place, thus our surrender to it. We believed that she would take care of us."

Despite myself, I shivered as I realized who he was talking about. "You worship the Machine Empress as a Goddess?"

"Is she not?" he asked. "She can change the rules of the world to suit her desires. She has built entire realities to serve her, and controls this wide region of existence. We may be creatures of faith, but we have not misplaced our beliefs."

Something about it seemed wrong to me. How could the God-force that judged all things also be a living and breathing entity inside creation itself? Power alone, to me, did not seem enough to make someone worthy of worship. I wanted that force to deserve the honor by being fair and just. In either case, I had bad news for him. "According to Conrad, Gisela died five years ago."

Even though our cheeks were pressed against metal, I could see the vague pain on his face from what I'd told him. After a moment, he focused on the positive. "The husband of the Goddess is with you?"

"Yes," I told him truthfully, but he could see the concern on my face.

"Is something wrong?"

I had to say something before anyone else got to these Yngtaks. "Conrad is not to be trusted. Keep your peace with that warning, but know that he claims to personally speak for God."

Larry seemed troubled. "God in the male form? Does he not speak for his wife?"

"No."

He closed his lashless eyes a moment before refocusing and nodding against the floor. "A number of my people may likely follow him in this time of desperation, but know that the true faith lies not with him." He moved to take a drink from the manmade stream. After a sigh, he said, "Hardship never ends these days, does it?"

"Not that I've seen." I smiled, and he laughed weakly with me as the absurdity of our location and situation hit us. Other yellow-skinned men and women began peering under the door, and my face was the first they saw as they began asking questions about who we were and whether we could get them out. Thinking of Cristina's advice, I gave neutral but hopeful answers that contained implied spins against Conrad without directly naming him. Also, I made sure to reach under and grasp hands and wrists. With each contact, I promised that everything would be alright.

A few techs came to deliver some food, assess the door, and return to the fabrication lines again, but I was alone when the pipe behind me ruptured further. Suddenly sprayed with icy subterranean water, I leapt out of the way and shouted. The Yngtaks laughed at first while I fought toward the pipe and tried to rotate the emergency valve wheel, but the break was just before it, not after it. The valve I needed was somewhere further down the line and out of reach. Giving up on the freezing mess, I stood back and tried to warm upuntil I noticed the slight pooling at my feet. The water had been trickling under the door for some time, but, with increased flow, was now washing back. "Larry?"

"Yes?"

"Is there any place for the water to pour out in there? Grates, holes?"

"No," he called back. "We would have escaped through such exits long ago."

I stepped back and my boot made a solid splash. "Larry, I can't stop the water flow!"

"No matter. Just open the door."

"They just got the specs for the lifter. It's going to be awhile."

Unseen, he paused. I could tell the truth was sinking in for him and the others trapped behind the massive door. At long last, he asked, "What are you going to do, ally?"

First things first. "Get help." I began to focus an intense burst of emotion to summon Noah, but then I realized that we had to hide his ability from Conrad. "Hold on!" Splashing through the sole-high water, I ran down the chrome tunnel and up the ramp at the end. As I passed, I noted that there were no good egresses for the rising water. The hatch for the ladder we had climbed to get there was higher up the sloped hall. There was a very real possibilityno. I wouldn't let that happen. Cross the bridge. Up the ladder. Shout for help! Dozens of feet began pounding above, and I started to descend again. "Come on! Bring tools!"

My initial stress faded as the combined might of our centuria swung into action. Flavia was beside me shortly, and Sampson as well. A group of Vanguard techs dashed after us, and I led them to the door through ankle-high water. Laptops were opened and held high, drills and ratchets and analysis tools newly made at the factory itself were put into play, and multiple small teams began coordinating rapidly and effectively.

"We're going to get you out of there!" I said under the door, but the water reached the lower rim and drowned out any reply.

Sampson began helping the team trying to lift the door directly while Flavia tried the radio to speak to the central command station. "No luck," she told me, completely focused. "You," she told a straggler. "Go tell control to turn off the water to section C-6." The woman nodded and began heading back, to which Flavia shouted, "Run! *Go!*"

Together, Flavia and I analyzed the long wound in the pipe and its pressured spray; there was no hope of sealing it while the water was defending the breach. We followed the pipes to where they seamlessly shot into the wall, but there was no help there either. She asked, "Can you drill holes like you did at the front gate? Give the water somewhere to go?"

I could. Dropping down on one knee, I formed my multi-tool and began drilling straight down into choppy water and waving chrome. Those who had not seen my transmorphic brace stared in wonder for a moment, but Flavia urged them back to work with urgent glares. After a few failed drill attempts, I realized, "I can't get a bit grip on the smooth metal with all this water."

"Try the wall then. I'll do a circuit and look for the next hallway. If I can find the manual valve, I'll shut it off."

"Good. Don't get your casts any wetter than they are." I stood in the shin-high freezing water and pushed my sphere-inspired drill at the wall. For a moment, I felt as if I was back in the meat grinder and futilely trying to drill my way out from under a relentless time shortage, but here I was not under attack by anything other than coldand my inner blue fire kept me warm. Those were good people behind that door, and I was not going to let them die.

My drill moved forward easily as I bored into the gap beyond. Alright, one hole made. A series of these might hopefully

The ancient pipe exploded, sending shrapnel against the teams at the door. Red tainted the water, and I ordered a retreat for the wounded. Their comrades grabbed them and began helping them out, leaving only a few to continue working. Re-assessing, I saw that the pipe was now simply open-ended and blasting water like a pressurized fire-hose. The trained soldier in me told me that the Yngtaks were beyond dead now. Nothing would save them.

I refused to listen. "You!" The tech froze halfway to shoving his laptop in a bag. "Get buckets," I told him. "Get cups, use your bare hands if you have to. Get *everyone down here* and start scooping the water from the end of the hall. Throw it down the ladder shaft over there."

He ran off with a frightened but determined, "*Yes sir!*"

What to do? I put my hands up on the sides of my head to fight the cold-headache that was now pounding in. What options were there? Drilling holes now would never be fast enough. Can't stop the water, can't open the doorso what to do? I hated to admit it, but I was somewhat relieved when I saw Conrad leading his entourage toward me through the waist-high water.

Pounding and shouting began reaching us from the other side of the door. The Yngtaks were aware that we had lost control of the situation, and they had begun to panic.

Conrad gave a grim shake of his head. "Oh, no. Not like this. Death should be hard-fought and blazing, not a combination of tragically mundane factors."

"What do we do?" I asked, keenly aware that any interaction with him would only fuel his followers' belief in his authoritybut that was less important than the nine hundred civilian lives on the line.

"We couldn't shut it off at the control panels," he replied. "We don't know the systems well enough yet. Have you tried the activation panel?"

I nodded toward the defunct panel. "When we first got here, yes. It beeps green, but it's stuck because they tried to force the door open."

He studied the size and mass of the door. "The lifter won't be ready for an hour."

We were wasting precious time while he ran through the options. "That's far too long."

"Then let's try to get there by scooping water," he said, giving in. "Your idea?"

"Yes." I followed him and his entourage to the ladder hatch at the end of the hall where a dozen people were crowded and shoving water down the long hole with makeshift buckets. Now that I could see it in action, I knew it was not nearly enough. There was no room for more people. What else could I do but stand and watch in horror? The screaming and banging behind the door would soon cease, and that would be that.

Celcus arrived with a curved piece of metal, but I grabbed him and pulled Sampson from scooping duty. "Come on, help me."

"What's the plan?" Celcus asked.

The fire inside me burned with a very sharp kind of fuel. "We can't do nothing."

They were Amber men, and everything in them agreed completely. We would never be bystanders to tragedy. That was our culture's gift to us. Stripping outer layers, we dove into the freezing water and began swimming down the hall. The open pipe was a wide jet to our left, but we slid past it and swam down to the gap at the base of the door. I could see dozens of yellow fingers under the lip at times, and I wanted them to see ours in return. Perhaps opening the way was possible with our combined strength.

Placing my boots flat on jumbled patterns of light, I braced between Celcus and Sampson, and we pulled up together. The pressure on my head and neck rose, threatening to knock me unconscious; I altered my stance and put more of my effort on my shoulders and thighs.

The first attempt failed, and we rose to the scant layer of air between frothing water and harsh white lights. Neither of them questioned this, and I loved them for that. We three gasped in as much air as we could and then dove for another try.

This time I slid my fingers in between yellow digits and pulled with interlocked grip. There must have been thirty or forty Yngtaks on the other side trying the same thing. How much force did that create? Calling upon Flavia's analytical ability, I multiplied a few hundred newtons by the number of people we had lifting and came up drastically short of the weight of this tremendous door.

No.

That was an unacceptable result.

That would have to change. This reality was not good enough. This reality was not fair or just.

Sampson was beside me, and thus I called upon the strength of his limbs. Celcus, too, and Flavia, and Septus, and Tacitus and Porcia and Rufus and Trajan and Paulinus and Larentia and Caecilia and Cristina and Noah and everyone I knew I could summon to come to my aid. There was a great trembling in me, made all the more confusing by a rush of bubbles and water flowprobably from the water jetbut it was not enough. I rose to the surface afire, and we pressed our faces into a nose-thick layer of steam and heat.

"This whole place is going to come down!" Celcus shouted against the ceiling.

Sampson pushed up to speak. "Is that what that was? Maybe it can't bear the weight of all this water!"

Celcus yelled back, "We have to go!"

There was nothing left to do. We'd tried. They began swimming back, and I started to join themuntil an unhappy fury blazed forth from my heart. No. Not like this.

Swimming back down for one last try, I braced my water-laden boots again. There were no longer any yellow fingers under the edge of the door. I was alone in this

No, not alone. Of all the people I expected to see swimming my way for a futile attempt at making right that which was going wrong, Conrad approached with intent eyes. He put his feet down, nodded at me, and then gripped the edge of the door alongside. Perhaps his genetically enhanced strength, as he had put it, would be the edge needed.

Seeing our fingers, a dozen yellow hands slid under near ours to join in the final attempt. Or, no, I knew: they had no more air inside. This was a desperation move for them.

All of them. I would use all of their strengths, and those of my family. We would all lift together. I pulled up as hard as I could, removing all limits of self-preservation inherent in my tendons and ligaments. Break my back, care not, just *open this door!* The fire in my chest raged at this inadequate treatment of the innocent. I had instinctively decided, upon hearing Larry's take on things, that only a fair and just God-force deserved our faith. This was not fair or just. This was cynical and callous, and I would not accept it. My fingers shook with blue heat; my limbs channeled flame. Beside me, I was aware of Conrad's thick muscles straining mightilyyes, fool king, I believe even in you for this one moment. As he had said: not like this.

Something heavy broke nearby, and the door rose with force and slammed up and out of sight. A rush of equalizing waters pushed the Yngtaks out among us; they stared in amazement as they realized only two of us were on the other side. Hundreds of yellow forms floated beyond them, and most of them began swimming our way. Overcome with adrenaline, I swam down the hall, came up for air, gasped in hot steam, and then went back for those few unmoving bodies.

I carried the first through a long head-pounding swim and dragged her up on the ramp before Larry stopped me with a hand. "She had already died of thirst. None of us drowned, ally."

Staring in shock at the body before me, I just tried to breathe and recover my senses. From what I'd felt, the massive door had been weight-balanced. We hadn't had to lift its countless tonswe'd only had to break whatever blockage the Yngtaks had created in their escape attempts. Still, half their number began loudly proclaiming a miracle, and by the husband of their Goddess at that, a blessed day be this, a holy day be this! I looked to Conrad, but he had not yet gotten up to bathe in their adulation as he was usually wont to do. His bedraggled gaze was on me, and his eyes were honest and relieved for the first time that I had ever seen.

I had no idea what his moment of true humanity meant, for it passed with the first prostration. As Larry won over a third of his nine hundred with insistence that they wait and understand the events, the larger portion fell to their knees and began loudly shouting and praying. The gathered human members of our centuria watched in amazement while Conrad's personal followers joined in.

Helped to my feet by Celcus and Sampson, I held each of them close. We had won three hundred new allies, but Conrad had gained double that with another 'miracle'and these citizens of theocracy had no fear of open praise and worship.

Returning on her crutches from her attempt to find the other valve, Flavia approached with masked concern. We couldn't have simply let them dienever thatbut saving these people had only made the situation worse. I stood with the three people I loved as the steam-filled hallway echoed prayers to a living man far too happy to accept all supplicants.

Only Flavia asked, and quietly: "Why's it so hot in here? That water was freezing when I left." 

Too much had happened too fast; I wasn't sure. "Someone must have turned on hot water in trying to shut it off."

She seemed to accept that, but her curious gaze shifted to me multiple times while we made our way through the prostrating crowd and out of that fateful hallway. I had seen that look before, but still did not know what she was thinking by it. She only stopped looking at me when we reached the ladder and her cast-clad limbs forced her to pay attention to her climb.

Cristina had used the opportunity of Conrad's absence to gather information at the central control platform, and she waved us over as we emerged from below, ignoring our soggy exhaustion. "We finally have a picture of what's going on out there. It looks like over a million soldiers are being herded toward the central world of this region."

Beside her, Caecilia looked grim as she leaned over the shoulders of our various techs that we knew and trusted. The whole duty shift was currently ours. "There are very strong patterns of military organization. Somebody is coordinating a massive offensive, whether the different squads know it or not." The techs nodded at that, but only we knew her implication: our home was manipulating the million Vanguard soldiers sent to explore the region into attacking the Enemy stronghold instead.

Celcus slopped water from his sleeves as he asked, "So what do we do?"

"For the moment, since we are caught in the same trap, the only strategy is to help," Cristina told us, her gaze on the factory floor below. "But enough bikes and guns." She patted a tech on the shoulders. "Order this place to start making aircraft. Helicopters, planes, and" She narrowed her eyes. "nuclear weapons."

"Nukes?" Sampson asked, mortified. I couldn't say I disagreed with his reaction.

"Go for the throat," Cristina told him, and I saw the fires of war in her again, hotter even than that night in the caves. "We have to end this as soon as possible. No giving the Enemy time to react and adapt, and no giving the power struggle here time to fester."

"Yes ma'am," the technician said, responding to her initial order with some trepidation. Below, the automated assembly line began constructing the outer shell of a nuclear bomb.

Cristina turned to face us fully. "Go rest and prepare. The people pulling the strings of this offensive are already on the ground and moving things forward. They've made unlikely tenuous alliances with other trapped entities and races that are normally enemies, so they're not going to wait for things to fall into place. It's going to be messy and chaotic. We'll need to leave here with very little warning, and, when we do, the fight will be upon us."

A warning beep began sounding from one of the consoles to our right, and she turned to her left to investigate. After a moment's glare at the monitor, she added, "Jesus. This says Her Glory the Machine Empress of Mankind is resurrecting inside the very fortress we're about to attack. *Why now?*" After a long and disbelieving sigh, she said, "Well, there's our schedule, then. Tighter and more horrifying time limits with each passing nightmare."

As the Yngtaks who had sided with Larry's skepticism began emerging from the basement levels, I felt a resurgence of energy. Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia stood taller as I did. "We'll be ready."

Fury tainted my blue fire red, but I couldn't spare time for an epithet cast his way. Sweaty backs pressed into me like a wall of flesh, and I screamed for room to operate the drill, but they couldn't hear me over the constant firing of rifles and pistols. Some were now aimed directly overhead and to the side to destroy spheres that were emerging from the facility itself beyond. Flavia took out one that had approached my head; I couldn't spare my attention for anything but the drilling.

Suddenly, the tool shot forward, and I pulled it back to examine the finger-length hole I made through the metal. I'd actually gotten through!

One of the men trying to hack the panel saw and shouted, "Again! Again!"

Heart threatening to rip right out of my chest, I applied the drill slightly to the side, hoping to widen the hole. How long would this take? Did we even have enough time? The ammo

My natural sense of our ammunition count had been right on the mark. Explosive shots became clicks, and the roar slowly died down as our centuria's guns turned into nothing more than melee weapons. The first spheres began getting through despite hand-to-hand assaults, and I winced as the first scream of pain followed.

There was no way I would drill a large enough hole in time.

But I would *not* give up.

Eyes misting as I focused on my job, I spared enough attention for one question asked without looking, "What's your way out of this, Conrad?"

Still being narrowly missed by drills on every side, he laughed. "You're not really interested, are you? After all, you raced me just yesterday, and you seemed pretty serious about putting me in my place."

I turned my head and looked him in his unconcerned eyes. "What *is it?* Tell me!"

More screams rang out, these mixed with anguish, and I knew that someone had died. There were no more gunshots, only footfalls on grating and the sounds of metal on metal as soldiers fought with their guns like clubs.

Just behind me, Trajan roared in pain; a transmorphic blade had speared him through the thigh in the same place as twice before. He raised a fist in disbelief, giving humor to us instead of anguish as his way of de-fanging the fear of our coming deaths. "*Why?*"

Flavia took a hit from a blunt attack to the helmet; what might have been laughter at Trajan's dark humor turned to desperation inside my chest. "Tell me!"

Conrad finally stopped leaning on the wall and came over. "It's simple, really. You want out of this?"

I nodded.

"You *really* want out of this?"

"**Conrad!**" I screamed as Celcus was stabbed through the arm. "If you have a way to save us, tell us!"

"Like I said, it's simple." He shrugged. "Just pray."

My heart fell like a stone. "What."

He looked around at the pressed crowd who were now too cramped to fight. What had become a last hall of defense was now a meat grinder; we would be systematically killed while our own panic held us in place. Those closest watched us, and a few of his followers looked on for some form of salvation. He glanced to them, and then to me. "In front of all these people, pray."

I had never been more coldly furious. "Pray? That's your way out?"

"Hmm." He touched a finger to his chin. "If I recall the stories I've heard, you've been in this exact situation before, during the siege of your home city. The spheres had you then, too, and nothing saved you but a series of lucky circumstances."

Wait. I looked to Cristina as she fought the press. She'd told me about this. "That'sthat's just survivor bias," I countered. "Of course a series of lucky circumstances brought me here. *Billions died.* They weren't so lucky, so they're not here."

"True." He pushed his lips forward briefly as he thought. "*Or*, God chose you to be here. Maybe this is part of his plan. That's what he's telling me."

"You can't be serious!" I shouted over the screams.

"Oh, I am." He looked out across the mayhem. "Existencelife itselfis very much like these spheres. Like a machine. It does not grow tired. You cannot hack it into submission. You cannot shoot it until it dies, and there's no negotiation or bargaining. It will grind you down until you have nothing left, no matter how skilled or capable you areand then it will have you." He leaned close and put a hand on my drill. "Pray, Venita, for a higher power is the only thing that can save you here."

I wasn't sure when the mist in my eyes had become full tears, but I looked away from him as I heard Septus shout in anger and pain. He was at the front of the morass, and, despite multiple slashes and stabs, had refused to go down. My family had helped each other greatly moment by moment, but our strengths and strategies were at an end, and I was about to lose them. I hated Conrad so much, but there was nothing left to do. In front of his followers and others who had not yet been convinced, I closed my eyes and breathed, "Help us."

"Who?" Conrad asked.

"Not *you.*"

"Yes, who?"

I swallowed bitter anger. "God..."

"Say it."

"God... *help us.*"

His watchers began clasping their hands and rocking back and forth in hope, but I just felt dirty and used; violated.

Carefully, Conrad took my hand and placed it on the hanging but still-connected panel. A beep followed, the light turned green, the door slid openand the spheres suddenly withdrew, leaving us in stunned silence.

"See?" he said with cheer. "All you had to do was ask."

I remained kneeled on the uncomfortable grating, burning with fury and embarrassment and doubt while dozens laughed and yelled and danced and clasped each other. Half that number fell to their knees as well and shouted praises. They were good people, smart people, strong peopleand yet

Cristina came and helped me up. "It's alright," she told me quietly. "It's alright."

But it wasn't. We had taken the factory somehow in some mind-boggling sequence of events whose import I still didn't understand; we had survived the black day, and my beloveds were sorely wounded but aliveso why did I feel so dark?

We bought ourselves a full six minutes as our pursuers grew closer and closer. When we were finally forced to increase our speed, the hundred spheres acknowledged their inability to catch up. Ahead, a thousand descended to block our way.

Too late.

There was no way to anticipate what form the factory would take, but we found a massive cave opening at the proper location and followed its downward slope at great speed as the eleven hundred spheres above and behind us spiraled into a swarm to follow. As the walls narrowed somewhat, our lead grew, and we put a full minute between us and our pursuers by the time we reached the high underground metal wall and sealed gate that stood as proof of our destination.

Caecilia waved the demolition team forward, and they began placing the entirety of our centuria's explosives at key points along the smooth chrome door. About twice the height of a person, it was imposing and ancient, but even it would not withstand what was coming. To its right, a panel with a red light on it and a dark rectangle asked for access; a few placed their hands on it, but it just beeped angrily and refused entry as expected.

At our Centurion's behest, Conrad sauntered over and tried his hand, but it denied him. "Not here," he explained. "I need to be at the central computers to put in the proper codes."

"Didn't think it'd be so easy," Caecilia said with a nod before ordering us forward to defend the narrow entrance to the wider cave area in front of the gate. Behind us, the chrome walls ran straight into the rock, so, while there was no escape, there would also be no assault from the rear.

I took up position among my beloveds as we moved mid-sized rocks in place for cover and readied our rifles. Most of the Vanguard only had pistols, but a hundred weapons would be enough.

"Choose your targets well!" Larentia reminded us. "Make every shot count!"

We were on the far left, and I glanced right to take in a hundred scared but resolute visored faces. These were good people. They would not let us down.

The spheres came into sight up the long tunnel, but we waited. I shivered with a flashback to the siege of my home when we had waited at that rift to defend against an unstoppable number of these things, but we had prevailed then, and we would prevail now. I caught Flavia's glance, and we nodded at each other. On my other side, Celcus took the first shot. I snapped my sight forward to see the foremost sphere fall and spark.

It was good that we had our helmets on. Others had stuffed material in their ears, and the foresight proved fruitful. The noise of a hundred weapons firing off in a cave was literally deafening. The first layer of spheres exploded like so many bursts of flak, and I estimated a good sixty or more had been taken down. A sixty percent hit rate was astonishingly good given the circumstances, but, then again, it was very difficult to miss a swarm that could block out the sun.

Aiming down my sights, I shook with the kickback from semi-automatic fire, but I kept my aim true. Ten fellmy dueand I switched to single fire to delve into excess. A hundred of us, a thousand of them, and most of our gunners hit their goals. The path upward lay cluttered with sparking and smoking components both mechanical and biological.

"That was easy!" someone shouted.

Others began to cheer.

"Shut up!" Caecilia countered. "The next wave will be ten thousand. We haven't won anything at all." Ordering us over to the other side of our rock barriers, she gave a decisive hand motion, and the demolition team joined us just before detonation.

The explosion rocked the cavern and sent dust and bits of rock tumbling. We waited, full of heat and the desire to run, until the overhead danger passed.  A molten hole had been blown in the ancient technological gate, and we poured through this on foot as we had poured through the black rift on wheels.

Backing up her commanding officer, Larentia told us, "Stay alert. Danger's not over."

Conrad seemed to be out for a stroll. Walking after us rather than running, he called forward, "There are no traps inside these places. That would be silly. Forget one part of the design and you'd kill yourself accidentally."

That reassured some of us, but I chose to peer through the smoke from the explosion and study what I could of the smooth chrome walls and grated floor. This was very similar to the medical facility at which we'd found our Imperator, but there was something a little grittier and dirtier about it. The long hallway took us a two minute run deeper; we came to a stop at a door at the end that presented the same red light and dark square. This door was lighter than the initial gate, but still solid metal.

"There are *two* gates?" someone asked desperately. "What do we do now?"

"We've used all our explosives!"

Conrad took a jolly walk over and pressed his hand on the dark squarebut it beeped red. He seemed dismayed, but only slightly so. "Huh. Interesting turn."

Sparing time only for a glare, Caecilia ordered us to take positions along the tunnel. "We have to hold off the next wave while we think of something. Forget ammo concerns. Fire at will when they appear."

"Does anyone have a laptop?" Cristina asked, coming over to me. "Computer gear, anything?"

Two volunteers came forward and unloaded their packs. Both reminded me of members of the engineering caste back home. "What's your plan, Casey?" one asked, addressing her by her fake name.

"One of you try to interface with that door panel." The man in question ran back to attempt it. Cristina waved me closer and told me, "Order that multi-tool of yours into something that can connect to this cable."

Not everyone knew I had a transmorphic brace, so I looked around awkwardly as it moved down around my gloved hand and changed shape into something that looked like a small laptop. The other tech guy took this in stride as pistol shots began firing off further down the tunnel; clicking his cable in and loading up something on his computer, he began murmuring.

Sampson glanced my way, understanding some of what we were trying to do, but his gun was needed to stave off the spheres. Caecilia, too, entrusted us to undertake this task. Her orders were focused on defense of the hole in the forward gate.

"Alright," Cristina said, looking over the tech guy's shoulder. "This multi-tool used to be a sphere. There's got to be some sort of collective control system at work here. Can you access it?"

"I'll try." He began entering commands and trying security cracking programs at too great a speed for me to understand. I could only sit with the device and continually will it to help us if it could.

Conrad drifted over and alternately smiled, grimaced, and nodded. As the firing down the hallway became more intense, he offered, "It's not going to work, you know."

Cristina said nothing. As she had told me, the less he knew about us, the better.

The tech guy looked up. "Why's that?"

"All this was built by the Machine Empress of Mankind," he explained casually. "A technological reality bender. There's a good chance the code operating the mechanical parts of those spheres doesn't even fully follow real logic."

"Shit." He peered at some of the readouts on his computer. "Are you saying the system can't be hacked?"

"There's only one way out of this, and it's not that." Conrad shrugged. "But keep trying, boy." He wandered off toward the tech crackers at the door.

Our tech guy looked to us in askance. "Boy? I'm thirty."

Cristina shook her head. "Yeah? Well he's a thousand." She studied our enigmatic opponent and then nudged me back. "Leave the device. Go ask Conrad what he means by one way out of this. He has a special interest in you. Maybe he'll reveal some secret way in that he's been holding back."

That made sense to me. There was a definite chance he was keeping something to himself to benefit his unknown agenda. As the full force of the hundred guns ahead of us began filling the long chrome hallway with noise, I retreated to the door, where Conrad stood watching their efforts inside the open panel with amusement.

There was no way to be subtle about it. "What's your one way out of this?" I asked, wary.

Conrad chuckled the request off. "You wouldn't be interested. You like your guns and your fighting and your heroism."

His answer put me off guard. What? I didn't *like* this, it was just all I had ever been allowed to know. Or did I like it? Did I enjoy the thrill of competition and feeling capable and strong and part of a skilled unit? Part of that did play into the love I felt, I knew.

A press of bodies surrounded us as our gunners fell back. We had gradually lost the advantage at the small hole our explosives had made, and now the tunnel ahead was filled with black. Worse, drills began emerging from the chrome above and to the sides. The spheres were boring in right through the outer walls of their own factory to get to us!

Rushing back to Cristina and the multi-tool, I asked, "Any progress? Is it possible?"

The tech guy sighed. "It only receives commands. It doesn't send them. There's nothing there that can help."

Taking the tool back and willing it into a new shape, I ran to the door again with Cristina close behind.

"What's your plan?" she shouted.

Activating the newly formed drill with a thought and applying it to the metal of the door, I yelled back, "If the spheres can get through this metal, then so can I!"

Leaning casually against the wall amid two screeching drills that had both barely missed him, Conrad said, "That's very creative. You might actually make it in time. I'm impressed."

With the matter of command settled in what everyone else thought was a friendly manner, Caecilia went about preparing our daring assault. I was ordered to sit the night out and recover, and, for once, I didn't argue. Something had happened to me out there, or had been happening all along. Standing alone beyond a few low hills, I let the chill night air flow over me while the blue fire within kept me warm.

Hands forward, I did my daily stances and practice, but something felt more variable about every motion. I could strike faster if I thought of Porcia, or harder if I thought of Sampson. The flames in my nerves energized me with the excitement of being my true self. I no longer had to live by other people's rules, and I was able to express all the irrepressible love I felt. In a strange way, I was like Conrad. I, too, was *excited.* Rather than just operating for duty, I wanted to see what would happen next.

Also in a strange way, that made the risk of death in the coming mission suddenly real. As I'd been taught, I had always accepted it as a possibility, but now the stakes actually mattered. When Tacitus, Rufus, and Porcia had died, we had hardly mourned. It was just a thing that happened to people. But now, with all this talk of afterlives and worthiness, a seed of doubt and terror had been planted in me.

Was this why our family was vulnerable to Conrad's claims? Was he promising to take away that doubt and terror?

I needed to be better. I needed to be faster. I needed to be stronger. These things I had been given by my brothers and sisters in arms, but I needed to take those gifts and hone them. I donned my arm brace and the transmorphic multi-tool and practiced until exactly seven hours from the start of the mission.

Waking instantly among my family at the appointed time, I popped up and climbed on my bike at the last moment. The eighty we had met with had suffered some losses and had taken great pains to keep their extra bikes. These we had been given at Caecilia's order to even out the weight of those that had borne us, and radio-equipped helmets had been spread out to enable communication. Flavia rode tandem with Sampson, who could best bear the weight of her until her limbs healed, but the rest of us had individual vehicles. This was good. Greater mobility would increase our likelihood of survival.

My hand trembled as we led the ride out.

No.

Not fear. Enthusiasm. I would enjoy being alive and loving and being loved and being part of a family for as long as I could, and if I died, or if they died, so be it.

My hand stilled.

Our long line of roaring bikes poured into that open maw and the blackness came over me like a tide rushing in through the visor of my helmet. A single glance backwards showed a torn hole of light glowing on a distant canvas of darkness. I looked twice until I managed to see it close. Yeah. Trap. If we had not expected this and created a solid plan, fear might have gotten through my armor once more. There was no way back, and we were committed now.

From the rift, we'd seen that the ground was bare rock, but riding along lifeless stone in pitch darkness gave me an eerie feeling. This was a bit like the amethyst spawning grounds we had once crossed, but not even crystals grew here. It was cold, too, right through my jacket, but not like the heralds of winter on recent night breezes. This was the chill not even of death, but of lifelessness. Did this Earth not have a sun? I could not ask, for we were under radio silence until Enemy contact was made.

But the Enemy was nowhere in sight. The headlamps of our hundred-odd bikes held a lance of light ahead of us in the alien darkness, revealing nothing but rock and void as we sped toward the supposed location of the factory. Where were the mechanically augmented animals that often exploded five seconds after death? Where were the horrific transmorphic spheres that wanted to drill into our brains for information? Where were the weird growing towers and roots of the cybernetic subterranean network?

It occurred to me that the Enemy could deal with us simply by sealing us off inside a lifeless Earth with no food and no water. It didn't have to fight us at all. What a nightmare! We would slowly starve here, eating our supplies, then the dead, and then the living. But could the Enemy possibly be that creative?

No. The truth was even worse. To my right, Flavia pointed high; the hundred riders behind us also saw it: a beam of golden morning light angled across the distant landscape, beautiful and akin to the new word *holy* that we had learned. It cut through from the lit sky above like a break in the clouds, but these were no clouds. We were halfway to the factory when the truth of our situation literally dawned upon us.

To their credit, the Vanguard riders kept radio silence as ordered, although I could see some of them panicking and being comforted by fellow riders with carefully placed hands on shoulders and backs. Of all the people I loved, none were fearless, for fighting without fear was both impossible and stupid, but I did sorely wish I could channel away the animal panic clawing in my ribcage. All I could do was share the real courage of those riding beside me. Lit by a hundred beams of randomly cast white, we were a bubble of light in the void. My teammates grasped wrists as we rode, and a single glance from Cristina from behind her open visor reassured me that we would get through this.

The sunbeam from on high disappeared as quickly as it had come, and we were once again riding through unbroken void. Now, though, we understood why: the open sky was completely filled with layer upon layer upon layer of transmorphic spheres, enough to block out the sun and render this world lifeless. Thus was the insanity of machines, to produce and produce and produce without end simply by algorithm; the spheres wanted to recharge from solar energy, and thus they crowded each other ever higher; the factory had no one to turn it off, so it just kept crafting and welding and releasing.

The spheres at the bottom of the black sky had the least charge, most likely, and that was the only reason we hadn't yet been noticed and instantly destroyedbut one approached ahead, directly in our path.

Radio silence ended in shouting panic as it flew over us and settled down over one rider to grip him and attempt to drill through his helmet. Others drew their pistols and aimed, but Caecilia calmly ordered, "We planned for this. Do not prematurely destroy it. Wait until the last moment, because every second counts."

I knew the Vanguard's claim that they were the best of the best the Empire had was true when they stilled their pistols and waited while the sphere began working its way through their comrade's helmet. Even in terror, they understood what we had told themwith proper obfuscation about when and where it had happened, of course. These agravitational machines were controlled by a methodical distant artificial intelligence that followed careful patterns of analysis. The black sky would not simply descend and murder us immediately. No, the spheres would come in growing waves as it gathered information about us.

We were already pushing the engines to their top speed. Some of the bikes had some sort of turbo fuel, but we couldn't dare separate. There was nothing to do but put faith in the plan. To my far right, I saw Conrad looking on with anticipation.

The assaulted man grunted in pain once his helmet finally gave way. Pistol shots rang out, and the sphere above him shattered and fell. A short count of seconds later, ten spheres descended in our path. Having failed the drilling attempt, these began to stab directly at us with extending spears of black metal. This, too, was as we'd guessed, and the men were ready to shoot them down. Ammo was precious, so the closest took care of their own threats.

The moment the last ruptured, a hundred spheres appeared before us.

"Now!" Caecilia ordered. Our centuria split in two as practiced after the race, and I reveled in being back as part of a team acting as one. Like the tournaments and missions before this, I was most at home as part of a larger whole.

The dark centuria did not anticipate the movements of our bright one, and we reformed past them as they fruitlessly tried to catch up. As we'd hoped, this stage of the assault would not progress until the hundred spheres had found resolution. Instead of racing ahead at top speed, we kept pace barely ahead of them, slowly and purposely giving ground so that their controller would see progresshowever slightrather than a failure of its group to reach us.

Initially, I thought I was dying. I'd been hit by a truck during the night, or perhaps I'd fallen down a crack in the earth and bruised every bone in my body. Or had I been poisoned? One vomit was not nearly enough. My head hurt, my vision swam, and the embers of last night's fire were painfully bright. Bodies littered the cave at riotous angles. Had we been attacked? No. I'd seen this in a movie about a politician caste member. No! This wasa *hangover!*

Was it potentially lethal? What had that character done about it? I remembered a coffee and painkillers; fighting down panic and dizziness, I found my backpack in the orange gloom and fished out the only supplies that might fit the bill. Okay, Venita, stagger forward. Find fresh air. You can do this.

One of the many cave mouths opened out onto a high hillside mostly shielded from sight by dense brush and scattered groves of evergreen trees. From here, the world couldn't see me, but I could see the world. Dawn was a greyish-blue tone over sleeping plains beyond our ridge; I breathed in chilly air and, for a moment, felt a little bit better now that I could orient myself. I cracked open the last soda in existence that Celcus had given me and I downed one of Flavia's painkillers with a sigh. What exactly had I done last night? I

Oh no.

Every nerve in body stung with alarm as the memories came flooding back. Celcus, Flavia, SampsonI'd spoken the terrible secrets that had been swelling behind the dam of my heart 'til those thoughts had broken from me and burst forth. I gave an audible groan out a dry throat and put my head in my hands as I realized I'd told sixty percent of my team that I loved them.

Memories of my life before this were no help. I was increasingly beginning to think of myself as separate from an enforced system that had been all around me back home; I was still a product of Amber Three's culture, but its holes and flaws were becoming more apparent with each new experience I had outside of it. In every story I'd read or show I'd watched, men competed for women and each individual woman had to choose one in the end. These decisions had been engaging, deep, and endearing when I'd watched them, and I'd always thought I'd already made my choice in Sampsonand then, later, in Celcus. Those of the military caste paired off and had children. Creating new units and teams was one of our primary duties. I had never really questioned that.

How could I choose? On television, one suitor eventually proved himself the victor while the others displayed latent cowardice or disloyalty, thus making the choice suddenly fall into place. It had often come down to simple little things as wellI stared down at the open can of soda in my hand. Celcus had given me this. Did that make him the superior choice?

But Sampson had been my first love, and had played all the online war games with me that nobody else around me understood. I'd had an entire online life in lieu of real parents or friends, and I felt that he knew me more than anyone else. My brothers and sisters in arms knew vaguely of my past, but they didn't *understand.* They hadn't *been there* on sleepless nights alone in the dark; alone except for an awkward holographic teenage boy from another world telling me that everything would be alrightand awkward no more, really, with those arms, those shoulders, that strong jaw

I shook my head to focus, but immediately suffered the consequences. No movement, Venita. Just sit still. Breathe.

The dizziness passed over the course of several seconds.

Celcus knew the current me, Samspon knew the past me, and FlaviaI sipped what healing soda I could as I stared wide-eyed at the brightening horizon. Military caste members were supposed to pair off and create family units. I had never even *seen* this concept, never *heard* of this possibility, except as whispered rumors about certain soldiers that had been dishonorably discharged. I hadn't even understood my own feelings untilwell, no, I still didn't understand them. Through all the blurred memories from the night before, her sudden kiss stood out the most. Was she even *allowed* to do that sort of thing?

And by whose rules shouldn't she be allowed?

Outside Amber Three, who were we? There was nobody in charge, no grand hierarchy, and no mission beyond surviving the coming war so we could go home.

Just as the fear in me reached dark terror at what my actions might have done to my family, I sensed them behind me. At exactly the moment I needed them, they were all there. Septus groaned and sat on the rock to my left; Celcus, Sampson, and Flavia each clasped my shoulder in turn and then reclined in hungover pain to watch the sun rise with me.

Nobody said a word. It was the Time of Sickness all over again, in which we had all found comfortable silence together, but there was no chance of death in this shared painjust humor. I could only manage slight turns of my head against sudden bouts of nausea, but I managed to look each of them in the eyes to ask the unaskable, and they told me with weary smiles that they would not hate me or resent me for what I'd said and done the night before. Thanks to them, I was no longer afraid.

Too, for the first timeand this I realized at that exact moment as the sun flared forth and made us all turn away and moan and groanI was no longer hidden. I was no longer apart.

I was no longer alone.

Eventually that morning of peace ended as Caecilia found us and swept us up and back to the others for the day's ride, but part of me would always remain centered in that brightening silent calm. The dark movie theater from my childhood had become lesser and more distant. I was less that abandoned child and more someone new.

After grabbing my gear, I left the empty can of soda on the rock floor where we had slept. On this uninhabited Earth in this high secluded cave system it would likely go a million years undisturbed, and I liked the thought of it as a marker that we had *been there*.

When I crossed paths with her on the way to the bikes, Cristina knew instantly that I was sick from the alcohol the night before. "First time drinking?" she asked.

My nod was pained and slight.

She made a noise of amusement. "Well, that's the price to be paid. Drink plenty of water, and remember this next time."

"No," I croaked, immediately overcome by revulsion. "I am *never* drinking again."

Her laugh was kind, and tinted with nostalgia. "I've heard that one before."

"Really!" I insisted as I winced and tried to keep up with her.

She just kept laughing as she outpaced me, and I promised myself to remember the pain of hangover rather than the blazing fun and dancing and truth-speaking the next time someone offered me alcohol. Or, at the very least, I would stick close to her if I did drink again. Her presence somehow made me feel safer. She had a certain composure and knowledge about her that

"Wait!" I shouted after her.

She slowed.

Catching up to her, I asked, "Your husband's alive? You said that last night, right?"

Her smile and humor faded. In its place dropped an expression I fully recognized: strategic focus. "I'm glad you know, so that I have somebody to share it with, but it's important you keep that to yourself." She took me by the arm and led me to one of the alternate cave mouths. Looking down upon our gear and bike staging area, she indicated the handful of men and women getting ready around Conrad. "I can tell you nowthat's going to become a very big problem. The less he knows about any of us, the better."

"Conrad?" I asked, slightly confused. "Did he do something?"

"Not yet," she said quietly, her eyes scanning the interactions below. "Not exactly. But I've learned in my time that immortality eats away at the things that make us human." A slight glint of moisture appeared above her lower eyelids. "When I told the people of my worldthe First Worldthat our planet was about to be destroyed, you know what they did?"

I gaped at her in awe. I wanted to ask a thousand questions about the glorious heart of the Empire, but my own strategic focus took precedent. "What did they do?"

They were exultant that death would finally come for them. Her studying gaze became a glare as she scrutinized the distant immortal below. "They threw a goddamn party in the streets."

The horrible inversion of courage that must have been required for such a reaction abhorred and shocked me to my core, but then I grabbed my cheeks for another reason. *God!* She'd told me many things about the unknown questions of the universe, but it was all a drunken blur after the second and third cups of poison swill. Now was not the time to ask her to repeat herself, but my thoughts raced with questions and possibilities. It seemed that every single thing was in fluxmy home, my family, my relationships, my heart, and even my understanding of existencebut all I could feel was soaring freedom at the chance to discover the things I wanted for myself.

That day's ride was a slow one, for many of the Vanguard members had gottenas they called it*equally sloshed*. We only collectively began feeling better about an hour before contact was made by radio and our thirty-odd riders changed course to meet up with another eighty. Suddenly, our little fusion gang became a full centuria, and the random wildlife of the multiverse feared us rather than fought us. Per our training, we made sure not to get overconfident, but the difference in Earth-by-Earth danger between riding with ten and riding with a hundred was stark.

That soon became small comfort. The real threat was not from any individual random Earth. The first rift we found that space had somehow healed over was an anomaly; the second translucent scab wound on the fabric of existence was a clear indicator that our trap was growing tighter. We hadn't been able to go backwards for quite some time, and now rifts to either side were closing even as we approached them. The Enemy was bidding us closer, and the time for battle was nigh.

Flavia had a suspicion that this tactic had been developed in response to our world's Dimensional Rotation. We stood talking quietly as our hundred and sixteen set up camp for the day just out of sight of the only rift forward: a gaping black maw with irregular torn space for teeth. Nothing but void could be seen on the other side, and it was obvious our next step would take us into a proper trap.

"We Rotated," Flavia whispered, telling myself, Celcus, Sampson, Septus, and Caecilia while Cristina and Noah listened from nearby. "There's a good chance the Enemy doesnt know exactly what we did, but it doesn't need to. If it corrals all our mobile forces and forces them into killing zones"

"we'll fall just like its spheres did when their connection was severed," Celcus said, voicing our collective understanding. "We're being cut off from our source in kind."

Flavia grimaced and leaned on her crutch to shift weight from her broken leg. "What's our map say?"

Caecilia glanced around to make sure none of the Vanguard were nearby. "The black rift leads to a symbol similar to the one at which we found Conrad, but with industrial connotations rather than medical. I think we can assume it contains a factory of some sort. We have to avoid it if we can."

It felt wrong to be fearful and creep about rather than fight. I looked to Cristina.

She responded to my unspoken prompt as the others followed my gaze. "What you have here is a reactive Enemy. It has limited creativity, and so farfrom what you sayhas followed careful tactical analysis processes at each encounter." She paused and waited for our leader's reaction.

Appreciating the gesture, Caecilia nodded for her to continue.

Cristina took a deep breath and gazed off in the direction of the black rift. "It may have overwhelming resources and control of this entire region, but it still has a major weakness in its own reactivity. It won't have forces mustered in the proper places, and it won't be ready for surprising contingencies."

Flavia suggested, "So we run when we should fight, and fight when we should run?"

"Exactly." Still looking at the distance, Cristina flashed a rather dark smile. "Charge in there and blow right through the trap. You say there's a factory? I say we smash down the doors and seize control of it."

Caecilia and Flavia exchanged glances, and together asked, "Is that even possible?"

Sampson pointed back the way we had come, and I could sense his thoughts were on the games and computer knowledge he and I had shared in our youth. "Conrad's medical facility serviced us. It just seems to be a matter of authorization."

"So we get Conrad there, and the factory will work for us?" Celcus asked. "I don't know if I trust him as the keystone to a bold offensive. He's, uh"

"Random," Septus commented. "Even volatile."

At that, I studied Cristina's face. She said nothing, but I could tell she was thinking the same thing as I was: Conrad put on an air of randomness, but there was something calculating behind his grin. In the last day his personal cadre had grown to fourteen people after his tales and confident persona had won over a few of the newcomers. I had to wonder what he was saying to thembut I did not have to wonder for long.

Trajan, Paulinus, and Larentia approached with ashen faces.

Caecilia pulled them quickly into our group. "What's wrong?"

Trajan glanced to his teammates and then told us: "It's Conrad. He says he knows about things. Important things. Says there's an entity called *God*"

I froze.

"it's very powerful, it sees all, and it *judges us after we die.*"

Discipline failed as we all began talking over one another.

"What?"

"What's that mean?"

"How could he possibly know that?"

Paulinus continued for his brother in arms. "He says there's a whole afterlifetwo, in fact. One for good people, and one for bad."

Memories of Cristina's answers to my questions burst forth in my brain. I stepped forward, full of the same confusion and shock. "What makes a good person or a bad person?"

"He didn't say exactly," Paulinus responded, eyes still wide. "Not yet. He says that he's a speaker for this God thing, that he was given a divine right to lead a thousand years ago and that morality is complex and requires interpretation."

Cristina kept a neutral expression. "*His* interpretation?"

While Paulinus nodded, Larentia countered, "He *is* a thousand years old. He *did* build our worlds. He was literally the creator of our Amber societies."

"You built the Amber Worlds," Cristina told her flatly. "Your ancestors. He just happened to be Holy Roman Emperor at the time."

"Holy?" she asked. "That's a word he used. We were only ever told that he was Roman Emperor without that extra word on the frontbut apparently he was also a leader for something called a *religion?*"

My blood ran cold at that word that Noah had once shied away from explaining. He stood watching us now with deep concern. I could tell this was exactly what he had feared unleashing among us by trying to explain concepts we had never encountered before.

"Millions of people believe this," Larentia continued. "The Vanguard men and women from the Empire already knew about it. A bunch of them confirmed everything he's saying. They say its thousands of years old, even older than Conrad. Why haven't we ever heard about this before?"

Flavia put up both her hands. "Come on. We can't be questioning ourselves right now. It's not the time!"

"Now *is* the time if we're about to risk our lives! What if we die and end up in the bad place because we didn't follow the rules? Conrad says you can only go to the good place if"

"Conrad says?" Caecilia interrupted. "That man has been *unstable* ever since we found him lying in a hospital bed and staring up at the ceiling. Why should we listen to anything he says?"

Larentia looked to her right, and Paulinus took the lead by saying, "*What if he's right?* The stakes are too high not to talk about this!" He stared down at his hands. "All my life I've tried to do the right thing by duty and by our people, but lately I've had no idea what to say or do because black and white were luxuries afforded only by the safety of civilization. Out here, all we've found are shades of grey."

"And you think *he's* the one to guide you through the grey?" Caecilia demanded, equally angry and scared because of this sudden change in her family.

I didn't know what to tell them, but I did have something to add. "Legate Yellow and her organization controlled the media we saw. I'm certain they've heavily edited our culture, both to militarize us and to avoid any mentions of this religion thing."

Caecilia's Dangerous Four all looked at me in surprise. For a moment, I had their attention.

"I've been wondering these same things, asking these same questions," I continued, desperate to share with them. "I don't know if what's out there is Fate or Luck or Chance or this God thing, but someone I trust" I glanced at Cristina without thinking. "told me that religion has been used to *control people* for thousands of years. Beliefs about life and death do involve legitimate questions and real faith, but that doesn't mean we should blindly follow orders based on that faith."

"I'm not saying anything about blind obedience," Paulinus said unhappily, following my gaze to glance at Cristina himself. "I just want to hear more of what he has to say."

Is that all? Caecilia asked, both concerned and relieved. Is that really all?

Yes.

For a moment, it sounded like the issue had reached a tentative conclusion, but Septus stepped closer under the afternoon sun. Which one of these afterlives would Porcia be in? Could I potentially see her again?

The uncertainty had spread to my own team like a virus, and I suddenly found myself as distraught as Caecilia. There was nothing we could do, either. They had a right to ask these questions just as I had asked them. I feared that my family would be taken advantage of by Conrad because they had not been processing these new concepts as long as I had, and because they did not have the inoculation Cristina had given me by telling me all about the bloody history of religious warfare throughout the ages. It seemed there was great danger in religious matters intersecting with secular interests.

Septus, Larentia, Trajan, and Paulinus departed to go listen to more of Conrads message, leaving us halved and shaken.

Sampson said, Could it hurt just to listen?

I kept my three close with a personal request. Please dont. Not right now.

Flavia and Celcus nodded; Sampson considered the issue for a moment, and then decided to stay.

Caecilia had been the only member of her four present before, but now that solitude had taken on a darker meaning. Gathering the rest of us close, she asked with subtle fury, It seems we have two Enemies to face. What is Conrad thinking? Whats his aim?

I looked to Noah, but he shook his head. He couldnt sense Conrads emotions either? I found that very disturbing. He couldnt sense Conrad or anyone from the Amber Worlds except for me. What did that mean? I saw Cristina glance to him, too, and I realized that she knew about his ability to sense emotions. It made sense, as they had already known each other. What battles had they fought together? They were both taciturn people who spoke little and revealed even less.

But the rest of my companions knew nothing of those matters. He turned down command when we first found him, Flavia stated, answering the original question. Could he be gunning now for full control?

Maybe he didnt see a reason then, Celcus offered.

Sampson glared at the man in question across our camp as Conrad gave an unheard speech to several listeners. Or perhaps it was a manipulation. We are not as easily controlled as these men of the Empire.

Heart pounding, I put forth, I think were uniquely vulnerable to this angle hes found.

With an angry glare, Caecilia stated, Its time to make a move against him.

Nothing too obvious," Cristina cautioned. "Challenge the man, but dont challenge his message. That will just radicalize his followers.

Concerned, Noah agreed.

Our plan came together rather simply. Trekking across the camp together, we supported Caecilia as she claimed the attention of our centuria. There are a hundred and sixteen of us now, our blonde leader said loudly. We are comprised of fifteen or more disparate squads, and nobodys in command. We have a plan for breaking through the trap that lies on the other side of the black rift.

Good. I nodded along with her words and met the gazes of our gathered onlookers with confidence. She had said nothing about Conrad, and carefully avoided claiming specific command rights. As we expected, her offer was taken as genuine, and discussions began among a dozen and a half Captains about the proposed idea. Also as we expected, because she had put the plan forward, they were naturally focused on her as a sort of implied leader. If life on Amber Three had taught us anything, it was the particulars of how soldiers came to submit to authority.

Unfortunately, we had one major vulnerability.

Im the key to this plan? Conrad asked, listening intently as the Captains discussed. His followers stood behind him, presenting double the number we had behind Caecilia. In that case, I should probably be in command during the mission.

With all due respect, Caecilia countered politely. Weve got lifelong military backgrounds. Were very good at what we do, and we know this plan intimately.

The Vanguard members we had ridden with so far did not know we were from the Amber Worlds, but they *had* seen us effortlessly control and slaughter the dangers of the multiverse. Many lent their voices and implied votes to our cause.

Your lifelong military experience is but a fraction of my thousand years, Conrad replied, also politely. Ive led a campaign or two in my time.

Caecilia smiled graciously. Ah, but youve been dormant for quite some time. We have been actively working as a team every day since the crisis began.

He laughed with genuine excitement. That sounds like a challenge! Care for a friendly competition? He raised his arms high to stir up the crowd, and, not realizing what was at stake, the gathered travel-weary men and women began smiling and cheering.

This was the third of our expected contingencies; Cristina had warned us of this possibility. Caecilia began our response with, A shootout perhaps? A test of aim?

No, Conrad said, shrugging off the first offer. Power is not granted by guns, but by people. Something simpler, more organic is in order. Since youre claiming atrophy in me, a foot race seems appropriate. And I suppose you are claiming that any of your people are better than me?

We hadnt expected that turn. Hed regained the initiative. Caecilia said carefully, Not so crass, but I have full faith in all of my brothers and sisters in arms.
 
Then I challenge He scanned us and settled on Flavia for a moment, but I could tell that choosing the girl with the broken arm and broken leg would only make him look absurd in front of his followers. There was one other equally battered and wounded, but my wounds were not so obvious to people that had not seen them happen. Venita. Up for a race?

I couldnt exactly turn him down after all the moves we had made, and my legs were actually the only part of me that had not been broken, slashed, kicked, or battered. All eyes turned on me, including those of Septus, Trajan, Larentia, and Paulinus, who now stood in the crowd halfway between Conrad and Caecilia. My family was on the line; Flavia, Celcus, and Sampson stood taller behind me, and I knew that I could do it. Draw up the course.

His grin was wide and his eyes gleamed. Cristina had told me what the word Demon meant, and, in that moment cast bright by afternoon sunlight and made chill by a breeze moving stray red hairs past my vision, Conrad looked to me like a creature indigenous to the bad afterlifenot in form, not winged or blackened, but with that gleeful intent to see mayhem at any cost.

They chose a route around the nearby hills. A hundred and fourteen people would stand upon high ground and watch two race along the dirt below and through one unseen length hidden by an upshot crag behind which shenanigans were expected and encouraged to occur. This would be both a race *and* a fight, thought I doubted the Vanguard watchers knew to what extent our struggle extended. A friendly shove or two, I imagine, one said. Another joked, Trip him if you can!

In contrast, Caecilia told me quietly, Killing hims off the table. We dont even know if he *can* be killed through conventional means; even if he can, he hasnt done anything traitorous yet. Lets not escalate.

Fighting down an intense bout of anticipatory nerves, I accepted her advice, stretched legs sore from days of riding, and tied my hair back as tightly as I could. We were down and out of sight of the main crowd gathering on the hill, and I realized that I was feeling something of the tournaments of old back at the academy.

Flavia tapped the therapeutic brace on my once-broken arm. Hows your bone?

I think I can survive without it for a little bit, I replied, and she helped me unclasp both the arm brace and its transmorphic mimic on my other side. Wow. Without these, I feel ten librae lighter.

Holding them up, Celcus commented, Theyre actually pretty heavy.

Sampson judged the course ahead. Every less ounce of weight matters. When I took off my outer grey clothing and pared down to just my undershirt, he turned red. I swear I didnt mean it like that.

Win at any cost, right? I kissed him on the cheek thenand gripped Celcus and Flavias hands. Imbued with their support, I took a deep breath and stepped out into view near the start line.

Conrad was already there stretching in just his grey undershirt, jeans, and boots as well; he'd had these clothes built by the machines at his facility, so I knew they were deceptively light and strong. He nodded at me in acknowledgement as the high hill erupted in shouts and cheers. I looked for Cristina, but found only Noah, who just shrugged when I asked him without words where she had gone. Was she not going to watch? Something about that absence stung, but I wasnt sure why.

The pressure of the shouts and cheers dulled all but my trained strategic senses. I focused my breathing, readying myself to race a thousand year old Emperor along a dirty gully on an unnamed Earth. Conrad raised his arms and brought out cheers from the crowd, but most of the watchers I cared about were still ascending the hill. 

To me, he said with genuine respect and a hint of arrogance, Youre not going to make this easy, are you?

What I could see of the course ahead began sussing itself out in my vision. Chunks of terrain simplified and turned into sequences of logical action. That mud was to be avoided, that flat dirt was to be sought, and stray rocks were to be given a wide berth. Had Conrad spoken? I ignored him. As Caecilia had said, he had not yet committed an unworthy or traitorous action, but his attitude alone was enough for me to deny him the respect normally deserving a competitor.

Slow it down.

Heartbeat.

Pulse pressure rushing out.

Breathe.

Pulse pressure rushing in.

Heartbeat.

Gears moved in my mind and chains of action and reaction wove together into a cohesive whole. In a single instant, I saw my entire path up to the middle blind. His path would need to be dynamically accounted for along the way, and I gave him a generous estimate between equally fast and fifty percent faster than me. If it was less than thatif I was even slightly fasterno strategy would be needed.

I sank into my starting stance. Alongside, Conrad did the same. His muscular arm formed a ninety-degree angle in the left side of my vision, hand pointed forward. I had spent much of my time with sleeves over my arm brace, so I guessed he did not know that my right arm had only recently healed from a break, but I had chosen the side that put him to my left just in case. Without the metal and accompanying gloves, my hands and arms felt exposed, but also extremely light.

Somewhere above, the excited race foreman popped off a pistol, and that first moment of automatic reaction stretched out in my awareness as both Conrad and I leapt forward. The power of his arc would have given him a small lead, but I'd expected that from his remarkably thick legs. It was the instant timing of my trained reaction speed that kept us equal in the end. Our forward boots hit the dirt at the same time and distance.

Lightning shot through me as he pulled away. I was only eighty percent as fast as I'd anticipated, perhaps due to all my injuries, but he was *sixty percent* faster than that baseline. For every span I managed, he achieved double that, reaching nearly five pedes ahead before I could reasonably react. There were no options or contingencies for dealing with such a mismatch, and the surprised shouts from the crowd on the hill rang in my ears.

What to call upon in crisis? I'd known someone so fleet of foot that she had been able to save my life at the expense of her own. Porcia the Swift, beloved by Septus, but taken too soon to see where that might have gone. You were my sister. How did you move? How did you place your feet? What color was the energy of your presence? The blue fire inside me flared like a furnace fueled, filling my hands and feet and core with her memory. A sharpness of movement grew like blades along the arcs of my limbs, and my furious gaze on Conrad's back became an unbreakable chain. Under a wave of amazed shouts, the gap between us stopped widening.

Imbued with Porcia's essence, I somehow matched Conrad's speed, but this first half of the course would not last forever, and I had only memorized the lay of what I could see. I would be forced to spend effort looking at the ground after the blind. If I was going to do something, it would have to be now.

No longer processing individual footfalls, I became aware of interlocking equations, a kind of music of motion that I had at times felt when my team and I were in perfect sync. This was the essence of Celcus, my antikin, the subtle glue that held us all together. Calm confidence and observation, perhaps a product of his great height, had always formed the basis of the capable attitude which we held during crises. I called upon a memory of him during the major tournament back at the academy in which we had all, for one glorious duration, been a single entity.

Thus I could see they were with me now. I had already been using Flavia's analytical mentality without even realizing it; the calculations, strategizing, and memorization of the course ahead had all come to me like donning a pair of sunglasses colored with her spirit. The drain of operating at nearly double physical capability was immense, but Septus' dogged determination spread through me in a surge, not to counteract the rapid exhaustion, but to make it possible to continue. Tacitus was there, too, in my silence and focus when Conrad had tried to engage and distract me. And RufusI knew you least of all, brother in arms, but you were still family. I've got your red hair as a symbol that you once lived and fought by my side.

All these spirits burned both as fuel and as fire, and the distance between myself and Conrad began to shrink as the blind approached. His nearly-shaven head glinted with sweat, and I turned as he turned, arcing around the grey crag and out of sight of the crowd.

The tilt of his head gave me warning I might not have had otherwise. The tensile strength in his legs was astounding, really, and I appreciated that even as he leapt forward, turned in the air, compressed like a spring, sloughed all of the force of his run, and sprang back at me with a kick aimed for my face. I instinctively knew he was going for a single-strike knockout given the momentum of my run into his boot, and I couldn't allow that to happen. What did I have left?

Accumulated forces, vectors, a wellspring of motion; as it did in times of absolute crisis, Time slowed to a crawl to the tune of a single high violin note, and I used my glacial eye movements to study the path of his outstretched leg and murderously angled boot. At a snail's pace, it moved toward me sole-first, cast in blue shadows by the flames inside me blazing beyond full strength. I was on fire, a being of collective determination, and, as all other paths fell away to analyzed probabilities of likely failure, I decided to take a risk. Leaping forward myself, I accelerated rather than trying to avoid the kick.

Rotation was the key. My core remained in motion along a vector toward his body, but my legs swung up rapidly, and my head swung back and down in kind, pressed upon by the sole of his boot but absorbing the force of his kick over a longer period of time than a direct impact would have allowed. Our cores met in the air, and I applied long slow energy to my arms to bring them around his body as that shrieking violin note became unbearable in pitch and I was forced to let it go.

We fell abruptly to the ground with him on the bottom. Grunting against the pain of impact, he grasped at my limbs and we moved and countermoved into what I recognized as classic grappling type three. He was our Imperator. He'd helped design that system a thousand years ago. What match could I be for him? And his strength was phenomenal. Managing to get a knee and a foot on the ground, I pushed back, but he had meuntil the blue fire in my heart flared again and I called upon the essence of my first love. Sampson's strength was mine if I wanted it, because he loved me too, and I let the blue burn in my eyes as I met Conrad's gaze and, hands gripping hands, pushed him ever so slowly backward and up.

The only emotion greater than his anger on his strained and sweaty face was his eager excitement. "*How are you doing this?*"

I remained Tacitus, silent and focused.

He rose with me and pushed back with all his raw strength, moving us to a mightily trembling standstill. "Gisela worked on me for centuries," he grunted, eyeing me like a child anxious to understand a new toy. He risked putting a foot forward, and it paid off with drastically increased pressure.

I remained Septus, dogged and unwilling to give up.

His eyes grew darker. "I represent the utmost of purely biological possibility. Genetic improvements. Muscles that never atrophy. A mind that can never fade. Tortures, all, in a waybut *you* should be nothing before *me*."

I remained Flavia, analyzing his every word, motion, and position for weaknesses. Finally, I had it: "Maybe you're not the prize you thought you were."

His laugh was both haughty and self-deprecating. "Or maybe you don't know your own strength, *girl.*" He glanced down, indicating the dry earth cracking beneath our boots.

The small amount of surprise that strangeness instilled in me gave him the edge. I stumbled and fell, and he approached with the intent to kick me while I was down. For a moment, I was back in the jade wasteland with Caecilia approaching in the same manner, and I called upon my last reserves to get up again.

But I didn't need to. Conrad slammed into the ground face-first. The back of his skull had been caved in, and Cristina stood behind him, a heavy rock in both hands. "I don't think he would have killed you," she told me, dropping the rock to help me up. "But I prefer not to take that chance."

Exhausted, but not exactly angry, I took in the sight of my Imperator's corpse. "What do we do?"

"Nothing, I suspect," she responded, kneeling to study the oddly noisy wound and its squishy sounds. "As I thought. It's already healing. Organic healing factor or nanites, I imagine. He'll be conscious shortly, so I suggest you finish this race."

My training kicked in and sent me jogging along at the fastest pace I could manage, but my thoughts were seized with the idea that Gisela's technology had *defeated Death.* What would the world look like if human beings couldn't die? There would never be another loss, never be another haunting painful absence. Was it possible? If I could somehow understand what changes had been made to Conrad to make him immortal, the risk of losing the people I loved on every single mission we went on would no longer be a thing to fear.

The crowd on the hill cheered as I approached, and then positively *shrieked* as Conrad emerged from the blind and began closing rapidly. Seeing this, I used Celcus' essence to balance those of Porcia and Septus. No more analysis: just run!

My awareness shrank to nothing but pounding footfalls forward. If a rock tripped me or a hole caught me, so be it. Gasping for air and beset by a hammering in my head, I fell. In the end, I'd stumbled over the backpack that represented the finish line. He blew past, but it was too late. Screaming and cheering people rushed around us, celebrating the upset.

Someone pointed out to him, "You've got some blood there. Everything alright?"

Conrad touched the back of his head and then grinned. "Oh, it's fine." Coming over and helping me up, he told me with sincerity, "Very good showing. Very unexpected. Very exciting. I think we're going to have some fun, you and I."

The late afternoon sun hit the exact moment of transition into evening gloom as I returned his gaze. The shadow cast over his bright eyes told me that I might have won the first battle of whatever unknown war it was we were fighting, but more was absolutely coming.

	<TEXT> Glad you like the series!

 Was that inspired by the theory of what would happen if earth suddenly stopped spinning? I got the sense that was what happened and was meant to throw off space-time positioning so the Enemy didn't have the proper coordinates anymore. A friend and I have had discussions about time travel and how one must include spacial positioning and inertia into the travel parameters or else you would end up left behind in space whilst Earth kept going along it's orbit. It would have similar ramifications to dimension travel since the rotation of a planet is generally fixed by the natural laws of the universe and any change would send dimensional gate projections into disarray.

In a sense, it was inspired by the thought of global changes to rotation and energy. In this instance, Amber Three is an artificial alternate Earth built with the capability to rotate the higher dimensions of local space. As you surmised, changing the shape of the mathematical 'terrain' changes where their local rifts end up connecting to. That global capability wasn't specifically designed to do this, but it was a theorized/expected consequence for sure. </TEXT>

Night and day had switched places; we were no longer riding alone in the dark. With over thirty people traveling together, and most soldiers, I felt safe for the first time in months. Of course, my sense of security also came from more than that. Institutions and structures I sorely needed had returned. The first I was aware of, and thankful fora hierarchy of command and responsibility that operated around us like a protective cloud. Others scouted. Others took watch. We participated, but it was not all on us to survive at the bitter edge every single second of every single day.

The other structure crept upon me without announcing itself.

That first day with the Vanguard of the New Exodus involved numerous rapid machinations, story crafting, and strategizing. We quickly realized that they were from the Empire, and thus naturally positioned to be our allies, but something greater was going on and telling them the truth about us seemed risky until we knew more. They were good men and women, but we had been sent out on a grey-class mission that had surely left ripples of chaos and unrest on Amber One in the wake of false promises of alliance and aid, and exposing ourselves would also expose the survival of our homeworlds.

During the last afternoon stop for rest, we finally sighted a river slicing through the endless golden plains of this world's North American grasslands. Our new companions had kits to test the water, and found it to be clean and drinkable. We shook our heads; why hadn't *we* thought of that? Then again, the Vanguard had been sent out with the full planning of the Empire to scout this region, and we had simply been sent on a covert smash and grab.

They left us then to set up camp a certain distance away, and I did not understand why until the last remaining Vanguard member, a boy of barely eighteen named Sol, awkwardly turned away with red cheeks and a terrified expression on his way into the high grasses. I'd seen teen movies from his culture, and, edited for propaganda as they might have been, I think I still understood. Under the warm late afternoon sun, my people were all unclothing themselves to make use of the water.

Was this a mistake? Would they know that we were not like them? How could one possibly guess at all the differences between two separate cultures? We would give ourselves away if we did not come up with plausible reasons why our norms were different.

But that would come later. I stood on the loam shore and removed my boots; the friendly earth was inviting and soft, wholly unlike the grim grey dirt and creeping moss of the jade wasteland that I'd thought I would never escape. Trembling against creaking muscles and unhappy pains, I slowly peeled away one bandage at a time from my head. Each large bruise stung a tiny bit in the cool air, but I had not been overly lacerated, so I knew I would eventually heal with few additional scars.  My back would not be so lucky; unrolling the matted bandages around my midriff, I began shivering at the pain.

Flavia came over on her makeshift crutches. She had me move just a few steps into the river and sit. With the water up to my waist, I felt half-refreshed, and she did the best she could above. "You can't get this wound up here wet," she told me while pressing a clean bandage between my shoulder blades. "I don't like these hints of exposed bone here. Easy places for an infection to take hold. Protect this area above all else until the skin heals over."

Taking the order quite seriously, I nodded.

"They have two doctors with them," she added. "We'll get one to look at both of us later tonight."

Her broken leg and broken arm made it very difficult for her to wash herself, so I helped her the best I could, and the men washed the clothes in the river to erase the pains of our collective journey. Blood, moss, sweat, grey dirt, and stressful memories floated away on the cold bubbling water. The worst were Cristina's clothes, and she watched the filth break away with a haunted and distant gaze as she absently rubbed her purple wrists. She came and sat in our small pool of slower-moving water and strung out her knotted and disgusting hair. "My face has been broadcast before. They might recognize me if I clean up."

My sister in arms blinked for a moment. This was the first time our rescued prisoner had spoken in front of her, but Flavia was the cleverest of us, and she rose to the challenge with excitement. "Then we'll dye your hair before they see you."

Cristina seemed to be considering it. "Will that work?"

"People see what they expect to see," Flavia replied, citing all the times we had used makeup to dull ourselves and blend in with the crowd. "Give them a different identity. Be unremarkable. Make it look like you're not hiding, and they'll suppress their own suspicions without even realizing it."

I nodded in support. "It'll work."

Cristina gave in wordlessly, and Flavia waved over Caecilia and Larentia to explain the situation.

"You're doing this to protect the Amber Worlds alongside us?" Caecilia asked, keen on hearing our guest speak.

"A little bit, sure," Cristina told her after a deep exhalation. "But I've done far more than just eject your worlds from the Empire at the height of a crisis. To *these* people, as someone else once put it, I have been both an angel and a demon."

Caecilia looked to Larentia, who asked for all of us, "What are those? Demon, like the Regret Demon, so something bad, but what's an angel? Something good?"

"Ah." Cristina looked each of us in the face and then sighed. "Now's not the time for that discussion. But yes. You could say they're mythological creatures; one very bad, one very good."

Beside her in the water, I asked sincerely, "How can you be both?"

Pained, she shook her head.

Pulling on her teammate's arm, Caecilia took Larentia off to find anything that might dye hair. The clothes were put up to dry, and we lounged around in the warm sun and cool water for a time watching the men play an improvised and splashy game of Empire football in the shallows; Noah seemed incredibly awkward about all the nudity, but he held his own, which was admirable considering the vast differences in strength, speed, and coordination between him and the soldiers of Ambers One and Three. It was teamwork, I saw; Celcus and Sampson led their men against Conrad's, but both sides worked together so efficiently that Noah's lagging made little difference. Had the same been true of me when I had shown weakness? In the corner of my vision, I could see Flavia's splintsthe cost of my mistakesand I knew that it had.

"Alright," Caecilia said as she and Larentia approached along the shore. They held out what they had found. "Metallic red berries that tested as inedible but not dangerous. Or natural blueberries that could do a sort of dark purple. Lastly, engine grease. If we're very careful, we can turn your brown hair black without smudging and giving the whole thing away."

Cristina looked at me, and I only realized what she was doing when she spoke: "Well, the purple's right out, but I think I'll try the red."

She'd chosen my hair color. Why did that feel so weird and nice? I wasn't used to people looking at me, let alone choosing me as a basis for a sort of new team color.

As a group, we dunked her, cleaned her horrific hair, and then got to work. We had various small bits of material and chemicals we could repurpose to modify the color of the dye, and, with a few rounds of experimenting and a little ingenuity, we managed to get the job done.

"Good choice," Flavia commented at the end, laughing as she compared the two of us. "You and Venita could be family!"

For some reason, that embarrassed me. I turned away.

"It's waterproof like we expected," Larentia said, testing some held-out strands again. "The stain has really taken hold. I don't think it'll come off if you sweat."

"Good." Cristina held some of her own hair out in front of her face and studied it. "I think I've chosen a name, too. My great-grandmother was named Casey, and that starts with a C, so I think I like it as a temporary identity."

Strange feelings made me even more uncomfortable as I thought about that. The others all nodded in understanding for the respect that showed her family line, but I had nothing like that in my life. My grandfather was a great person, yes, but my mother, father, and ancestors were a blank otherwise. That feeling of void grew as we all sat in the pool and began hashing out the cover stories we would tell the Vanguardbut then that feeling of void shrank as Cristina began braiding my hair with practiced ease while leading the discussion of identities. She didn't ask, and I didn't stop her; she argued that we all had to be a little different than we were so that we would actively remain in character and not accidentally slip up.

With the clothes dried and evening coming on, we donned our fresh non-uniforms and prepared to rejoin the Vanguard camp. On the way through the grass, Flavia studied my face and smiled. "You seem happy."

"Do I?" I asked, aware now that she had mentioned it of a bounce in my stepand in my hair. I pulled the red braid forward to look at its tasseled end. "It's really nice, don't you think?"

"It's not military code," she responded, but in a daring and excited tone. I think she was on the same page as I was when it came to the thought of enjoying our time of freedom from the harsh rules of our home. As we walked, I wondered how far that daring extended. I myself had never even thought to stray outside that strict structure until I had found my inner azure fire in that horrible jade wasteland.

A scout on his way in roared past us as we hit the edge of camp, and Atticus took the news before coming to greet us with grim confirmation. "Well, what you observed appears to be true. We can't go back. All our routes are circling towards the center of this region. That's how our two teams even met up before we ran into you all."

I shared a glance with Flaviawe had talked about this in the river, and we had been sincerely hoping that it had just been something the Regret Demon had done while chasing us, even though that sounded unlikely the more we worked it out. No, the great enemy that had attacked our world was drawing us all in to our doom step by step like an anaconda squeezing the life out of its prey. It was now clear that we could not get home without winning this war that had been thrust upon us.

"One group we ran across warned us of something like this," Atticus continued. "I shoulda listened."

I hoped he didn't notice the sudden change in our collective body language. Was that other group from Amber Three? They'd been planning an attack on the great enemy's facility since the day we'd left. Did that mean we could run into our brethren out here? Even join back up with them?

"We were gonna set you up to walk your route," he said after thinking for a moment. "But now I think we all gotta ride together even if the extra weight costs us a ton of gas; get into this fight. Whaddya say?"

Caecilia didn't need to consult with us, for our answer was unanimous.

That first night with them wasn't anything special, for we were all still strangers. Both their doctors came around to check on Flavia and me. The first applied some sort of hardening gel to my back that would disinfect and seal my wounds, while the other worked on genuine casts for Flavia's arm and leg. "The ribs," he said, "Are just going to hurt terribly for a few weeks. Not much I can do there besides give you some painkillers. You're just lucky they're fractured and not broken." When we looked at each other in surprise, he asked, "Don't any of you have medical training? Did you think she was walking around with fully broken ribs?"

"Our doctor died early on," I lied.

He grimaced. "It's going to be tough for you guys then. Glad you found us."

"Us too," Flavia told him before downing the first painkiller.

The second and third days passed with a few incidents, but nothing we couldn't handle. The Vanguard squads watched us in amazement as we effortlessly downed a massive lizard-beast one day and burned a path through maggot-vine fields the next. We were heavily armed, well-coordinated, and fearless; there was no hiding these innate qualities of ourselves.

At some point, Atticus commented, "You guys must be one of the top-end squads, right? Like the best of the best?"

To this, Caecilia just laughed with earned haughtiness. The truth of her reaction was more convincing to our companion squads than any lie, and that confirmation prompted a growing number of the Vanguard members to step up and begin performing as we did. They went from fearing going around every corner in the multiverse to hesitant trust that, together, we could actually handle what might come in the war to which were so blindly riding.

By our fourth night making campthis time in a series of caves that offered total concealment and protectionwe had all developed a sort of budding camaraderie, enough that the groups began to mix and talk began to loosen. Separate small caverns were set up with fires and tents, and people began to move from area to area almost like the parties I had seen in Empire movies. Indeed, we realized that someone had produced hidden bottles of liquor, and we of the Amber Worlds became timid wallflowers for the first time in our lives.

"Anyone got a soda?" I asked hopefully, approaching the circle of people around the campfire in the big main cavern.

A brunette girl my age that I didn't know well laughed. "Just the hard stuff, honey."

What was I supposed to do? I couldn't tell them I wasn't allowed to have alcohol, and they would certainly get suspicious if *all of us* turned it down. She procured a red plastic cup from a stack someone had brought on their journey 'as a joke'what was the joke? I didn't get the significance of red cupsand then I accepted and held before me a small pool of noxious chemicals.

All eyes were on me.

Giving them a sheepish smile, I said, "Thanks," and downed the contents of the cup in one big swallow.

Oh.

No.

No, *no.*

Coughing and kneeling, I tried not to vomit as fire burned up my throat and nose.

The dozen-odd men and women around the fire laughed, but not too cruelly.

"Yep, that'll getcha," the girl said with a grin. "That's 190 proof, homemade." As I battled my coughing fit, she filled a canteen. "Here." I shoved it away, but she said, "It's just water. Drink water. Trust me, one shot of that stuff is all you need for a good while."

I took the canteen and staggered to a corner of the tents behind the circle while the watching faces finally turned back to their conversations. Here, Cristina had Sol cornered. The young man's light brown skin was clearly the brighter for alcohol, and he was slurring a bit.

"What do you know of the cold?" she asked, choosing her words very carefully to imply that we knew about what they had mentioned as the driving force behind their journey. "Have you guys found out anything?"

Red cup in hand, Sol grinned and shook his head. "Nah. It's just coming up on us so fast. We were slow on the outset, and nearly froze to death." He sighed with momentary unhappiness. "I just can't believe the Empire's gone."

"You're sure it's gone?" she asked, and I saw tension in her neck that belied her calm faux neutrality. "Have you actually *seen* the Empire's lands frozen or dead?"

Sol frowned. "Nah, but what could survive that? The First Tribe is dead, man." At the tail end of his last word, he remembered the name she had given. "Casey."

Cristina patted him on the shoulder and then stalked away. Following her briefly, I asked, "Is everything alright?"

She stopped and faced me by cavernous firelight. "I have to believe my son's still alive, but that doesn't sound good." She gave a bitter glare at nothing. "I'll just have to expand my search. They wouldn't have sat in place and died. They have to be *somewhere.*"

Beginning to feel a little fuzzy, I asked too loudly, "But how will you find him?"

Back at the circle, someone turned around and raised his hand. "I'm a finder. Someone need to find something?"

That snapped Cristina out of her darkness and toward the firelight. "Our squad didn't have a finder," she told him, using a risky lie. "What kind of things can you find? What does that mean?"

The doctor who'd made Flavia's casts asked from the other side of the fire, "You guys don't have a doctor *or* a finder?"but nobody really heard him over the other conversations.

The closer man stood as a silhouette against the fire and, cup in hand, explained, "I can find anyone I've met or anything I've touched."

"Really. That's intriguing." Cristina moved to speak with him, and I lost track of their conversation as my senses began blurring at the edges.

I found myself walking down one of the tunnels to another chamber without really making a decision to do it. The next cavern had another fire, this one with only five or six people around it, but Conrad was there giving some sort of grand speech about the wonders of himself. Most were laughing and taking the braggadocious tales as jest, but two were listening with intent.

The third cavern held a dozen people in it like the first, and I scooted up to the fire next to Flavia with excitement. "Have you tried that stuff they're drinking?"

Red-faced and subtly slow in her smiling response, I knew she had. She leaned close and whispered, "It's horrible."

"It really is!" I had so much I wanted to say to her, and it all felt so much closer to the surface than ever beforebut a pain rose as well. I had to find Celcus first. He deserved to know. I took a swig from my canteen, stood, and said, "I'll be right back."

"Noooo," she called after me playfully. "Come back!"

The fourth cavern held a small cloud of dancing drunk people. Celcus and Septus were there flailing like madmen, but having all the fun in the world. Why had we never been allowed alcohol? Why had we never danced before? I couldn't take this from my tall man.

The fifth and final cavern was down a long and narrow tunnel with no apparent ceiling; the firelight did not extend this far or that high. Heading the other direction, I met Noah, and he did a double-take before stopping me. "Venita, are you alright?"

I nodded and laughed. "I'm great. How are you, clone emotion-sensing guy?"

"Not a clone," he responded automatically. "But, um, just like with you, I can feel all of the Vanguard members. I'm sorry I didn't sense your distress before now."

"Distress?" I pushed him for some reason. "I'm not distressed."

"You're literally lightning right now," he said quietly after glancing forward and back toward the two visible fire-lit areas. "There's a fire in you, a blue fire, and I don't think you know what to do with it yet."

That caught my attention enough to stun me through the blanket deepening over my inhibitions. "You can see it? The fire?"

His close silhouette nodded. "You found something, some inner strength I'm sure, but there's something I've been seeing for a long time that you might not realize. I wasn't going to say anything, since it's not my businessuntil I sensed your dangerous impulses just now."

"What's dangerous about it?" I demanded. "I can feel the way I want."

"Yes, you can," he whispered, getting more specific. "But isn't this going to crack your team apart? They're not going to understand that you experience emotions differently than they do."

Reeling in place in the dark, I felt like crying, shouting, and pushing all at onceuntil the impact of his words brought out deeper questions. "Wait, what do you mean?"

"Well, I can only assume they're like most people since I can't sense them for reasons I still don't understand, but most people have a range of feelings within any given category. You can hate brussel sprouts and hate a murderer with different intensities, yeah?"

Ick. "No. Those are equally bad."

He grinned in the dark. "Bad example." Thinking for a moment, he continued: "You can hate a pebble in your shoe and hate a bully with different intensities, right?"

"Yeah..." I had some vague notion of what he was going to say, but I was having great difficulty thinking.

"Well what I sense from you, Venitait's just what I see, maybe because of your upbringing, your culture, or just the people around youwhen it comes to romantic love"

I pushed him *hard*, but he did not stop speaking.

"You've only got one setting," he said louder, forcing his point across. "And it's that fire inside you."

My feet were taking me away from him before I even decided to run.

"Passions like that make people do stupid things," he shouted after me. "You'll risk everything, damage the whole world if you have toI've seen it before!"

But I didn't listen. I ran to that final cavern and found him there; I found my Sampson sitting alone and watching the fire while others danced. Pulling him aside into the shadows, I asked breathlessly, "You lied about having a girlfriend somewhere out there, didn't you? Because we used to be together?"

By dim orange light I saw the tension in his jaw, and I could tell my hands on his strong arms made him uncomfortable. After a moment of shared close breathing, he said, "I lied. I've been trying to stay away from you, but I couldn't leave, either."

I wanted to kiss him, then, but Noah's warning echoed in my rampant thoughts. I'd screwed up enough. It was time for me to do something the right way again; it was time to be the best I could be, the way I had been before I'd been broken. Now I was remade in azure and heat, and I could do this. Dragging him by the hand, I led the way back to the fourth cavern, where I took Celcus by the hand as well. Septus laughed and pushed me away from the dancers, and I knew that he knew. Among my surviving family, he was my only remaining actual friend, and his heart had always been set on Porcia regardless.

Flavia still sat in the third cavern, and she lit up at our approachand then grew wary as I pulled the four of us to a private corner where fire and shadow danced along the walls and half of each our faces. We sat, drunken, and faced one another for real. In that instant, they all knew, for there was nothing we could truly hide from one another.

Celcus bore an expression of hurt, but also understanding.

Sampson's face held begrudging apology.

Flavia was purely and solely happy.

"I wanted to tell you, in case we die in the coming battle," I forced myself to say after a shiver. The fire inside *was* my strength, and I didn't have to be the way the military had raised me to be. "I love all of you. Not just as brothers and sisters in arms. I love you, Celcus, my antikin, for we could never have been apart. I love you, Sampson, for your strength and humility, and for what we had that still hasn't faded. And FlaviaI don't even have the words for what you are to me. I don't understand it. It just is the way it is."

She gulped, but out of excitement, not fear. "I know."

Sampson looked each of us in the eyes with trepidation. "What now?"

Celcus lowered his head for a moment, and his mop of brown hair covered his face. He gave a hard sigh, but, upon meeting our gazes again, he said, "I guessed it. We're all so different, and I felt I couldn't be all the things either of you offeredbut you couldn't be me, either." He hit his knee with a fist, but not too hard. "I'm alright. I'm not resentful, and I'm not going to harbor negativity. This doesn't diminish what you and I have, does it?" He watched me for an answer.

My response was full and true: "It won't."

He seemed relieved. "I'm glad you did it this way. We're stronger together, and Sampson and I had begun fighting with each other in small ways; I think because of this."

I thought back to subtle glares and comments, even as recently as on the *Matilda* before it crashed. "You were! That's what that was about?"

Sampson grimaced. "Yeah." Reaching out a hand, he waited.

Celcus clasped his forearm, and two of my beloveds made peace. Together, they faced Flavia. "They'd discharge us with dishonor if they knew."

It wasn't an unheard-of concept, but I was certain now that it had been edited out of every movie and show we had ever seen. Making babies was one of the primary responsibilities of military caste members above a certain age. Family units and structure had all been designed around it.

Flavia raised both eyebrows in challenge. "Then they won't find out." She put her hand in the middle, and we each placed ours on top, with mine last. "I have no idea what we're doing, but we were going to fracture and break apart if we didn't face this. Now we'll be stronger than ever."

Celcus nodded.

Sampson nodded.

I, too, nodded. "I don't want to hurt any of you."

It was Celcus who took the lead in shaking off that concern. "We're pretty tough, if you haven't noticed. We'll figure this out, and we'll be fine. No matter what happens or what you choose, I won't resent any of you. You're all my best friends. Beyond family."

"And who knows?" Sampson added. "Maybe we'll all die in the coming battle anyway, and none of this will matter."

Flavia shivered. "That's not funny."

I was too ecstatic and drunk to do anything but smile. "It is a little bit."

We broke our circle of trust then to rejoin the festivities; while still in darkness, Flavia pulled me back with her unbroken arm and, without warning, kissed me hard. I began to say something in surprise, but she slapped me.

"What was that for?!"

"Waiting so long," she said, moving off toward the fire with a bemused smirk.

I found another drink soon after, and, for a time, everything was right with the world. I had everything that mattered, I was my true self, and I'd been honestand they'd accepted me. There were still a thousand questions ahead, but every face in those caves and around those fires seemed full of life and wonder and hope. I could see now that the Vanguard members had paired off pretty fiercely, and that their squads were almost exactly half men and half women. Did the leaders of the Empire know this same lesson? Love was everything. Love was strength. I could feel it burning in my every nerve.

The earthquake was minor, but absolutely reflected in me. The others looked around warily for a moment, but resumed their conversations when no further tremors followed. I was too high on a cloud to notice; I drifted to my feet and wandered back to the first cavern. For some reason, I wanted to share my happiness with Cristina. She'd braided my hair. Why was that such a big deal to me? She'd taught me something in the jade wasteland; she'd helped me find the fire in me that had always been burning to get out. I had just needed to align myself to my own truth.

She caught me in the darkness between the first and second caverns. "Oh my God," she breathed, clutching my arms. "The finderhe says he still senses a comrade who used an amethyst suicide device. He thinks it doesn't kill you; it just teleports you somewhere distant. *My husband's alive.*"

In my drunken happiness, my smile was wide and genuine. "That's wonderful!"

"We have to get moving," she said frantically, speaking more to herself than me. "We have to plan, we have to calculate, we have to *do something!*" She could hear Conrad's speech from down the tunnel, and there were now ten people sitting and listening to his words. By distant orange, I saw fire and apprehension in her eyes. We soldiers were heading into an unknown battle, but I knew then that Cristina Thompson was going to war.

"Also," I asked her blithely. "What's God?"

That fiery gaze angled to meet my eyes. There was something dark there behind the flames reflected from Conrad's speech. She had a fire inside her, too, but it was not blue like mine. She was no longer smiling as she said: "You know what? I think it's time we had that conversation."

The delay had given me *some* strength, and I used it now to feint an attack to her right while sending out my multi-tool to the left. It slung out like a long whip and wrapped around the gun on the ground, bringing it back toward me at speedbut she stomped on it, and it recoiled back to a brace around my arm. A swinging kick took me in the temple, and I crashed to the ground amid sensory stars.

This was important. I got back up on my feet to take another six punches to the face, and then five to the stomach. I could no longer defend myself, but that was not really the point anymore. Soaked in blood and battered beyond feeling, the pain was now my strength. I didn't have a plan, but I refused to accept a reality in which I no longer had this family.

My world shook with each further punch; earthquakes ravaged the memory palaces of my mind, while hurricanes drowned out any attempt at civil order. The land itself tilted mightily, but I resisted a fall. Someone distant screamed, *Run away!*, but I shook my head as best I could on bruised neck muscles.

The hits stopped just as night threatened to fall. I blinked away red to see a second tied-back curve of blonde behind the first, andan arm around Caecilia's neck? I stared in shock for a moment as my damaged thought processes tried to understand that Flavia had, despite her broken leg, broken arm, and two broken ribs, snuck up behind Caecilia during the fight and used her one good arm to momentarily hold our Centurion in place.

Flavia managed to shout, "Get the gun, Venita!"

Nodding weakly and falling to the ground, I crawled over; behind me, I heard Flavia hit the dirt and scream in utter agony, but I grasped the weapon as Caecilia leapt down and struggled with me for control of it. My multi-tool locked around it several times, but she ripped off my gloves that controlled it, and it fell to the ground useless. Standing above me, she threw the gun away again and put a boot to the river of blood running down my face. "Venita: Run. Away."

I could no longer speak, but my flat refusal had to be clear on my face. As she closed her eyes and pulled her leg back for a kick, I saw Flavia on distant grey watching me through pain with nothing but absolute support. Her eyes were blue to me despite the omnipresent red in my vision, and my reason to go on was all I had left. My sight shifted to the gun off in the dirt, impossibly far away for all that a few steps mattered; as it had before in moments of extreme stress, Time's violin played a high rising note for me, and the world slowed. This was my moment of peace, my reflection-before-Death, and I could feel myself moving into that movie theater when I was six years old and my parents had been exiled and all I had needed in the world was a place to feel safe and like I belonged. That memory, surrounded by dozens of other military caste children, had always been my sanctuarybut no longer.

This was my safe place. These people. Flavia. Celcus. Sampson. Septus. Lovethat's what this was.

Wait. I had it.

While that high rising note sang penultimate tension for my approaching final moment, I fell forwardand turned the movement into a roll. In a single revolution, I whirled over the gun, grabbed it as I came up, and pointed it at Caecilia's back.

Her kick hit nothing but empty jade air and she opened her eyes in shock. She turned around twice before sighting me far behind her.

I shivered mightily, but kept the weapon held up. "Yield." Neither of us moved for a span of several heartbeats. Completely covered in grey dust, we were twin pale statues of violence.

"You did it," she finally breathed, relieved. "I yield, and gladly. It's good to have you back."

She wasn't wrong. There was a rekindled fire in me, azure against this world's jade, and I knew that I was not broken.

Well, not mentally. The others rushed forward and helped me up, all laughing, congratulating, and wondering at my surprise success. The fog had made a few of the quicker moves blurry, they said, but that last roll had been amazing.

To my left, Conrad grinned. "Very good show. I haven't seen a fight like that in agesliterally."

To my right, Cristina gave me a solemn nod. We both knew what I had done; what I had found inside.

It was back to lying down in the triage section of the cracked-open plane, but this time I was there for success and pride, not failure and weakness. Flavia had aggravated her splinted broken limbs, but she was full of smiles, and we talked like we were cadets in the bunks again, for there was naught else to do but recover while the others finalized plans for escape from this place. I knew we would make it; I knew I would not falter.

And the worst was over, at least for now.

In the privacy of the bioluminescent night, practically cheek to cheek for our inability to speak loudly, Flavia whispered, "So how did you do that?"

I turned my head, which was the only thing I could move. "What do you mean?"

She, too, turned her head, and those ocean-blue eyes regarded me carefully. "Caecilia had her eyes closed, and the others had some fog obscuring the rear of the fight, so I think I'm the only one that saw it."

My heart sank as I anticipated something dark based on her tone. In our formal Latin dialect, I asked, "Of what do you speak?"

She searched my expression, decided I was honestly unaware, and whispered as quietly and privately as possible, "The gunit was" She shook her head, then, dismissing unhappy thoughts. "I guess it doesn't matter. I'm just happy that you're still here."

I laughed, but then coughed at the pain in my chest. "With all these bruises, I feel like a zombie. I must look horrible."

She just smiled warmly at me and shook her head.

The morning brought a sense of freedom and excitement, and not just for me. We were all looking forward to seeing colors other than green; that, and escaping the constant growls and shrieks of sea life unseen above. Without our plane or our motorcycles, this would be a journey on foot, and we left behind what gear we could while forming into knots to help the wounded travel. Celcus supported me as we walked, while Septus helped Flavia. Sampson remained just behind in case either of us stumbled. One of the men from Amber One had a bad leg injury, and his fellows helped him. Our healthy soldiers stayed alert in a circle around us.

The rift glimmered ahead in the fog long before we should have been able to see it, but whatever lay beyond was still hidden by jade until we came close and looked out upon a grassy plain waving golden with the tint of late autumn.

"Finally a good reality?" Trajan asked, both hopeful and tired.

"Stay sharp," Caecilia ordered, moving forward into the next world with her rifle at the ready.

The sun was painfully bright to my unadjusted eyes, but I reveled in its warmth and the return of familiar nature. I was all bandaged up in a hundred different ways, but, underneath those wounds, I was whole again. The colors of this world were all intensely vivid after the last, and I couldn't help but take it in wide-eyed and exultant.

There was no sign of the Regret Demon. Unable to track us, it had lost our trailbut someone else soon found us. As we stumbled through waving grain and cool breezes, engine roars grew in the distance. There was nowhere to hide, but we were hopefully well armed enough. We watched and waited as two squads of ten riders each approached in parallel. They wore makeshift brown uniforms that had been clearly crafted in a hurry, but they were *not* from the Amber Worlds.

Twenty long-distance dirt bikes came to a halt and grew silent. The leader of one of the squads dismounted and took off his helmet to reveal short-cut black hair and a cautious expression. In a southern variant of Empire English, he asked, "Y'all run into some trouble?"

Caecilia looked around at each of us. Cristina watched warily and waited for more information, but our leader had her gaze more on Conrad, who just grinned as another surprise twist promised further entertainment. Caecilia settled on an unspoken order to Noah, who she figuredbecause I was the only one who had actually heard Cristina speakwas the only one among us who would have the proper accent.
 
"Sure did," Noah finally said. "Lost all our gear in a jade fog world."

"Ah," the other man replied. "We saw that rift, but that world's not on our assigned route. Welp, let's getcha sorted. We can't exactly leave fellow Vanguard members hanging, now can we? There's twenty of us, looks like enough for each of you to ride tandem and then some. Climb on board, and we'll sort things out at camp tonight."

We had no idea who these people were or what they were doing, but, at a nod from Caecilia, Noah did the only thing he couldhe played along. "Sounds good."

One by one, we each climbed on a bike behind its operator. The roar of the engines was too loud for us to talk, and we had no helmets with which to speak over radio, so we had all day to think of plausible stories for what we had been through. At times, I watched Cristina. She was calm and confident in the face of infinite possibilities, and, somehow, I felt that I now had some small measure of that same strength. For the first time since the crises had begun, I felt like there was actually a chance that everything would be alright.

*Author's Note: I know I'm starting here in /r/hfy with Part 7 in a series, but don't be afraid to jump in with this part. It's a good place to start.*

---

Scanning left and right between dogged breaths, I dragged the semi-conscious reeking woman across wide bands of grey dirt and soft moss while the unseen rising sun sharpened bright shadows made eerie by omnipresent jade fog. My fatigue at being awake all night had remained at bay only thanks to the adrenaline of the plane crash; strange calls and growls from the fog now kept me agitated enough to persevere. Movement was critical, and I could feel the clockwork drumbeat of Time ticking away all of our categories of survival. Where was the plane? If it'd continued rolling after we'd been thrown out, it could have ended up leagues away, and visibility here extended no more than a few footfalls.

I didn't want to think about the possible fates of my brothers and sisters in arms. I had to assume they were searching. How could I help them locate us?

A heavy growl echoed out startlingly close, and I reflexively dropped her and moved my hands, but my pistol had been lost in the crash. I had nothing. Listening to the growl in horrified anticipation, I moved my head to track it, finding myself oddly perturbed as the sound seemed to move upon us and then zoom by *overhead.* Everything here was both oddly bright and dark at the same time; the dark green contrast was too high to tell if a shadow accompanied the soaring growl.

The former prisoner moved feebly on the ground, slowly clawing her way toward awareness. Again I was amazed at her ability to move at all. How long had she hung on that cross in the city square? From her matted hair, sunburned skin, purpled wrists, and horrible stench, she had been up there days at the very least. Someone had to have brought her food and water. "You had allies, didn't you?"

Her laugh was weak, but her spirit was not. Hands on moss, she looked up at me through those grimy brown locks. "As much as I appreciate what you did, they were going to rescue me at dawn." She ignored my offered hand and raised herself up on shaky legs. Her gaze slowly circled murky bright-dark jade before coming to rest on me. "You're a well-muscled girl."

Taken aback by her piercing gaze, I asked, "So?"

"No uniform," she continued, unraveling my identity piece by piece. "But those clothes ill fit you. You reached for a gun, too, just now. You're very fit, used to a uniform and a gun, but carry a strange accent." Her chest heaved with the effort of speaking after her ordeal, but she had me pinned. "Not Amber One, because they blamed me for what happened. So one of the other Amber Worlds, then, which means more survived than just the reality I was in."

There was no way she'd just managed to *guess* all that. "You heard Conrad's speech. I thought you were unconscious before we pulled you down."

"Conrad?" she asked, subtly stunned. "Conrad the Second?"

"He's here somewhere," I told her, looking around. "He was on the plane with us."

Her stare bored down on me like a drill. "The *thousand-year-old immortal Emperor that nobody has seen in centuries* was on a plane with you just now?"

It occurred to me that I was giving away information; when I said nothing, she turned and began limping off in a random direction.

"We're not safe here," I said, loudly at first, but then moving to a whisper after an answering growl from somewhere in the distance. "We have to stick together."

She slowed. "Where is here? What reality is this?"

I had no answer for her. I began to lead the way, but she tugged on my arm.

"Your back."

All I felt between my shoulder blades was a sort of latent numbness and wetness. "What's wrong?"

"You're wounded." She hesitated as she assessed the damage. "I can sort of see your spine."

I must have been in shock. On some level, I *was* aware of the injury, but I had been heavily trained to block persistent pain. Reaching back, I poked oozing openness and winced. "Can you"

"Yeah." She helped tear my sleeves off, intending to use them as makeshift bandages, but that revealed the metal braces on my arms. "What are these?"

For some reasonperhaps our likelihood of death out hereI felt I could be honest with her. "This one's an automatic physical therapy device. I broke my arm when you ejected our Amber realities from the Empire." After she nodded in understanding, I continued. "This other one's a home brew. A transmorphic device disguised as a similar brace." Clenching my gloves, I willed it to form the sword shape I had originally seen on the engineer's table.

She grinned in genuine surprise and ran intrigued fingers along its black metal. "Your people reverse engineered Her Glory's transmorphic spheres."

It was my turn to be confused. "The spheres, yes, but who is Her Glory?"

"Seriously?" she asked, judging my face for sincerity. "You know Conrad, but you don't know his wife?"

I narrowed my eyes. "The Yellow Empress?"

She didn't disagree, but her culture had another name: "Her Glory, the Machine Empress of Mankind."

A shadow passed between us and the effulgent unseen radiance that marked the noon sun; she quickly wrapped my torn sleeves around my core under my jacket, and we hobbled forward as quickly as we could manage toward a very different type of darkness. What we had thought to be a hill instead emerged from the fog as a coral-like structure cast in black and jade, and we hid in a hole between two tall kelp-like plants, sword at the ready.

Peering out while my heart pounded in my chest and in the wounds on my back, I breathed, "I can't help but feel like we're at the bottom of an ocean."

Her gaze was sharp as she studied the murky green atmosphere. "Maybe we are, in a manner of speaking." At seeing my askance, she elaborated, "This reality's physical laws are close to ours or we'd be dead alreadybut that doesn't mean life here came about the same way. This air is pretty dense; the lifeforms here could be lighter, and swimming around up there."

Gazing up, I could see the environment here in a totally new way. "So we're on an ocean floor."

"We always were; an ocean of air with nothing but space above. It's just more obvious here."

Thinking of it that way, I felt a shiver. My childhood fear of being sucked up and away into an eternal lonely void felt closer somehow. There really *was* nothing but gravity holding me inside our ocean of air. If one day gravity should turn on meI shook away that instinctual terror. That could never happen, right?

A distant roar echoed, but not in my ears. "We have to move!" I hissed. "That's the thing that brought our plane down."

"Stay," she murmured, watching the shadows outside.

As much as it surprised me, she had the air of a natural leader of some sort, andas Conrad had saidwe were creatures of service. I decided to trust her calm focus, which still seemed impossible in the face of her broken body and all that she had been through. Under the filth and grime, she was perhaps ten years my senior, but her stability in the face of that *thing* finding us again seemed the hallmark of someone far older.

 My pulse raced into pure lines of fire across my forehead as I sighted the darkness of its massive form moving in the jade ocean above. The mountain of brain matter could only be seen by its shape, but some of its extended claws were close enough to make out as it soared by overhead. A roar sounded again, testing for minds, but it was far quieter than it had been elsewhere. Amazed, I whispered, "I don't think it can find us."

"Why do you think that is?" she asked, with a tone that indicated she had already guessed. "The Regret Demon would kill us instantly if it knew where we were, so we can surmise it does not. Reason it out."

The mountainous shadow continued past us, and the roiling green sea let down the sun's light once more. Deep in thought, I whispered back, "Since we've done nothing different ourselves, it must be something about this place. The physical laws here, like you said, or the fog itself."

She waited, eyes on me.

Was there more? I searched around with my logic. "So maybe something about this ocean impedes sight not just physically, but in mental ways as well."

Her gaze was still expectant.

"Which means we're protected from the Demon for the moment." I ran over all the factors as best I couldand then swore. One of my teammates could sense emotions at a distance, and I had been banking on that for our survival. "*But Noah can't find us either.*"

As I finally reached the conclusion she had come to some time ago, she nodded. "We are both saved and doomed by the properties of this environment. We're on our own."

It was a bitter pill to swallow, but we clambered up and began to walk again, this time in search of food and water. Leaning on each other for balance, we hiked through terrain made less exotic now that I understood it a bit better. Seized by a random thought, I asked, "Do you suppose there's actually any green fog here at all? What if our vision and hearing are just clouded by this place the same way mental sight is?"

She turned her head as we stumbled along together and gave a small proud smile at my guess, but there was no clarifying the unknowable.

There was nothing to do but walk back along our own footprints. Now more in control of our wits, it was clearly the smarter decision to return to where we had started. With a sigh against fatigue, she told me, "If you're ever separated from your group, just stay where you are. Let *them* find *you.*"

It was good advice, and, if I had to be honest, I was certainly feeling a strange fear; I had never been away from my brothers and sisters in my entire military career. We were a team, or had been, and now I was alone. What would save me if danger presented itself? I asked this question even as a new shadow moved upon us; I threw her down and dodged aside as a giant billowing fish-like creature with incredibly long air-fins and a gaping mouth sailed past, stirring up grey dirt as it went. It circled back around, and I raised my sword in defense as I used the last of my strength to retreat against nearby coral outcroppings. Facing down the oncoming creature, I shouted, "It smells my blood!"

"You didn't evolve here," she called back. "It has no idea what your blood smells like. It has to be something else!"

It didn't seem like something else. A wide mouth and sharp teeth rammed into me, and I chopped at it with my sword. Failing to do much damage, I willed the device into several randomly vectored spikes, and those stabbed into open gums as the fish wriggled with immense power against me. Sharp stone outcroppings tore at my already wounded back and wicked teeth came down hard on my brace-clad arm; screaming despite myself, I kicked with all the pent-up fury of months of pain.

That pain was excruciating, but, more than that, I was filled with righteous anger at the unrelenting nightmares that I had been subjected to since the day that grimy woman had ejected my reality from its position of safety in the Empire. She'd done it to save us from the destruction that had found the other Earths, so I wasn't angry at her. No, the chip on my shoulder was reserved for those concepts which had been kept from me my entire lifeI had no name for what I had been denied other than the word *religion* that Noah had once said, but my imagined embodiment of Fate or Luck or Chance had chosen to save me at the last moment repeatedly only so it could torture me again soon after. Strange multi-faceted eyes fixated on me as I kicked, and, screaming louder, I slammed my forehead into the nearest.
 
It finally let go, aiming to circle around again, and I felt the bloodied coral at my back begin to move. Willing up a sword shape again, I whirled and faced a rising worm-like creature wider than me and far longer than I could see; it bore a crest of faux coral on its spine, and it grasped jade fog with a clawing open mouth.

This was an alien ecosystem. What had she said to me? *I didn't evolve here. It doesn't even know what I am.* Seized by a strange notion, I stepped asideand stood stock still.

The huge air-fish was no less hungry for all the gum wounds I had inflicted, and it shot right past me to bite onto the coral worm. Both struggled, but the fish had clearly evolved to hunt the worm, and the battle ended with a snapped spine. All I'd had to do was the exact opposite of everything I'd ever been taught. The key had been to stop moving and not fight.

As I returned and helped her up, I could see that she had already understood that. I asked, "Why didn't you tell me?"

More or less hanging from my shoulder at this point, she could only manage a weak smile. "If you didn't come to the realization on your own, soldier, would you have listened if I had said *not to fight?*"

I was seeing quite a few things more clearly lately. "No. I wouldn't have listened." Her perspective was just the latest in a long series of questions incompatible with the viewpoint I had been brought up with. I was starting to suspect I was no longer the soldier my caste and commanding officers wanted me to be. From the Legates on high all the way down to my Centurion, Caecilia, I was becoming increasingly useless. Questions about right and wrong, the afterlife, different ways of thinkingI could not forget Caecilia's evaluating gaze after I had frozen up on the parachute jump and nearly gotten my sister in arms killed. Even if I survived this horrible jade wasteland, I would have to answer for my weakness. I fell to my knees on soft moss. "It doesn't matter if we get found. I'm going to lose my family either way."

Rolling onto her back and gasping against the strain of injured travel, she forced out, "You can lose hope if you want, but it won't help. I've got to get back to my son."

Our footprints did not extend beyond this band of moss. We'd made it. I leaned forward on one arm for a moment, collecting my strength. "Where is he? Is he safe?"

"I hope so. We left him in good hands because my husband and I didn't expect to survive what we had to do."

I lifted my head enough to see her. "And"

"No," she said quickly, fighting back any deeper reaction. "No. Just me."

"Oh." I fell forward and lay on my side. "I'm sorry."

"You can give up and become bitter, pained, and dark. I did that, and it gained me nothing. Or you can find something to live for, some reason to go on, and you can live again."

I had a reason to live. It immediately came to mind, though I dared not think it. In a way, I had always known it, but it was surprising how much fell away when nothing else was left. Here we were, no weapons, no food, no water, no energy, no strategynothing at all but waiting with no hope.

Yet I *was* still hoping.

The glow that was the sun arced down to the horizon only to reveal natural bio-luminescence from the mossy terrain itself. This world was still just as jade and shadowed, and we just as spent. With my shock fading, the pain was becoming unbearable, although the bandages had ensured I would not just bleed out. Her days of crucifixion had left her physically broken, but not mentally, and we talked as otherworldly sea creatures sailed by in the green-tinted night air.

"Your sonwhat's he like?"

She shook with the warmth of an unheard laugh. "Smart."

I had never really thought about it, but I wanted children someday. Celcus and I had never talked about it, but it felt important. "Like you?"

"Hah, no, you could say he's adopted. And not entirely human."

Now that was intriguing. "What, really?"

"He's a young entity of light that took the form of a boy when he became separated from his family."

Entity of light? I turned my head, bringing my cheek into contact with the soft moss. "Like the allies that helped build our Amber Worlds?"

"The same, actually."

"So they're still around," I said to the open electric green air. "Maybe humanity will find some allies out here in the multiverse after all."

She said nothing further on that topic, and I wondered if finding those ancient allies would mean losing her son to his former family. That would certainly be bittersweet.

My training told me that someone had to take watch, but neither of us was whole enough to stay awake. The moss under me had begun to grow into my bandages and clothing, but I was too weak to rip away. Half-awake, I took a physical tally: when the crisis had first come upon us, a sphere had tried to drill into my temple; while held fast, I'd shot up through my own cheek to destroy it. So, scars on my temple and cheek. Broken arm, twiceonce back in the academy, once after makeshift parachuting with a tarp to escape a certain death. Horrible illnesses from the multiverse. Surviving a plane crash. How much more could my body take? Not to mention the mental trauma of our various obstacles. We'd been fighting for our lives with almost no rest day in and day out for months, and I understood the signs of what was happening to me. It was every military caste member's secret fear. Those who acquired the stress syndrome were not treated kindly, and inevitably ended up alone. A rush of traumas assaulted me in that quiet solitude; as the green glow of dawn came around again, I began sobbing uncontrollably. "I'm... broken..."

Her laugh next to me on the ground was long, sudden, and kind. "Oh really?" She bent up with an even deeper laugh, and then told me, "I'm so sorry, but you'll be just fine."

"How can you know that?" I demanded, angry in the midst of my tears. "You don't know what I've been through. My back"

She lifted the rear of her shirt.

At the sight of what looked like dozens of stab wounds on her flayed back, I immediately stopped talking.

"Made by men under my command a very long time ago," she said softly, lowering her sweat-stained clothing back down. "Because *I* became dark and bitter, and *I* went down the wrong path. They beat me to within an inch of my life and left me to die in the desert. And you know what? I crawled right to the nearest tent and sewed myself back up. I didn't give up, so I'm still here. There is so much more pain left ahead on this road, and you *will* learn and overcome."

I wanted to ask *who are you?*, but instead I said: "Will you teach me?"

She gave a solemn nod. "Help me find my son, and I will." She held out a hand, and I recognized it as the type of greeting Noah liked to use. "I'm Cristina, of the First World, and the Empire."

I took her hand and shook it. "Venita, of New RomeAmber Three."

"Well, Venita of Amber Three, it's time to ignore my own advice and start moving. I don't think they're going to find us." Ascending to her feet while trembling mightily, she pulled at me until the moss gave way.

Hardly able to stand, I let myself be half wrapped over her shoulders. I hated to say it, but I forced myself to admit: "I don't have any more strength."

"Yes you do," she replied, moving forward one measured step at a time. "There's always more, Venita. How do your people view endurance?"

Keeping me distracted from the pain was working for the moment. "Well, the first level is your body's normal endurance," I gasped, feeling my raw back more powerfully. "Then there's a second level that... the best soldiers learn to tap into by burning your very life force... the energy of self-preservation. Those limits normally imposed by your nervous system to keep your tendons and muscles from ripping themselves apart... and I once broached the third myself, that stemming from my very soul, the warrior's fire... but I'm long expended now."

"Then find a fourth level," she ordered, pushing us both up a low slope with effort.

I nearly fell, but managed to move my foot and stay up. "What's even left?"

"Beyond willpower, the body, and the soul, there's" She looked around for inspiration, but there wasn't much to see in the shadowed green air. At long last, she laughed loudly, and we both fell to our knees because of it. "belief." She threw a hand out, and I gazed forward at an emerald silhouette of a cracked-open aircraft. "That's what I once lost. Belief. But no longer."

Humanoid shapes ran out of the fog, then, and grasped me by the arms as I fell to grey dirt. She'd found it. How had she *found it?* We'd just picked a random direction andshe'd found it. The woman I had felt sorry for days before had proven stronger than me, and *she* had saved *me* from the wandering wasteland. What was I even?

These were the faces I'd wanted to see again. These people were my reason for continuing on. I lay in the shell of the aircraft alongside Flavia. Her wounds from saving me when I'd frozen up and failed to open my parachute were starkly apparent, and I despaired at how broken she looked because of mebut she just smiled back, happy to see me safe. Cristina stayed close, sitting above us and tending as needed, but I saw her tense and subtly watch Conrad as he emerged from the fog to speak to someone in the front half of the plane.

She murmured with alarm, "It's actually him. How is this possible?"

But there was no further discussion of him for the moment. Water was held to my lips, and my entire awareness sang for that cool relief. I was still too weak for food, but there was a certain measure of sustenance in knowing that it was coming.

My tall man came around after his patrol returned; Celcus kissed me on the forehead and asked me if I was alright, but I could hardly whisper. Sampson and Septus visited that evening and talked of strategy and plans; they, too, had figured out that the Regret Demon could not find us in this place. That meant that leaving was dangerous, and that we had to choose our egress carefully. Noah was not one of my five, but he came by anyway, and he apologized for not being able to find me. I just feebly shook my head, absolving any responsibility.

The gruff mercenary men from Amber One had suffered two casualties in the crash, but took their roles as guards and patrolmen no less seriously. Conrad's orders were law to them, and I secretly wondered why I was one of the only people here questioning his presence. In this, I knew Cristina shared my apprehension, but I also suspected my commander held similar feelings.

But Caecilia did not come around to see me.

One of her four, Paulinus, sat with me for a time, but he said little and seemed torn by something unspoken.

Rifts to other realities were located over the course of that day, and I could hear talk of possibilities. Nebulous beryl rays hinted at the setting of the sun, and I managed to stand and stagger my way out onto grey dirt where the others were making plans. Cristina stood on the outside edge of their circle just watching, and she nodded to me in acknowledgement of my renewed mobility. Caecilia saw me, then, and came over.

There was a definite note of unhappiness in her voice. "Let's take a walk."

I had some idea what was about to happen, and a cloud darker than the setting sun settled over me as we moved beyond the next hill. I had gotten used to the green light here, and now everything just seemed black and white; life and death cast at sharp odds.

Unhappy but intent, Caecilia stopped at a particular distance from the craft, pulled out her pistol, and threw it on the ground behind her.

So this was really happening.

She pointed past me. "One of the rifts to an adjacent reality is that way. You can reach Amber One through a few more rifts beyond it, if you so choose." Her apologetic eyes were still golden to me somehow despite the tone of the world.

I understood this ritual dearly, for some of the least capable cadets at the academy had washed out this way, but I had never expected to drop from the top of the class to the bottom years after graduation.

Caecilia seemed to have a similar thought. "Where's the girl that stabbed someone with her own broken bone to win a tournament? What happened to her?"

My thoughts raced for an out, but I refused to say anything that would demean myself. Begging and bargaining would not work. I had seen pathetic members of our caste try that and embarrass themselves. No, I would not go out that way. "I'm no longer an unquestioning follower of what we were taught."

 "I'm right there with you," she said, low and private. "But you've been freezing up and nearly getting your brothers and sisters killed. When we rode between the disintegration amethysts, when we para-jumped down to Amber Onethese are just the incidents I've seen. I hoped the time to yourself I afforded you at Conrad's facility would help."

I gulped before admitting, "It did. But not enough."

"If we're going to escape from this place, we can't afford another disastrous failure like that." She shook her head ever so slowly. "I don't want to do this, but I have to think of the others under my command."

My cheeks were wet, for I knew that this was likely the end. This is what I had told Cristina: I was going to lose my family. No, I had *already* lost them, for I had allowed myself to become a liability. Even untrained consultants like Noah were more reliable than a broken girl that had been smashed mentally and physically against the endless tortures of the multiverse.

Her expression was hard, but I could see regret in her golden eyes. "You know your three choices. Make me yield" She gestured back at the gun behind her on the ground. "run" She nodded forward at the rift some distance behind me. "or die." For that option, there was only the cold grey dirt between us.

There was one last phrase that would actually begin the ritual proper. Clenching my fists in anticipation, I breathed, "Don't say it. Just don't say it. Just don't."

She gave a deep and sad sigh, but formed up into a combat stance with both fists raised. "*Defend yourself.*"

Those words resounded in my head like a death knell as she crossed the distance between us and the first strikes flew toward me. She began with a traditional opener, perhaps purposely giving me a chance, and I did manage to instinctively respond to her one-two combination with an ingrained block. For a moment, I saw myself back at the academy and several years younger; the teacher had made me stay behind and practice this kind of exhausted fighting many times. He'd said that as one of the best I'd never been *truly against the ropes before*, and that, when the time came, I would appreciate the grueling extra training.

Arms down, block, elbow up, push her fist out, shoulder ram, left arm down

My first level of endurance was already gone. I was so weak that I'd only had a handful of moves in me. She was incredibly fast and quasi-famous among our caste for being dangerous; I was only still in this because I had been alongside her and seen her fight so many times. Ten moves in, I was already risking tendon and muscle damage by pressing beyond normal endurance. There was no chance at all of reaching the gun beyond her.

Her headbutt caught me off guard, and I reeled from the impact. She used the opportunity to hit me hard across my scarred cheek, and I staggered backso she kicked me in the stomach.

Pain is just in the mind, I told myself, even as I failed to summon up my usual walls to block it out. Painmy arm brace! I began blocking with my arm more forcefully, and she drew back as her fists hit metal dead-on. In that moment, I had an opening, and I willed the metal on the other arm to form into the shape of a bat. I swung at her midsection as hard as I couldbut she caught it and tried to tear it out of my grasp. Instead, it formed into a locking ring around her wrists, and we fell and tumbled in the dirt. Several leveraged kicks to my lower half forced me to disengage, and I rolled away and tried to clamber up.

She got to me before I could recover, and her boot slammed up the side of my face. Blood poured down over my right eye, but I sent my multi-tool up to latch onto her leg and pulled her down with impact. To avoid another kick to the face, I was forced to let go again, and she literally did a flip off of the ground and recovered her footing. Seeing that, and the copious energy remaining it implied, I knew I was doomedbut I was not going to run.

Digging deep into the third level of endurance, my very fire itself, I leapt up and ran right at her. This was my only chance, to eschew the chess game of learned moves and go for broke; blow after blow bruised my face and head as she focused on the most damaging hits, but I barreled her back repeatedly, got inside her radius, and punched relentlessly at all the ineffable horrors I had been put through out here. The storm of impacts against my dulling senses only fueled my fury further, and I screamed and attacked harder as blood sprayed left and right.

It was not hers. She was too good for that. I had not really managed to deal serious damage; it had all been slightly deflected. She had the advantage in experience, skill, tactics, and energy. I had never really had a shot, and that was more or less the point of this ritual. She'd been holding back, but now she slid around and punched my bandages above my exposed spine.

The pain flew outward from me like so much blood sprayed by a scream, and I drew back to face her. Everything was red now rather than green, and I could feel deep bruises and cuts all down my battered face; my stomach was on fire from well-placed kicks, and a few hits to the thighs had me half-stumbling.

"What are you doing?" she asked, despite the rule that she was not supposed to speak until the choice was made. "Run away, Venita!"

I coughed up warm iron thickness, pushed it out through my swollen and busted lips, and said, "*No.*" Out there in the wastes of this green nightmare I had found a reason to keep going, and I wasn't about to let it go.

A new voice reached us from the hill. "What the hell is this?"

I laughed; it was Noah, for we had not gone far enough away to avoid him sensing my distress. Behind him was absolutely everyonemy tall man, Celcus, my first love, Sampson, my dogged brother, Septus, the incorrigible Trajan, awake after his injuries in the crash, Caecilia's dour sister in arms, Larentia, our voice of moral reason, Paulinus, and behind them the savage mercenaries from Amber One; all of these flanked by Cristina on the right and Conrad on the left. But this was not absolutely everyone, in fact. Flaviano, she was bedded in the craft with the broken leg, arm, and ribs she had endured in saving me. It was my fault she was not among these witnesses.

Noah stared at me in shock and moved to help, but Larentia held him back with one arm. "Don't interfere. We are military caste. This is our way."

Conrad chuckled and looked on with piqued interest.

The others watched in worried concern and hopeful support, but Cristina simply gave me a nod.

I understood. There *was* a fourth level of endurance, and she had shown me the way. "I won't run."

"Then you better try to make me yield," Caecilia told me with angry eyes, quietly enough that only I could hear.

	<TEXT> That's actually been the biggest hurdle - ordering the chapters of such an immense sprawl of stories. The Empty Earth (I think I missed the end of the world) in particular has a buttload of prequels. It hadn't occurred to me to use flashback chapters, but I might have to do that. It could either make Noah's story even more confusing or help clarify it, I'll have to see which. I'd rather not have his portion of the compendium be multiple times bigger than everyone else's... but there might be no helping that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, quick update about coming stuff of interest.

 

Wednesday at 6 PM this week I will be posting The Grey Riders in another subreddit for the first time based on your previous suggestions. Gotta get the stories out there! So your upvotes will be very important for visibility. Right now Im thinking /r/hfy, but if youve got any new suggestions, let me know! Watch for the link Wednesday at 6 PM.

 

The plan for the compendium book you all asked for is now finalized. It will contain The Portal in the Forest, the Desolate Guardians, the Moon Aflame (+ 3 new chapters), The Empty Earth, The Crushing Fist, and Our Final Acts. This is again something your attention and reviews on Amazon will help greatly. This book is basically my shot for 2016 at breaking into a new level. Hopefully we can get enough visibility to get there!

 

And speaking of new level, I want to thank you all for your support on my Patreon. Ill be going through the lists and doing Patreon rewards here for anyone new who has signed up recently. Were almost to that first $250 goal, and Im very excited and encouraged.

 

Thanks a ton! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the main tenets we had been taught in training came back to me now: inattention is a shield. Just like you, the enemy is always tired, constrained on time, or expecting the wrong tactic. The best armor can stop any one bullet, but never being noticed can stop thousands. In fact, I had lived my entire life by that intrinsic part of our culturehide the hair under a hat, dull the face down with makeup, don't stick out from the crowdand standing in the complete opposite of that two-decade streak brought the most paralyzing inaction possible. Caecilia held a slightly lifted hand back to keep us still, but I needed no order. If the mood of the armed, angry, and hungry thousands all around us swung so, we would die. Their eyes were orange and white by firelight as they stared at us in equal shock. 

From the rear to the front of the high stage, Conrad floated forward with arms wide open. "You know me. You have seen my face all your lives. You know my story, and from whence I come. But there are others!" Shouting loudly but calmly, he told them, "Indeed, see their fresher faces and unbroken spirits. You can see with your own eyes that these five are from elsewhere. These are your fellows in arms from Amber Three. Contact has been made and routes have been forged. Ambers Two and Three survive. Your sister Earths are coming to help you."

Celcus stood with me, and Noah slightly behind me and to my right. Septus and Caecilia, two steps ahead of us, took the brunt of the stares. Uncomfortable denizens of Amber One shared confused glances and absently touched their guns and knives as they waited for understanding and consensus. What was Conrad trying to pull? We had specifically been ordered to come here incognito so that the Legates could handle forming an alliance, and we certainly hadn't remotely been in contact with Amber Twobut I could see a powerful appeal in his lie.

His voice continued to radiate through the square, and I noticed he had gravitated to the exact same height and position Legate Blue had once used; looking around, I realized the city square had been designed for oratory uses, and that this was, indeed, an exact copy of New Rome and other cities on our world. Our poleis were of a standard design. "You are creatures of service," he said, putting the choice on his listeners. "Not slaves. *Pillars.* On you, this world stands or falls. As always, you have three choices. Continue to riot and starve in violent hedonism, kill these transgressors and stand on your own, or pledge fealty to the renewed allianceunder *me.*"

I could have done without him stating the second option. Celcus grabbed my metal-clad arm as weapons were slowly raised in portions of the crowd. Some shouted epithets; others pushed and shoved at those favoring the attack. Under the chill night sky and shrouded at times by smoke from the many fires, I could do nothing but wait for my fate to be decided by others. That sense of complete helplessness applied horrible pressure somewhere deep, widening already existing cracks. I had been trained to believe that there was always a way to survive if one was just smart enough, strong enough, or fast enough. Had that been a lie? Were life and death merely random flips of the coin? Again, Fate or Luck or Chance held me in its fickle hands.

Conrad stood tall above the crowd, saying nothing. He gave no indication of concern when firearms were randomly turned toward him. No shots were taken, but I still shivered with horrified anticipation. Before me, I could see Caecilia's knuckles white in the darkness on her rifle. A single wrong movea single shout or shot or stumble by anyonewould set off a powder keg of Conrad's making.

But I'd been wrong. Noah was not behind me. In the morass of people, his hood up and low over his face, I heard him shout, "Do you have food?"

Of course. It was the simplest and most basic question of all, and those four words shifted the mood in the square with a palpable upward jerk.

"Food?" came a shout.

"He can bring food, can't he?"

"Amber Two had record yields this year, they're sure to have excess!"

"Allies feed each other!"

Thousands of voices rose together in a storm of pleading, begging, and demanding need. Conrad waited, arms still wide, and he made it clear with his calm neutrality that he would speak only once the stadium-like roar had died down. Layer upon layer of enervation weighed me down; I wanted to fall, grab someone, or even just take a step forwardbut I used all my willpower to stare down at Caecilia's held-back hand. It remained flat in the air behind her, steady as a rock, locking in her constant order not to move a muscle. How was she not trembling?

The members of the crowd began hushing each other in order to hear what this man who claimed to be Conrad would say about the food situation. Drawing out the tension to a keening high point, Conrad waited until the shouting stopped; until the murmurs began to die down; until absolute silence save the chill night wind reigned for a full ten seconds. When those assembled were at the point of breaking and perhaps speaking or shouting again, Conrad cut them off with a startlingly loud, "*Yes.*"

By waiting until they had been about to speak, he had prevented the reaction I had expected. Instead of shouting happily en masse, those around us simply lowered their weapons and shook with relief. Some sat, exhausted. Some let tears flow down their cheeks, either from joy at this salvation or regret for how hopelessly they had been living. I could see now that these were not evil people. Would *we* have ended up like this without the firm chain of command that had survived in our world?

"Now that we have found you, we will return," Conrad announced. "Until then, you must cease this chaos and begin the rebuilding effort. Who will be in charge here until we return?"

All attention turned forward to the conversation of leadership, and Caecilia's hand closed before me, letting us know we could finally move and breathe. She bore a furious expression at Conrad's unpredictable actions, and I shook bodily in agreement with that sentiment. Celcus stuck to my side protectively as we advanced, and I saw Noah snake through the crowd alongside. I guessed that there was no coming back later in such a volatile situation. Caecilia wanted the prisoner *now.*

I tried not to look up as we moved along the square-lining row of crucified bodies. Many were duplicates of Noah. Some were not. Capital punishment was not unheard of, but this barbarismI swallowed down my abhorrence and focused on the stage ahead.

All eyes fell on us once more as we stepped up into the fire-born spotlight. Caecilia wasted no time in having us move to the indicated woman and surround her. We pulled the cross down and laid it flat; I untied one arm while Noah got the other and Caecilia freed her legs. It was not often that I felt pity, for such an emotion was both useless and insulting, but savage dirtiness, caked blood, dark matted hair, and torn clothes were all I could see. Somewhere in this mess was a still-living woman for all that it seemed that we carried a corpse.

When we turned around, a sea of fiery orbs watched us.

"She's the one who did this to us!" a shirtless man at the front shouted. He had formerly been on stage when we had arrived. "She consigned us to this!" He hefted a long blade, and those around him hesitantly lifted guns.

Conrad did not look back at us. He addressed the speaker only, and with the first biting edge I had ever heard from him. "All your actions up to this are understandable if not civil, but the chain of command has been restored. Your pardon does not extend beyond this moment." He lowered his voice so that only those at the front could hear. "And, trust, she has a fate in store for her far worse than this ancient cruelty. In fact, I assign you men to escort your new allies out of the city. Your duty is now to keep the prisoner safe until she may be interrogatedand worse."

That turnaround caught the rabble rousers off guard. All menace fell away, replaced now by awkwardness, and with sheepish expressions they came up and helped us attend her. Noah stared murderous ice at them with brimming eyes, but focused his hands on pouring bits of water from his canteen between her purple, swollen, and cracked lips. "It's gonna be fine," he insisted with a whisper. "You're gonna get through this, and this will just be a bad dream someday."

I wondered at his ability to have a conversation more than one-sided with someone on the verge of death. What blackness must she be feeling? What despairing anger? The pieces of Noah's tale came together in my thoughts as I connected what he had told us to who this person must be. She had saved these people, but, in their panic and fear, they had not listened. This is what she had gotten as reward for trying to be a hero. Noah had said that she had gone into this at the end of the Crushing Fist crisis expecting to die. Surviving that only to come to *this* seemed a cruel act of Fate or Luck or Chance.

As a collective, we hefted her surprisingly light weight, and off we went. Celcus was directly behind me, but men who might have killed us minutes earlier were all around me otherwise. For the moment, I had to calm my inner anger and accept them, at least marginally, as brethren. No matter what they had done, they were still men of Amber One, and that meant they had to have *some* strength inside them.

Conrad gave an order to Caecilia, who took it with a public nod and a private scowl. She could not voice her concerns while these men were with us, and I wondered if Conrad had achieved two goals at once by sending them alongthese volatile elements had been removed from the crowd, yes, but we could also not commiserate over his duplicity. For all his calm politeness and respect, he had made many bold and dangerous moves without consulting us. I could see my own wariness reflected in Caecilia's expression as she carried our prisoner's other side.

"This way," the shirtless brute said, now rather apologetic in tone. We followed him through streets filled with rubble, fires both purposeful and uncontrolled, and swaths of amazed and dirty faces. To these, he repeatedly called out, "It's true! Conrad the Lover is here, in the city center. Go see for yourself. Food and allies are on their way!"

What would these people do if they knew that we had no actual ties to Amber Two? Or, indeed, Amber Three, for we were grey-class soldiers on a disavowed mission. Nobody would ever know the fate of this reeking half-dead woman once we carried her beyond the city limits, and nobody would ever know who we had beennot really.

We reached the clearing outside the city where the other half of our team awaited by the *Matilda* with the engines already fired up. My heart skipped a beat as I saw Flavia lying wounded within, but Trajan, Paulinus, Larentia, and Sampson gave us no opportunity to discuss her injuries. Guns were already out, and Trajan asked, "Who are these men?"

Caecilia shook her head and gave a wordless order with a tilt of her hand that only we would understand. The others knew not to talk or give away any information whatsoever; instead, Trajan had our other half drop their weapons and head on board.

The lead brute coughed politely and said, "Sir, we've been given a duty. We'll go with you until this woman reaches her destination."

Forced to play the role of new allies, Caecilia nodded graciously and said in the formal, "Your assistance is appreciated in a great degree." Back to the informal, she told these six other men, "We can use all the manpower we can get. It's not safe out here."

This time, the seats of the craft were all taken. Their six took up the opposite row, weapons lowered but still in hand; Caecilia, Paulinus, Septus, Sampson, Celcus, and I sat warily facing them. Trajan and Larentia took the pilot's and co-pilot's seat respectively, while Flavia and the prisoner lay on the floor attended by Noah. These positions I marked sharply and kept track of in my head, for my instincts told me the chance of conflict was very high. Our alliance was based on lies, and these menastonishingly dirty, scarred, grim-faced, and tested by violencehad only been invited back to the world of duty and honor an hour before. If they saw or heard something they didn't like, blood would be spilled.

Caecilia passed on her order, and Trajan nodded. After the pit in my stomach dropped with force due to the rising grip of the plane itself, we approached the center of the city and hovered down to a precarious depth. The ramp opened while we were still airborne, and Conrad waved to the people that were now his, shouted one last promise for coming aid, and then ascended into the plane with us. The ramp closed, we ascended, and Conrad nodded toward Caecilia for picking him up. Few words were exchanged, for the engines were still enormously loud, and only those with helmets or headsets could communicate.

"Let's get back to Amber Three and drop her off," Caecilia ordered with a hint of unhappiness. "Let's get back to our lives."

We were not the type to question, but I squeezed Celcus' wrist, and he said hesitantly, "Are we really going to give her over to that *thing?*"

"We don't know anything about her, and she's not one of us," our Centurion responded, her tone carrying a rare note of uncertainty. "It's not our problem."

At the front of the craft, Larentia turned around in her seat, gazed down at the mess of blood, dirt, and other foulnessand then she gave her sister a pointed look. She had a headset on, but she didn't need to say it.

"We have a problem," Trajan cut in. "The rift engine isn't working."

Caecilia unhooked her belts and climbed forward. "Is there an error?"

We looked on with concern as they tested a few controls. Conrad, too, clambered ahead, and the cramped forward section became a mass of arms and hands. The second test worked, and we transitioned to a new sky that was more green than blue; the third test failed; the fourth worked, and we flew through blue again; and so onuntil Caecilia was the one to say it out loud: "We can't get back."

Turning and addressing us, she elaborated, "We can only move laterally or closer to the center of this region. *We can't get back to Amber Three.*"

For those that had no helmet on, we shouted the news in various ears, and a sense of deep worry took hold among us. For those of us in the know, it seemed likely that our hand was being forced with regard to the prisoner. Noah looked up from cleaning her face with a cloth to give me the nod that indicated twice daily that we were being observed; I said, "It's watching us."

But it was too late, and Trajan had already activated the next rift jump.

There were no more greens or blues. The color outside was pure blank white, and the roar of the engines dimmed to a bare whisper. We were still flying at speed, but something had altered the vibrations and sounds around us. Caecilia looked to Conrad, but he just grinned with excitement and used a hand to say, *proceed.*

"Lower the back ramp," she ordered, and, as we all held on tightly, Larentia hit the button.

There was no roar or sudden blast of wind. Air was still moving, but this place was oddly smooth and quiet; we could see now that we were flying through a white tunnel of staggering scope. Behind us, hovering solidly and without effort of any kind, a white desk framed that same middle-aged woman with glasses and a sweater. 

Caecilia stepped down our open back ramp, testing the feebleness of the wind, and then stood at the very end. In any other sky, this would have meant falling and death, but, here, there was no buffeting. "We" She stopped, surprised at how well she could hear herself. At a more normal volume, she said, "We've got your prisoner."

Next to me, Noah shook. His voice was black. "*What did you do?*"

As Caecilia conversed with the woman at the desk, I told him, "That's the being we made a deal with. Sheitwanted the prisoner on Amber One in exchange for very important information."

"You" he breathed, his face contorted with emotions I could not recognize. "Oh, youyou *idiots.* That's the *Regret Demon.*"

His words caught not just my attention, but that of the grim men opposite us and my own brothers and sisters. I asked with some concern, "What's a demon?"

Conrad laughed at my question, but not unkindly. It was as if I was a child asking why the sky was blue.

Noah trembled mightily with what I now knew to be anger and fear. "Doesn't matter doesn't mattershit, shit." He looked around the inside of the craft rapidly, but saw nothing of use, and then explained, "That *thing*yes, it trades information, and it's bound by strange rules, but the one thing the Empire learned about it over the centuries was that everyone who trades with it ends up regretting the interaction very dearly. No matter how this plays out, you *will* regret making that deal."

"Everyone?" I asked in horror, sharing similar glances of surprise with the others. "But Amber Three made deals with it, too!"

He nodded unhappily.

"We can't get home," Celcus said, pulling off his belts. "They must be in trouble!"

I unbuckled myself, too, as did everyone else but Trajan and Larentia, who looked back repeatedly in confusion but focused on keeping the plane steady. Rushing aft, we gripped various holds at the top of the ramp, but Caecilia ignored us for the moment.

"So you yourself violated one of your laws by accepting delayed payment?" Caecilia asked, sliding a paper forward across that white desk. "And payment worth only personal vengeance, with no actual value to your people?"

"Damages were caused," the faux-woman said with chilling hatred. "At first accidental, and the situation was resolved. The prisoner from Amber One then did it again, *on purpose*, and with much greater scope. High-level spaces were torn asunder. Newly created entities were de-made and could not be recovered."

Beside me, Noah held onto a handle in the ceiling and said in shock, "Your children were killed when Cristina saved the people of the First World..."

Understanding the motive for our trade at the same time that we did, Caecilia gave a light bow of apology to the entity, but then shook her head. "Revenge won't bring them back."

"To not complete the deal would be a violation," the Regret Demon hissed, positively shaking with very human-like rage. "Violations are dealt with."

"A violation for you, or for us?" Caecilia asked, still wary. "Where do these rules come from? With whom did you sign a contract?"

The bespectacled woman behind the table froze for nearly four seconds, and then slid a paper forward.

Caecilia knocked it from the table, and it flew off into the distance behind us at a speed that belied the otherwise quiet and untroubling wind. "No more exchanges. The woman we recovered from Amber One has suffered more than enough. I'm sorry about your children, but I'll not turn any human being over to whatever you are."

To my left, past Noah, I saw Conrad nodding with surprised pride.

But the leader of the savage men from Amber One spoke up. "Um, sir, are you sure that's wise? Look at where we are..."

Caecilia clenched a fist and herded us into the plane proper without a word. Looking back, I watched the middle-aged woman behind that eerie hovering desk; she shook with pain, as if tortured by invisible strings. It hadn't occurred to me that she might be a real person in the thrall of the Regret Demon, and I started to say somethingbut strange long limbs of what looked like brain tissue emerged from out of sight and shot toward us; Caecilia shouted, and Trajan slammed the jump engine online.

We emerged into a blue sky full of roaring wind let in by the open back ramp, and he commented over the radio, "I tried a lateral move just in case the way home is still blocked."

"Good," Caecilia told him, clapping his shoulder and shaking slightly with the weight of her decision. "Let's"

"Behind us!" someone roared, and we all turned our heads to see that the rift the *Matilda* had opened was now being forced wider by clawing grey, fleshy, and corrugated limbs. It receded into the distance apace, but something huge began to emerge, and we could do nothing but stare as the rounded silhouette of some shrouded monstrosity barreled through the clouds after us. Trajan dodged left into a heavy cloud bank and we all collectively grabbed something and tied ourselves to various holds; Celcus and I bent down and lifted Flavia and our prisoner into seats and belted them in. My sister was too pained to speak, but she thanked me with a squeeze from the hand of her unbroken arm; it was likely we were about to die, but I was grateful that her death would not be my fault in the end.

A bellow beyond all sound shook our craft and our bodies; we covered our ears, but the sound was in our minds. Through the open rear of the ship, we could see the true form of the Regret Demon approachinga mass of brain tissue as wide as a mountain, with no mouth or eyes or sensory organs to speak of; neural tissue transformed into knotted multi-jointed limbs, and metal spikes emerged at the ends to point growing light at us.

"Dive!" Caecilia screamed, and Trajan and Larentia threw our stomachs up into our hearts as piercing beams sliced clouds in twain above us. "Jump again!"

"Another twenty seconds 'til recharge," Larentia replied in warning while Trajan jerked the controls left, right, up, and down.

Moving with the vomitous sway, Caecilia gave us an order we all already understood: it was time to fight. Bracing against the wall, I aimed my rifle alongside a dozen others. This was more or less the definition of an impossible shot, but we had bullet spam on our side; firing in succession as our window of open air moved unpredictably around the sight of the brain-beast soaring after us, we let a trail of orange dashes guide us to the closest limbs. In this, the men from Amber One were as adept as us, and our unified effort tore apart the first two laser weapons.

I couldn't hear their whoop of success, for the repeated gunfire was painfully loud even over the roar of the engines and the dampening effect of my helmet; we survived the twenty seconds and jumped to a green sky.

Our hearts fell as claws tore open this next rift in our wake.

Celcus screamed, "We can't escape it that way!"

As he leaned with each turn of the ship and held on confidently to a handle in the wall, Conrad commented, "This is fantastic. Absolutely fantastic. I'm glad I woke up for this."

Glaring daggers at him, Caecilia ordered us, "We have no choice. Build the sapphire turret."

A vision of what we had done in the city of the mind-controlled citizens hit me; I could not help with this. My teammates had no such barrier. It was dangerous and difficult work bolting down the base components of the turret in the middle of the wind-ravaged floor while inertia shifted wildly around us, but Celcus, Sampson, Paulinus, and Septus managed to contribute pieces in between the worst moments while the rest of us did our best to suppress the closest emerging lasers. Some sliced very near, wiping away clouds around our craft, and the brain Demon grew inexorably closer with each dodge that wasted precious speed.

By the time my brothers had the turret barrels and firing mechanism locked in and ready, the beast was upon us. Limbs reached out not to shoot us, but to grasp us directly, and that roar in the mental plane sent earthquakes through our minds a second time. Our screams rang out, but one was out of determination, not pain. Giving the controls to Larentia, Trajan had clambered back to take responsibility. He gripped the handles of the sapphire turret a second time

And our mistake became apparent. We had constructed it far enough back that we were still in the protected zone, but ice grew along the rear of the craft as the turret drained all the energy from the space around it.

Sudden silence fell as our engines went quiet.

For one eternal terrifying moment, we coasted along on pure momentumand then, like that first drop over a rollercoaster that I dreaded so much, we began to fall.

Trajan smashed against the ceiling and then slid; Sampson grabbed him and roared in pain at the stress on his arm as the *Matilda* began to rotate faster and faster. I flung my arm out to help, but I couldn't quite reach; my multi-tool extended a span farther and snapped around Trajan's forearm as sheer centrifugal force pinned us against uneven metal. Losing all sense of direction and action, I fought the blanket of pain to stay awake; I saw one of the engines release a momentary blast of blue fire, but fail to ignite. Even despite the total tumult, Larentia was *trying.*

Out the open rear ramp, light green and dark green traded places at a blinding pace. I couldn't catch sight of the horror that had been after us, but it didn't matter. Deep jade fog blasted into the cabin, and I could no longer see anything at all.

Another engine roar sounded, this time on both sides, and the force pinning me down ebbed; our spinning was slowing, but we were still dropping like a stone. I tried to take in the faces of those I loved, but they were hidden from me by darkness and jade. The roar turned, and we began to drop less fiercely, but it was too late. The front window and the rear ramp exploded at the same time, and the floor crumpled beneath us. Something cracked in half, and I was thrown free onto weirdly mossy earth. I bounced twice and then lay still for fifty heartbeats, stunned.

Overwhelming adrenaline, yes. Total shock and panic, yes. But I had reached the ground aliveand I was not alone. After several panicked moments checking myself for any serious wounds, I looked up.

Our prisoner was up and on her feet, limping away. How was she even conscious, let alone mobile?

Clambering up myself, I followed her on shaky legs into the jade gloom. "Stop!" I told her, grabbing her by the arm. "We don't know what's out there. We have to get back to the plane and help the wounded. Stick together."

She could hear me, but she didn't want to listen. She struggled weakly, even sobbed once when she realized that determination was not enough. "I have to" She coughed away pain in her lungs. "I have to get back. My son needs me."

"We'll get back," I told her, grabbing her as she fell limp to the organic ground. "For now, you have to stick with us. But as soon as you're better, we'll help you find your son. I promise."

I shivered mightily with the fading of the adrenaline in my veins. I was like Conrad now, making promises I could not keep, but I understood why he might have done such a thing. Still feeling the whirling vortex of sensations that had brought us down to earth so forcefully, I just kept repeating the lie that everything would be alright.

	<TEXT> It's really easy to think that messing with format will convey the descent into insanity. In a way, that will get the job done, but it's like painting a portrait with a broom instead of a brush.

It's very important to set up basic conceits that *don't* change for an insanity story. One of the required conceits is that the main character believes either explicitly or implicitly in the soundness of his own logic. Read "The Telltale Heart" by Edgar Allan Poe - seriously, it's short, and he does this masterfully. The main character insists you'll understand him if you just let him spell out the logic of what happened.

Poe does use changes in format like you suggested, but only as part of the climax in the last couple paragraphs. Otherwise, the descent into insanity has to be done with steps that each make sense. You want the reader to want your main character to succeed. You want the reader to root for him being sane and this all being an elaborate hoax or supernatural happening.

You can do that with tools that are surprisingly mundane. For example, you can create a surreal moment with something as simple as the main character saying or doing something and another character giving an inappropriate reaction. That lets the main character blame the strangeness on the other person while still acknowledging that something is wrong. For instance,

Action: I smiled, waved, and told the passerby, "How'd'y'do?"

Reaction: The man grimaced at me in disgust and hurried on.

Justification: Confused, I stared after him. He must have been angry with something; I must have caught him at a bad moment.

Of course, one instance like this is nothing, but if everybody you meet seems crazy, maybe you're the crazy one, and our reader will start picking up on that as the main character increasingly realizes it, too, but doesn't want to accept it. Introspection is a big part of this. For instance, after a few more encounters like the example above, the main character might start wondering "What did I *really* say to that passerby?" - i.e. shifting the suspicion from the other to the self - and perhaps he'll record his own voice and play it back and find out he's not saying what he thinks he's saying. Now you have a whole new level of justifications to work through... is there a supernatural issue? A physical one (brain speech center)? etc... because "I'm insane" is the absolute last thing anyone will accept.

To round it back to the point about conceits that don't change, the one in these examples is that the insanity 'issue' is with speech and that he's thinking one thing but saying another. It's important that the *kind* of insanity the main character experiences is consistent, and that has to be something you stick with through the whole story. Is he experiencing wrong emotions? Are his perceptions coming apart? At the end of the day (and the story), the madness has to make sense, or you lose the reader. And a consistent type of madness keeps you from doing too much. Even just a little bit of madness makes life very difficult; too much makes life impossible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Conrad sat listening to us in the gardens. His light brown hair was cut short, worn not medium-length as I had seen in pictures and movies my entire life, but nearly shaven in either a military or medical style. Too, he was clean-cut, rather than sporting the two-pronged beard with which he had often been classically depicted; yet without these regal hallmarks and even in nothing more than a medical gown he was still a highly composed man with noble bearing and piercing brown eyes. When he looked at each of us, I knewunlike the Legateshe truly saw us. Our higher-ranking commanders had ushered us through the inception of this mission, but had never really known any of us besides Caecilia. I still remembered with some impact how Legate Blue had called me by my rank rather than my name despite the fact that we had all been negotiating with an unknown entity in a clearly manufactured alternate reality environment. When all my other military allies had been my veritable brothers and sisters throughout my life, the Legate's lack of bond with us had felt strange and demeaning.

This man had no trouble focusing on us as individuals, and he had even been willing to speak Middle English so that Noah could mostly understand our conversations. It was similar to our informal conjugations and thus akin to the most-spoken language of the Empire at large, and our Imperator had continually refined his verbiage as he'd learned on the fly from us. His aptitude was astonishing, for not two hours later he almost sounded like a native. "And you, Septus, a seventh son of your household? Then, despite the recent troubles, I take it the dynasty fares well. They have been fruitful and multiplied."

Septus took the praise with a slight seated bow, but then offered, "We are half the number now that we were only months ago."

Conrad leaned forward and clasped him on the shoulder while looking left and right to each of us. "Fear not, for consider *my* perspective. You were mere thousands when you went into our ten branch worlds, and now you are billions. You lived in tents while the worlds grew and while you carved out the infrastructure that would run the heart of the Empire. Now grand cities dot your globes, and it sounds like they survived the devastation with the same fortitude you all have displayed in reaching this place." He leaned back and watched us carefully for our reactions to his next question. "Tell me, did you do it alone, or do you have the support of the Sixth Millennial?"

Now that was an odd question; I had heard Noah once call something 'out of left field' as an analogy from the Empire sport baseball, and that phrase came back to me now. As a group, we exchanged confused glances and shakes of our heads. I saw that Noah in particular had his eyes narrowed. I think I knew him well enough by now to guess that he was immediately wary of any Unknown Capitalized Thing.

After seeing our reactions and visibly judging them to be genuine, Conrad said, "A shame. Statistically, the birth of a sixth reality bender by now should have been a virtual certainty. Fear of the new millennia was a clich even in *my* youth, but, as they say, it *has* been a thousand years. Humanity is due for another exceptional personage; whether hero or villain, undoubtedly they will be of immense stature. They always are." His gaze went distant for the first time since he had awoken. "More than a shame. I don't anticipate much of anything anymore, but I suppose I was holding out some small mortal hope that something *interesting* would come along in this era."

"And we could use help very badly right about now," Noah added, his expression dark, but Conrad didn't seem to hear him.

When our Imperator's eyes finally refocused on us, he gave a small appreciative smile and said, "You ten will have to do instead."

It was Caecilia who understood his meaning and thought of the question first. "What of the Fifth Milliennial, sir? What of your wife?"

His face was absolutely neutral as he spoke, but his voice was tinged with deep sorrow. "Dead, for perhaps five years now."

"Only five? She survived in exile all this time?"

"Not survived, no," he corrected her with a gentle smile. "But she did exist for most of the last eight centuries. This place is one of hers. The whole region is rife with her influence; her technology burrows between realities and grows under the earth in vast networks that use the energies of the planets' molten cores to operate. Here." He raised a hand.

**Yes, sir?** The device-laden black sphere approached from among the trees where it had been waiting to be of service.

"Call up a map of the region," Conrad ordered, and I imagined he had used that same kind but commanding tone to talk to servants in the Palace of the Roman Emperor before our worlds had ever existed.

A hologram comprised of light blue wires appeared in front of the sphere, carved out of the air by multiple budding light emitters. **Will this three-dimensional approximation do, sir?** 

"Yes. Highlight allied technology, please."

We did gasp slightly as bright red appeared throughout the lay of little blue Earths. At that scale, it appeared as an omnipresent crimson hue, but the assistant sphere zoomed in to show us an individual planet and the millions of little red filaments snaking throughout its entire crust right down to the heat within. It looked like a nervous systemor perhaps veins and arteriesfrom the medical textbooks I still carried with me. I wondered if there was a massive Heart somewhere to which all these biomechanical conduits led.

But the energetic technological biosystem was not present on all the blue globes shown.

**Curious, sir. It appears three new realities have entered the region somehow.**

"Yes," Conrad said with a compassionate grin. He patted the sphere on its smooth device-free top. "Yes, my friend. Like the hundreds of worlds that fell among ours five years ago, these three have arrived from elsewhere, and it does seem that one of them is very close to here. That is Amber One, I take it? The aim of your mission?"

Caecilia judged our support, for his intent was obvious, and then she channeled that support herself in the hopes of handling what was coming next. "Yes, sir, it is."

"Then I will lead you on this mission," he stated, already on his feet and moving before he finished the words. "And perhaps I'll see something more interesting than these cursed chrome corridors."

As a group, we hesitated.

He stopped and faced us. "You must obey my orders, for I am still legally your Imperator, yes?"

Caecilia nodded, but said nothing.

His expression became a self-deprecating smirk. "Your Imperator in name, perhaps, but not by earned right. In that case, I'll ask thusly: rather than lead before proving myself, may I ride with you ten on your mission as an observer?"

"Well, yes," she replied. "Also"

His read on our feelings had been correct, but we *had* been collectively prepared to follow him, for that was simply our way. Our true reason for hesitating had been a bit more difficult to express than that. He gave us a slight bow, still oblivious, and then turned and walked away while his spherical assistant desperately tried to hold the open rear of his gown closed as he moved.

Caecilia's mutter was deadly serious. "Anybody who laughs while he's in earshot will have to run two leagues tonight."

I held my mouth with my hand and locked eyes with Flavia while we tried our best not to giggle like we were academy cadets all over again and trading stories in the bunks after lights out. Paulinus put a palm to his forehead, Trajan walked away red-faced, Septus blinked and stared, Celcus and Sampson made faces to hold back laughing, and Noah raised an eyebrow. For all the horrors that were about to follow, I would never forget that moment. Sometimes, life is just too absurd to take seriously, and I loved every single one of them so much that none of what happened after tarnished that one stupid laugh we all shared when the immortal creator of our entire world finally turned away down the hall and took his bare bottom out of sight.

After letting the snickering burst free for a few moments, Larentia clapped her hands and, prompted by her blonde teammate's exasperated expression, spoke quickly. "Alright, let's pull it together. We've got preparation to do. You all know your tasks."

The group began to split and head down different hallways, and I found myself transitioning out of the group mindset which so easily absorbed me when I was with them; now I had to walk alone. Each had their assignments, such as searching the facility for useful medicines, studying information available on the computers, or getting surgeries to fix thigh wounds and other injuries. *My* only job was the most difficult one possible as far as I was concerned, and I wouldn't have done it if I didn't deeply respect its issuer. My task was to *relax* and *do nothing* and *de-stress.*

I walked the halls with a grumpy frown.

The lack of echoes and reflections in the chrome walls had me seeking out tucked away bathrooms and the like in search of a mirror. What had begun as an idle desire to check if the surgical machines had altered my cheek and temple scars became an angry search for reflective surfaces, but I continued to find nothing but faded rectangular stains. The facility was enormous in scope and seemed to go down level after level; I stopped at the fifth floor down and began to wonder at the sheer size of the place. Had the Yellow Empress built this out of hope that one day she would have people to take care of once again?

Five years.

She'd finally died only five years ago.

I simply couldn't wrap my mind around it. It was all starting to blur together now, but I'd been in my second year at the academy then, with a new family growing tighter bonds as I came to grips with the loss of Sampson from my life. Judging by what Noah had told us about the extradimensional impact that had started all this and nearly destroyed the Empire, I actually thought I could remember the *exact moment*. Deep in the structure of the Empire and protected by two Shields as we were, it had only been a shiver, but that disquieting vibration had left me haunted for the rest of the day. The Amber Worlds did not experience earthquakes, not *ever*not with the crust and inner heat so full of technology and constantly managed by the best of the best. Everyone else had shrugged it off, and the Legates had sent out a message explaining it as a minor technical oversight, so I hadn't thought about it again until that solitary realization in that quiet chrome hallway.

Alone. I was alone. This whole place had a quiet low hum about it, but I was deep enough that I knew I would hear no voices or footfalls in these anechoic tunnels. When was the last time I had been alone? I felt like a limb in a larger animal; like a member of a unit, but, at times, not a whole person myself. That had recently been changing as I had begun to think about the questions my brothers and sisters refused to entertain, but never had I felt it more fully than sitting in true solitude with nothing but my own thoughts. I tapped the wall, and, hearing no echo, I called out, "Hello?"

Nobody answered, and nobody could hear me. I was safely ensconced five floors down. My call became a happy shout, and, upon hearing no reply or activity, I screamed an excited forbidden word at the top of my lungs. A weight seemed to lift from my chest as I realized I could shout whatever I wanted; no, *think* whatever I wanted. Nobody could tell me I was wrong or silence my questions, even if there was also nobody there to answer them.

It was a strange thing to be smiling so broadly and feel so free while also crying profusely. A terrible pain flowed as fire through my core, and I understood why Caecilia had ordered me to do nothing. I had spent so much of my life running, fighting, training, competing, and performing that I was now finding resolution only in stillness and silence; like the Time of Sickness, this was another forced medical leave, and I had no choice but to face the things that had happened to me.

Just me.

Only me.

Noah I understood, because he had shared many stories from his past in private with me. It made sense to me that he would be immune to the purple tempest, for his mind operated on a vector orthogonal to ours; not better or worse, just different. But for every single one of my brothers and sisters to also ride unaffected? It made *no sense*, and I didn't want to admit that it felt unfair, but the torturous experience had yet again set me apart and left me with feelings I could not share. None of them understood. None of them *could* understand. Smiling with relief and sobbing openly and freely because I would not be heard, I let the feelings move through me in exquisite pain and release; usually, I would have gone to my grandfather for salvation from this, but I was on my own for this one.

And then I gave a long exhalation and let myself be calm. "It happened," I said to no one. "It happened to *me* and me alone, and nothing can change that. I'm alive, and I can move forward."

Judging by what had happened in the old well by my home when I had been sick, trapped, rained on, and furious at existence, I knew Noah would be sensing my sharp distress and heading my way; perhaps he was on an elevator or a stairwell even now and moving downward. I closed my eyes, breathed in and out, and sent a purposeful ripple flavored by the feeling *it's alright, I'm alright*and he moved off, leaving me to my solitude.

In fact, free to do anything and everything I wanted for the entire night, I became seized by the sudden notion of further exploration. Just how far down did this place go? On my feet and leaving my cheeks wet to carry the immense release and relief with me for a time longer, I found more stairs and began descending at speed. At times, I even leapt landing to landing. Down, down, downthe further I went, the more space there was between me and the worlds of man; the greater the depth, the less any of those concerns mattered.

Ten.

Fifteen.

Twenty.

This was less a hospital and more a bunker! The depths became both chill and hot at the same time, and I began taking elevators as the stairs ended. This was a very special place built carefully for Conrad the Lover by his Yellow Empress, I imagined, so I guessed that not all her remnant facilities were like this. The heat increased as the elevators continued to take me down, but I heard massive air circulating machines groan to life in response to my presence, and cool breezes kept me confident about continuing.

Running 'round pylons now cold and dirty black rather than chrome, I came to an elevator that was the antithesis of the ones before it. Those had been clean and polished. This was grimy, open-grated, uncouth, and every bit the access to the *true* basement I had been looking for. I gazed through the grating into the darkness below; this was more a construction shaft than anything else, and I was absolutely enamored by this new emotion that I had never felt before. I simply couldn't resist.

What was it? I couldn't put a name to it. As my heart became a turret-gun firing at phantom fears inside my ribcage, I stepped on, hit the large green button, and grabbed old metal as the carriage shook into motion and began descending into the dark.

This part I hadn't anticipated. Was there supposed to be a light somewhere? As the maintenance elevator squealed and moved, I wondered who exactly was supposed to keep this place up. Had it not been maintained in eight hundred years? Or was it repaired by machines? In that case, why this rickety elevator? I had sudden visions of the exposed cable snapping and sending me down into limitless rock and concrete, either dying on impact or being lost forever. Holding on tightly, I waited, and the journey seemed to take all eternityat least until I blinked and began noticing a very slight hint of violet. Immediately tense at this most hated of colors, I railed at what I had gotten myself into, and steeled myself for danger. A slow second heartbeat joined the rapid cadence of my own, this one far heavier.

But this violet was a few shades brighter and contained a bit more blended white light than the purple of the storms.  The elevator came to a stop, and I stepped out onto hot rock against a tremendous knotted artery.

This was it. This was exactly what Conrad had shown us. Biotechnological masses curved up into the root of the facility, practically glowing in certain portions with pulsing violet-white energies; from left to right, the artery continued on in both directions, five times my height. This was one small growing tendril of the region-wide nervous system the Yellow Empress had grown out here over the last eight centuries. I could literally feel it pulsing with life; moving forward in awe, I put out a hesitant hand. The very air flowed with the rhythm of its beat, and I had no doubt now there was a Heart somewhere at the center of all of this. It was warm, smooth, and benign.

And it grew at my touch. Flexible metals extended out after my fingers, following the course I set as if I was magnetic. It was life moving to life, warmth to warmth, though its heat came from the Earth's molten core and mine came from flesh and blood. I recognized this sensation, for I had come to know it from Heath: it wanted to help. From what I knew, the Yellow Empress had built her works out of love, not hate, and her exile and death had not changed that core that she had poured into her creations.

But I did pull back as my proximity to such great living energies began to confuse my senses in exactly the way I had been so traumatized on my way here. Floaty, slightly dissociated, losing my sense of time and place, I moved away immediately and retreated to the ancient elevator with a haunted gaze locked on pulsing violet as if to make sure the glowing biotechnology would not somehow follow. This artery and that stormthey couldn't be connected, could they? Part of me refused to believe that. This was wonderful, while *that* had been horrible. One was violet, one was purple. Different. Different enough. I shook my head.

The long journey back up brought sense and calm back to me, and I found the room I had woken up in. I lay down to sleep exhausted, and without seeking out anyone else. I was not yet ready to be among others again.

The sleep was good. Oh yes, the sleep was wonderful. Even though Celcus woke me up early with a careful hand on my hair, I felt well rested and whole again; my body and mind had both forgiven me and re-pledged their support to the cause.

"Get up," he said softly. "We're heading out."

"Already?"

"You missed quite a bit."

Sitting up, I asked curiously, "Like what?"

His grin widened to disbelieving delight.

Mine became just as big as he led me out onto the hangar floor. "We've got a *plane?*"

He held his arms up toward the massive but elegant black raven that sat before us. "We've got a *plane!*"

As the engines roared blue heat and the ceiling of the hangar opened by mechanical action, I hefted my pack and ran up to the open back ramp after Celsus. Everyone was already inside, and Conrad himself sat in the copilot's seat guiding Trajan at the controls. Larentia stood behind them, also learning. As I stepped into the ship proper, Caecilia motioned for me to sit in one of the numerous seats lining both sides. As I chose a seat next to my sister, who squeezed my hand, Caecilia asked, "How are you feeling?"

"Better," I told her truthfully. "Much better."

"Good."

"What's this all about?"

She gazed around with me at the inner cabin of the powerful craft. "We've got to get to North America somehow."

"For Noah?" I asked, looking over at him in surprise.

"Well, yes," she replied. "But that's also where the off-world prisoner is, according to the scattered radio chatter Paulinus spent all night logging."

I locked eyes with Paulinus, who nodded and said, "There is no doubt. The situation on Amber One is very dark, and the citizens there think retribution may quell the chaos."

Beside me, Flavia added, "I was listening, too. It sounds like we have to hurry."

I still couldn't get over the beauty of having an entire airship at our command. "So this was just *here?*"

"Nope," Celcus said across from me, his expression gleeful. "This place has an automated manufacturing bay. Conrad ordered the computers to build a plane and it didin just twelve hours."

I couldn't believe it, and I gaped and ran a hand over the wall behind me, imagining that it was still warm from construction. "So this plane didn't exist last night?"

"Nope," Septus said, laughing.

Sampson joined him. "You're late to the party. We've had all night to get over our amazement."

I stuck out my tongue at him and turned away imperiously. "I was busy *exploring.*"

"Oh yeah?" Sampson asked, leaning closer from the opposite row of seats. "What'd you find?"

Celcus began to speak up, but the rear ramp began to lift, and the growing roar of the engines drowned out all conversation. Celcus and Sampson seemed to glare at each other for a moment; I looked to my left at Flavia, who gripped her seat's belts and stayed focused on breathing as the craft begin lifting from the ground on jets turned vertical.

There were no windows on the sides, but I could see over Trajan's and Conrad's shoulders, and the rim of the world fell away as we rose. As our momentum changed from vertical to horizontal, the overwhelming noise of flight smoothed and calmed into a sort of constant undercurrent, and I was finally able to shout, "*What exactly is our flight plan? How do we cross an ocean and three realities?*"

Caecilia touched her ear and frowned; Flavia leaned close to me and shouted right in my ear, "Too loud! We're... going... very... fast!"

She turned her head and I shouted mouth-to-ear: "How... get... Amber... One?"

On the other side of her, our leader had grown exasperated, and she began passing down our helmets. Donning mine alongside them, I found the roar quite dampened, and our inset radios were more than operable. I said again, "How do we get to Amber One?"

At this, Caecilia gave a gesture that said *watch this* before reaching over and patting Trajan on the shoulder.

He seemed to know what she meant, and he dialed some controls and pulled a major red lever down. I sensed heightened electromagnetism that made the hair on the back of my neck stand on end, and a violet rectangle tore open in the air visible through the front windshield. With a flash and a shake, we entered the next reality.

That got me. I was finally fully infected with the same sense of awe and excitement that had taken the rest of my team. This was, as an Empire citizen might term it, *very cool.*

Over the radio, I asked Conrad, "What else can that machine bay build?"

He tapped his helmet. "Well, this headgear first; a motorized bike second; then this aircraft when the plan was further refined."

Still awed, I asked, "What's it called?"

"This aircraft?" He turned his head toward the front, and I knew he was looking out the front at the passing clouds. "The *Matilda*, after Gisela's and my eldest daughter. I suppose this is my way of honoring her now that the cathedral in Germany that holds her remains no longer exists after the destruction of the First World."

I gulped, but could only think to say, "It's a beautiful name."

He nodded slightly, but said only, "Yes." I could not see his expression behind his visor, but I had the impression that he was a man weighed down by far too many memories.

"Why now?" Noah asked suddenly, his tone rather accusatory.

Conrad turned his helmeted head and regarded our other observer.

"Why are you active now?" Noah elaborated.

"Do you think I lay staring at the ceiling for eight hundred years?" our Imperator replied. "Even boredom grows boring, and mania has often driven me to random wanderings or self-education. Make no mistake, I move now only because you are new and interesting. When this crisis is over, perhaps in a year, or five, or ten, or a hundred, I have no doubt I will go back to staring at the ceiling of whatever bed I find myself in. Immortality is a curse; a sin against God."

Many of us looked at each other in askance. I was the one who spoke. "What's that?"

Noah made frantic but subtle silencing motions with his hand, and Conrad seemed to take that cue, sigh, and explain, "Sinnaginstgahd is... a Frankish word meaning 'cyclical trap'. Like a cycle of vengeance, or a no-win scenario."

"A Catch-22," Noah offered hastily.

Conrad shrugged and turned away from us, and, though I felt something odd about the exchange, I, too, shrugged. It was not the first word spoken by Conrad that I had not fully understood, and I was sure it would not be the last. He was a man out of time and culture.

The constant droning sound was surprisingly relaxing, and, while my family talked and joked around me, I sat in content silence watching them while drifting in and out of a half-awake state. By the time we began nearing our objective, the sky was full of fusion orange. We had been chasing the setting sun for most of the day, but it was finally getting ahead of us, and the smoke-shrouded city below appeared as a series of evening-shadowed pillars clawing up at us and beset by intermittent fires. I found it hard to tell this one apart from the others. I understood why it looked similar to New Rome, but it also stood similar to the controlled polis we had partially destroyed; that one, and to cities in the Empire I had seen in movies. The closeness in history that all our worlds and sister Earths shared was surprising. If not for the shape of the land itself, I would have no idea where I was. 

My heart rate began to rise as the drop approached. I had long hidden my secret terror of falling out and up into darkness from all those in my life, but I'd done this once before in training and once before with the original owner of my silver bracelet; I knew I would be alright as long as daylight remained. As we strapped on our parachutes, I tensed, and wished for my teammates to hurry.

Addressing Conrad as he put on equipment, Caecilia asked, "Sir, you're coming with us?"

"Doubtless. This will be incredibly engaging. I've never thought to jump out of a plane on purpose before."

He seemed excited rather than worried, and his attitude helped me feel a little better until I began to question whether he understood the risk to us as mortals. I resolved to ask Noah later if he could sense Conrad's emotions, or if he, too, was unreadable. So far, Conrad had come off as a sensible and level-headed leader, and I hoped that would remain true, but my residual feelings about the Legates kept me from blindly trusting him no matter who he was to our culture and world.

Trajan and Larentia remained in the forward seats to pilot the craft to the rendezvous point. For the first time that I had seen, Caecilia's four would not be moving together, and she nodded at me to indicate that she now trusted us the same way. The rear ramp opened and loosed a tremendous rush of air; one by one, we were off. I did not hesitate as my brothers and sisters leapt out before me, but I found with immediate horror that Caecilia had timed this jump for the exact passing of the twin oceans of twilight and eve. As I arced away from the plane and down after the falling helmeted forms soaring between wide columns of smoke, light transitioned into darkness, and my heart seized in my chest.

Losing the arc and any control over smooth descent, I tumbled. Caecilia and Conrad were the only ones behind me, and I heard them shouting over the radio, but my thoughts were paralyzed. Black flame-filled void and a mountainous ocean the color of fusion fire cycled madly in my vision, taking away my grip on *up* and *down* and hitting me harder with that terrible fear out of my vulnerable childhood. My mortally panicked pulse hammered against my skull, trying to knock me unconscious, but I shook with pain rather than let it take me. It was as if I had always known that I would die this wayfalling up into limitless lonelinessand I could already see them finding me on the ground some hours later. Caecilia would say, *I should have known she wasn't ready to go back into the field.* Celcus would say, *I loved her*, and perhaps some line about how pretty he thought I was that nobody would counter because we simply do not speak ill of the dead. Sampson would give his trademark taciturn glare, and Flaviano. No. Just no. I could not bear to think of her so pained. Instead I saw Septus leaning over me and gripping my shattered limbs, perhaps saying, *Venita was a good friend.*

Wait. He was really there in my vision, grabbing me. He was saying something in my helmet, too, but I couldn't understand him in the depths of my seizure; he embraced me tightly, locked something, and pulled a cordthe force of sudden resistance tore him back, ripped something between us, and sent him off into the distance with a dark plume overhead as I kept falling.

"Is she unconscious?" someone demanded, and this I understood.

"I think so!" Septus replied. "I lost hold of her!"

For the second time in my life, an entire city was reaching up with its broken claws to grip me; I had a feeling I would see that movie theater in my mind again very soon. I pushed so very hard against the walls of panic, but could not quite bring myself to move coherently. The columns of smoke had grown wider and hotter, and I was starting to make out details of rooftops as the curve of the world grew flatter at speed.

It was too late. I was well below the height to safely activate my parachute. Straining as hard as I could, I managed to choke out, "*Why?*", but the overpowering flux of chaotic emotions gave me no answer. I was two beings, reallya thinker and an animal. The animal had acquired a severe hidden weakness in its biological programming while initially growing to maturity, and that vulnerability had been hit; it had lost all control of itself. As I fell, I managed to stare at my arm, and my multi-tool began moving in response to the thinker in me. But it, too, activated at random, and I knew I was lost as black fire-mirroring windows shot up past me. We had been aiming for the rooftop of the tallest building in the city, and I had nearly made it, and been first among my team to do sobut now its floors soared up as I soared down.

Forceful arms and legs surrounded me without warning as someone went in for another try, but I screamed at them as I realized that they had just doomed themselves in trying to save me. My screams went ignored. A sudden jerk struck the wind from my lungs. The parachute had opened, yes, but we were still dropping at tremendous speed. Worse, we slammed into the rapid side of the building with bone-cracking force; still, my bearer did not let go. It was all they could do to hold on, and, as the light of uncontrolled fires dispelled the darkness and snapped me out of my particular kind of terror, I found the grips and tried to guide us as best I could despite the adrenaline rush of flying so fast through obstacles so close. We bounced against the side of another building, and my bearer went limp; holding on to the parachute grips with only my hands, I clamped my fingers shut with extreme intent. The thought of free-falling another twenty stories

We flew over a highway, barely missing bent lampposts and abandoned cars. The land fell away beyond, giving us more time, and I aimed for a wide swath of pitch darkness. Timing it for an instant before we hit that true void, I released the parachute, and we rocketed down into the city's main river. Water surrounded me, choked me, even tried to suck me down with all the weight of the parachute, but we were far enough out of it that I could turn around now, dive down, and bring my savior up from the chill void. Now fully back in the strength of my training, I swam us both back to shore, wondering the entire time whether it was Celcus or Sampson who had broken himself saving me.

But when I laid my teammate on the night-clad shore and removed her helmet, it was neither. Flavia lay before me broken, bleeding, and unconscious. She'd gone underwaterwas she breathing?! After checking for a pulse and breathing, I screamed, took a deep breath, and took a moment to recall what I'd read in Otho's books. Ok, turn the drowning person's head to the side, allow water to drain from the mouth and nose. Ok, done. Turn the head back to center. Pinch the nose, strongly breathe four times into the mouth of the injured person, ok. Her lips were freezing, and I cursed at what that indicated, but I put my ear near her mouth and waited.

"Get... off... me," she whispered.

I pulled back and began breathing myself as she turned and began coughing out water.

We sat in pained silence while waiting for the rest of our team. A new feeling was eating away at me, and I guessed it to be guilt. How could I have let this happen? Why had I frozen so hard? I wanted my death to mean something, and dying that way would have been absurd. Worse, if Flavia had died

"Don't," she murmured as she lay on the muddy riverbank next to me. "Your face. You're blaming yourself."

I shook my head forcefully. "That was stupid. You got hurt to save me from my own stupidity."

"No," she insisted, locking her eyes on mine. "I once nearly jumped from something and died, but you saved me. I love you, *stulta*. This is what we do."

I could only gulp away rising pain and nod slowly. There was no time for more than that, for the others came running down from the high road above, and numerous hands and eyes began checking her condition.

"Paulinus and Sampson," Caecilia ordered, choosing the two strongest men. "Make something to carry her on here, then take her to the rendezvous point. Once you're there, do what you can with splints and bandages. She's broken an arm and a leg at least; two of her ribs, maybe more." Our leader contemplated me for a long moment, and then, rather than reprimanding me, ordered me up. "Let's go." She didn't have to say it; I knew I would answer for this after the mission.

Down to just myself, Celcus, Septus, Caecilia, Conrad, and Noah, we crept through the streets. Trying our best not to look like a military crew, we moved with guns hidden, our helmets stashed in our packs, and our stances open. Someone might take a shot at us, but Caecilia was betting against there being snipers. Crowds moved through the streets in waves of rioting and looting; there would be no military-level resistance. 

The faces passing us in fire-lit darkness were angry, dirty, hungry, and scared. The power was out, and, by our intel, had been out for quite some time. Nobody was in command. Nobody was in control. I stared at these proponents of chaos with disbelief. How was this disorder possible? Amber One had been like us; we were strong, and we would prevail. These people had given in to baser fearswell, on that, I could not judge them, for my injured Flavia was all I could think about, and that had been a consequence of the same weakness.

We came to the city center, a virtual mirror of ours, where Legate Blue had once given an inspirational speech and announced our conversion to military jurisdiction. Thousands of determined faces had gathered in lines to sign up. Here, those faces were a sea of exhausted pain and constant fear, and shirtless men with large muscles were shouting and roaring atop a stage to rile up the crowd. I didn't understand what we were seeing at first, until I recognized what was happening from historical movies. In a way, it made a sort of horrible sense: our worlds had been founded from a culture that had done this to criminals and prisoners.

I looked to Noah as we realized who was up there. Two hundred Noahs had been sent to this world during the crisis, and it seemed most of them now hung dead from crosses lining the city center.

That was why he didn't know what had happened to them. They'd been killed by a fearful and angry mob.

He didn't seem to react to this openly. Rather, he stood furious and stunned. I wondered: could he feel some remnant of what they had felt? A tear rolled out from each of his eyes, but he spared no time for himself. Instead he pushed forward and said in horrified compassion, "Cristina!"

Caecilia held him back with a forceful hand. "She's the off-world prisoner?"

Tearful and raging in silence to keep our cover, he nodded.

"Then it's too late. She's been up there for a long time. Probably died days ago."

"No," he countered flatly. "She's alive."

Caecilia frowned. "You saw her move?"

Jumping in to defend my friend as I realized he might be *sensing* her being alive rather than seeing it, I said, "I did. I saw her move."

"Then she'll have to hold out a few more hours," our leader said grimly. "There must be thousands of people here, and all of them armed. They're agitated and looking for someone to lash out at. We can't give them any excuse. The slightest attention here could be lethal."

She was right, and I felt a sickness forming in the pit of my stomach. Crucifixion was considered a barbaric and ancient form of capital punishment, and these people had strung up the ones they felt responsible. Here the citizens of Amber One stood, shouting for food and for anger, and I saw *none* of myself or our culture in them.

Septus spoke up. "Where's Conrad?"

We looked around, but it was too late. He was already onstage. Lifting his arms high, he said calmly and confidently, "My children! I have returned to you in your time of need."

In a single instant, the thousands around us went silent.

Caecilia gripped the gun hidden under her shirt and cursed. "Get ready," she told us quietly. "This is about to get *very* out of hand."

	<TEXT> Venita sat under the wide dome of the evening sky with an absently focused gaze marred only by omnipresent and sourceless brimming tears. Smooth orange overhead arced down to crumple on the horizon into various shades and colors; here, then, was persimmon, and there carrot, and to the left veritable tomato. Hints of green ran at random along the border of light and land like notes on a sheet of music; here, then, was mint, and there turquoise, and to the right a trace of eye-catching cyan. There was purple out there, too, but *that* color deserved no consideration. It was ugly and raw.

Celcus approached and hesitantly touched her back. "How are you doing, Venita?"

She remained in the dirt, her legs up, her arms around her knees. Without looking at him, she asked, "Who?"

Flavia appeared and gripped her left shoulder; Sampson sat and touch her right. She froze, eyes wide. She had experienced this moment in the tide of insanity. She had experienced this moment out of order. Time. It was always about Time. Surrounded by her family, pulled back to earth by their living touch, she gasped her spirit back in and returned to herself.

I.

She was an I.

I was an I.

And the storm was over.

Scraping earth in my fingers, I asked, "How are you all so solid? How did you get through that?"

They looked at each other, and then moved in front of me to block my view of the spilled-paint horizon. Their hands remained on my metal-clad arms, keeping me anchored. They consulted each other with unhappy glances and then Flavia told me, "It was just you, Venita."

Staring at her, I could only breathe, "*What?*"

"You were the only one the storm affected."

So the hand of that unknown all-seeing entity that might or might not exist had reached out to torture just me. Was it punishment for something? We had all been complicit in warfare so far. It wasn't fair. Shivering with after-stress, I finally turned my head and looked beyond our four elders around the fire; at the other side of the camp and at the other edge of the hill, Noah sat looking out at the opposite horizon and its oncoming darkness. It was still our secret that he could sense emotions, and that mine alone were sometimes tangible to him. Did that quality make me vulnerable in a way my brothers and sisters were not?

But I had been trained to handle trauma like this, and I knew the first step in moving forward was to take any step at all. With the help of three sets of hands, I shakily climbed to my feet and moved to the fire where Larentia was pouring tiny bits of water into Septus' open mouth.

"How is he?" I managed to ask with a weak voice.

"The same," she sighed, closing his mouth for him. "Vitals erratic. He won't last long like this."

I tried to speak, but the words failed me; I swallowed and said again, "We should hurry then."

Trajan and Paulinus looked up from their fireside conversation in surprise, but Caecilia didn't hesitate. Grabbing her backpack, she swung it up around her shoulders and mounted her bike. "Alright then. Let's go." The others hesitated, looking at me and then at our leader, but she barked, "Come on! If Venita says she's able, then we'll listen to her."

At that, everyone leapt up, and we embarked on a night ride. Our collective headlamps lit some distance ahead, but our speed was still limited. It was not a good idea to ride at night except in dire circumstances, but these were certainly thatand the path remaining to the unknown medical facility was supposedly very short.

Adrenaline rushed through me at the slightest touch from any night breeze. Each gust made the animal inside me react with bristling fear at the possible onset of another purple storm; in the dark, we would never see it coming. For some reason, it hadn't affected my brothers and sisters, but I just couldn't face what I had seen. Not again. I motioned to my teammates, and they switched with me to our family radio channel.

"What's up?" Celcus asked.

Flavia added, "How are you feeling?"

Sampson remained quiet, but to listen, not to ignore.

"I think I need to find my parents when we get back home," I told them, letting the previously unthinkable spill forth.

"Really?" my sister replied, surprised. "You literally never talk about them."

"Yeah," Celcus said. "I just assumed they were dead."

"No. They're aliveor they *were*, before the troubles. I don't know now. But I have questions for them that I need answered."

Sampson finally spoke. "We'll find them, Venita."

Yes. That would do. The exquisite pain of insanity was not that it was wholly torture; no, it had been equal parts agony and revelation, with constant wild swings back and forth between the two, and I could only put the lingering trauma of the bad to rest if I had a chance to understand the good as well.

And still my limbs shook with weakness. My sensory perceptions felt light and distant, like impressions upon sand, and I had to continually force myself to accept this as real. I was out of the storm nowright?

A rift took us into a new night-clad geometry with no visible sky. On a suspicion, Caecilia called a halt, and we climbed down from our bikes to look around. Flashlights illuminated mineral-rich stone and high crystalline towers that reflected our beams in a thousand vectors of colorized redirection, and it would have been beautiful save for its color.

"Are we in a cave?" Trajan asked, shining his beam up into pure darkness. "The air feels open, but I can't see any stars or sky. Shouldn't our flashlights at least show a hint of clouds up there?" We shined them together, but even their combined might reached nothing above.

I watched Noah as he lifted his visor to see plain hues. He immediately turned and shouted at Sampson, who had reached out to one of the pillars. "**Don't touch it!** *These are amethyst!*"

As one, we recoiled, and then retreated closer to our bikes. We knew of the Gemstone Hegemony and of the rumored deadliness of the amethyst pyramids that were part of it, but it took Noah's explanation of the use of small ones as suicide devices before we truly understood how much danger we were in.

"We're deep in the lion's den," Sampson murmured, recalling one of his world's parables.

Indeed, we had ridden a lucky path of stone far into a forest of growing amethyst, and the way ahead narrowed. Carefully scouting, Paulinus returned to report unhappily, "It looks like a natural separation between two low fields of small amethysts of slightly different hues. It continues on into the distance as far as I could see, and I am mostly certain the two will not meet."

"How wide?" Caecilia asked.

He shook his helmeted head. "Just wide enough for one boot. We would have to walk it like a wooden training beam, placing one foot in front of another while carefully balancing."

"That's never going to work," she mused, thinking aloud about our supplies and unconscious passenger. "Is it wide enough for a wheel?"

Paulinus nodded. "Barely."

"Then we'll go single file, tied to keep our line connected and hopefully upright, with Septus and his bike firmly in the middle." She addressed Noah, who remained as far from the amethyst lattices as possible. "You're new to these vehicles, but do you think you can manage this?"

Noah gulped, but told her, "Yes."

We proceeded to tie the bikes in a long line in the ordered manner, but we did so apprehensively. This sort of apprehension was unknown to us until Larentia told us to think of the road ahead as littered with landmines. At that, we laughed, for we had been trained for that scenario and we immediately knew what to do. Landmines were incredibly easy to avoid when their locations were known, and these amethyst outcroppings were prominently visible.

That arrogance faded as we actually began moving forward. Caecilia took the lead and rode the needle ahead; for each of us, the task was keeping ourselves balanced and aimed directly at the bike ahead of ours as it turned subtly this way and that. Paulinus had been correct in thinking that the two hues of amethyst fields would not meet, but they were hardly even. The path became increasingly winding, and we absolutely could not stop or put our feet down no matter how much we desired to do so.

"Why'd it have to be *purple?*" I muttered angrily, feeling my exhausted adrenal glands shooting painful bursts of fire into my veins.

Behind me, Flavia tipped suddenly on uneven stone and fell to the right; instinctively, I threw myself left, and I bounced against our opposing ropes with a desperate hope that she would not hit the gemstones and be disintegrated. If she did hit, I would be the first to know, for I, too, would fall. Ahead of me, Celcus leaned slightly to the right to balance out my forward tension.

But her grunt of effort rang over the radio, and a curve in the narrow path gave us the angle we needed to get back upright. There was no time for relief, for Larentia suffered a similar tilt, and Trajan and Paulinus used my tactic to keep her upright. Straining against various near-falls, our communication grew terse, for a single moment of inattention meant death for us all.

Monstrous stress hovered behind me like an amethyst pyramid in darkness, but I did not let it touch me. The trauma of what I had been through in the storm had to wait. I could not let myself face it now, nor any time during this mission. It screamed at me from the distant recesses of my mind, but I focused only on the sweat running past my eyes and the disintegration gemstones around my wheels. The imaginary monster hovered behind me with faceless intent, waiting for me to acknowledge it.

Oh. There was also a real amethyst pyramid.

Oddly calm, I registered this without a glance or so much as a gasp; the dark reflection was visible in the pale on the back of Celcus' black helmet. I dared not look up or warn my teammates, for distraction would be deadly. The inverted pyramid following us would either destroy us or notthere was nothing any of us could do about it. I hoped that our precise care in avoiding harming the environment would show us as a neutral party simply passing through, and not worth the kamikaze death its attack would cost.

It was all too much too soon. Electricity and fire warred in every limb and rib. Veins prominently pounded in my forehead and a quiet roar of exhaustion grew as the darkness of that strange gemstone world became a smothering blanket over my awareness. I felt my hands release their clutch from the handlebars, but there was no strength left in me.

I lean back in my seat at the movie theater once again. My laugh is relieved, unsurprised, and tearful. "I was hoping to talk to you again."

The kind man with the crooked nose nods compassionately. "It seems you've been wounded." He points to my head. "Up here, in a haunting way that cannot be bandaged or stitched."

"My father," I ask, closing my eyes for a long moment to reinforce the walls of my mind and heart. "Is he here?"

My intermittent friend leans forward slightly and looks down the row to my left. "Nope. I don't think so."

My eyes are still closed, for I dare not look myself. "My mother?"

"I'd have to say no to that as well, though that's no guarantee. Your loved ones come here, yes, but human relationships are complex. Do you love them?"

For that, I have no answer.

"I see," he says softly. "So your wound is not a new one, but an old one reopened."

He's right, and his framing of what I went through makes me realize that this was always inevitable, purple insanity storm or not. Outside of the carefully crafted confines of my world's social norms and reinforced beliefs, I was always going to be forced to re-evaluate who I was. In a way, that means this pain is goodI get to decide who I want to be now. For this realization, I feel very warm and thankful to have someone to talk to about these things, for none of my brothers or sisters have ever been allowed to think about it. "I'm glad you've reached out to me."

"Oh no," he replies with equal warmth. "I'm not reaching out. *You* are coming here of your own accord, and I just happen to be here. This is your dying dream."

The words pass through my awareness with the chill of ice and timeless haunting quiet. "Dying dream?"

"This is a placeor perhaps a statethat human beings pass through as their probability of death in their next few moments approaches absolute certainty."

Answers! I am chilled, yes, but I am desperate beyond fear to know more about the truth of existence. I raise a clenched fist in excitement. "How is that possible?"

"No clue," he says, jovial at his own humored lack of understanding. "How does any being experience dreaming while, by the very definition of sleep, their consciousness is offline? How does one incorporate a brief waking sound into a dream for subjective minutes, hours, or even days? Time and consciousness are not linear in the slightest."

Many of the moments I experienced in my tempest of insanity flood back to me, and I become seized by the notion that some of them may not have happened yet. "So we come here as we begin to transition into death. Does that mean our lives areI don't know*set?* That the future is predetermined?"

His joviality morphs into intrigued challenge, and he taps his chin with a finger. "Oh no. I've seen a few lucky last-minute one-in-a-million escapes. They came here, we talked, they found peace with what was happening, and thenthe completely unexpected happened and back they went. It's exceedingly rare, but you'd be surprised how often I've seen it due to the sheer number of people dying. Well, I guess the number of people dying would be everybody eventually; so it's an aggregated probability effect. Winning the lottery yourself is hard, but *somebody* winning is very easy with a large enough population. But to see a specific person defy the odds repeatedly like you have? I can't help but feel that something else is going on. Perhaps your dark passenger has something to do with it."

He points, and I turn my right side fully around until I can look behind me at the unlit back of the theater. There in the darkness, high in the last rowbut still within hearing distancesits a shadowed silhouette. Through the sheer presence of the unknown watcher, I can feel eyes upon me. The chill I felt before becomes ice creeping around my heart. "Who *is* that?"

For the first time that I have ever seen, he seems surprised. "I just assumed you knew. I certainly don't. This, too, is highly unprecedented. Each being's dying dream is for them alone, because it isn't real. It's just an artifact of consciousness ending. Unknown to all, hidden from the rest of the dream worlds, and populated only by the imprints their loved ones left behind on their own way through. This place is the ultimate privacy, an unassailable safe space to come to terms."

I turn away from the chilling spectre over our shoulders. "But you're here."

He gives a small chuckle. "I suppose. No pain can reach you here. I want nothing, therefore I cannot harm you."

"You want nothing?"

"Nothing at all. I found my purpose, and it is simply to help. To be there in any way I can, for you and for anyone else who asks. You'd be surprised how many paths are open to a Caretaker, for someone has to have the keys to even the most defended garden."

For the first time, I take him seriously as a person rather than as a figment of my imagination or as some unknown entity. "What's your name?"

"I'm not sure." He watches the movie screen for a time, where helmeted men and women ride narrowly between amethyst fields in clinging darkness. "My journey has taken me through many worlds of dream and hallucination beyond my understanding; planes of existence where memory and personality are interchangeable and all that remains is the soul. I think I lived more than once, in some manner of speaking. Purgatories for perceived failings in life, metaphorical cleansings, and dying dreams. Died and was eaten, only to go with my consumer whence it came to states of existence ineffable and unknowable full of hunger and need beyond limit. A cycle of forgetting and continuance, the same cycle that traps us all in the end. But these concepts cannot be conveyed in mere words, and, even if they could be" He sighs and laughs at himself. "they're still nonsense that means nothing to anyone. A dream is for the dreamer alone, and when he wakes, to use a colloquial phrase, nobody gives a shit about your dream, Heath."

Confused, I ask, "Is that your name?"

He pauses. "In one of my livesI'm not sure what's dreamed or real anymoremy older brother once said that to me when I was a boy." He turns his head to the right as if in deep introspection and subtle pain. "It couldn't have been my real life... that would have been so long ago... how could I have been *there* and then also..."

As he becomes lost in deep thought, the theater rumbles and tilts underneath me, and I nearly fly out of my seat. As I begin to panic utterly, he grips me by one wrist and keeps me from being torn out into the black void that has always terrified me so. "Venita!" he shouts over the roar of numerous engines and the bouncing rumble of uneven stone. "*I remember!* I know where you are!" He shouts something more as his hair and mine wildly flip around between us, blocking my view of his mouth. All that remains is his grip on my wrist and concerned alarm in his eyes.

Bouncing awake, I found that hold still tight, but it was not a human handit was my multi-tool responding to the willpower urge that I had given before passing out. Locked to my handlebars and rotating as a form of primitive navigation, it had kept me in line whileoh shit!jagged amethyst raced a heartbeat away from my visor. Using another curve to pull myself back up, I found balance and took in deep breaths as we shot out onto open stone and finally escaped the deadly narrows.

Somewhere, someone was shouting at me over the radio, but I was too out of it to process their words. We blew through a rift at high speed, emerging under a welcoming star-lit sky, and I slumped to the ground in a series of stops, pushes, grabs, and other assorted forces. In the cyclone of confusion and exhaustion, I heard Flavia say angrily, "pushed her too hard! She wasn't ready!"

"Clearly she was," Caecilia replied with a calm tone. "Because we *did* make it. Have confidence in your sister, for, like you, she is one of the best."

A blur of organized shouting, group efforts, and mechanical sounds followed; an aggravating beep sounded in my awareness several times. At long last, Celcus suggested, "Maybe show it we have wounded? Put Venita's hand up there!" Someone lifted my arm, and green light flooded my closed eyelids; the sound this time was not aggravating. Cool air washed across me, and I perceived nothing coherent until I woke up on a bed some duration of real sleep later.

I was alone in my room, and I took a few moments to look around before I threw off my white sheets and climbed to my feet. It was as if someone had taken one of our hospital rooms and re-made it in chrome and dark non-reflective metals with a totally different appreciation of style and decor. It was not alien, not exactly; just strange. A variety of robotic arms hung from the ceiling unmoving. A few dark tabletops held the remains of torn-open bags and medicines. I looked down at my arm and noticed an intravenous tube taped to my arm. Grabbing the bag, I saw that it was only a rehydrating solution. I carefully removed it, rolled my sleeve back down over my physical therapy device, and slid on my shoes, belt, and gun.

The hallway outside ran reminiscent of a bunker or fortress. This place had clearly been designed to last. Nowhere did I see perishable construction; it was all shaped metals. "Hello?"

No echo. That was a small but very important detail. Somebody had designed this place *not* to echo unpleasantly, and that meant it had likely been built by someone humanor human-like. I did begin to hear the sounds of my comrades as I moved down the hall past open doors that showed into empty rooms like mine. To the voices I rushed, and I found them sitting just around the corner in a vast space that opened up into a massive garden.

And Septus was there, awake and grinning weakly along with Trajan's jokes. His smile widened as he saw me, and I ran forward and gave him a giant hug. "Septus! You're alright!"

He nodded, but then touched a fresh scar on his head. "A little brain surgery never bothered me."

"Brain surgery?!" I leaned back and examined the wound. "How long was I out?"

"Just a few hours," Flavia told me, coming up for a big hug of her own. "This place is incredible."

The garden seemed to be some sort of waiting area, and not nearly the facility in its entirety. Looking around as I sat with and clasped Celcus, I asked, "Where are we?"

Caecilia answered from her wary post by the entrance. "The medical symbol on the map. This is it. Some sort of fully-automated facility sized for humanoids and with full understanding of our anatomy. We showed it we had wounded, and it let us in." She positively glared around at the unassuming bushes and trees. "First *good* thing we've seen out here in the other worlds."

"So you don't trust it?" I asked, gauging everyone else's reactions.

We were not fools, but I could see they *wanted* to believe. In that moment, I knew that the stress of this journey had affected more than just me. Training or not, we were still human, and it seemed every world out here was more horrifying than the last. I could tell that this need for a break was at the base of Caecilia's decision to let us stay here despite her misgivings. I wanted to stay sharp like her, but she ordered me to relax. "We're very close to Amber One. We'll set out tomorrow, or perhaps even the next day. There's no immediate rush. You just get back to a hundred percent, alright?"

I nodded, stood to salute her kindnessand never completed the gesture. Ten pistols emerged immediately, including my own, as a black sphere approached through the trees.

But it was not the kind that had attacked our world. It looked vaguely similar, but that might have just been our prejudices. This one was outfitted with numerous protruding medical devices, reminding me of one I'd seen in *Star Wars*, and it was capable of speech. **Would you like to see the patient, ma'am?** We all looked at each other in askance, but the sphere approached me in particular. **Would you like to see the patient, ma'am?**

"You must be the one officially logged in," Noah commented. "Since they used *your* hand to get inside."

With all attention on me, I said the only thing I could think of: "Sure."

**This way, ma'am.** The medical sphere turned and hovered back the way it had come; we rushed after it with equal parts curiosity and wariness. It took us down a long hall, to the right, to the left, and then to a closed door at the end. **You'll note this room is larger than the others,** the sphere said. **It's a V.I.P. roomVery Important Patient. Hah. Hah. Hah. That's a hospice joke. What is your rating of the joke?**

Confused, I replied, "Um, it was good."

**Wonderful. I will catalogue it for future use.** It inserted something into a slot, and then the wide metal door slid up and open.

Within, numerous complex machines beeped, hummed, and glowed in their own living rhythms. At the center of technological chaos, a well-muscled man in a thin white gown lay staring at the chrome ceiling. At our approach, he blinked. Slowly, he pushed tubes and mechanical arms off of himself and sat up. He was not a massive man, but he was very much larger than us in other ways. Immediately, every one of us except Noah bowed lightly as was the manner of our cultureand then, remembering the customs of *his* era, we sank to a knee each.

"What's going on?" Noah asked. "Who is this?"

"Bow you idiot," Caecilia muttered harshly. "The Legates serve for this man in his absence. His *eight century* absence. This is Conrad, our Imperator, and the founder and leader of our armies."

"Oh my." Noah still did not bow or kneel. "How is he *here?*"

Our Imperator stretched, slid down from his bed, and stood tall before us. "This" He coughed deeply to clear his throat. "This is the first interesting thing I've seen in a very long time." He bade us stand with a motion of his hand, and then ordered, "Tell me, what have I missed?"

	<TEXT> Flavia closed Septus' eyelids with a gentle hand. "We can't just leave him here. He'll die." She gazed around the wide open landscape of rolling harsh brown rock that the rising sun had revealed to us.

Larentia sighed. "We can leave a beacon and someone from home will come. We're significantly slower carrying an unmanned bike and an unconscious boy."

"Boy?" I asked, glaring in defense of my brother. "You're only two years older than us!"

Celcus and Sampson both came out of their solitary glooms at hearing my tone rise.

"Cool it," Caecilia ordered gruffly. "No infighting. We can't afford it. And furthermore, we're not leaving anyone behind. We're on our own now, and nobody from back home will come pick us up; if we leave someone behind, they better be incinerated ashes to cover our trail. This is a grey-class mission." She checked the primed grenade at her belt. "We'll find something more comprehensive later if we can, but this'll have to do for now."

My strapped grenade did not cause me any stress. I had handled numerous such devices in school, and I knew it was perfectly safe unless I wanted it to not be so; of our ten, Trajan seemed the most ill at ease with his self-destruction device. While I had consulted my borrowed medical textbooks and tried to stitch up the stab wound in his thigh as best I couldhis second, actually, because a black sphere had also speared right through the meat during the Siege of New Romehe had been uncharacteristically quiet, and I had seen his hand repeatedly check that everything with his belt-grenade was set up correctly. He had cracked no jokes, born no smirk, and displayed no bravado. Now that we were up and preparing to head out, he seemed closer to his old self, but I could see his hesitation hanging over him like the omen of the raven.

He, Paulinus, and Caecilia held the map between them and rifled through the layers.

"An unrecommended path does exist," Paulinus commented, comparing three layers of the complex map. "We could get there in an hour."

"I don't like it," Caecilia murmured. "Higher-dimensional pathing can get us basically anywhere in the region very rapidly, but an overwhelming percentage of these unrecommended realities are marked with symbols they told me represented bad things." She looked past all of us to where Noah stood gazing at the horizon opposite the sun. "Does our guide have any insights on how to get us to this medical symbol?"

"Where is it?" Noah asked without looking at us. "On the Earth I mean. Not by reality-pathing."

"North of here. Base of the Alps, in the region where New Verona would be on our world."

He shook his head ever so slightly. "Spatial compression damage had already dealt lethal blows to many of your sub-stations. To get to your world's last working control station, we took an emergency underground transportation system. A high-speed vacuum tube sort of thing. I didn't realize how far we'd gone, and certainly nobody would answer my questions when we were prisoners. I imagine that rail tube is destroyed now..."

Caecilia stiffened. "Which continent are you from?"

"North America," he responded, sighing deeply. "Strangely, I feel much further from home now than I ever did flipping through any number of realities. How do I cross an ocean when all the boats and planes have been destroyed? When everybody's just trying to survive?"

"We'll get you there," she told him, not with the tone of a promise, but as a matter-of-fact statement. "When this is all over."

He nodded, and then finally turned to face us. "Then I do have advice for you. You're all very talented and capable, so I have no doubt you'll make it to that medical symbol on the map. My suggestion to you is that you should be more worried about what's there at the destination. Think on this: everything on the way is random, and, as someone I respect once said, did not evolve to kill us. But that destination exists for a purpose, and purpose belies intent. What kind of medical facility is it? And who runs it?"



We all looked to our leader, but Caecilia was not perturbed. "I've thought about those questions, and we'll just have to risk it. We're only on this mission because that watching entity will seek revenge if we don't. In other words, we're doing this to survive, so if we let some of us die, it's all pointless."

"Revenge?" Noah asked. "What is it? Why does it want revenge upon you?"

At that moment, it occurred to me that the information he had been told had been carefully calculated. I had been vaguely aware that he did not know everything we knew, but the degree to which this was true became apparent as Caecilia chose not to fill him in. I had chosen to befriend this person, but I would not violate her intent by telling him. I felt a rare emotionshameand Noah glanced at me before looking down at the ground with subtle hurt. He, too, had just realized that he was being kept on the outside. I hoped Paulinus would insist he be told, but it seemed the priorities of our homeworld were more important than the moral questions concerning keeping a consultant in the dark when said consultant was riding with us and risking just as we were. Paulinus, too, turned away with an unhappy expression.

Without further discussion, we packed and tied Septus and his bike and rode out at half speed through the rocky orange and red terrain. Canyons and cliffs were our constant companions as we crept across the landscape. The moment we found a rift, we entered a vast bog upon whose floating hills we rolled very carefully. A sandy desert followed, and we drank more water from our canteens than we should have, but a river basin opened up before us after that.

My favorite was a thick old-growth forest whose high trunks and thick canopy kept our path clear of all but emerald-gold shade and thick layers of leaves. The massive towers of wood and their intermittent beams of spore-clouded sunlight moved past in varied parallax; sparing what glances I could to my left and right, I felt the raw power and beauty of nature in a way I had never experienced before. This, too, was a world long for our winding through realities, and an hour inand an hour from the next riftthe soft beams of sunlight began to take on a strange tint. At first, I couldn't quite tell what had caught my concern, and I was the only one looking; after another ten minutes, I knew for sure that gold was taking on purple. This was not some local trick of the canopy. All the beams out to the gloomy depths were taking on deep violet as a chill and storm-scented wind poured in. I pointed, and Flavia opened her visor to look up in wonder.

Noah saw us, looked to his left and right, and then said calmly over the radio: "Caecilia, may I ask your nomina?"

Ahead, the lead helmet turned slightly sideways. "We have not earned last names here. Not yet."

"Alright then," he continued, still completely neutral in tone. "I know last names are important to you. *You* must then know how serious I am by the fact that I would address you by your earned appellation now. You have to find a riftany riftnow. Not in an hour, not in minutes, but *now.* It doesn't matter how dangerous the map says the next world might be; anywhere without purple skies will be safer than here very shortly."

I saw helmeted heads begin turning this way and that looking for danger, but Caecilia asked only, "Larentia?"

Her sister responded with a shiver in her voice, confirming what our leader thought to be the case: "From what I remember of the map, we're in a rift desert. There aren't any for leagues. The one we are heading for *is* the closest, and it's still fifty minutes out."

A skittering noise echoed through the trees, and my gaze darted up and to the leftbut no one else appeared to have heard it.

"I know how this sounds," Noah continued, still deadly serious. "But your only option for survival is to stop, tie yourselves to a tree, and ride out this storm. I'll protect you in the meantime."

"How it sounds?" Caecilia responded, addressing the Hannibal's steed in the room. "One of the duties of command is to parcel information. You ride with us, thus I have absolute faith in you as a person. Command decisions have nothing to do with personal feelings."

To my left, Flavia turned her head to look right; I followed her gaze to Noah slightly ahead. His helmet bobbed up and down with a nod of understanding.
The incoming breeze made me shiver as if sudden cold was cutting right through my clothesand then I felt like stripping them off for all the intense heat that was suddenly blazing down upon me. My own voice sounded like someone else's plea-filled echo. "Noah, what's happening?"

He said one word, grimly: "Insanity."

This time, my shiver was not from perceived cold.

Caecilia raised her gloved fist and called a halt, but not for Noah's plannot exactly. Leaping down to the thick loam, she raised her visor and ordered us directly, "We'll tie ourselves together, but not to a tree. This is an alien world, and we have no idea how long this storm will last. Tie all the bikes into one long train, two by two, and Noah and I will ride at the lead. Do whatever it takes so that they won't fall over if we are incapacitated or struggling."

"What?" I asked, responding to my spoken name from behind mebut nobody was there.

With her visor open, I saw my Centurion watch me with concern. Her golden eyes were cast dark by ambient purple, matching the colors of the ancient forest under the deepening sigh of the canopy overhead moving in the wind. She said to the others, "Hurry."

Someone took my hands and tied them to my handlebars; I threw up on him or her and apologized.

Flavia used her clean hand to grip my shoulder and told me, "It's fine, sister." She gazed at me as if evaluating something very intently, and I saw limitless oceans and shimmering blue skies of old in her gorgeous eyes. Our Shield still existed; in her irises, we were safe.

"Screw makeup, you're beautiful," I told her as my sight grew fuzzy and sharp in alternating beats. "You shouldn't dull yourself down like the rest of us. You should be in a movie. *Love and*, uh, what was it?" I couldn't remember the...

I felt a jerk as we began moving again. I tried to guide my bike, but my hands were unresponsive. I moved left; I moved right; I was stuck! Theme song music began playing loudly from the high trunks passing by on either side, and I shouted, "Duty!" Or wait"Beauty!" Or was it the other one? "Duty, beauty, duty, beauty..." Which was it?"

Noah's voice over my helmet radio cut through my growing distraction. "Venita, can you hear me?"

I looked around my bedroom, and finally sighted a familiar but subtly alien face on my small television. Hitting it to clear up static, I asked, "Yeah, what's up?"

He grinned at me, but his words were not filled with humor. "You have to hold on. We'll get you out of this as soon as we can, but you have to hold on to your focus and your sanity for fifty minutes, alright?"

"Make it sixty," I laughed. "It's always ten minutes worse than you think."

"Alright then, soldier," Caecilia said, her face suddenly on the television. She carried about her a strength that made me listen. "Sixty minutes. Can you handle it?"

"Yes *ma'am!*" I laughed again, and saluted. The seriousness of the situation rushed back in a moment later, and I stood abruptly. "I'm not home." I moved into the back room, but my grandfather was absent. Outside my window, there existed no world save an infinite void filled with a continuum of rising pink stars. A guitarist played every song from my very early youth, back when I had been so very captivated by music, and each song rang out from countless versions of that same guitarist and his rocking white guitar at the same time in a distancing line of movement; **same**, same, *same*... gone, but back again, with a new song, each new tune from an older age in my life. Would he eventually go beyond what I knew now? How old was I? What *was* age? Could I know my future by listening to the songs this aurally enamored artist might play? Some part of me felt as if I had seen all of this before. Why this neuron? Why this memory?

"Faster!" Caecilia shouted.

Orcs. Half-orcs. I could smell them. I would slay them all. I'd been the best, and I would be again! "Why did you have to go away?" I asked, sobbing at my window. "I love you, and I daren't so much as think the thought lest it come upon us like a dragon, fire and all." Flavia's hand came to rest on my left shoulder; Sampson's on my right; Celcus pressed his palm against my back.

But they were tied to their bikes like me. It couldn't be them.

I whirled around. I was no longer home. I was in the dark. Breathing hard, I asked, "Why not you, Noah?"

"You could say I'm immune to mental assault," he replied in my ear. "Perhaps I've got a good handle on my metacognition, or perhaps I'm already insane."

"Can I think my way out of this?" I shouted, hearing myself echo in the night.

"Go to your safe place," he suggested. "Where does the real you reside?"

I wasn't in void at all; I was among those pink stars. Endless guitarists, the same passionate man, played their guitars in endless snakes across the span of my mind.

I...

*come on, Venita*

I like...

*say it! speak it!*

"**I like music!**" The admission spilled out of me like some sort of horrible confession, and relief and wonder immediately surged through me. I was no longer speaking with my real mouth; I was just shouting in the halls of my own mind, but the realization still *mattered.* Letting slip a tear of happiness, I shouted, "*I'm not just a soldier! I'm a person!*"

My mother and I used to listen to music together. No. More than that.

My father played the guitar.

It's him. I am five years old, and he plays for me every single day before bed. Sobbing openly now, I let them flood back; the moments I refused to acknowledge for so long after he left. "I hated you," I tell him.

He just gives me a long jovial glance, smiles deeply and caringly, and recedes into the pink darkness as he plays my favorite song. I don't remember it anymore, but it was the only one he wrote himself. Nobody else in the entire world, nay, the multiverse, had ever or would ever hear it. It had been written just for me.

But Noah would not have warned us so if insanity was as simple as that. This I understood as horrible pains began to fracture and split and magnify manifold myriad infinite

I grow still.

So this is how the purple is going to get me.

I don't have a word for you. You see all, you invade all, you set forth the terms of existence, and yet give us no hint as to what we are supposed to do. Is killing wrong? Is stealing wrong? Is lying wrong? Is adultery wrong? All of these things have severe punishments in the military caste of my world, but I was taught about other societies and other worlds in which they are not wrong. Who is correct? What happens when we die?! That would be the naturaland finalpoint of judgment of our mortal lives. When the Hitler of each Earth died, none mourned, for he was a *bad person*; when a close family member dies, all mourn, for regardless of how terrible their behavior might have been, they are supposedly, at heart, a *good person.* What is good? What is bad?

What is the reward for being good? All the best sodas in limitless supply; all the time in existence to play video games and have deep conversations with the ones you love.

What would *you* do to a *bad person?* I am back between those long rows of knife-wielding watchers again, gunning down captive men and women who thank me for their deaths. I am back in that man-made valley of fire, smoke, and rubble, the full fourth of a city that our bolted-down sapphire-and-chrome turret reduced to ruins with a single heartbeat of railgunned explosive death. Do I deserve to be among those screaming and maimed wounded? Fire catches upon my arm, and I slap at it, trying in vain to put it out. This fire will burn eternally, for what else does a *bad person* deserve but to be left alone with their pains and doubts for all time? A small touch of that infinity brushes my awareness, and I distantly hear myself screaming uncontrollably.

I have been screaming for some time, in fact. My throat is raw, and my heart beats to murderous machine gun fire in my chest.

I see myself asking, "Can I think my way out of this?"

Is it...

Isn't it...

Time?

In one way or another, it always comes down to Time.

Is there a moment when I am free of this cold/hot gold/purple revelation/pain?

Of course there is. It just so happens to be in the future.

And at the core of it all, I know that I make it through this, because I am in the thralls of your book, and I am telling my story from the future of this moment.

Yes.

Yes, that's right. I survive this.

You sadistic monster. How can you make me relive this? Relive the tears running down my cheeks as I see my father's face clearly for the first time in nearly twenty years? He was wise, and he was my dad, and I thought he was the coolest man that ever lived. I mean, I thought that before he chose ideology over me.

And the nightmare didn't stop there. I fell into a bottomless void of fire, random terrors, self-torture, and bouts of epiphany and haunting remembrances. Because of various hurdles in that forest that I was told about later, it took far longer than fiftyor even sixtyminutes to reach the next rift.

What I've told you so far lasted thirty minutes. Reaching the next rift took eight hours.

You've wounded me more deeply than you can know. It took me so very long to work through what I experienced in that purple storm, and I don't want to think about it again. If you have any compassion for human life, go away. I'll tell you your story later. Give me this moment of respect and privacy.

Just go away.

	<TEXT> The rumble of our engines echoed as we rolled between two high walls of grey stone and tan facings. While Trajan held Septus and his bike, Paulinus dismounted at Caecilia's wordless order and pushed a dumpster to block the way behind us. At speed, we moved down the high narrow man-made canyon as one.

"Noah!" Caecilia shouted over our radio channel. "Start making sense!"

The sound of panicked breathing slowed only to allow a cascade of words from our off-world consultant. "They... were... asleep," he panted, and I saw his clenched hands flash stark white on his handlebars.

"Asleep? They were moving around. Walking. Driving."

He shook his helmeted head. "Asleep... until we woke them..." He gasped against what sounded like overwhelming pain. "They're screaming."

"Who?"

He lowered his head as we sped toward the other end of the blocked alley. "All of them."

Larentia cut in. "On the street?"

He shook his head forcefully, but could not speak. We emerged into the dark purple velvet of evening beset by white wounding streetlamp slashes and warm crimson light pooling on the sidewalks like blood. Noah's earlier animal scream echoed in my head, and surely that of all my comrades: *Don't look at the red lights!* One glance had sent Septus into a seizure, and I imagined a direct look meant even worse.

But our gazes were not straying. We were the focal point of an amphitheater, and the citizens of this new street our audience. All faces watched us without expression. All eyes stuck to us like we were actors on a stage. They expected action from us, and every move was being noted. Some filmed with their phones. Some just stared. Others marched toward us from the pools of red.

"What the hell is this?" Sampson asked, repeating what was on all our minds.

Caecilia ignored the question. "We have to figure out a defense against those lights. Sooner or later we're going to accidentally look."

Ever my beloved strategist, Flavia broke a store window with the butt of her assault rifle as we moved down the street under the stares of the unmoving masses. After leaping in, she returned almost immediately with a black marker. While we stood warily in anticipation of what unknown force might be coming for us, she drew on each of our visors. When she came to me, I understood. She locked eyes with me and moved slowly from the left side of my vision to my right, leaving opaque blackness between our gazes. "How's that? Direct line of sight blocked?"

I nodded. It was not nearly a reliable solution long-term, but, for now, it would block direct light-to-eye contact while letting us see most of the rest of our field of view. It took some getting used to, but less than I might have expected. All of our visors were so marked in less than a minute.

"Time's up," Larentia called, noting movement a few blocks down. "Organized groups approaching."

"That way," Caecilia pointed, ordering us on. Flavia's defense became important sooner rather than later, for we had only ridden between stopped cars and their staring drivers for about a single block before we were caught by surprise. Men with red light lances emerged from beyond the next corner and pointed them directly at us; we would have been lost in that instant. As it was, I saw only a halo of crimson around the thick black lines at the center of my vision and a rapidly searching scan of brightness bouncing within said halo. *Something* was looking for an iris to focus onand failing to find it.

This first assault lacked guns, and Caecilia ordered us on with haste into the deepening purple and white of the city under night. The enemy attempted to use their red light lances on us nearly a dozen times, as if they weren't aware that it wasn't working, and Noah fought the grip on his breath to try to give us more information as we sped through silent and staring downtown crowds.

"Their nervous systems are programmed," he forced out. "Look. They're changing behavior to chase us as they walk past those lights. Their conscious minds are stuck in bodies they can't control. They're screaming, all of them, ever since we arrived here. It's overwhelming."

"Are they going to resort to force?" Caecilia asked.

Noah took a deep breath of recovery before replying, "I'm not sure. This whole civilization has become a sort of behavioral organism. Think of these people as components in a global system that steams along using their effort and productivity, but without their consent."

As he dodged around bystanders, Trajan asked, "Who is the monster behind this? Who is in charge?"

"Nobody," Noah responded with a subtly horrified tone. "There might have been somebody behind it at one time, but not anymore."

Riding next to me, Flavia gave a grunt of understanding. "A behavioral entity that is sentient, but not conscious. It *is* adapting to our presence, but through evolving behaviors, not directed intellect."

"I'd say so," he gasped, going quiet as the weight of countless unheard screams continued to exhaust him.

Caecilia pointed, and we turned to follow the indicated direction. "Then this system *will* defend itself once the initial behaviors fail enough. We have to get out of here. Now."

Beside her, Larentia countered, "The crowds seem to be directing us by leaving open paths. It doesn't seem like we're getting any closer to escaping the city."

Despite all our movement and speed, she was right. We had no choice but to slow and push toward the wall of people watching usand every single one of them brandished a knife the moment we came within a certain distance. We reacted by instantly pulling out our assault rifles and pointing them at our nearest aggressors, but they did not so much as flinch. The end of my rifle sighted an older man in a suit, a young mother, a child, and a teenage boy, but there was no chance at all I would actually fire at any of these. As we backed off and they returned to merely watching, my shout rang out in my own ears. "*What do we do?*"

It was a basic ethos of our entire caste that we should protect, not harm, the innocent. The thought of shooting a child was abhorrent and disgusting, and the prospect of potentially shooting some of these adults was nearly as murky. Controlled as they were, they were somehow innocent *and* armed and dangerous at the same time. Despite our mutual training, I could hear the stress levels rising in the voices of my fellows. Were we already in a trap too wide and too deep to escape?

The long lane between walls of people had become something akin to the path a parade might have taken, and at both ends lance-bearing regiments approached to close a pincer formation on us. For the first time, we heard gunshots ring out from the distance; stone-faced watchers fell, pierced in the chest or head, for those aiming from afar were too distant and completely indiscriminate. Without consciousness in this living system, there was no possibility for compassionor negotiation. The combined framework of reactive behaviors was going to mercilessly destroy us the same way that our immune systems had removed bacteria and viruses during the Time of Sickness. We had shed no tears for *them.* Why would this civilization-entity hesitate to slaughter *us?*

I could tell by Caecilia's sweeping scans back and forth that she knew we were in a tight spot. Never before had I seen her anything but grimly sensible and confident. "There has to be a way out of this," she murmured, accidentally speaking her mind over the radio. Her concern became our panic; only through years of training did we stay on our bikes and following orders. "Alright," she said, breathing hard. "We're going to brute force our way through one of these pincers. They're armed. That means they are enemy combatants, controlled or not."

It was weak logic, but it *was* within our ethosif only barely.

Trajan transferred the unconscious Septus and his bike to Noah and Flavia; they rode at the back while we revved our engines and prepared for the charge. Part of me was secretly happy that my beloved sister would be safest from injury, even if that sentiment went against the implacable courage I had been brought up to feel about life, death, and my teammates.

Distant shots continued pinging around us as we arranged in formation. One bounced from the side of Paulinus' helmet, but he ignored it while staring citizens continued to fall around us. Together, we hunched over our handlebars and laid our assault rifles forward like lances of our own; mechanical cavalry ready to deal death en masse.

This was the first time I would ever actually enter real combat against other human beings with guns, and my heart hammered thunder in my chest and in my ears as the roars of our revving engines rose to drown out all else. Under my sleeves, I felt armored by the close metal surrounding both my arms, but my teammates had no such protection. Their survival would depend on my performance, and on my aim being true. I didn't want to kill human beings, but these people had cornered us beyond any choice. In a way, I had been raised my entire life for this moment. A good Soldier of Amber Three would not hesitate to end the life of a threat to the commonwealth.

Forget that. I wanted Flavia, Celcus, Sampson, and Septus to live; Caecilia and hers, too. Noah was a strange foreigner, but I didn't want to see him die; of course my grandfather, and perhaps the little girl whose silver dolphin necklace I still wore as a bracelet. I felt no connection whatsoever, in that moment, to anything beyond these few that I loved. Facing what I would have to do, the world I had been promised felt hollow.

I did not breathe. My heart did not beat. I gazed a pointed dagger at the rapidly approaching feet just under the black line at the center of my vision; aiming just above, I pulled the trigger of my gun and took my first lifeand then my second, third, fourth, fifth, tenth, maybe even twentieth. Row upon row of armed men and women fell without so much as a scream. This pincer was ten rows deep, and we bumped and bounced at high speed over their piled bodies before I finally took in a breath, and, with it, the pain of gunsmoke and murder.

It had been so easy. They'd simply taken wounds and fallen. Wasn't life supposed to be sacred? Wasn't every individual supposed to put up a tremendous fight to survive? Didn't everyone have their own deep and personal story? How could we have snuffed out a hundred or more stories so easily? *How could existence allow such things to happen?* That meant that we could be snuffed out the exact same way. No caring, no respect, no remembrance.

But we were alive. We had killed them all with our superior aim from a distance greater than they could have effectively hit us, and we had thus wiped them out. It had only taken moments to ride right over their bodies and escape the trap.

As we raced along the avenue left open between the endless walls of knife-bearing watchers, I tried desperately to justify what we had done. What *was* this beast we faced? It had no body, no limbs, and no gaping maw. It existed only in the conceptual spaces of human idea, but it *did* exist. We were running its innards even now, and it was moving unconsciously and automatically to annihilate us. Unconscious sentiencejust what exactly did that entail? Was this civilization-entity unique in the multiverse? Were we wrong to harm it?

I couldn't believe I was asking myself that question when I knew that behind every single one of those emotionless faces was a trapped brain screaming with the agony of a hopeless prisoner. The thought of being caught that way myself was horrifying to my core, but, judging by Septus' reaction, these systems brought us seizure rather than programming . Noah *had* said he couldn't sense emotions from us the same way he could from both his people and these people. A terrible idea occurred to me. "Caecilia."

She kept her helmeted head forward as we rode. "What is it, Venita?" 

"We can't afford to be captured. We can't let them experiment and develop light-programming that works on us. They could use it against our home." I deliberately avoided saying Amber Three in case they were listening in.

Our leader said nothing at first, but that momentary silence spoke volumes. As we reached breakneck speeds and yet saw no end to the walls of watchers in sight, she responded calmly, "Everyone keep one of your grenades at the ready. If you get too injured, or you're about to be captured"

"We understand," Larentia said with grim sorrow. "Ceece." 

Paulinus said firmly, "Yes, sir."

Trajan laughed. "They won't take *me* alive, the bastards."

I looked back at Flavia, and she nodded. We didn't need words. Just ahead of us, Celcus and Sampson gave no reaction, but I knew what they were thinking. If it came to that, they would rather use guns, and I knew my tall man would take care of me so I wouldn't have to do it myself. Between Noah and Flavia, Septus still lay slumped over his bike, held up only by the two of us working in concert. It was a small consolation that he would not have to feel it happen.

We could hear them over our engines: boots stepping in concert. Caecilia called a halt, and we listened as thousands upon thousands of footfalls echoed between the high buildings of our horrible city-maze. She said simply, "We have to break out of this." We knew what she meant, and, at least personally, I was in too much shock to condemn the idea of continued killing. But rather than have us shoot our silent watchers, she bade us follow her onto our feet and into the crowd, leaving the bikes behind. Dozens of knives sliced out like so many willful spikes; my teammates fought with the butts and lengths of their rifles, but I squeezed my gloves a few times and brought out the Multi-tool from under my sleeve for its first real use. A perfectly balanced bat of black metal formed in my hands exactly as I had imagined. In the crowd-cast shadows of a bright white streetlamp, I cracked a stabbing woman in the head. She fell, only to be replaced by an old man who looked like my grandfather. I charged him and bowled him back against those behind him.

My backpack absorbed several knife blows meant to end me, as did the physical therapy device on my otherwise weaker arm. For all other attacks, Celcus and Sampson worked in tandem with me to keep the enemy at bay while Flavia and Noah dragged Septus between us. Just ahead, Caecilia, Larentia, Trajan, and Paulinus lay about with even more fervor and skill than they had against the spheres during the Siege of New Rome; like this strange civilization-beast, they were a wordless unit of four cogs comprising an elegant monster of violence. Men and women fell away silently as blunt impacts disabled them and sent them stumbling into their fellows. Suddenly, we were free of the crowd and running down another alley.

Without bikes, we were in serious trouble, but we were also afforded new opportunities. While Paulinus rolled a smoke bomb out to cover sight of us for a short time, Larentia shot the lock out of a door and led the way inside. Trajan carefully shot every other door in the alley and left them all hanging open; catching up to us as we dragged Septus, he smirked. "Let's see their algorithms figure out which door we took."

Ahead, Caecilia took point and cleared each hallway. The building had been emptied of people to form the human barricades in the street, and that meant the enemy had finally lost track of our exact location. Our leader went to lift her visor to see better in the dark, but then thought better of it. "Up is a fool's errand. We go down." A stairwell afforded access to B1. We carefully walked down, clearing each angle. B2 came and went, and we began to run. B3 was unlocked, but not deep enough. We hit B4; Caecilia pointed her rifle down the well and studied the further depths. "This'll have to be it."

Bursting out into a parking structure, we realized with no small contagious hope that the entire downtown area was connected underground. Now I understood the depths of our training back home, for running in full gear and backpack was no easy feat, but every ounce of endurance meant that much higher a chance of survival. To tire was to die. Noah was not one of us, but he was far less burdened by gear; Trajan and Paulinus took and carried Septus between them as we ran at full speed between countless rows of cars, vans, and trucks. At various points, Caecilia had us plant wireless low-frequency detonable explosives from our backpacks. We had taken these to break through any barriers we might have found on Amber One during the capture operation, but this situation was far more pressing.

Section after section took us from open parking to private areas to hallways and back to open parking again. Could we really run the entire length of a city? No, not even if we delved into the second and third levels of human endurance.

"That's far enough," Caecilia panted. "Time to find a vehicle to hotwire." Smashing window after window, we broke into numerous vehicles until we found one whose steering shaft we vaguely understood as similar to our own. Despite difficulty catching her breath, Caecilia laughed out loud at our choice. "It seems, as the saying goes, we have met a friend in a foreign town." Indeed, it was a long and empty rectangular truck that could have been the brother of the one we had driven during the sphere attack. She and Trajan took the front cab again while the rest of us piled in and readied ourselves; driving out, we took ramp after ramp. Each ascent added stress to our already keening adrenaline, for each new floor meant we were that much closer to combat again. I watched B3 pass in bold green text; curving around, B2; curving around, B1; I closed the back doors.

And then the echoes of our engine changed, and I moved forward and peered through the small window between us and the cab. Caecilia turned the truck onto a main street and gave no outward indication of alarm as we moved between endless battalions of armed and uniformed men. This, then, was the truly trained military. I realized that we had been facingand had murdered a hundred ofour counterparts. The initial response had been from local police and militia forces, as we had been before being absorbed by the military.

But no. These silent hard-eyed and emotionless automatons were not like us. Never.

Even though that was how the military caste had always been portrayed in our locally-produced movies.

Even though that was how the Legates wanted us to be.

I slumped to the metal floor in the same position I had fallen during the Siege of New Rome. I just

The truck shook as something very heavy and very loud passed us, and I leapt up to peer out and see the rear end of a tank as it moved by the window. I could do nothing but remain frozen in place. A *tank?*

We almost got away with it. We were actually about to turn when I noticed Trajan looking in a side-view mirror repeatedly. He shouted; Caecilia jerked the wheel. I knew instinctively we had been noticed and that the tank had turned and fired, but I had no time to react as the explosion narrowly hit an unseen wall beside us and slammed the truck over on its side. Thrown about violently, I had the wind knocked out of me, but I forced myself up on my metal-clad arms and found my rifle in dusty darkness.

Bullets pinged the outside of the truck like hail, but we had no choice. There would only be a short time before another shot from the tank ended us all. Paulinus kicked open the broken rear door and fired out at the approaching uniformed men. Dozens fell, but they kept coming without relent. Flavia coughed painfully and then joined him in firing. I could see shrapnel in her arm, but she was still able.

Helping Celcus, Noah, and Sampson up, I checked their injuries. Sampson had a bleeding head wound, but there was nothing we could do for that at this moment. Noah was mostly alright and grabbed Septus, whose limp unconsciousness had protected him from harm. Celcus had bruised ribs; he tried to brush it off, but he needed my help to move. Together, we pushed out of the rear of the truck and around behind it while firing at stony approaching faces that exploded into fountains of red like so many dolls falling in unison.

Caecilia and Trajan leapt ahead from high on the overturned side of the cabin; the second shell hit, and the roof of the pushed truck knocked us all forward into the crowd with a wide metal thump. I saw Trajan take a stab to the thigh before he roared with rage and began battering his way through teenagers, children, and old men. Even at the end, we were better than simply gunning down the innocent. For my part, the multi-tool became a bat again, and I flew into a frenzy with the last of my strength keeping the silent knife-wielding monsters from Flavia and Septus. Sampson and Celcus bashed head after head, but I could see them slowing as exhaustion and pain overtook their combat senses. We barely made it into another side street before the third shell cleared away the knife-bearers and shrouded us in smoke. The indiscriminate firing had actually helped us.

This time, there were no approaching footfalls. Only the tank moved forward. It was slow but inexorable. We could hear it coming, and there was nothing we could do. We were outclassed, and the unconscious civilization-entity knew it despite having no thoughts of its own. The lone-tank behavior was proving to be superior in terms of losses vs efficacy.

We hid behind two dumpsters on the vain hope that they might absorb one shell; sweating, red-faced, and pained, Caecilia held up the detonator for the charges we had set throughout the parking structures beneath downtown. She gazed at it with a grimace. "It's not going to negotiate."

Behind me, I heard Noah shake his head. "There's nobody to negotiate *with.*"

She lowered the detonator. "I can't. All those people..." None of us argued. There was a chance the destruction would cave in the city and take the tank with it, but it went against everything that we believed ineverything that was *right* in some grander sense beyond mere daily choices. Controlled or not, such an act would kill tens of thousands at the very least, and we had seen enough human beings die back home. "Wait," she said with inspiration. "We've got all the parts for the sapphire turret in our backpacks, don't we?"

Trajan leapt up without needing to be ordered. "Slow that thing down while I assemble it." We threw our backpacks in a pile so that he could rummage through them and pull out the chrome and sapphire pieces. To Noah, he said, "Stay here and help me build!"

Meanwhile, we ran toward the front of the alley. The tank had to be delayed; it could not be allowed to reach us and find a firing solution before Trajan was ready. I knew it was very unlikely that we could hold long enough, but, strangely, I was not afraid of dying as long as I was with my family.

We charged onto the street and faced the approaching tank in a spread line. I had never felt such an adrenaline spike as at that moment facing down the open smoking barrel of a cannon that could obliterate me in an instant; we tarried for the briefest beat before running on toward the other side of the street. The fourth shell blew a crater in the street behind us, for the aiming and firing of such a weapon was slightly slower than the foot speed of unburdened infantry in a city-maze.

Caecilia guessed that it was aiming to fire at the corner of the building we had taken refuge behind, but she didn't give it the chance. Without our backpacks, we ran faster and lighter through the edifice itself after shooting open another door; the tank fired at the corner where we *had* been, and we emerged into the next alley closer to shoot at the armored vehicle from the side. We couldn't damage it, but the disruption to its forward momentum had been accomplished. It stopped and swiveled to aim its devastating cannon at us, and we ran the only direction we couldtoward it.

Adrenaline stress became a pure exhilarated rush as I followed my team leaping and bounding onto the tank and over it; Celcus and I were the two gifted the opportunity to leave grenades around its treads while the uniformed men in the distance behind the tank hailed bullets overhead. It was a desperate exercise straight out of an action movie, and, at our meager success, I couldn't help but feel a surge of pride and accomplishment in a deep way that had been trained into me from birth. We dove into the nearest building as the grenades went off; they had little effect and the tank continued to rumble past the front windows, but we emerged into our original alley just as Trajan and Noah finished assembling the long-barreled blue-and-chrome weapon. We clustered behind it as a last ditch effort to survive.

Trajan pulled away from the gun as it began to emit a high single-note song that held the characters of both an inwardly drawn breath and an angry gasp. We recoiled with him as a viciously icy wave expanded from the turret in every direction save back at us; clattering followed. Ice precipitated out from the very air itself in an alley-filling sphere as the gun drew energy into itself. He shook off rime and shouted, "Is it supposed to do that?"

The armored behemoth pulled into view. Its cannon began turning toward us.

"No time," Caecilia yelled. "*Fire now!*"

How much energy was there exactly in a mostly-complete sphere one actus in radius? I had mere heartbeats to stare at the iced brick walls ahead and at the crystalline patterns creeping up my darkened visor; in the first heartbeat, I recalled an old movie reference about the surprising amounts of energy inherent in matter and space-time; in the second heartbeat, I made a guess, and then I multiplied that guess by another guess; in the third heartbeat, I screamed.

But Trajan didn't hear me in time. His hand had reached the grips. He pulled.

This was no jet engine ramping up to speed like the Rotation. This was one single instantaneous slap from the hand of the air itself enraged. We began in the safe zone behind the weapon, but the rushing fist still slammed us right past it and sent us sprawling and tumblingsuch was the force of vacuum behind numerous dodecahedrons fired with all the fury of a rapid-fire railgun. None of the projectiles hit us, for Trajan had pressed the trigger only for instant, but a mere instant was enough. My visor cracked as staccato walls of booming chaos threw us back the other direction; sliding across ice, we had no ability to stop ourselves from piling painfully against each other in corners. There was no sound but the roar of apocalypse, and I knew I would have been deafened or even knocked unconscious if not for my helmet.

The third and final hurricane went rushing back in to fill the void the explosions had made, but this was weak enough that we only slid across ice for a short time. We lay spread out and brutally bruised; we lay stunned and confused.

That confusion turned to horror as we scrambled to our feet and took in what a mere instant of that horrifying gun's fire had accomplished.

The tank was gone, yes. The tank *was* gone.

Caecilia lifted her visor to reveal a face as ashen as the landscape before us. Her falling hopes mirrored the delayed crumbling collapse of buildings far to our left and right.

Larentia took her helmet off completely; stumbling and falling onto one knee and a hand, she shook her head while staring wide-eyed.

Celcus grabbed my hand reflexively. I hadn't even felt him approach. On my other side, Flavia did the same.

"I didn't know," Trajan said behind us as he sat injured against the wall, audible more by radio than by voice in our temporarily dulled hearing. "*I didn't know.*"

Paulinus put a hand on his teammate's shoulder but kept his unblinking eyes forward. "None of us did, brother."

Sampson stared, absolutely silent.

Only Noah seemed still able to move. He walked forward among us, eyes ahead but hands touching each of us. "We have to go. Dwell on this later."

Caecilia was the first to break out of the spell. Looking down, she took three breaths, and then ordered, "Pick up Septus. Disassemble the gun. We have to get out of here while they're still in shock. After this, they won't hold back. If they choose to napalm us, I won't blame them."

Snapped back to reality by our training, we went about grabbing our backpacks and quickly disassembling the turret as a team. It was still quite hot despite the ice it had precipitated by draining energy from space itself; I threw my two pieces in my pack and hoped we would never have to fire it again. I knew in my heart that our military in its rush to get things done had given it to us without test firing it, for nothing so horrible would ever have been sent out with a grey-class squad like ours.

"Get extra shirts out," Caecilia ordered, watching a thick wall of grey approach. "Helmets on, stuff fabric around your mouth and neck. Do *not* breathe that in."

We did as ordered, and our exit from the alley led us straight into a nightmare for which I was glad I had assembled what felt like a partial hazard suit. The atmosphere had been replaced by smoke; cool night air by fire; buildings by rubble; silent watchers by limbs, gore, and moaning torsos. A child bleeding from two shoulder-stumps wandered by crying, and my heart seized. A woman lay among broken stones as buildings continued to fall in the distance from the severe damage they had taken. Her cries... her cries.

Her cries.

Her cries were not of pain.

As we passed, she screamed *thank you* over and over again in a manner I knew I would never be able to forget.

*thank you thank you thank you thank you so much thank you*

Despite the numbness crushing my chest, I was crying. Tears rolled down inside my helmet and into the fabric over my mouth and nose.

Her cries were echoed by the scorched and bleeding dying all around us. Through the smoke, block after block, we heard gracious thanks from the bottoms of the hearts of every person we had not yet fully murdered. I looked to Flavia in shock, and then to Noah. He had not been exaggerating in the slightest: these people had been prisoners in their own bodies, and they moaned now with thanks for their freedom. Only Noah had heard them before, but they had been begging to die.

Did that make it better somehow?

Did that make it easier somehow?

The behavior of the city's citizens was no longer organized. The survivors wandered at odd paces; some faced walls, some banged into things, and some jittered in place. Unable to be reprogrammed by red lights that had been obscured by smoke, outright destroyed, or cut off from power due to the damage we had caused, their behaviors could not be fixed or adapted. The military legions we had seen moved past us in the billowing darkness, still intent on the position we had left some time ago. Heading left and away from the devastation, we crept back to our bikes and found them lying on the pavement. They had been knocked over by the powerful shockwaves, but were otherwise where we had left them. The enemy had been after us, not our rides. In the depths of the fire-lit and smoke-filled night, we climbed on and rode out as silent as the human beings here that we could not help.

Caecilia's bitter rage was sincere and true, and for this I loved her. "We're gonna come back here someday," she said in crass informal, anger and tears rife in her voice at exactly the amounts I needed to hear. "And if we can't save these people, we are going to burn this entire place to the ground."

We dared not make a fire the rest of that night for fear of pursuit. After dressing our physical wounds as best we could, we sat in the cold darkness, each alone, each fighting demons in pained solitude. An argument could have been made that we had not known that a single instant of fire from the sapphire turret would destroy a full quarter of the city and kill what must have been at least two hundred thousand people; indeed, we had been thanked by those so murdered. Perhaps we had technically done nothing wrong if one was to get lawyer caste about it. That argument did have merit. But we had not *only* done that arguable act. We had personally shot at least a hundred men and women first. It had been to survive, yes, and they had been armed, yes, but

I sat in the dark sobbing and clutching my head. *Reasons* didn't make it any easier. *Excuses* didn't make it any easier. In my nightmares, if I was not falling forever through the sky or being swarmed under by black spheres, I would see a child wandering through a landscape of smoke and rubble without arms, and there was no way I could take back what we had done.

Otho had said the sapphire turret might be used to destroy a mountain. We had taken that as a joke, but I had a suspicion he had been completely serious.

I wanted Flavia's touch and comfort. I needed to hear Caecilia tell us how it was. I wanted Celcus to insist it would be alright. I could have used some of Noah's strange wisdom. I wished Trajan would crack a joke. I hoped Paulinus would justify this for us with his sharp sense of morality. I watched Larentia for signs of support of what her sister had ordered. I considered knocking myself unconscious to consult with the kind man in my dreams whose presence made me feel safe, and I would even have dared to speak to Sampson in a way that I was not supposed tobut I deserved none of these people's love that night. By starlight, I studied the face of our unconscious teammate. Alone among us, Septus was still pure. Because of his presence, we were not yet wholly tainted. Bandaged, bruised, bearing shrapnel, or even unconscious, none of us had escaped unscathed, but we were not *bad people*not yet.

	<TEXT> Gritting my teeth, I held my arm taut as the green-shouldered medic cut away my cast with a handsaw normally intended for lumber. Keeping his eyes on his work, he gave a sheepish smile as he pulled back and forth. "Sorry, we've had to improvise."

I could only half-whisper, "It's fine." And then: "*Stopstopstop!*"

Tiny traces of blood oozed out from the yellowed plaster, but he had not cut too deeply. Only Celcus was with me, and my tall man held his breath as the medic grimaced and brought a rock down on the thick part of the cast. It broke open and fell away, leaving me mostly unharmed. The medic laughed in disbelief at his own success.

Glaring, I asked, "First time opening a cast this way?"

He patted my back. "You'll be fine, soldier." With that, he reached over for the next splint device I would wear. For a few moments, I had a chance to hold up my oddly slim and disgustingly pale arm. Metallic red hairs stood out stark and mammalian against sickly white. This alien limb was part of me. I had never had a section of me I considered *weak* before. I looked up at Celcus, and he looked at me, but we had no more time to process. The medic scrubbed my skin clean and then clamped a long metal bracer over my forearm. A connecting joint piece and a shoulder mount followed.

"You're lucky we still had a few of these in stock," he explained while having me do a few pressure and push tests to calibrate it. "It's an automatic physical therapy device and pneumatic assistance mechanism. Right now, it will do the bulk of the work for your weakened arm so that it functions at the same strength as your good arm. Over time, it will do less on a declining gradient so that your real muscles gradually take over. It's waterproof, and you can't take it off until you're ready. Do you understand?"

If I had considered my pale white arm alien, this robotic carapace made me feel like a Terminator. I couldn't hide my grin. "Yes, I understand."

"Alright. Great." He grabbed his things and began to head to another in the long line of patients in the crowded medical tent, but first he regarded Celcus. "You take care of her. Don't let her take it off, not even to itch."

"Itching? Will it get bad?" he asked.

The medic just gave a mischievous and slightly sadistic laugh while moving on.

Haunted by that, I stared at my metal-covered arm. I imagined I could already feel itchy spots beginning to germinate in my skin unseen.

"Don't think about it," he murmured, taking me by my disused hand for the first time in weeks. I had worked out my grip as much as I could handle, but my fingers still felt weak. The arm itself, however, moved silently and capably with the assistance of my auto-cast. As of that moment, I felt mostly whole again. The only permanent outer differences between my naive self and my current self were the wild scars on my cheek and temple.

The time of illness was over. We left the medical areas; Celcus and I walked the high path opposite the rivers of smoke from the charnel pits where some portion of the world's three billion corpses were methodically being dealt with. Three billion; one unavoidable, one ordered, and one unfortunate. The virulence models had all woefully underestimated the ravages of diseases from other realities.  Between the Crushing Fist, the Dimensional Rotation, and the Time of Sickness, we had nearly been cut in half as a people.

But for every major loss, the shouting messages of pride and strength from the Legates only increased, and the ranks of the military swelled further. The diseases had taken the most vulnerable; children, the elderly, and those wounded in the initial two crises. That had left millions of parents and caretakers free to join up. Legate Blue was not wrong in saying that this was a time of great need, but Celcus and I had been bred, born, and raised for this. Those without a lifetime of training would have far lower survival rates in the field. I often had misgivings about the direction our society was going, but I was not a philosopher or a politician, and I had no words to articulate the ominous portents I imagined circling over our heads. At times, the circumscribing rotation felt like ravens heralding doom; at others, vultures awaiting a feast. Recently,  the pattern had begun to feel like a clock whose hands were always ticking and always winding down.

Standing at the apex of a high ridge and looking over the nearest valley full of burning bodies, Celcus brooded. "This is exactly like the final scene from *Love and Duty.*"

"But this is life," I told him. "Not a romantic comedy."

He sighed. "What's going on with you, though? This concern may sound minimal in the face of everything that's happened, but we were about to go out the day it happened. I wanted a chance to get to know the parts of you beyond duty and service."

The wind began to shift, and we started walking before the vast columns of corpse-smoke reached us. I held my arms against my chest reflexively and said, "Do I have any parts of me beyond our training and our caste?"

"Of course you do. There's a world of love and beauty behind those green eyes of yours, and I want to see more than just hints."

Despite my best intention, I laughed rather unkindly. "Wow, is that a line from something?" After a few noises of disbelief, I asked, "What have I ever done or said that was poetic or productive? I don't even have any interests beyond the movies and games the Legates tailored for us. What's the difference between me and Flavia?"

He was more confused than hurt, and he gestured with his hands for a moment without saying anything coherent as he tried to put together a response.

I continued relentlessly. "What's the difference between Septus and you, for that matter?"

"*Septus?* Are you saying that you"

Exasperated, I gripped his forearm with my weak hand. "No, no. It's not like that. I just mean that we are barely starting our lives and we have never had a chance to become real people. Our upbringing has seen to that. If these disasters hadn't happened, we would be doing our civic service, joking around in locker rooms, and training. That's it. That's all we've ever done. Train, plan, strategize, and compete."

"But we're the best," he replied in protest, still not getting itand quite aware that he was not.

I decided to try another way to explain the pain I was feeling. "We're gonna die, Celcus."

He stopped on the gravel between two ridges. Sea salt crunched under our boots. "Don't say that."

"If not on this mission, and not on the next, then *someday*," I insisted. "What then? Do we just become names on the walls of our caste's Remembrance Halls?"

He was trying hard not to sulk. "That would be a great honor."

"Have you ever been there?" I asked louder. "Have you ever *read* any of those names? Do you know who any of them are? Do you *care?*"

"We do not denigrate the dead," he countered, beginning to walk again.

"Why don't we?" I yelled after him. "Do they take offense? Can they hear us? Are they able to watch the events of the living like some sort of play?"

That froze him in his salt-crunching tracks.

We stood under the morning sun for a time, neither one of us looking at the other. For questions like these, it seemed everyone was alone with their own thoughts. After a time, I took his hand, and we walked back in silence.

The one upside to losing half of our global population was that food was no longer a desperate issue. Despite centuries of isolation, we had stuck to the original mandates of our creation, and vast food stockpiles had been kept underground. These would be almost exactly enough to feed the remaining peoples until the farming caste got things up and running again. Legate Red had often been on television and radio talking about how *lucky* we had gotten by having the logistical supply and demand curves meet in such a fashion, and Legate Yellow had probably ensured the media channels were completely in agreement with that sentiment. This narrative was just another raven cawing overhead in the eaves of my mind.

Trajan and Paulinus, the two men in Caecilia's four, stood on the border of the base waiting for us. I had only started to get to know them during the Time of Sickness, for they were hard-eyed and focused at all times. Trajan was absurdly fit, strong, and handsome in the manner of well-jawed Legates of old, but a bit too cocky about it for me to take him seriously in that way. I preferred my tall lanky Celcus and his short mop of brown hair, something which I'd had to let him know often when Trajan had come around to get to know us in a real way during the Time of Sickness. The illnesses had been a great equalizer in a way; with all operations suspended and all people everywhere sick, sniffly, sweaty, and disgusting all at the same time, Legates, Centurions, Evocati, Pedites, and more had mingled casually and without rank or ceremonymingling in this case meaning wandering in fevered dazes, lying about groaning, and crawling to water a few times a day.

I knew Paulinus less well, for his quiet was born of respect and duty rather than smiling arrogance. The length of his dirty blonde locks lingered at the extremes of military allowance, but this was the only extravagance he allowed himself. Whispers said he had been born into the politician class but had chosen to give up his power and position and join the military caste because he had simply believed it the right thing to doand he had done this at sixteen, long before the crises and at an age when I had still been more worried about online games and boys than moral callings.

At our approach, Trajan and Paulinus hurriedly waved us forward, and we followed them to the outer camp that had been established to hide our grey-class operation without looking like we were hiding. All that mattered was that there was no solid trace of our presence; no written missives, no supply requests, and no personal relationships with those at the base proper. Later, nobody would be able to definitively say that we had ever been there. In that regard, the flood of new recruits, and therefore new faces, would wash away what vestiges of our interaction we could not help leaving behind.

Within the major tent, Caecilia and Larentia stood at one end of a wide table while a gleeful engineer crouched over various devices at the other. Flavia, Septus, and Sampson waited and watched slightly off to the side; the latter glanced our way and then quickly flashed his gaze back to the demonstrations as if embarrassed that he had looked at us.

We spread out and followed the excited engineer as he explained the various equipment choices they had been able to develop based on the technologies the disasters had dropped in our lap. From the emerald armor the Noahs had broughtisn't that strange, don't you guys think? A whole bunch of clone guys just show up with this stuff? They're pretty cool, though. And their blood had some antibodies that helped with the worst of the plagues. But that's neither here nor there. What you really gotta check out is this Drop Barrier we made using the fields the emerald armor generates. It's alive, you know? Oh, you didn't know? Well it's sort of like an eel, in that it can generate its own field. It gets energy from your movement over time, and expends it when something tries to damage it. It doesn't even know it's protecting you by protecting itself. It's not sentient. It's more like a snail in a shell, except without the snail. It *is* the shell. And these sapphire rifles, oh boy, we have learned such an incredible amount from these. They don't have conventional power sources. They seem to draw on space itself with some sort of specialized zero-point energy harvesting process made possible only because of the unique physical laws inherent in the sapphire itself. In other words, we can't make more of these. Sorry guys. Unless you find some Gemstone Hierarchy worlds while you're out there. Or is it Hegemony? Gemstone Hegemony... that sounds right. But that's neither here nor there. Oh, but what I was saying, the sapphire rifle energy generation process gives some credence to the theory that time is cyclical. Isn't that wild? We can get into that later. Um, this, this one, this one is awesome. This is a transmorphic sword made from repurposed sphere tech. You know the way they could spontaneously spear and stab or adapt their forms? Well it's intelligent, and it's designed to take generalized directives from afar. It'll respond to your will as long as you're wearing these gloves. The circuitry's in the fabric, you see. We don't fully understand the sphere technology yet, but they're easily malleable, so this sword is the first result. It can turn into a shield or a helmet or any tool you can imagine. I think you'll find it very useful, and the risk of it turning on you and trying to kill you is extremely low. Oh! *Yes!* The chaingun! This portable modular chaingun is made from multiple sapphire rifles and our technology so it can fire the dodecahedron rounds very fast. Anything you fire this at is going to be absolutely obliterated. People, vehicles, mountains. Be sure to set up the base and anchor it into the ground first. The kickback on this is just plain

Caecilia looked as if she was back in the throes of the Time of Sickness. "Please, Otho. Focus up."

The rest of us sighed with relief as Otho the Engineer finally stopped to breathe. After a deep gasp, he bowed lightly. "Of course." Pointing to each thing in turn, he said, "Drop Barrier. Transmorphic Multi-tool. Big fucking gunnine thousand."

I smiled at that; looking around, Sampson was the only other one who had gotten the reference. Nobody else here had grown up on games, or perhaps they were too weighed down by the seriousness of the situation to care. 

"What about the hoverpacks?" Caecilia asked. "I heard they were working with the agravitational crystals to enable infantry flight."

Otho shook his head, and his grungy brown hair flopped with the motion. "You either need huge amounts of it compared to the mass of other objects it's lifting, or proper harmonics. It won't work with just human beings. We'll make airplanes and helicopters out of it for better fuel efficiency, but that's the most we can hope for."

"That's very disappointing." Our leader regarded many of the technologies on the table and decided aloud, "We can't take most of these other ones with us. We can't afford to be recognized. We'll take one Drop Barrier for emergency use, and just the one will give us plausible deniability. Perhaps we stole it from you."

Otho raised his eyebrows at the thought that anyone could steal from the military and engineering castes and get away with it.

"The Transmorphic Multi-tool I think we can take, because nobody will know anything about it beyond what it looks like at the time. A sword or a hammer or something. And this chaingunI do badly want to see what it can dobut if we use it, it'll make too big of a splash."

"No, go ahead," Otho countered. "We're not going to make another one of these. We started with only two hundred sapphire rifles, and we can't make more. This is a test prototype just to see if it was possible. There's also a self-destruction mechanism you can use to erase any evidence it existed." He paused. "Or you can use it blow up something really, really big."

Caecilia's wide grin was that of a leader empowered beyond her expectations. "*Awesome.*"

She directed Trajan to wrap the long multi-barreled blue-and-chrome chaingun in blankets and carry it back to somewhere safe; he put the accompanying base rods and long stakes in a backpack and carried about three hundred librae of equipment out all by himself.

"Show me the Drop Barrier in action," Caecilia asked.

Otho took the small emerald device, pressed down on it, and dropped it to the ground as it lit up like a spark. We watched in awe as a fan of shimmering energy about the height of a person radiated upward and outward. Otho tapped it with a hammer; the impact sent a ripple bouncing around like fast waves in water. "It'll recharge as you walk around with it in your pocket or what not. In terms of kinetic protection, each use can absorb about the impact of a loaded-down truck before it fails." He reached down, turned it off, and handed it to Caecilia, who regarded it with thought.

"Who gets the Transmorphic Multi-tool?" Otho asked.

I had already spoken before the question was done. "Me."

All eyes turned upon me at my sudden volunteerism, but no explanation was really required, and protest was not forthcoming. Otho shrugged and handed the gloves and sword to me; donning each one, I then imagined what I wanted the tool to beand it folded up and surrounded my good arm, exactly matching the design of the auto-cast on the other.

Larentia and Paulinus nodded with appreciation, and Caecilia pointed a proud finger at me. "Nice. Now it's disguised."

I had not had the thought to disguise it until after I had volunteered, but I wasn't even sure of my own reasons. All I knew was that I had to push harder than ever before if the people I loved were going to survive this. As everyone else was dismissed and filed out of the tent, I waited. Catching Otho alone, I asked, "Do you have anyI don't know, textbooks?"

He seemed far more unsure of himself when he was alone with a female. "Um. Probably. The Internet's been down, so we had to do things the old fashioned way. What kind?" 

"Medical. And science, I guess."

"I have some basic ones."

"That'll do." I accepted three beginner's textbooks from him and ignored his burning cheeks and awkward stares. I had forgotten to put on makeup that morning to dim myself down, and this was just one of the consequences. "Thanks, Otho."

He scratched his beard and made a noise of agreement.

Once outside, I flipped through the books as I walked. Here was anatomy, including a breakdown of everything that made us human, and here were basic medical procedures. It occurred to me as I looked at these that we had never been assigned trained doctors or medics. Had the medical caste simply always been available at home or on bases? Or was it some consequence of the view that we were expendable? We would be heading out on a grey-class mission with no medical support. We knew enough about the human body to understand how to break it or avoid breaking it, but none of us had even basic training with triage. Why did my world have such glaring omissions in thought and purpose? Closing the books, I stopped in place under the noon sun. If we were missing certain things, perhaps we had traded them for strengths in other areas. I turned and headed in a new direction.

"Noah?" I asked, approaching -401's tent cautiously. He was not military, and I had guessed right that he was still asleep.

Within, he rose, groaned, and rubbed his eyes. "What's up, Venita?"

In the informal tongue, I asked, "What would you say our strengths are as a people?"

He smiled lightly at yet another question that was, as he had termed it during the Time of Sickness, out of the blue. "Let's see. What have I seen here?" He climbed out of his cot and directed me to turn around. It was a strange barrier from his culture, but one I didn't mind allowing him. While I faced outside and he dressed for the day, he said, "Your people have a rather incredible fitness of sorts. Not just physically; you've suffered multiple absurd devastations and you're all plugging along as a global team without a moment wasted on misery and complaining."

"Is that not how it is in the Empire?" I asked, watching the sky outside the tent. "Or, how it *was.*"

His laugh was judgmental, but not overly unkind. "We got flabby and apathetic in our safety, and again, not just physically. I'm not from the First World, but they were a prime example. You know why the Crushing Fist was allowed to get so bad? They weren't manning the walls of the Empire anymore."

That brought a confused frown to my face. He couldn't see it, but I knew he could feel it. "What happened? Sickness? Infighting? Did the military get ordered back for political reasons?"

"No." He gave a heavy sigh. "Apparently they just... gave up."

The sensation of spinning that concept filled me with threatened to make me nauseous. "I'm sorry, what?"

"They literally gave up. They just... stopped. The First World military was still in operation, but mostly at desks back home, lazing around, attending parties, who knows what else. Instead of putting their lives on the line at the border, they just... didn't."

It made no sense. "What did they think would happen with nobody manning the Shield?"

"It was somebody else's problem," Noah said for them. "Somebody else would take care of it. It was the bystander effect on a massive scale."

I glanced back, but he did not see me looking. "What's the bystander effect?"

He blinked. "Huh. I guess you wouldn't know. Individually, every single person in the Empire came to be a bystander in a structure far larger than any of us. So large, in fact, that none of us felt like a part of it. Almost all of us were at the bottom and too far from the decision-making to understand it in the least. Without understanding, there was no caring, and we just let other people in distant capitals handle things. That in turn led to corruption and control rather than good leadership. See, that's your strength. Every single one of you has a role and feels directly responsible for participating in the survival of your world. It's astounding. In the rot and apathy that was the Empire, healthy seeds were germinating in protection all along. Now you get to grow somewhere new, somewhere free from disease."

Part of me felt warmed and inspired, but another part asked, "Distant decisions led to that?"

"Yeah. Fates decided in closed rooms by powerful people are rarely favorable for the unknowing."

My healthy fist was clenched tight, and I slowly unraveled my fingers and forced myself to stop dwelling on the Legates and the consequences their decisions had had for us. *Lucky.* That claim resounded in my thoughts. "Thanks." I departed without another word, something to which he had grown accustomed.

Our scheduled departure time neared. Caecilia had opted not to have us leave early, for the initial step in our mission would simply be to find a safe spot and last a single night in another reality. The first time she had sent us out, we had lost Porcia and our mission nearly immediately. This time, she and her Dangerous Fourshe had laughed as she had used that old nicknamewould go with us. We were all in this together, for we had all made the deal with the eerie information broker in the white room.

And it was watching in some manner. Noah had informed us of a periodic awareness brushing over our group in particular; whatever it was, it was spending great effort to observe us. It could only manage to watch us once or twice a day, but it was growing increasingly irritated for reasons unknown. Caecilia ordered us not to tell Noah any more than necessary about our deal, for despite being on our team he was still an off-worlder, but I couldn't help but wonder if he might have known something more about the entity. We could only hope it understood the need for delay during the Time of Sickness. As things stood, we were finally healthy again and setting out as soon as possible.

"I'm pretty sure all the versions of me on Amber One evacuated before the end," Noah said as he stood talking to Sampson. "But I only seem to remember things after that from perspectives here. I don't know if this quantum entanglement has a range limit or what, but I have no idea what the other eighteen hundred mes are up to."

Sampson ran a hand through his short brown hair and shook his head. "Two thousand yous? It would drive me crazy."

"It can be a bit confusing."

Flavia saw me approach and waved, but continued to ask her question. "If there are some yous still on Amber One, will you have intel from them once we get close enough?"

"Yes, I hope so."

Before I could reach the conversation, Celcus ran up behind me and grabbed the metal around one of my arms. "Hey."

I turned and smiled up at him.

"I got you this," he said quietly as he shoved a can of soda into my hand.

"Are you serious?" I asked, dumbfounded. "This could be the last soda on the planet."

"I know. Drink it when you want it most," he told me warmly. "If we have a really bad day out there, you'll have this to cheer your spirits."

I glanced over to make sure Sampson wasn't looking at us, and then hopped up and kissed my tall man quickly. "This is wonderful. Thank you!"

Beaming, he walked with me up to the assembly point.

It was odd being out of uniform while assembled, but that was the nature of this mission. Each of us was dressed in drab browns and greys designed to look nondescript. We had initially considered black, but anyone dressed in large amounts of black would look very suspicious. All black would practically scream *spies* or *ninjas*. Among us, the one most inconspicuous was Septus, who I had hardly noticed in his fully grey clothing. Something about it reminded me of our sweats back at the academy when cadets had been trained to be neither heard nor seen unless spoken to, and my brain had almost immediately discarded him as a thing until I had seen his eager face. It was the first time I had seen him positive since Porcia had died.

The Dangerous Four arrived exactly at the stated time, and they looked incredibly surreal in plain clothes. Trajan still grinned arrogantly, sure, but his muscles were hidden under baggy clothing; Paulinus looked at ease in traveling gear, while Larentia itched at her slightly oversized brown tunic. As always, Caecilia was completely cool, confident, and focused. In fact, she smirked proudly as she saw us. "Look at this bunch of non-descript losers. We might as well be homeless-caste!"

Others smiled, but Noah looked to me, and I shook my head to say without words that *no, that was not really one of our castes.*

This time, no modifications to my bike were needed, for my arm-and-cast pairing had become two machine-and-human hybrid limbs. With loaded-down motorcycles and heavy backpacks, we looked like proper bandits, and I shouted to Celcus, "Hey! This is like *Love and Duty* too!"

"No, this scene was in the first one!" he shouted back over the roar of our engines.

"Not *Love and Duty Two!*" I yelled at the top of my lungs. "I meant this is also in *Love and Duty!*"

Caecilia pointed at her own helmeted head, and we quickly donned our black riding helmets. A moment later, her voice crackled in our ears. "These *do* have radio, you know."

I was sure she could see the embarrassment in my cheeks burning right through my visor as a bright red glow.

The guard shift change was at its critical point, and we set out exactly when nobody would see us. I stayed close to Noah, for he had only had a few weeks to learn how to ride and thus was still a bit wobbly and uncertain. For this, though, he managed, and we disappeared around the nearby low hills in short order. The rift in question was heavily guarded, but had been reserved as a secret by the Legates. The bunkers that had been built around it aimed their artillery at us, but nobody questioned us or stopped us.

And just like that, I found myself in another reality again. The sky here still did not shimmer like mine had for most of my life, but it felt alien in a completely different way. That blue had not been breathed by my people before. These trees had not been flattened by the Rotation. These hills were unkempt and full of vegetation, and the going was rough. It was amazing. Had a human being ever passed this way in all of Time?

"We're heading toward a certain symbol on the map nobody has investigated yet," Caecilia radioed. "Based on our gradual deciphering of the meanings, I've come to believe we'll find human beings there. A sister Earth, perhaps. I haven't shared this intent with anyone back at home, since we're on our own now. I'm hoping we can find refuge or make allies there tonight."

Interesting. I hadn't expected there to be other human beings out here, but then I remembered my histories. The Empire had maintained widespread contact with numerous Earths in the nearby region and even had fairly brisk travel between those colonies and the First World for a few centuries. People not in the knowcommon folkhad sometimes wandered between worlds naturally and termed these places fairy worlds; in more recent times, parallel dimensions. What had become of them as the Empire's willpower and might had faded? At the very least, we were about to find out the fate of one.

Most of the afternoon was spent struggling with high grass, deep underbrush, and muddy riverbeds, but we made about the progress that Caecilia had expected. When we finally approached the last rift, we were exhausted and ready to rest; we laughed and joked as we pushed through, rode out of a thick forest, and found ourselves among high undamaged buildings on streets filled with human beings walking this way and that to wherever their evening activities might be taking them. We stuck to the pavement and they paid us no heed, for we were simply non-descript bikers in the traffic. It was only when we saw glowing red lights up aheadnot directing traffic, but bathing the sidewalksthat Noah began shouting incoherently. Most of us looked over at him and not directly at the red lights, but Septus was not so lucky. He fell and began convulsing with seizure, and the mood around us changed immediately. As one, the traffic stopped, the pedestrians on the sidewalks froze, and hundreds of eyes turned upon us.

"Retreat towards that alley!" Caecilia ordered, having Trajan pick up Septus as he seized and shook. "And do what Noah saysdon't look at the red lights!"

Alarms began sounding in the distance, alerting the city to our presence, and it became clear we had made a grievous error. Pulling out our weapons as hundreds of citizens lifted their phones and began filming us for unseen watchers, we readied for whatever was cominga fight perhaps, or worse, but certainly horrible judging by Noah's continued shouting.

	<TEXT> I had to do a little research for this reply, because "My heart beat to racing" is one of the lines I've pseudo-secretly intended to come off as an artifact of translation from Latin grammar to English grammar while still (hopefully) being correct. You can see a couple of these if you scan back through the stories with that in mind. My instincts told me it was correct, but I can't find anything strictly for or against it. In this instance, the intended use is along the lines of 'oscillation', 'pulsing', and a rhythm that rises to a racing level. As in, 'My heart oscillated to a racing level' or 'my heart pulsed (faster) to a racing level' not said in so many words.

But if it comes off as an error I'd rather change it than have people get taken out of the story. </TEXT>

 A giant Cybernetic Bear, part Bear, part Robot, and the size of King Kong comes out of the woods and attacks them. It is sick and dying, infected with mystery snot and worms, but it still lives. They manage to kill it with the guns, shooting a little radar dish on the top of its head. As it powers down, it's pretty cool the stuff it says.

While I wait for him to speak, I lift the lid and take a drink of my sodaoh, so sweet, so wonderful. It burns away some of the stuffiness in my sinuses. Am I sick? The girl in the movie is sick. In fact, her sweat has gone beyond a mere sheen and become a half-encompassing bath. I fight to breathe.

"You have to move," he says suddenly, snapped out of his consideration. "You have to climb!"

The open circle of my soda cup refuses to recede from my vision when I put it down, and I instead find myself falling-but-not-falling into the splashing liquid. The cup grows in size until I am struggling to escape the deadly circle of frothing liquid within. Pushing at the plastic sides, I find only jutting stones.

Throwing my head this way and that, I managed to breathe between heavy rain and rising waters. I was still in the well, and had only just managed to wake up as the rain's swelling had closed around my face. I could hardly look up for the force of the torrent pouring straight down the long neck of the well; the crises had torn its cover away, and I should have realized the danger when I had been looking up at the stars. In the movies, the Rotation had always brought horrific storms once the cycle of weather began to reassert itself. I had nobody to blame but myself for seeking this place to be alone.

This couldn't be the way I would die. Not after everything I'd survived; not before the questions I had were answered. I was still weak from fever, but I called upon that third depth of energy, my very soul, the thing that might go on after I fade, to pull myself up and out of the water with one arm.

But only just so.

I shouted, but the rain was too loud, and the well too deepand everyone was passed out from sickness besides.

There was only one way to get help.

At first I tried to focus, but that was the wrong way. I went the opposite path instead as the water reached my shoulders; I stopped fighting it and let the pain of my losses fill me. My mother and father, barely remembered, who chose ideology over me; poor wonderful Tacitus, who had given me his breath gladly and without a word; Rufus and Porcia, who I had known as budding teammates, but not nearly as the lifelong family they should have been. And now I had been ordered to make my grandfather sick, and I knew the Legates who had ordered a billion deaths already had no compassion for the *acceptable range* of further losses. These pains jabbed into my heart as a thousand little needles; using that pained beating as a fulcrum, I sent a giant spike into the unknown worlds of emotion as a curse and as a prayer for all that had been done to us. Fate, Chance, LuckI didn't know its name, but I demanded it answer for the punishments we had not deserved. Bashing the rocks of the ancient well with my single hand, I screamed, "*Give me back my people! Give them to me! Give them back!*"

But the only answer was a head poking over the top of the well. "Venita?" Noah asked with concern. "What are you doing down there?" He dropped down the rope with a bucket on the end, and I tied it around my waist under the freezing water as raindrops pummeled my face and matted hair. He wasn't military caste and thus couldn't lift me by himself, but his aid was enough. I climbed the age-old rocks until I could fall forward over the broken lip and lie in the mud.

"Are you alright?" he shouted over the storm.

I wasn't, and wouldn't be. Not for a long time. The storm, to me, represented the oversight and power of the embodiment that might exist somewhere beyond life. "I don't care if you won't tell me," I shouted back, more to the sky than to him. "If this is what you do to us, then I spurn you. We'll do it all on our own!"

The storm did not have an answer for me, but Noah helped me up and led me back toward my home. I knew the real struggle was only just beginning, but, for the moment, anger and determination were mine. I would survive this illness, this *sick day* and its weeks of recuperation, and I would help the ones I loved to survive it as wellthis day and all the crises ahead, no matter what it took.

	<TITLE> The Grey Riders [Sick Day] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-29 00:14:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We met the next morning after a night of preparations.

"Do we need the other two hundred Noahs in here?" Caecilia asked as she regarded our newest guest around the strategy table in the center of the non-descript grey room.

After the guard finished undoing his handcuffs and departed, Noah-401 shook his head. "Anything you explain to one of us, we'll all know." As we stared at him as a group, he looked down at the basic blue clothing that marked him as a military prisoner, and then back up at us. "Did I stain something?" He paused. "Oh."

Hard-eyed, Larentia asked, "Are you a collective entity of some sort?"

"Oh, no, nothing like that," Noah-401 replied, carefully stepping forward toward the strategy table. "Our quantum decision tree has just gotten decidedly tangled." Seeing the combined stares intensify, he elaborated, "We're all the same person at the same point in time; due to a rather strange snafu in spacetime we purposely exploited during the crisis, we're just from different quantum decision branches. I'm not sure if we all share one soul, but we certainly have perspective and memory overlaps."

Beside me, Flavia leaned forward over the table on her hands. "So you can remember all two hundred cells you were in?"

He shook his head again. "Nah, they're all fairly blank white rooms. Nothing to differentiate the memories. Same with eating, or walking, or sleeping. You don't remember ninety-nine percent of the things you do in a given day, and it's the same with me. Only the important and memorable things are shared."

Caecilia smirked. "Like plans to attack Amber One."

"Yes, like plans to attack Amber One."

Next to Flavia, Celcus coughed, and I took his hand for a moment behind her where nobody could really see it. When others looked at him, he pretended to have coughed on purpose. Without moving his head, he shot his eyes left and right, and then said, "Okay then." He gave a second light cough. "And you're human?"

Noah-401 gave a haunting and wistful smile. "Mostly."

"Mostly?" Caecilia demanded. "You Empire citizens! This isn't a television show that just cuts to a new scene after a mysterious quip referencing something the audience knows but the other characters don't. I'm going to have to call you out on that."

Noah-401 reacted with some surprise. "Yes, I, uh, do actually have a special relationship with narrative structure." He paused and studied Caecilia more intently. "Who are you again?"

"The question is still who and what *you* are."

He blinked away his wariness and told us with no small hesitation, "I've come to believe I'm something higher-dimensional races call a gwellion."

"And that is?"

He looked each of us in the eyes as if to remind us he was a thinking and feeling being that did not deserve violence. "A sort of universal constant. I, or, rather, people like mewe witness disasters and live to tell the tale."

"Well, by being here, you've certainly done that." Caecilia stiffened. "Are you afraid we're going to hurt you because of this supposed trait?"

Noah-401 took a deep breath. "People tend to confuse cause and effect between contemporaneous events. If a gwellion's around, disaster's coming. And I can't truthfully tell them it's not my fault."

Our blonde leader gave a forgiving snort. "Some unknown stranger hardly brought all this down on our heads, clones or not."

"I did help it happen," he said quietly. "It wasn't any of the other hundred and ninety-nine Noahs, and it wasn't one of your technicians. Someone else did the actual final command, but I helped prime your world for ejection from the Empire."

Caecilia paled.

Larentia put a hand each on the arms of her two male teammates as they reflexively reached for the pistols at their hips.

Around me, my five made no move. It was up to our superiors to decide his fate. For a moment, I burned with hatred for the horrors that had found us and taken Tacitus, Rufus, and Porciahorrors sent upon us by this strange un-muscled and caste-less *person* that hardly deserved to be called a man. Noah-401's head turned until his gaze was fixated upon me.

Snapping out of it, Caecilia sighed and laughed it off. "Surely it was done so at the order of a superior officer."

That actually seemed to alleviate some of our guest's guilt. "Yes," he said slowly. "Yes, it was."

"Then don't concern yourself. You are not responsible, and none of us here believe so." She looked to us, and we nodded. I was surprised to feel that such a thought *did* in fact lift my anger away. My next self-reassurance matched Caecilia's words. "And it was necessary, aside from all that, due to this Crushing Fist you spoke of to the Legates. We would have been destroyed had you not ejected us, so any damage that action wrought is actually the lesser of two losses."

Noah-401 gave a solemn nod, but said nothing further. I could tell he had seen glimpses of the outside world through various windows, and that what he had seen was beyond consolation or apology.

"Now that we have settled that issue," Caecilia said, "I've got an idea for infiltrating Amber One. We actually have roadmaps and schematics of basically everything over there thanks to our long-standing communications. We just need to" She coughed once, but tried to continue. "We'll" Her second cough interrupted more forcefully, making her face bright red, and Celcus and Septus used the opportunity to release coughs of their own that they had been holding in. Eyes narrowed and blazing, gaze shot to us, Caecilia ordered with fury, "*Everyone to the infirmary!*"

Worried for my tall man but reassured by our leader's quick action, I walked with my team as we hurried out and down the hall with Noah-401 in tow. It was apparent from the change in the base's ongoing chaos that something was seriously wrong; the announcement came on as we neared the infirmary and found dozens of coughing and wheezing guards, scientists, and soldiers. The hallway lights changed color from slightly blue-tinted to slightly green-tinted, and an alarm rotated twice before the words rang out. "This facility is now under the control of Legate Green by issue of a Declaration of Medical Emergency. All personnel are to stay where they are at until further orders are issued. Close all doors and vents and cover your mouth. Do not leave the premises. Do not initiate contact with others. This facility is now under the control"

While the announcement repeated, we groaned. The medical caste's ways and concerns had never been ours, and, while we appreciated their work, sickness was for the weak. Orlooking at Caecilia, Celcus, and Septus as they leaned against the hallway wall, it became clear that new pathogens from other realities had found their way back to us. Perhaps, in this case, even the military caste was susceptible to illness. I looked down at my hand and at the traces of sweat that still remained from Celcus' grip.

Streams of face-shrouded men in white coats with green shoulders flooded past, and we could do nothing but follow orders as they swiftly took control and began assessing the situation. I was placed onto a cot sitting next to Flavia and Noah-401; he told us, "Don't worry. There's more biological connectedness between worlds than people realize. In all our running around during the Crushing Fist, nobody's gotten sick yet."

Haunted, Flavia shook her head slowly. "We've been sealed off for a thousand years."

Noah-401's confident expression fell as he regarded the crowded cots and pained patients. "Do you think it's me?"

I swallowed, and thought I detected the slightest hint of stiffness in the back of my throat. Did that mean I was about to be sick, too? "We sent out numerous teams, and some have returned, no doubt bringing back dangers. But go check with somebody anyway."

Flavia touched his arm. "You might have antibodies."

"That's right," he said, eyes wide. After a single beat, he hopped off the cot and chased after a nearby green-shouldered man.

Flavia and I were left alone to lean against one another and cough intermittently. I didn't know if it was hearing everyone else cough or if I genuinely had the need, but I suppressed it as much as I could.

"It just won't stop," she murmured. "It's going to be one crisis after another until we're all gone."

Gazing absently at the blank white wall opposite while my head rested upon her shoulder, I asked in formal, "Are you losing your courage?"

She moved roughly underneath me with a cough and replied with the proper saying: "As long as a single one of my siblings lives, I will fight on."

It was not common to give anything other than a nod to that, but I told her, "I know you will," and she turned her cheek against my hair and smiled.

I was awoken from slumped sleep by the call to assemble. Finally, after an immeasurable time spent on that uncomfortable cot in that loud hallway, we were being given new orders. Following burbling streams of sweaty men and women with runny noses and disgusting coughs, Flavia and I found places among the numerous rows building in the outside courtyard of the base. Proper posture was difficult for many of those around us, but they managed, for they shared our endurance. The other castes were not present here.

He was not seen as often as the others, but I still recognized Legate Green. In his high-shouldered medical uniform decorated with medals not for valor but for bio-genetic triumphs and epidemics contained, the white-haired and dark-skinned man from one of the eastern continents stood tall on a recently constructed platform. "This is a grave decision, but it is one we must make. All military operations are suspended until this illness has passed through our populations."

The man in the crowd shouting out at random would usually have been a critical loss of face for all of us, but, in this instance, our thousand assembled hearts leapt together. He cried in shock, "What would you have us do?"

I broke posture to look to Flavia, and she to me. We had never once in all our lives *not* had a purpose.

Legate Green studied the man who had shoutedand the rest of uskindly. His bemused but compassionate smile underscored his words. "Young man, you are ill with a cocktail of viruses brought to us from other realities. Your duty now is simply to heal thyself. No exercise. No training. No combat. Your foremost civic performance at this time is to lie on a couch or a chair or grassy hill and do nothing at all. Eat fatty foods. Drink a couple sodas. *Take a sick day.*"

"Pathetic," someone muttered to our left. To our right, a woman gave a snort of disgust. Complaints circled through the crowd; all discipline had been lost. *Sick days* were something the fancier castes took when they didn't feel like going to their cushy desk jobs or their fingers got too sticky from eating donuts to type on their computers. I shook first with confusion and discontent, and then with a strange shivering weakness. I had been sick before, of course, but I had never once complained. To do so would have been to disgrace my entire team.

"In fact," Legate Green continued as he paced back and forth across the low stage. "We have no resources or infrastructure to quarantine these illnesses. We have been doubly devastated in recent days, and the new rifts all over the planet are pouring in various amounts of wind, water, and contaminants from other realities. Given certain regional dangers looming, we cannot afford the time it would take for each various sickness to naturally work its way around the globe. You are just one of many infected groups, and the rest of Amber Three has already been informed: we are ordering an anti-sequestration."

At that, the undisciplined crowd went absolutely silent. My own voice caught in my tickling throat as I realized that we would basically be forced to go back home and sicken our families. My grandfather

"Go out into the city, and to the farms, and to the rural suburbs," he announced. "Every single Amber Three citizen must be infected as soon as possible. We must burn this fever out *together.* We must end it now and return to health before our enemy finds us."

"Sir." This time, the speaker raised her hand.

He nodded toward her.

"What if one or all of the plagues are lethal?"

Flavia and I looked on with fear at the answer to that question.

Legate Green motioned to one of his entourage beside the stage and took a clipboard handed him. Reading it, he spoke aloud, "Preliminary tests indicate acceptable mortality ranges. We will not *all* die under any circumstances; we were cut off from the multiverse for roughly forty four generations, which has put us in a bad spot genetically, but not doomed us altogether. We will survive this. *You* will survive this. The real danger would be in allowing these various sicknesses to continually drain strength, morale, and time during the coming war. Today, this week, this month, when you can lie at home and restthat is how you will survive this. If we do not do this, the afflicted will fall ill when they are traveling, wounded, or fightingand they would die. This is the only way. Now I can order you to do this with a Medical Mandate, but I prefer to have your loyalties to this course of action. Do you all understand?"

A few replies were given discordantly.

Louder, he said, "Do you all understand?"

This time, the shouts were as onesave for Flavia's, and thus mine. She did not join in the unified acceptance, and I held back to support her solemn concern. As the rows of men and women began moving out of the base and we along with them, I felt her eyes on my back. A billion people had died in the flood of compressed space brought by the Crushing Fist; a billion had died in the Dimensional Rotation ordered by our own Legates. Here, now, was another such order. How many would be lost to this strategy? As Flavia had expressed to me earlier in the long hours of hallway waiting, the lesser of two losses was still a loss. How many strategic losses could we take before their sum still amounted to extinction of our way of life? I

This cough was real. I gripped my mouth in horror. I would have to go back home and infect my grandfather! With all our duties taken away save this, I had no other purpose. *We* had no other purpose. We were the bringers of death now to our own families and friends. This was our vacation; our *sick day.*

"Hey, wait up!"

On the curve in the dirt road just outside the base, Flavia and I split from the ranks to await Noah-401.

"Don't you need to help the doctors?" Flavia asked. "Give blood or undertake tests something?"

He gave a wan smile; he'd wanted to laugh, but the situation was too grim for that to be appropriate. "They've got two hundred of me for that. I have a reason for going with you, but I cannot tell you what it is just yet, so Ihow do you do this? I formally request assignment to your team."

Well, he was at least *trying* to fit in. Flavia didn't care either way, so I shrugged. I had too heavy a duty to undertake to care whether or not he came with us. We began walking, and he followed.

Freed from any particular location or dutyindeed, even from any oversightwe were left to wander back the route the helicopter had taken us to get here. Outside of military camps and bases now, the widespread devastation of our crises was no longer a distant or hidden thing. Feverish, we paused to rest under an overturned oil tanker that dominated a lonely and empty mud flat that had once been a wheat field. Like a mountain of curved metal, the boat remained tilted on its side, with no possible access by any means to the decks high above where bodies hung on the rails and silent smoke stacks pointed up and out at the afternoon sun.

"You guys must have seen this location and chosen it as a place to meet up," Noah suggested.

"We did, actually. Always have a backup plan," I told him, my heart sinking. "But our duties now are solitary. For the time being, we are not a squad or a team. Celcus and Septus and Sampson and the others will have to walk their own paths today."

"I see." He gazed down at his worn shoes as he sat in the slim shadow of the tanker. "At least you get to go home, and have people you care about. I've only recently been able to accept that I'm a part of this at all."

"This?" Flavia asked.

"The human race. You knowpeople."

"Because of there being hundreds of you?"

"Oh, no," he said with self-deprecation. "That's very recent. No, my distance started long before thator any of this, really. I guess I'm here trying to help because the solitary path leads nowhere."

Interesting. I had never once been alone in my entire life, and all of my trials had been endured with the help of allies and family. Did Empire culture lead to individual isolation? It suddenly occurred to me that this person among us was foreign in ways I had yet to understand. After a cough, I asked, "How do you see us?"

He glanced at Flavia quickly, and then locked his gaze on mine. "We'll talk about that later."

Odd.

But fair enough.

Leagues of soggy farmland awaited us, and we slogged slowly. The seas had been poured upon this place by the Rotation, not just drowning the land, but salting it as well. I guessed that nothing would ever grow well here again, but farming caste men toiled under the hot midday sun nevertheless. I gave them salutes for their determination, and they responded with solemn knee-bends as was customary for their caste. We were of equal standing, brothers and sisters at the bottom rungs, but ours would be the hands that would rebuild the foundations of the world. Noah watched with curiosity, and I studied his reactions to our ways in return.

Beyond the fields of the farming caste, we came to understand what two billion dead really meant.

"We can't go this way," Noah said, covering his mouth with fabric from his plain blue clothing.

Flavia and I both shook our heads. To cut around would take far too much time and strength. Steeling myself against the stench and sight, I pushed ahead through the low grasses.

Some had drowned after breathing compressed space and been carried here. Some had ruptured open when the pressure had lifted and the dry grey liquid had re-expanded inside them. Some had survived the tidal wave but fallen through the sky during the Rotation, much as I had. I held my broken arm close and tried to pick my around the massive splatters of organs, shattered bones, and blood that lay untended on the open flatlands. If due to illness I fell here on the nightmarish plains of wasting, would I be the last? Or would the rest of my people follow crisis by crisis as Flavia feared? She was a solid soldier, aware of dangers and conscious of fear but willing to do her duty in the face of it without hesitation. She was a solid *person.* I had to take her concerns seriously; things would not be fine just because I wished them to be so. Not anymore. Something fundamental had changed the day our safety had been torn asunder, and life would be very much harder now.

"Oh, gah, no," Noah muttered, stepping back out of a wide pool of red biomass and broken white spears that had once been a rather large human being. "Where are the birds? The scavengers? *Anything?*"

"You endured the Rotation in your cell?" Flavia asked.

He fought back the urge to vomit and replied to the affirmative.

She sighed. "Then you didn't really see it. Didn't really endure what it meant to be out here unprotected when it happened." She scanned the dull non-shimmering sky that had not too long ago become a hurricane to end all hurricanes. "No more birds. No more scavengers. There won't be; not for a long time."

"So these people will just rot out here?" Noah asked. Kicking a defunct black sphere out of his path, he held a hand over his nose and added, "Or, rather, cook out here under the sun."

I could no longer hold in something I hadn't realized I'd been containing. "Shut up!" I stalked over and confronted him. "These are *people.* These are *our people.* There's nobody to come pick them up and bury them or figure out who they were. Their families will forever hope they walk back in through the door someday. They'll never know what happened to them. Do you understand? These stinking cooking piles were *people.* They're not disgusting. They're not horrible. We might be the only ones who ever walk this field and see them as they fell. In pain. *Scared.* So you just *shut up.*"

Taken aback, he could only stare at me and retreat a step or two. Flavia watched the interaction with concern.

Breathing hard and sniffling, I turned away. What had *that* been? I felt embarrassed at my undisciplined outpouring, but oddly relieved. I didn't understand what I was feeling or where that had all come from, but I hoped that was the last of it. I was a calm, cool, and capable member of the military, and I was implacable. Yes, I was fine.

For three leagues, we walked in silence, paying our respects to the dead. At long last, the sight of standing healthy trees unexpectedly refreshed our spirits. Whole forests had been torn up and cast down the eternal cliff that the Rotation had temporarily made of the world; the range of fallen logs had ended long behind us when the region of pooled left-behind ocean water had begun. We sat in a grove of willow trees to escape the sun and emptied the last of our canteens between rough breaths. In some sense, the exertion of the walk had kept our symptoms at bay, but my nose began running freely as we rested and looked out across the rising hills ahead. The major slope of Collis Oppidum could be seen in the distance, and I began shaking as I saw my home growing close. Flavia and Noah tensed, but I clenched my hands and forced myself not to feel whatever it was that lurked behind me. The open world felt hollow, like a stage lit harshly by the afternoon sun, and dark feelings moved behind rear curtains out of the sight of the audience. To escape them, I moved to the front of the stage and pushed ahead with energy I did not feel.

The swampy terrain became too wet to pass, and we were forced to find the rough remains of an elevated road upon which endless lines of sick, tired, and hungry people walked at slow speeds in both directions. A few shouted to us as newcomers, informing us of the anti-sequestration, but one look at Flavia and me showed them that we were already sick.

"Who is the strange one?" a wary woman asked in formal.

Noah couldn't understand her, but it was clear what she was getting at. In the informal, he replied, "I'm, uh, from Canada."

Her suspicion lifted and she laughed before pushing her children on ahead. Now that I thought about itnow that I saw him outside of the small circle of people I knew wellhe did have a very obviously *different* look about him. His facial structure ran foreign in a way I couldn't quite place; not a recognizable look from one of our own distant continents, but different on an uncanny and completely new vector. What had Legate Green said? Forty four generations' difference? With that in mind, I could suddenly place him as vaguely Eastern European in descent. That dispelled my uneasy feeling.

He grimaced. "What?"

There was no way to explain it without sounding weird. "Nothing." We joined the flow of people.

Ahead of us, a tired father spoke to a chatty mother he did not know. "Us? We just took refuge in the shelters like everyone else."

"Weren't they cramped?" she asked.

"Extremely." One of his daughters coughed, and he pulled his kids aside.

We walked on, and I looked back repeatedly for reasons I didn't understand. The little red-haired girl smiled as her father leaned over her and checked her lymph nodes. Because he kept a calm face, she had no idea that anything was wrong. When we curved out of sight of her, I faced forward again to find Noah watching me. I grimaced. "What?"

"Nothing." He kept his eyes ahead for the rest of the walk.

Many of the buildings in the protected side of the major hill were still standing despite their ancient and poor construction. The pattern was such that we could actually see stark outlines of the various disasters and their effects; this block still stood, while that block had crumbled, while still another no longer existed at all. These patterns made it clear that the survival of my block at the top of the hill had been an uncommon feat. A league-long spray of rubble had created its own water- and wind-break, just as the piled wood had blocked the door and rear window and protected my grandfather during his nap.

He stood at the door waiting, and smiled as we approached. "I see you've brought a friend, my granddaughter."

Noah hesitated as he found himself put on the spot; he began to reach out his hand, but then gave a shallow bow instead.

My grandfather smiled. "Come in. We'll have tea."

We sat in the front room and I waited with a heavy heart. When my grandfather brought three cups of tea, I looked up in askance.

"You and I will have to share," he said, speaking informal for our guest's sake. "If I am to take ill, as we all must this day."

I lowered my head. "I don't want to do this. I don't want you to get sick."

"You would defy orders?" he asked calmly.

I looked to Flavia, and she returned support for whatever choice I made. But before I could speak, my grandfather spoke for me.

Billowing his robe gallantly, he stepped one leg up onto the table, bent his knee, and raised a fist high. "Fear not, granddaughter of mine! For I have a secret. I cannot *be* felled by illness!"

Flavia grinned widely while I groaned. I said, "Not another story! We have a guest!"

Noah beamed. "Please, carry on. I *love* stories."

Taking his cue, my grandfather stood completely on the table and began shoutingwith a fire I had not seen in some seasonsabout our family's unknown lineage and heroes from other worlds. His wild imagination and fiery tales had kept me feeling safe and entertained when I was young, but nowno, it was still the best. Our neighbor pounded on the wall angrily, and I couldn't help but laugh. No cough or sneeze could find me now; my grandfather was too busy climbing on furniture and having imaginary swordfights with beasts out of the past, and I was too busy laughing.

I awoke in the dark of the night with a tremendous weight upon my senses. Blowing out wave after wave of foulness into tissues, I turned to apologize to Flavia and my grandfatherbut they were both passed out. Only Noah was awake, and he sat in the dark near the rear window gazing out onto a night landscape that seemed as bright as day under the moon's chill glare. "Can they hear us?" he asked.

"We don't eavesdrop," I retortedbut I felt bad. "Sorry."

"It's fine. I haven't told anyone this," he said quietly. "But I can sense emotions."

My limbs tensed as I flashed back to the various moments of intense emotion I had experienced during the dayand the moments he had turned to look at me as if startled.

"Yes," he continued, as if responding to what I felt. "But that's only part of the reason I asked to come with you today. There's something very wrong here."

Scooting closer to the window so that I could see devastation made pretty by the change in lighting, I asked, "How so?"

"When you fell asleep, I did some investigation of my own. I hope you don't mind, but I tried to watch some shows on that little black and white television you've got in the front room."

I shrugged. "What of it?"

"I found a romantic comedy in your discs, one made locally." He reached to his left and pulled an unopened can of soda over. "I didn't drink this when your grandfather gave it to me. I thought you might want it, seeing as how it might be one of the last sodas produced for awhile."

Grabbing it, I gulped down several chugs of wonderful burning bubbly chill and then sighed. "Thank you! That's genuinely nice of you."

He looked back out over the jagged moonlight shadows. "I saw a Dimensional Rotation in that movie; two lovers separated tragically by worldwide destruction. Have you seen it?"

Still breathing out that wonderful carbonation, I said, "It's a cliche. There are a dozen like that."

"That's what I mean," he replied, practically whispering now. "Your romantic comedies are brutal action movies. Nothing about that movie was fun or hilarious. It was death, tragedy, and service from the first minute to the last."

Now he was just being weird. "Yeah? So what? Your movies are all like that, too. I've seenlet me think. Predator, Die Hard, oh, I love those two. Saving Private Ryan. Heat. Gladiator. Have you seen Gladiator? It was *the rage* here like you wouldn't believe."

He gave a genuine little laugh. "I bet." He turned to me, and his face seemed at once silver-lit and shadowed. "Venita, I don't feel any emotions from the people here. On my worlds, the love and hate and fear and hunger and joy float across the world like a multi-colored fog. They practically exude it from their very skin like an everlasting sweat. Here, there's *nothing.* The only person I've sensed anything from at all is you, and even then only traces, and only when your feelings spike."

Judging his sincerity, I studied his face. I didn't quite believeno, I absolutely did believe that he could sense emotions. My face had been stoic, but he had seen right through my armor to the heart of my pains at the moments they had most hurt me. "So your worlds are like the daylight we walked through today, and ours is like this land now under the moon. Physically, it's all there, but the feel is dark and cold somehow."

"Yeah." He seemed surprised at my response. "That's exactly it."

"Maybe we just feel emotions differently than your people do," I guessed, shrugging. "Or maybe we're too focused on our duties to worry about *feelings.*"

"At least in your case, I'm worried it's the second one," he murmured. "You've got a huge weight on your back that seems to be crushing you without you even realizing it."

"No. I'm fine."

"Are you sure?"

His question snapped something tiny in the bottom right of the cavity beneath my heart, and I felt the weakness begin to propagate through my armor. "I'll be fine. I just" I looked down at my moon-lit hands. "I just miss my friends. Tacitus, Rufus, Porciaand I'm afraid I'm going to lose more of my family." I coughed despite myself as my resolve bent.

"Well, I didn't know them, but I bet they were very capable people."

"Huh." I tilted my head to look at him. "That's a serious compliment in my culture."

"Oh. Well, it was meant." He sighed. "If it's any consolation, I've encountered a certain device that proves that souls exist."

"Hm? Of course they do. The soul of any citizen mirrors his or her caste; for us, it is the drive and endurance beyond normal limits. The fire that refuses to be quenched."

"Yeah, but I mean the whole thing. Your immortal energy or whatever it is that goes on after you die."

My heart began beating faster in my chest. Something about the nonchalant way he'd spoken about such an absurd concept made me feel that I was a small town bumpkin that had grown up in a protected shell while the rest of the Empire had lived far greater lives and explored far greater heights than I could have ever imagined. Worried, I asked, "What do you mean by *going on after we die?*"

He looked at my grandfather's and Flavia's sleeping faces and then back to me, confused. "You know, like religion and all that."

The nerves all around my body were burning now at confirmation by his confusion. "Noahwhat's *lidgin'?* And what's *re*-lidging?"

Slow horror crept across his half-dark expression, and the silver half of his face seemed paler even than the moon. With a trembling voice he said, "Don't worry about it. It's nothing."

"It's not nothingis it?" I asked, a matching horror welling up in my heart. "What is it, Noah? What are we missing?"

"I just" He turned and cast out a hand at the television in the other room. "I saw a few shows and movies I knewwhen I was flipping through your discsand I put some inand they were" He stopped himself with a shake of his head.

Breathing hard despite my stuffy nose, I demanded, "They were *what?* You're on my team now by formal request, you have to tell me!"

"They were *edited*," he whispered. "The movies from our Empire that you've seen are mostly the same, but with lots of missing pieces cut out. I thought it was just political, or maybe just some moral prerogative, but"

"Legate Yellow," I breathed, staring absently as my thoughts went wide. "Head of media, propaganda, and relations. She would be the one to make those choices, set those policies. But it can't just be her. Somebody must have made the choice to edit things we see from the Empire a long time ago. Maybe they thought our society would be better for it."

He seemed momentarily less horrified. "Not a completely insane idea, actually. Who's to say?"

I grabbed his wrist with my good hand and demanded again, "So what is it, Noah? What's this thing about our souls and immortality and going on after we die? Is Tacitus still out there somewhere? Are Rufus and Porcia to be found on some nearby or distant world or"

"Stop!" he hissed, grabbing my good arm in return. "These kinds of questions are extremely dangerous."

"How?" I asked, shaking again as something pushed up from inside me. "*How?* If they're not gone, I want to know! You might be able to sense my feelings, but you can't take the thoughts out of my head. I'll go crazy wondering!" Tears began running down my cheeks as the weight he had spoken of finally hit me. "They're *gone.* I loved them, but I hardly knew them. We were supposed to have *lives* together. They were supposed to rise through the ranks, start a family, grow old." Sobbing, I curled forward against his shoulder, not caring how awkward his expression was. "None of that's going to happen now. I'll *never get to talk to them again.* I'll never know what they wanted. I don't even know what *I* want. My career has hardly started. I haven't even had my first date with Celcus. What if Flavia's right? What if we're all going to die one by one?"

Choosing his words extremely carefully, he asked, "You've never thought about death before?"

"It's expected. It's part of life," I choked out, repeating so many viewpoints I had heard from shows and movies I now realized had been edited. "It's nothing. It's just a blank. Nothing after, and our lives comprise nothing more than respectable memories in the annals of the caste. Or so it was supposed to be."

He grimaced and patted my back uncomfortably. "Death's never that simple."

"Where are they?" I demanded, sitting up. I would go to them now and bring them back. "Tell me!"

"I don't know," he said with a heavy sigh. "Nobody does. I'm sorry."

My anger continued rising, and I stumbled up and stalked out of the house, fighting down the urge to scream and punch things with my one working arm. What was *happening to me?* All of my discipline was falling apart, while the smooth grain of duty I had been promised was turning out to be a path full of jagged spikesand my feet were bare.

The night was deathly quiet, for no cars or trucks rolled along the highways anymore. The barest tinge of ice reached me on the breeze, hinting at a terrible winter for someone somewhere, but I cast the wind away with my hand and stormed over to the old well.

The top edges had been badly damaged by the Rotation, but the essence of the ancient hole in the ground remained. Some dozens of my neighbors and family had survived within, and I carefully made my way down with two feet and one hand and sat on one of the ledges at the bottom, adding my tears to the water beneath.

Such questions were dangerous, he had said. What danger was there in wondering? What were the possibilities, even? If that warrior fire inside me could fuel my body in times of desperation, then it truly was energy as he had hinted, and if it lived on after my body expiredwhat then? Where did it go? Where was Tacitus now? Could I give him back the breath I had taken from him and let him live in my stead?

I asked these questions to the quiet darkness of the well in which I sat; the stars were but a mere circle directly overhead. As I sat and gazed up at those distant pinpoints of light representing suns of other worlds so distant as to boggle the mind, the true scope of existence, for just a brief moment, impressed itself upon me. I was nothing at all in the face of that, andwait, what was that?

No, it was nothing. For a brief few heartbeats, I had thought I had seen a small shimmer of sorts among the stars, the tiniest of tiny distortionsbut it had been nothing, and certainly not the personification of Luck or Chance or Fate to whom I had shouted for favor so many times.

Was that it? Was that what Noah and Legate Yellow feared to tell me? Was there really some personification of a universal force out there watching us? Did he, she, or it decide what happened with our lives and souls? What would I have to do to gain its favor? Was it a kind entity, or a cruel one? I recognized this feeling from the day my parents left: absolute and unbridled panic.

My heart beat to racing in my chest, and sweat irked me around my collar and in my hair. Shaking, I tried to climb out of the damp and warm darkness, but my limbs had become too weak. I slumped along the ledge, feeble from fever.

The man with the crooked nose smiles. "What's wrong?"

Shivering in my seat, I say, "It's too cold in here." I look to my left past Tacitus and Rufus. "Porcia, can you go ask the manager to turn up the heat?"

I turn my head back to the right as the kindly man speaks. He says, "Maybe it's just empathy."

Indeed, the girl in the movie sits shivering at the bottom of a well. I gulp. Her situation speaks to me. I feel very lonely in many ways at that moment. "I suppose." I narrow my eyes and sharpen up. "Somebody wants to know your name."

"Do they now?" he asks, smiling wider. "I'm always open to meeting new friends."

"Not this one," I tell him, shaking my head worriedly as I slump in my seat. In the informal, I mutter, "Some creepy ass librarian thing that fakes being human."

"Ah." He puts a finger to his lips, thinking. When he drops his hand again, he says, "You can do what you need to do, but I would prefer you not tell that entity anything about me."

I want to tell him that I won't, but instead I say, "We'll see."

Despite what I said, he knows what I actually felt. "Thank you."

Curled up in my seat while watching the movie, I ask, "Do you know what happens after we die?"

Laughing long and loud despite hushes from audience members unseen in the darkness, he responds with a bemused grin, "Oh, wow. That's a doozy of a question." He gazes forward for a time, and then says, "I've met my Death, but he will never come for me now. I'm thinking your Death may not be coming for you, either."

I remain curled in my seat and feeling low, but my interest is piqued. "What do you mean?"

"You've come and gone from this place multiple times," he says, turning just his head to look me in the eyes. "Not many people can attest to that. Did your latest friend to arrive" He nods down the row toward Porcia, who sits watching the movie with unblinking eyes and pale skin. "did she save your life?"

This is one of the things weighing upon me. Or, as might possibly be said by people like Noah who know more of existence than me, this is one of the things weighing upon my soul. "A cybernetic bear was rigged to explode five seconds after we killed it. She pushed me away and took the brunt of the blast herself."

He positively giggles, and then stills himself. "Sorry. An exploding cybernetic bear? And here I thought I'd heard of everything by now."

I have to ask. I feel like I already know, but I have to ask. "What is this place?"

He hesitates.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Everything about the white room quietly screamed faux neutrality. Even the air itself was exactly skin temperature such that moving my hands through it felt like nothing at all. Though there was nothing to see along the blank walls, I kept my eyes sharp as Legate Blue and his entourage led Caecilia's four ahead of our five. All told, we made a rather representative legion from all ranks and mentalities, but I couldn't help but feel that we were walking into something uniquely dangerous. Celcus and Sam stayed close ahead and behind; Flavia remained at my side as she studied the middle-aged woman ahead.

A single white chair sat before her desk. Had that been there before? I looked to Legate Blue, who regarded us and said, "I am not happy with the mission we gave your group, but it was not an incorrect move. This" He glanced to our hostess with a subtle look of apprehension. "*woman*" His gaze returned to us. "is an information broker of sorts, and we traded some rather precious things for a map of the region."

I could see that Caecilia wanted to speak, but our blonde Centurion tipped her restrained anger beneath the brim of her cap and held back while the Legate continued.

"The complication," he said with regret. "Is that we didn'tand still don'thave a legend for the map."

Caecilia lifted her head. "So you sent my teams to various symbols on the map to determine what each one represented."

He narrowed his eyes somewhat at her speaking out of turn, but then visibly decided that the situation warranted open discussion. "Yes."

"In other words, every single one of my teams was sent directly into danger."

He straightened up at that. "Not necessarily." After giving an unspoken command to one of his entourage and sending the woman back through the rift, he scanned our collected faces and said, "We have been given thirty-seven minutes and fourteen seconds for this round of information trading. We cannot waste it. With the extreme losses we have suffered in the chain of command, Caecilia, you and your men are my most valued assets in this region. Furthermore, your subordinates have been on the ground and physically in other realities, while we have not. I encourage all of you to speak your mind during these negotiations. *Any* thought or observation you find relevant may be crucial, and we cannot waste time with formalities."

Flavia, Septus, Celcus, Sampson, and I exchanged glances as a team. It would be strange to speak out of turn with such high-ranking superiors present, but Caecilia's nod of support told us the Legate's order was legitimate. 

Flavia squeezed the hand of my non-broken arm before overcoming her trepidation and speaking up. "Sir."

The Legate looked to her in surprise, but then remembered his own command; he had clearly not expected interruptions so quickly. "Yes?"

"You said you traded for a map of the region."

"We did."

She swallowed audibly before asking the next question in carefully phrased formal. "Does that mean that our region is unfamiliar to us?"

Legate Blue understood what she was getting at. He ran a hand through his grey-peppered hair and, for a moment, seemed to me much older than when I had seen him back in New Rome giving rousing speeches. "We are still reconstructing the timeline of events, but we do know that a team of clones or duplicants of some sort wearing emerald armor infiltrated one of our dimensional control stations and, with the help of technicians there, ejected our world from the Empire's structure." I had been hearing this man's authoritative, confident, and even cocksure voice most of my life; although it was deeply masked at that moment, this was the first time I had ever heard him speak with true vulnerability. "We have no idea where we are, and we are alone."

The faces of my comrades became as white as the room in which we stood.

As we internalized that, the Legate laid out a hand ahead. Someone would have to sit and speak for everyone, as there was only one chair facing the ivory desk. Still stunned by what we had been told, we remained motionless; Larentia clenched her fists against that fear and stepped forward. Caecilia nodded, and her brunette Optio sat with determination. Addressing the bespectacled middle-aged woman across the ivory desk, Larentia asked, "How do we begin?"

"That is up to you," came the eerily neutral response. Our hostess adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses with a touch of her finger. "What would you like to know?"

Larentia looked left to her superiors. Several cards full of suggestions were put in her hands by the Legate's assistants, and she quickly flipped through themand, for the moment, chose to ignore them. Straightening up and giving a subtle glare, she asked, "Why are you here?"

The woman touched a piece of paper at the corner of her desk and slid it front and center. Trying not to crowd around too forcefully, we looked over Larentia's shoulder.

*box office sales numbers and synopses for movies produced here 1996 to present* | *your diary* | *one uncia of brain matter from the youngest male present*

In the informal, Larentia muttered what we were all thinking. "What the fuck is this?"

Too focused to be bothered by the breach of protocol, the Legate nodded grimly. "Her prices are steep, and often inexplicable. Nevertheless, she means exactly what is listed, even if the cost has secondary lethal consequences." Beside him, his assistants cast their eyes to the smooth white floor.

Brain matter? I winced as I tried automatically to reach out of my sling with my broken arm and touch my temple. The sphere had been trying to drill into my brain in order to"She's trying to learn about us!" I exclaimed.

Our hostess gave a light smile as we unzipped her intentions.

Next to me, Celcus said, "We *have* been sealed off from the multiverse for nearly a thousand years."

Septus shrank a bit as he quietly realized he was the youngest male present.

Caecilia grinned with pride at our deduction. "I bet we're chock full of new information that was never available before." She motioned to one of the Legate's entourage. "Do we have those box office numbers?"

The older man she had addressed replied, "Communications are in severe shape, but I'll try to find someone with access to that data." He looked left, received the Legate's nod, and then departed back through the rift immediately.

Flavia didn't like it at all. "What might we be giving away with those numbers?" she asked. "It's too easy."

Sampson had an answer. "Culture." After a pause to look at each of us, he elaborated, "I experienced this world first primarily through movies, shows, and video games. With that data, we'd be giving away what kind of culture you have here."

Larentia grimaced in her seat. "Well she can't have my diary, that's for sure."

"Speak for yourself!" Septus countered from the back.

Caecilia held up a hand and watched the oddly still woman behind the desk. "We don't have to give anything. I think it's clear we drew attention to ourselves either by being shot here or by Rotating; beyond that, if we've figured out what it wants, we already have the answer to our question, so we shouldn't pay."

"It? Not she?" I watched as our hostess tilted her head as if listening to something in the distance. Horror crept up my spine as I realized that what we were speaking with was more of a puppet than a person; some sort of robot, or worse.

The puppet's light smile still remained. "Those who know how to play the game are appreciated. Your superiors were too desperate and emotional to focus. You are not the first group they have brought in, but true negotiations can begin now."

Seeing the seriousness of the situation dawn on those around me, I shivered to throw off the imaginary spiders crawling up my back. While everyone else watched our puppet hostess, I glanced sidelong and studied the Legate. This was one of the highest ranking officers in our entire military, and I didn't believe for a second he had been *too desperate* or *too emotional*. Maybe in the first hours after the disasters the military had collectively given this entity whatever it had wanted, but his words as we'd arrived now rang in my thoughts: *How strange that you're here.* Why? Had previous negotiations included talk of us? Or not us specifically, but rather a category of subordinates like us? I found it strikingly odd that he was allowing us to lead this situationdid that mean that hidden dangers or costs were at play that he was avoiding by using us as proxies?

I did know one thing: the Legate had traded Porcia's life for the meaning of a symbol on a map.

"We have twenty nine minutes left," Caecilia said, leaning over her Optio's shoulder. "What's the next question?"

Larentia took suggestions, studied a map given her by one of the Legate's assistants, and then asked, "This map shows a large region that appears to have no exits, and we seem to be surrounded by symbols that we now know represent the bio-mechanical threat that nearly destroyed us with black spheres. Worse, it seems the old saying is true: all roads lead to New Rome. In this case, not to us, but to this dangerous-looking symbol at the center of the region. I will assume that the intelligence behind the spheres resides there, and that we are stuck in an absolutely massive deathtrap. The enemy will find us; it is only a matter of time. Therefore, we must act. Are any of these statements strategically incorrect, and, if so, which one?"

Good! I dared not breathe as I listened to the very careful phrasing of the question.

The woman's eyes went distant for the space of a few seconds, and then she re-animated abruptly, pulled a stack of papers over from the right, and carefully placed the top one next to the previous price quote we had chosen not to pay.

*schematics for your planetary Shield generator* | *the color of Oscar the Grouch in the final season of this world's Sesame Street* | *the off-world prisoner currently being held on Amber One*

Caecilia held up her hand again immediately at reading these options. "Don't speak without thinking." After intense thought, she said to the woman behind the desk, "May I ask questions about the rules of our negotiations without paying an extra price?"

Her answer was a curt nod.

"Can we leave and come back during the time allotted?"

Emotionless: "You may."

"Does our time still elapse?"

Ever so subtly sadistic: "Yes."

Caecilia stood taller and began to step away, but then glared and snapped back. "Can you hear us if we speak to each other out there?"

The woman's light smile returned. "*Yes.*"

Our leader looked to the Legate with concern, and then shook her head. "So there's no point in trying to speak privately." She addressed us. "I will choose my words carefully, for you all know me better than this being knows me, and therefore we can communicate openly *and* in secret at the same time. I will say: the game includes not just the prices and our reactions, but the information inherent in all of these as well. The entity has purposely told us a great deal of information with the options presented in this second page."

It was all true. The thoughts had already been storming around in my head, as they had to have been in others, and I was glad Caecilia had acknowledged it. We had just been told that an off-world person existed, that he or she was being held as a prisoner, *and that Amber One had survived.* At the same time, we had been offered an extremely easy middle optionthe color of Oscar the Grouch? That meant our opposition in this strange white room either intended us to take the easy way outor was attempting to mind-game us by offering an apparently easy and innocuous price. And the first option, the schematics of our Shield generator, was both completely out of the question and a subtle warning that our defenses had been tested in the past. This being was aware that we had once been protected, despite never having had a chance to come near us because of our position deep inside the structure of the Empire.

Looking down at her map, Larentia exclaimed, "That must be Amber One! Look!"

Gathered a bit closer to the desk and its eerie occupant, we followed the brunette's finger as she touched upon usa golden-yellow *III* symboland then upon a similarly-colored *II* and *I* at two points across the nearest half of the region. If our guess as to the symbols' meaning was correct, the vectors of our ejected paths through the multiverse showed clearly in the final resting position of each of our worlds.

Beside me, Flavia seemed increasingly distressed.

Celcus offered, "If we assume we're on the closest side of this region, then the Empire must be back that way!"

"We can't assume that," one of Caecilia's male Centurions replied. "But we can have mathematicians confirm after this."

"We haven't paid a single price yet," Flavia muttered quietly so that only I could hear it. "We're being manipulated."

I looked her in the eyes and nodded lightly.

Caecilia said, "Time is limited. We must set upon a goal." Narrowing her eyes and studying the human puppet across from us, she said, "I think we should value the prisoner on Amber One as a price more appropriate than the color of Oscar the Grouch in the final season of Sesame Street, because we do not know what truths we give away with such an answermeanwhile, finding Amber One is already one of our goals, now given to us *gratis* by way of the price options listed." The middle-aged woman began to smile again, but Caecilia slapped her hand down on the desk. "But because that is my natural conclusion, and because I must assume my enemy is extremely clever, I say this: Oscar the Grouch was orange in the final season of Sesame Street."

I watched our hostess freeze while my heart beat five times in room-wide silence.

She began moving again by nodding in appreciation as if to say *well played*and also that the entity's evaluation of us would be adjusted accordingly. Taking the paper, she deposited it in a drawer and then regarded us. "Payment accepted. The question was: are any of these statements strategically incorrect, and, if so, which one? The answer is: no. The statements are all strategically correct given your current state of information."

"*Our* current state of information?" Larentia asked.

Caecilia groaned. "We consulted it about our proposed strategy. We didn't ask for new information."

"That's not fair! It screwed us!" Septus said, stepping forward. Sampson and Celcus held him back with light pressure, and he relented with an unhappy snort.

The puppet woman's smile deepened rather wickedly. "The game is the game."

"*Fine then.*" Gripping her Optio's shoulders, Caecilia told her what to ask with pointed calculation.

Larentia repeated, "With the goal of the survival, freedom, and health of our world and its peoples, what question should we ask you to best serve that interest?"

The paper slid forward held space for two options.

"What's it say?"

"They're blank!"

"What *is* this?"

"If you knew what the options were," our opponent answered calmly. "It would give you vital information you haven't paid for."

"How can we pay prices if we don't know what they are?"

"You can pay to find out what the payment options are."

Flavia cut through our confused arguing with a shout. "**Forget this!** We shouldn't listen to anything this creature says. It'll all be lies and half-truths!"

For the first time, the woman seemed offended. "No lies. Never lies. That would undermine the game."

"*Omissions,* then, and manipulations!"

The offense disappeared in favor of neutrality again. "Of course. The game is the game."

Staring, I fought down a sudden sense of revulsion at the breakneck emotions visible in our opponent. She was fake, and everything she did was presented to portray a mask or to manipulate.

Angry now, Caecilia demanded, "What's the price to find out the first payment option?"

The puppet adjusted her sweater and then looked pointedly at the person in the only chair in the room.

Larentia confirmed with her superior and then repeated, "What's the price to find out the first payment option?"

The paper slid forward held only one option.

*the name of the man in the red-haired female's dreams*

Everyone else realized who it meant before I did. All eyes turned on me.

Septus laughed despite himself and looked up at Celcus. "The name of the man of Venita's dreams?" 

The woman raised a warning finger. "Clarification. The name of the man *in* her dreams, not, as colloquially said, the man *of* her dreams."

Stepping back reactively, I held up my hand in front of my sling and broken arm. "What? No, Ino, they're just hallucinations when I lose consciousness. They're not *real.*"

Now the gazes became stares.

"Pedite," Legate Blue addressed me by new rank now that I was military rather than police. His momentary haunted gaze from earlier was now visible again. "*Is there an entity in your dreams?*"

Faced down by one of the main heads of our entire caste, I stammered, "He's very nice, he's just"

The stares all around became wide-eyed. He interrupted me. "*When did this begin?*"

"I don't know, I" My defense of the kind man with the crooked nose faded. "Immediately after the grey wave."

"When the Shield was gone?"

Feeling strangely violated, I said, "Yes."

Many glances, confused expressions, and unhappy arguments were traded around the group until Caecilia shut us down. "We're running out of time! Do you have his name or not?"

I shook my head.

Frustrated, the blonde directed Larentia further.

Her Optio asked, "What's the price to find out the second unknown payment option?"

Our opponent slid the current papers to the side and then reached into a drawer to pull out a new one.

"Wait!" Flavia shouted.

Caecilia raised a hand, and Larentia said, "Stop."

The woman blinked behind her wire-rimmed glasses, but did not continue her movement.

Blonde looked to blonde. My sister told my superior, "Just cut to the heart of the matter! We don't need to jump through all these hoops and pay horrible prices and have our brain matter taken or our dreams violated. We have the map, we see the stronghold, *just ask it who our enemy is!*"

This time, all eyes turned to Caecilia, and then to our opponent as Larentia asked the simple question that cut through all of the manipulations and games. "Who or what is the intelligence in control of this region?"

If I didn't know better, I might have sworn there was pride in our hostess' expression. This paper she took out of a pocket in her sweater; unfolded it, placed it before us, and held her head back with one eyebrow raised. The only price option for finding out the answer read thusly:

*the off-world prisoner currently being held on Amber One*

"I thought that you might be more interested in this prisoner than you let on," Caecilia said flatly. "But now I'm certain. I'm going to make *you* an offer."

Intrigued, the woman leaned forward and listened.

Turning to the Legate's assistants, our leader took a pen and paper, wrote on the back of one of her male colleagues, and then placed it on the desk and slid it forward past the other papers. We looked on in wonder.

*the reason you want this prisoner* | *schematics of the stronghold at the center of this region* | *the answer to the question we should most ask you for our own health, freedom, and safety*

The room shook slightlyour first solid hint that all was not what it seemedbut our opponent's glasses-bound eyes were impressed and hungry, not angry. "These are the payment options. What is offered?"

"Something you can't do yourself," Caecilia offered with a hint of triumph, for she knew she had garnered us some small advantage. "We will ride out there, even infiltrate Amber One and steal that prisoner if necessary. We'll deliver him to you. That is our offer."

It was all I could do to keep from laughing in amazement. Any one of these three options would be enormously beneficial for us, but each would

The woman reached into a drawer and pulled out thick rolled-up engineering specs that could not possibly have fit within. She handed it to us and said, "These are the schematics for the stronghold at the center of this region."

"I thought so," Caecilia replied, taking them. "We've got less than a minute left. Let's get out of here."

I glanced back repeatedly, but the woman behind the desk had fallen into a state of forlorn dis-animation. We stepped out of the rift and back into headquarters; for a brief moment, I thought I saw the white room flash as something elsesome horrible slimy cave full of dripping gore I thought looked possibly like *brain matter*but only a muddy open field lay beyond now. The sun shone, and there was no hint of our guest.

"She'll be back," the Legate murmured.

His older assistant ran up with the box office numbers and synopses, but there was no use for them now.

Snapping out of the daze caused by what I had seen, I heard Flavia arguing quietly with Celcus and Septus. Coming up next to Sampson as he stood by with a frown, I listened to her say, "We're still doing what that *thing* wants. Attack Amber One? Steal some unknown prisoner? We didn't win! We're still caught in its web!"

The Legate overheard and returned with a serious glance at each of us. "Maybe so, Pedites, but Centurion Claudia Caecilia did extremely well for us and I expect you to give her your full support. We must now craft a plan for the assault on this fortress at the center of this region of death; we have the tools to survive, and I will not spare a single tear for some off-world prisoner. Ideally, if we forge alliance with Ambers One and Two, no military operation will be necessary. But they may not be willing to give up what they possess." He waved our superiors over. "Centurion," he said, addressing Caecilia. "It is not by chance that you came here. A series of events is in motion that is far greater than we can possibly understand at this time."

Caecilia nodded and listened.

"The primary objective of our global military is now to craft a plan to attack the intelligence behind the spheres. We will also find and contact Ambers One and Two in an attempt to create an alliance; retrieving that prisoner will be your task, and that of your subordinates."

"Sir?" she asked, narrowing her eyes. "I admit I am ambitious, but isn't that a bit out of our pay grade?"

He took a deep breath in through his nose before explaining: "*You* made the deal. It is bindingand believe me, that *thing* will find you if you fail."

We'd been sold out. Caecilia stood tall and saluted rather than spill forth the words quite clearly brimming behind her guarded expression. Larentia and her two male peers followed suit. I used my good hand to grab Celcus by the wrist and still his clenched fist. While Sampson and Septus exchanged bitter glances, Flavia just lowered her head and stared at the floor.

"But you are my soldiers," the Legate told us. "This is a grey-class mission that will not be acknowledged by our government. If you are caught, we will disavow you. In that vein, you can also use certain resources that would otherwise be... unethical." He gave a curt nod to the older man that had gathered the box office data; that assistant began leading us away. The Legate gave one final call: "Good luck. Succeed, and survive."

As he led us out of the rear building that had been constructed around the rift and back toward the base proper, the white-haired man grimaced and told us, "He means well, we've just been faced with nightmare after nightmare since this happened, and the right thing is becoming unclear. I'm sorry you kids got dragged into this."

Caecilia tipped her head. "Sir."

He laughed. "Not a sir, just an old man."

Now that we were no longer full of vengeant fire for Porcia's death, we looked around more as we traversed the halls. In room after room, engineering and science caste members worked in great droves; I saw countless spheres being dissected, a set of the emerald armor the Legate had mentioned being studied, and a deep blue crystal rifle of some sort in parts on a table. The base was overcrowded and alive with shouts, rushed coffees, and lunches eaten at desks. I understood: my squad and I would be riding out and braving physical danger, but these men and women of the intellectual castes would be working no less hard and no less dangerously to help secure our world. Dangerously, for the medical area of the base was overflowing with scientists burned and scarred by energies they had yet to understand.

But they would produce wonders, I knew, for their castes and family lines had been waiting centuries for an opportunity like thisas had we. As I saw the fire of their souls I realized that the military caste would no longer be the downtrodden bottom rung of the social ladder; no longer would we be made fun of as useless inside our tortoise shell, or decried as tools of the wealthy to police and control resources. We were *needed.* Watching Caecilia as she walked with confidence, I understood that she had known this from the instant the disasters had begun. She was not at all perturbed by our new mission, for, indeed, surviving it and bringing the prisoner here would tremendously bolster her standing. As Porcia had thought, Caecilia would be a Legate one day. I had no doubt that she was a skilled and worthy officer to put my support behind.

We came to the brig and stood in wonder looking at the occupants of the two long hallways.

Our guide murmured, "The military is on high alert for clones or duplicants infiltrating us, given this situation."

In every cell, standing at every set of bars, the same man looked out at us.

Caecilia pointed at one of the guards, and then at the nearest cell. "Let that one out."

"Sir?" the guard asked, wary.

She regarded this prisoner's lack of muscles. "Even if they're duplicants or something, they're still unarmed, and clearly lack military training."

The nearest half-dozen prisoners heard that and simultaneously groaned, "Hey, come on!"

"Let this one out," she said again.

The guard looked to our guide, who grimaced, ran a hand through his short white hair in the same manner that I had seem employed by Legate Blue, and then shrugged. The two men carefully unlocked the cell and then stood back far out of reach. The guard added, "He only speaks informal."

Caecilia saluted the released man, but the salute was returned only awkwardly. "Not military?" she asked, using the informal.

"No." He looked at each of us, and I felt odd for a moment as his eyes fell upon me and seemed to pierce right through me. "You're all very honest people; the first I've met here. I will trust you if you will trust me."

"For the moment, if you tell us your story, I think we can do that," Caecilia told him as she offered her hand. "What's your name?"

"Noah-401," he replied. He looked forward and back down each hallway. "And these are Noahs 402 to 600."

Larentia offered, "So you *are* clones."

He grinned. "Not exactly. But you don't need to lock us up. We came here to save you."

I looked to Flavia, and she looked to me. She had become distrustful as of late, and I wasn't sure what I thought of these strange men either.

"Really?" Caecilia seemed to be formulating a plan. "Then maybe you still can..."

	<TEXT>  Did you plan all of this ahead? 

You can check out some really long elaboration on that [in this AMA](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/48pu9v/iam_m59gar_aka_matt_dymerski_horror_and_science/)!

 The Grey Riders, their network of inner worlds, their caste system and society, their synthetic planets, etc. Was this all worked out when you started building the multiverse, or is it something that just grew out of the ongoing writing process?

I was aware of their culture and history from the beginning, but the individuals we follow and their path through the crises have been worked out more or less at the beginning of each series.  </TEXT>

It was, however, not a physical threat. A handsome man with strong arms and short brown hair stood beside her with a worried expression; he looked nothing like the boy I had known online, but the cut of his cheeks did hold hints of that youthful face.

Flavia glanced between the three of us and said, "Venita, it's"

"Sampson," I said, staring. "Youbut"

His intense eyes darted down to my hand in Celcus', but then back to mine without concern. Rather, he seemed relieved that I was alive. "With a few others, I forced my way through the transfer terminals to Amber Three during the danger, and good I did. It" He shivered and clenched a fist.

"blew up," I finished for him, my eyes growing even wider at the bevy of horrors that had been cast upon our worlds. It was too much to process, so I focused on the one thing I could understand. "*You're alive!*" I held my arms open instinctively, and he embraced me carefully around my broken arm.

"It's good to finally meet you in person," he said quietly.

While held, I looked to Flavia, and then to Celcus, but both just seemed wary and worried.

Noticing that, Sam backed off and said to Celcus, "I'm no threat to you, her antikin no longer, I see. I have my own love, and she may yet still live."

Very tenderly, Flavia asked, "Amber Eight is gone, isn't it?"

Sam didn't accept that. "I'm alive. Others may still be. In that regard, I'm signing up to join the teams that are going out to search the multiverse. They're looking for food, yes, but I can do that at the same time that I look for others from my Earth."

We three remained uneasy for a moment, but it was Celcus who broke the tension by clasping Sam on the arm. "We are all friends now, and loyalty matters above all. Join our squad."

I gulped, but some part of me didn't want Sampson to disappear elsewhere the moment he had finally appeared in my real physical life. "Yes," I said tentatively, before reinforcing it. "Yes. Join us. We've lost two of our family. We could use you."

Flavia warned me with slightly raised eyes, but bowed slightly to the newcomer. "Yes, join us."

"Alright," he said, relenting. "I thought I'd be a stranger here, but I've lucked upon the only people I know on this entire Earth."

"Not luck," Celcus told him. "You came to New Rome because you had a connection here, and you found it."

Shoulders were clasped, humor was exchanged, and I reveled in the unexpected *addition* to my family rather than further loss. Life... could go on.

We met up with Porcia and Septus the next day. Along with hundreds of others, we were given direct training and orders from Centurion Caecilia and her peers. Nobody knew what to expect through the rifts, but they told us what they could about the multiverse and handed out compass chips that would help us find our way. The only working vehicles were motorcycles that had been light enough to stay tied down during the Rotation, and even then only a few dozen in the entire region could be immediately repaired by the engineering caste. We were to be sent out in waves as each pool of bikes was made worthy of use, and our six were among the first.

Wearing the deep red and silver befitting her new Centurion rank, Caecilia found us as we readied our gear and worn uniforms. "Not those," she said, handing each of us one of her carried plastic bags one by one. "These."

We unraveled them to find that we had be given new black uniforms with gold trim. "But this is what *you* wore," I said, surprised.

"That's because the special assault squad positions have been vacated by our promotion," she told us with a grin. "You'll have to fill in."

Flavia gaped. "Us?"

"We've seen your team in action, at school, on the force, and during the siege. You work together like no others, and you're fiercely loyal to one another." She paused at the exit of our tent and turned back briefly to face us as we grew tall with pride. Her grin became a knowing smirk. "Besides, everyone else is dead."

We deflated, but the comment had been made in that kind of humor only the mutual survivors of a disaster can share, and our deflation became laughter on the way out.

She departed, telling us only, "May Chance be kind to you."

Porcia gazed after her with awe. "It's like none of this got to her at all. She's going to be a Legate someday, isn't she?"

Before turning to don his new uniform Septus replied, "No doubt."

That was an interesting thought, given what Larentia had asked of us. Was Caecilia even now planning for the future?

"I'd follow her," Porcia said hopefully. "She seems honest."

Celcus smiled and said, "Maybe one day you'll get your chance."

We rode out that morning full of fire, devotion, and bravado. They'd modified my steering so I could ride with a broken arm; our bikes took us through our assigned rift and into another world for the first time, but we had not gone two hours and two rifts along our planned scouting path before we came upon a strangely lighted cybernetic tower growing like a root through the middle of an open field. From whence it came, we could not determine; somewhere deep in the ground, it seemed. This I describe poorly, for I am filled with blind rage at the memory.

Animals came upon us from inside the tower as we prodded at it; beasts we somewhat recognized, save for robotic limbs and modified body parts. The birds fell to our pistols, but the bear was armoured and much more durable. Breaking out the assault rifles we had been given, we downed it only after pinpointing a weak spot on the back of its head. Awed and saddened at the killing of the beast, we looked to each other, and did not see it begin to glow.

Five seconds after it fell, it exploded.

We had not gone *two hours* into our mission without being misled. One of our number was dead, and we carried her body on the back of a bike while we returned with a furious fire for answers. For all the talk of her honesty, it seemed Caecilia had been expecting us. Ushered into her tent with her permission, we faced her, and she faced us.

"I'm sorry," she said. "Yes. You were sent with purpose."

Sam physically backed Celcus as they both stepped forward and the taller man said, "*Why?* You should have warned us!"

"The Legates were testing something," Caecilia said mysteriously, and with compassion. "My hands were tied on this one. They wanted the best squad sent to investigate certain information."

"You could have chosen someone else," I muttered fiercely from within my scarred family, barely able to contain my anger.

She asked flatly, "Are you the best squad?"

We said nothing. We still had our pride, and, further, it was as she had said: everyone else qualified was dead.

"Then I'd like you to accompany me to the region's military headquarters," she continued, her gaze stone. "I don't appreciate how this was handled. I have some idea of what's going on, and I want you behind me with all your anger and pain on display when I demand answers."

With our fire momentarily sent into confusion, we looked at each other a few times and slowly agreed.

"Good. Then be back here in an hour, and we'll depart."

We returned to the morgue tent and stood over our fallen sister. I touched her cheek, but Porcia was cold; her soul had gone. It had only been that morning that she had been hoping for an ambitious future rather than being worried about being left behind; now it was she who had left us behind. I tried to feel more, but I was too numb to loss to internalize it quite yet. Septus lingered the longest, and we all knew why, but there was no teasing or joking. There was only silence as the repaired military helicopter picked us up; it was from halfway around the world, and had apparently ridden out the tempest at a high altitude and simply coasted along with the winds thanks to a great pilot. That same pilot took us to headquarters with Caecilia and her Centurions, and then dropped us off with a solemn, "Be careful."

A warning for entering headquarters? His concern had been much more than a simple pleasantry.

From the helipad, we couldn't see much of the rest of the base, and soldiers ushered us forward quickly. Larentia warned us with looks to stay quiet and appear angry, and numerous vague but fired-up conversations were had between Caecilia and a rising chain of command.

At the last, we were taken out beyond the base, where a hasty building and fences had been constructed around a rift. Equipment and scientists surrounded it, and we looked beyond at a simple white room that held an ivory desk at the far end; seated there was a calm older woman with light wire-rimmed glasses who seemed to be doing paperwork.

Legate Blue, for all his usual confidence, now approached us with gaunt eyes. "How strange that you're here..."

"Why's that?" Caecilia asked, now equally wary.

From the end of her long and silent chamber, the middle-aged woman adjusted her papers with a tap, put them down, and addressed us with a calm tone that somehow reached us even from such a distance. "Truce is offered for thirty-seven minutes and fourteen seconds as a free courtesy. Please, sit."

Larentia nodded to her leader, and Caecilia looked to Legate Blue, who just stepped back. The blonde Centurion said to us, "Alright then. This is what we're here for, right?"

We again exchanged glances as a family and as a squad, but someone needed to answer for Porcia's death. We followed Caecilia toward the rift; at the last, Flavia said quietly to me: "Somehow, I think we're going to regret this."

I couldn't help but grin triumphantly. "I had no doubt. And it looks like they've been promoted."

Legate Blue raised his arms even higher and his voice boomed across the crowd, silencing us. "New Rome's defenders suffered greatly, but they have prevailed. This is the least damaged region *in the world!*"

He paused and let the roar of the crowd return and swell. Flavia and I's voices were among them. How could we not cheer for ourselves at the behest of our most beloved leader? It mattered not what he and his peers had ordered for us, thereby causing the deaths of a billion men, women, and children. It had been necessary, and, judging by the lifeless spheres littering the landscape, it had worked.

Exactly ten seconds after he allowed us to cheer, he silenced us with a motion of his hand. "No longer are these men and women the Police Department of New Rome. With the loss of their Chief"

Flavia and I stopped grinning and shrank in our boots.

"I now re-initiate this department as New Rome's Homeland Defense Legion. For their bravery and military efficiency, I name Caecilia and her team as Centurions over the surviving members, and any new recruits. For the next seventy-two hours, we will take all comers from any caste, military or not. If you're a farmer, an engineer, a doctor, a scientist, or any other, your world needs you."

He allowed the crowd to cheer again, but Flavia and I watched in stunned silence. The military caste was among the lowest; who here would willingly give up their position to become one of *us?* I couldn't quite process it, but it appeared to us that Legate Blue was being somewhat dishonest and taking advantage of the crisis to grow membership ranks. That couldn't be true, could it? We looked on as hundreds rushed over to the tables to begin signing up.

He continued. "A great blow has been struck against our world, but the struggle is just beginning"

Turning away with Flavia, I followed her out and away from the zealous throng with a strange sense of disquiet. I also did not doubt Legate Blue would be visiting many other cities today, and proclaiming each one the least damaged region and worthy of having its civil defense turned over to military control.

"You two, wait."

We stopped and saw Caecilia's brunette squadmate approaching. She bowed lightly. "I don't think we've officially been introduced. I'm Larentia."

We each bowed in response and then waited.

She scanned the crowded street and pulled us slightly aside into an alleyway. "I noticed you two don't seem as fired up as the others. Would it be accurate to say you have mixed feelings about this change in structure?"

I looked to Flavia, and she looked to me.

"Don't answer," Larentia said in the formal. "Just know that we feel the same as you do, and we will call upon you as trusted allies above and beyond what is openly spoken from now on. Do you understand?"

As one, we nodded.

"Good." In the informal, she said softly, "I'm glad to see you survived. The others?"

Flavia nodded again, while I added, "All but Rufus."

Larentia waited.

"The red-haired," I elaborated.

"Ah." She cast her eyes down for a moment. "I didn't know him well, but, from what I did see, he was valiant."

"Yes."

She saluted smartly, and we returned it with pride and loss. A moment later, she was gone, and Flavia and I looked to each other in askance. So it was politics then, as it always wasbut now we were no longer rookies, and thereby no longer insulated from its plays and counterplays.

The hospital rested at the core of the city, and we moved through many blocks of triage tents and harried nurses before we reached the actual broken glass doors. Someone had swept up, and we entered a moderately clean front area and inquired at the desk.

A great orchestra from some long-forgotten movie rose to glorious heights in my heart as the nurse did not report Celcus as dead; crying silently with happiness and relief while following Flavia, we rushed back to the Coordination Center where long lines of people were still signing up. Legate Blue was gone, but a tall head crowned by a mop of brown hair stood out above the crowd; I bashed annoyed people out of the way and tried to tackle him. I failed, and he held me against him, surprised.

When he realized who it was that had thrown an arm around his midsection, I could feel the genuine laugh of amazement in his chest. "Careful," he said happily. "Ribs are still sore."

I didn't let go. I just stood there in the crowd for a timeless time, and he made no move to push me away no matter how many people sighed and walked around us.

For a whilejust a little whileI had the distinct belief that everything was going to be alright, and that, perhaps, Luck or Chance or Fate personified had heard my desperate please cast into the depths of the mental worlds and chosen to answer with kindness.

When he finally took my hand and led me away from that crowded spot, I first saw Flavia's concerned face through the crowd, and I dropped my emotions to prepare for danger.

	<TEXT> I choose to daringly forego a mere sip and lift the lid and straw to take three deeply satisfying gulps of my soda. Its not something you can do more than once or twice at a movie without draining the cup and risking a bathroom break during something important, but Im in the mood to to sink with a smile into sense-filling sweetness. As the rolling flavor fades from my senses, I sigh with contentment.

The older man to my right looks on with slightly wide eyes. I really thought that trailer had spoiled the end of the movie.

Touching my cheek, I trace an old scar that I always liked to think healed in the shape of a black holes halo. It hadnt been there a moment ago, but the round bullet hole and two pointed corners where it had been stitched shut had collectively graced my left cheek for years; Id only just noticed and remembered. What, that girl shooting up through her own face to escape? Nah, they wouldnt end a movie like that. Not flashy enough.

Oh? He nods with understanding, if not agreement.

Glancing left, I notice one of my friends to the left of Tacitus. His hair is blood red and his skin is pale under the shifting light of the screen. Rufus!, I ask with excitement. When did you get here?

He must not hear me over the noise and thunder of the previews; like Tacitus, he gazes unmoving at the picture.

This must be a very safe place to you, the man says.

Still smiling, I turn back to address him. Safe, no. Special, absolutely. I laugh with nostalgia. I was six. The bi-lustrum had just come, and among the movies they blasted to us was a little film that had missed the last one by barely a week. Can you believe that? It was released in the Empire four days after, which meant we didnt get to see it until *ten years* later. Oh, it would have changed everything about our own cinema.

He matches my smile with a kind one of his own. It was that good?

More than you know. I think back. It took the military caste by storm. My grandfather let me go see it on a school trip; some sort of special field trip just for the military kids. I focus on the screen as images of Imperial Legate Blue appear just as I remember. Countless rows of smartly-dressed children salute him on his high tapestried station as he salutes back, jokes with Imperial Legate Red whose face is on a nearby screen, and then introduces the movie. I grin wickedly. Predator. Nineteen-eighty-six. Already ten years old by the time we saw it, but it was absolutely timeless.

Ah, yes... an instant classic.

I ask, Youve seen it? For some reason, I had vaguely expected that he had not. Something about his manner hints that he is a foreigner; perhaps he is from another continent.

He does not answer. His slightly crooked nose throws random shadows across his face as he turns his gaze around the theater. So this place is special to you, but not safe?

Shaking my head, I look up into the vast dark void above. The ceiling is black, but visible; definitely present, but still high and distant. When the movie actually starts, Im thankful, for it absorbs my full attention and pulls me somewhere else. Here in the dark, in the long minutes before it begins, I feel reversed. I am as a spider clinging to the ceiling above an infinite and unknowable depth full of icy chills, absolute silence, and utter loneliness.

He follows my gaze upward and replies solemnly, I see.

In the current preview being shown, a lost little girl reaches for her mothers hand in the forested night, but her mother has vanished, and she is alone. I look away from both the darkness above and the moving light ahead. After an uncomfortable moment resisting some unknown chill, I continue. Anyway, it was a double feature. Predator and Die Hard, back to back, and no school at all. That was the best day *ever.*

That sounds wonderful. It must have deeply affected you, being surrounded by children your age all boisterous and full of camaraderie after a day of pure on-screen bravado.

Laughing, I said, More than you know. I really needed that feeling.

Genuinely compassionate, he asks, How many weeks before had your parents been exiled?

A rising choir of screams emanates from the trailer that has now been placed upon our screen. That same actress from the first trailer with the distinctive wound in her left cheek is now in another upcoming movie; here she clings to the inner top of a well while her world begins undergoing a Dimensional Rotation. I laugh heartily. Oh man, not this cliche again. This is like the tenth movie to use that plot device. Dont they know the Legates would *never* do something so absurdly drastic? Its just not believable! And does this movie even have a makeup department? It looks like shes still exhausted from that other movie! Passed out, in fact... I trail off as I began to feel strangely uncomfortable.

He gives a kindly worried grimace. She really does need to wake up. Her friends cant hold her ankles much longer.

Someone opens a door behind us in the theater. Light streams in, blinding me. Someone else opens an emergency exit door. Wind from outside roars in, throwing my hair about wildly as my face hits the back of the seat in front of me.

Combat skills and determination won't be enough to survive this! he shouts in my ear. Think it through! What does a Dimensional Rotation do?

Breathing becomes incredibly hard, and I gasp; indeed, it was the outward rush of air and drop in pressure that had momentarily knocked the girl in the preview unconscious in the first place. Theyre literally *turning the planet,* I tell him, gripping the seats in an effort not to be torn up and away into the black. Rotating... local spacetime. It wont make the holes go away... but it will change where they go...

Thereby cutting off your enemy, he yells. Smart tactic!

"Smart..." I can only barely manage a whisper as the battering gale tears all presence from my lungs. Except for this part...

Consciousness returned in a disorienting instant. Grabbing jutting stones instinctively as I upended, I stared up into a long circular darkness where dozens of terrified people hung like so many wide-eyed spiders staring down at me. The closest was a dirt-covered and gritted face at the shoulder end of a straining arm. How was Flavia above me? If the well was up, then down waswe had just been talking about my greatest fear, a secret born within me from my vulnerable youthful years, and that animal terror reared up just outside my awareness

*Don't look down!*

Flavia shouted something, but I couldn't hear her over the deafening winds holding me aloft.

*don't look down*

The turbulent gale was so powerful that the mud had been stripped from her hair.

*don't look down don't look down don't look down don't look down don't look down*

In a wide arc, the blonde halo danced chaotically around her head like the Medusa of old.

*don'tlookdowndon'tlookdowndon'tlookdown*

Indeed, the full realization of my situation turned me to stone as I saw the reflected tint of the skies augmenting that blue already present in her eyes. There was nothing but open void below waiting to swallow me; light and windy rather than dark and silent, but void nevertheless. The paralysis of that childhood terror took me, and I slipped from her grasp in an eternally long moment of mutual shocked stares and flailing hands. A single sharp violin note in my heart slowed time to infinity, but there was nothing for it. DownI was sinkingdown! no!a millimeter an eon, but it was already too late.

As I sank into a deeper current, that long violin note faded in favor of the wind's all-encompassing roar, and the well in the ceiling of the world shrank at a startling pace. As I curved away from it, I saw Flavia leap forth; where she had once considered giving up by falling in, she was now jumping out of that same well and off of that same ledge with the fire of life.

A gripping fist slammed me into earth, and I bounced and flipped over fully once before grabbing at dirt with my fingers. Momentarily flat, I turned my face up against the hot wind and looked a planetary crisis in the eyes.

Dirt soared at me like an endless plane of flowing dust; only buildings, trees, and the distant well stood against it. The clouds were unrecognizable speeding tracts of jagged white on tempestuous blue racing by overhead. Indeed, if I understood right, the atmosphere would be the first thing to feel the effects of the Rotationit was the least anchored and the most mobile, and was far heavier by mass than anyone usually gave it credit for. All around the world, the entire atmosphere had begun to move all at once, and that initial maelstrom had torn Rufus away, and then me. From what I'd seen in the movies, there would be a small lull after the chaos ebbed; after the air stopped tripping on itself and began moving smoothly in concert, but before it began picking up real speed. That moment would be my only chance.

And I was so tired. My fingers held all of my remaining strength, and employed it fully to dig into grass and loam. The wind grew warmer as the energy being expended found sink in the atmosphere; I gasped against dirt and dust to breathe. My outward sigh of pain coincided with a quieting breeze as the moment approached, and I tried to climb to my kneesbut failed.

Firm hands pulled me up by my forearm, and I tried again, this time succeeding. Flavia pushed forward against the wind alongside me, and even spoke words of determination, but I could not hear her over the whisper turning into dragon's breath around us. It was different this time. No longer were there curling currents of chaos curving this way and that through the woods and ways of our world; the gale was now unified, constant, and rising. Often with storms there is an innate apprehension as one awaits the ebb of a particular blast, and keening adrenaline as it rises higher and higher, suggesting the idea that *this one might just keep getting stronger*I felt that adrenaline, for I knew this force would not stop. She and I ran forward together stumbling; walked together; pushed and shouted against a flat palm of brutal force at the last; fell flat and clutched the earth again mere steps from the well as the roar grew beyond deafening, the vibration of the ground shook us to our core, and the sheer force began peeling us away from our handholds.

There were only two planes now, both opaque, smooth, and blazing past. One was dull brown and one was bright blue, but they both screamed doom. I kept my head up and my eyes and mouth turned away, but like a powerful ocean current that I had somehow sunk into up to my elbows, the brown pulled past with unstoppable strength. My fingers finally let go.

I hear you again, playing that distant violin, for I am about to die. I know this. I do not accept it, but I know it. There can be no surviving this speed, this sheer kinetic energy, and I tumble half in that flat brown plane and half out, breathing in the scant instants I can before hitting the earth again and again. If I could just *see*, I might try to

The pain hits beyond belief, but somewhere far away where I can barely feel it. I am back in the movie theater again for a brief lapse; the man with the crooked nose stands over me in concern as I lay crumpled between the seats. I'm not sure why, but I need to know. I ask desperately, "Is Flavia here?"

He looks left for a moment, and then smiles and shakes his head. "Not yet."

Heaving awake, I pushed at the encompassing pressure crushing every limb. Metal rods and massive broken foundations jutted around me, but something marginally softer had prevented my impalement. Turning my head, I saw who I had landed against. The rods had stabbed into he who had traveled upon this path first, and thus his last act had been to save my life one more time. His broken arm had twisted and remained at an angle, leaving him in a permanent state of salute. I didn't have the breath to tell him, but Rufus knew I was thankful.

The heated atmospheric impetus reached the force and constancy of a jet engine aimed directly at me, and I crawled deeper into the rubble to escape being torn away. Among the heavy walls, I entered under the wordless screaming gazes of a dozen others who had already secured themselves here. Tied to rods or wedged between stones, they held on with their all and prepared for what was comingfor the spherical globe-spanning hurricane was merely the beginning.

They could see my uniform. Children looked at me and grew calm. Mothers nodded with silent thanks. Fathers clenched their fists in determination. Was Iwas my mere presence

I was a symbol.

Not only was it necessary that I survive, I had to look calm and confident, too.

As my ears adjusted to the eerily constant breath of the world-dragon around us, all became silent. Here in the broken pits that had once been the foundation of a building, I could breathe, and I let myself do so as the whining of the sirens broke through the deafening blanket. The alarms had been built to be heard even under these conditions, loud beyond belief, and we listened to their long shrill dirges now. To say that I was utterly terrified beyond the limits of insanity would have been an understatement, but I just gazed at a young girl who had been tied to a foundation stone by her mother. She waved. If I wasn't scared, then she wasn't scared. If she wasn't scared, then I wasn't scared.

Think it through, he'd said. All I had was my belt. As the world itself trembled from the sheer ferocity of wind overhead, I tied my belt first around three rods, and then my wrist. Heart pounding in horrified anticipation, I sent my senses down to my core. Could I feel it?

I could. It was starting.

What did I know about the Rotation? Something about reference frames, inertia, a minimum level of static friction and potential energythey hadn't taught us about it in depth because nobody had expected the deeper capabilities of our artificial Earth to ever actually be employed. There was something, too, about frame dragging and the computational inclusions of the massive bio-computers hooked into the core of the planet. The ground itself and any buildings, rooted trees, and other heavy stationary objects would remain anchored, but absolutely everything loose or mobile would notpeople included.

Staring, I watched the little silver dolphin at the end of the girl's necklace begin to rise. A slight dizziness and disorientation washed over me; underneath us, the grey rubble began to take on the feeling of tilting.

I expected them to, but nobody screamed. All eyes were on me. Adjusting my footing repeatedly as the tilt became steeper and smaller rocks began tumbling away, I did my best to appear confident. I even said some platitude I had once heard the Chief repeat. Despite being unable to hear a single thing over the jet engine that was our atmosphere, parents nodded. My gaze turned to the mother's hand on that little girl's.

No, the terror only became real once the dirt and rubble were sliding away in earnest and we had to fight to keep standing. A thirty-degree incline, and then thirty-five, and then fortyat forty-five degrees, something changed in my perception, and I no longer perceived myself to be on a steepening hill. Instead, it was a cliff becoming progressively more shallow.

Now they screamed, for they could not help it. Children cried as they slipped and fell and became tangled in their ropes; fathers strained their arms and mothers tied knots ever tighter. Their eyes were upon me no longer, for this was now a time of personal survival and nothing else.

That part of me that begged for a larger entity than myself to *do something* screamed loudly in my thoughts as my boots scrabbled away from the tilting earth for the final time and I began truly hanging from my tied belt. Now my brain processed the fiery winds for what they were: all around the globe, above every city and valley and mountain, the skies were literally fallingit just so happened that, because of the Rotation, down was becoming horizontal rather than vertical. Like a roundabout that I had often played on as a child, once it began spinning, the imaginary force that appeared when our reference frame was in rotation became the dominant pull.

Centrifugal, I told myself, squeezing my eyes shut. I was not hanging over an endless pit; I was being held horizontal by centrifugal force.

No. The logic wasn't enough to override the fear. Opening my eyes again, I stared down past my feet. I was hanging next to an infinite cliff, and only ledges, trees, and buildings stuck out below to break my falland my body. To my left, a father's rope came untied, and I watched him sail down into the distance only to splatter and bounce from the side of some distant wall. Worse, ragdolls were flying through the air around us, and I saw many nearby hangers-on turn away in horror as they soared past and became bright red blotches on brick ledges, rocks, and trees far below.

How far would it go? That desperate terror struck me again as I thought of the force continuing to tilt and throwing me straight up into the sky, but it stopped directly at horizontal as the full weight of the Rotation turned spacetime beneath the very fabric of our existence. Shuddering and weak from all that I had been through, I let the belt choke my wrist into numbness. I could not hold on, but the pain was better than falling even if I lost a hand.

The sirens cut off one by one, but not because the danger was past. I flinched as a falling car snapped off the alarm tower visible on the horizon. Thousands of logs followed, a storm with wood instead of raindrops, and the foundation above me shook tremendously at the impacts. Multiple logs hit each other, and one bounced in and crushed a child and half a father hanging some measure below me. How much more could we take?! *What would be left of us even if we survived this?!*

The heat of our raging blacksmith's furnace grew unbearable, and I thought I actually saw a trunk or two burst into flames as they impacted one another. There was no longer any sound, for the overwhelming reverberation of the rushing ocean of air falling past us had left me with nothing but auditory numbness. Pieces of my uniform were being torn away by their frayed or sliced ends; I could feel the belt squeezing the bones of my wrist into horrible bruising. It was as if the hand of some entity of kinetic energy had gripped me bodily and begun to squeeze and pull, and it only grew more intent as a truck slammed into the stone above.

It was going to crack. I could sense it. I could also see it in the eyes of those far from me who could see up past the overhang at what I could not. Had my hands rested enough? I didn't have a choice. Gripping the jutting metal rods, I fought the crushing fist that held my body in thrall. I just needed enough to undo the belt, and thenthe pain! Screaming mentally as the feeling rushed back into my hand, I dove headlong into the nerve-fire and gripped the next rod over with fingers I couldn't even feel.

It wasn't enough. The wrenching forces snapped me down with vehemence, and I shot past my startled companions in the blink of an eye.

There was no longer any fear. Now that I was falling along with the wind, vehicles, logs the grey wave had thrown about, and even other people, I felt hardly anything at all. The wind was lesser, for I was at speed, and nothing was hitting me, for we were all soaring together. Curiously, the divorcing of action from ability left me completely calm. There were no objects in reach, I had no strength left, and there was no way to communicate. I could do nothing. Therefore, I was no longer afraid. Fear existed to motivate necessary actions, I realized, and without possible actions I was merely an observer. My fate was in the hands of Luck or Fate or Chance personified now.

At the very least, this was a beautiful experience. The eternal cliff to one side whipped past, full of buildings and rubble and broken forests seen in a way no human being had ever experienced before. On the other side, layers upon layers of the sky moved with me, a graceful ocean walling me off from space. I would not be cast out into that icy cold void alone like I had feared as a child; even at its most injured, my Earth would hold me tight and protect me from that fate.

How high was I? Two, maybe three stories up? I was lucky most suburban buildings had been destroyed. New Rome approached like so many flat spikes below, shooting out far from the eternal cliff even at this perspective. Would one of those buildings be my end? Falling around me, I saw a white-haired old man, an unconscious brunette woman, andno! The little girl! She was above me, but falling fasterwhy? *How?* Less air resistance? A different current? She screamed mightily with abject terror, but there was nobody to hear her. I pointed at the old man and then at her, and he saw her approaching. Would he understand?

He did. He tried to grab her, but, failing that, pushed her my way. Skydiving. We were skydiving. Wait, junior year we'd trained for this! It had only been the one time, and just as part of a cooperative educational effort with the army, but we *had* done this. Suddenly back in a type of situation I understood, I used what felt like permanent blasting air jets to move myself closer.

My arms closed around her, and I gripped her tight. Her silver dolphin necklace tried to spirit itself away, but I grabbed it on impulse. The girl clutched my midsection tight, and I looked past her at the old man, who had emulated me in moving with the air and grabbing the unconscious woman.

Look downbuildings growing largerwhat had our speed been skydiving? By military reckon, a league and a half per minute, which meant two miles a minuteand we'd started near Collis Oppidumsomewhere in my training, I had learned to keep track of the time even in crisis. Alrightwe had ninety seconds.

I used one hand to hold the girl against me and the other to grab the old man as he floated within range. He was likely military or engineering caste, for he understood what was needed. Together, we scanned the storm of debris around us for anything that might act to slow our rate of descent. It was he who saw ita massive tarp whipping around the contents of a long flatbed truck loaded with pipes. We angled our four bodies and moved toward it, but we dared not accelerate too fast and injure ourselves upon it. The wait was beyond excruciating.

I let the girl go and she clasped the side of the truck and held on. I mouthed, *I'll be back*, and she nodded tearfully. The old man climbed his way down with the woman in tow; tying her to the back of the cabin, he let her hang limp in the wind, for there was little else he could do. Time was up.

We three conscious passengers on the side of the falling truck clenched against the coming impact as the broken teeth of New Rome came up to meet us with all their yawning broken glass windows and exposed interconnecting structural supports. They had been built to withstand this kind of disaster, and withstand they had; cars, trucks, logs, boulders, and people smashed into them, but their armored cores and reinforced network of strutsusually hidden behind colorful banners or artfully blue to avoid sticking outnow took every impact without so much as a shiver. It was at one of these angled buttresses we shotand passed within an arm's length.

Looking up, I stared for a single heartbeat at the receding spikes above. We had somehow hit the bullseye and soared right through; the buildings had taken a ton of the debris out of the air around us, for that matter. I looked down to the old man and mouthed, *Let's go!*

He nodded and began untying the forward section of the tarp. I climbed higher and untied as I went, replacing the knots with a cinch around my own waist. We would have to do this right if we were to use this tarp correctly. Looking down, I confirmed that he had done the same for himself and the little girl at the proper points. All we could do was create a curve in the huge tarp with our own weight and hope that the wind kept it full; we had no time or materials for a proper parachute. Even as we worked, the tilt began softening.

We kept the important points tied so that it would not flap in the wind until we were ready, but, as I reached for my knife, they began snapping one by one. He had been going for her, but the now-conscious woman in the cabin stared at us through the window as we were pulled roughly away. As we three slammed together like pendulums and held tight, we could do nothing but watch her drop down into the distance with the truck.

*Away,* the old man indicated, pointing into the sky.

Debris was our enemy now, more so than a potential fall. We did our best by pulling on the tarp ropes to direct ourselves away from the eternal cliff and its limitless continuum of debris; over the course of countless heartbeats, the Rotation began slowing and the tilt in the world faded. We ourselves rotated with it, and our feet came to point at the racing ground. There was nothing else to do but take the impact. I tried to run as the speeding earth came up to meet us, but it was just too fast.

Random debris continued to fall as we lay on our backs in that upturned field and stared up at the sky. He had broken a leg, and I had broken an arm, but the little girl between us remained unharmed. 

Of the detritus arcing to earth like falling stars, I sighted numerous black spheres. Stumbling over flattened high grass and kicking one, I found it to be undamaged, but lifeless. The intelligence behind its operation had been cut off by the Dimensional Rotation exactly as the Legates had hoped. Our world had still been shotgunned with holes to other realities by some unknown damage, but we were no longer directly connected to wherever that particular enemy resided.

There were no words. Dirt-blasted, limping, injured, and in shock, we three began the long walk back to the city. Ashen ghosts joined us one or two at a time, and what was left of the road became a trail of silent tears lined by the remains of both people and civilization. The heat generated by the Rotation had not left us, and we walked on into the searing night without relief.

But we had survived.

We had lived through it.

By training and action, we had survived the forceful turning of our entire planet and the spacetime around it, just as our forefathers had intended when they had grown the Amber Worlds in the first placewell, not exactly. The ability was supposed to have been used for restructuring the branches and support of the outer Shield, and we were *supposed* to have months or even years to prepare. With only sixty seconds' warning, we had undoubtedly lost a tremendous fraction of our way of life. All vehicles had basically been destroyed, as well as any structures not built to military code, and everyone who had not heard the sirens or who had not found secure attachment in less than a minute.

There were no words to describe the losses. Worse was the general understanding that the Empire would not be coming to help us. We who had lived at the core of the Shielded worlds had had our own protections stripped away; what likelihood was it that *they* were still alive? The First World, maybe, for it had its own powerful barrier, but none of us thought for a second that the rest of the Empire had survived whatever had happened. Indeed, through every little window in space as we walked, we saw only strangeness and nightmare.

The squat high towers of New Rome exhibited an array of vehicles and other buildings sticking out from one side; the other, while hardly pristine with all those broken windows, stood as a testament to the fact that we were still here. Most of the survivors in our thousand-odd walkers from the outer areas had been military or engineering caste. Arriving at midnight sweaty and drained shells of our former selves, as a group we began picking things up and cleaning. It took an arriving Legate to order us to stand down and go recuperate before it really hit us that we had been through something so devastating that our way of lifeour very work ethicneeded to take a back seat for the moment. For me, it felt like Caecilia's order for us to go home all over again. Twice in the same day I had been told that I had reached the limits of my duty and that I should go home to see my friends and family. The feeling was... jarring.

"I'll get her to the Coordination Center and find her parents," my ally in parachuting told me.

I gripped his arm and said in the formal, "Good serving with you."

He saluted, and I knew then that he was military caste, not engineering. Part of me swelled with a little bit of pride as I watched him lead that little girl into the crowd.

What devastation the strange grey wave had brought had since been dropped away by the Rotation, and I limped along clear roads and fields that had once been forests. Lone trees remained where once whole groves had stood; the wave had felled them, and the eternal cliff had sent them soaring to distant lands. At first I wondered why we lacked debris from those lands higher than us, but then I came upon the remains of the ocean as it lay pooled to the horizon. I stood in thrall then, filled with adrenaline once more, as I envisioned the tipping of the very ocean itself down the face of our lands. Beyond the second level of human endurance and deep into a third that stemmed from my very soul, I found enough energy to run home as the powerful beats of my favorite movies pounded action and music in my head.

But my home had been on the main hill of Collis Oppidum, and the falling seas had swept around it. By dawn's light, I staggered up to buildings I had once thought matchstick; my heart swelled and my head filled with crescendos of triumph. A few others had fallen, but my home still stood.

Kicking open the door, I again found our two rooms calm and organized; my grandfather had already cleaned up and made our apartment presentable. He sat within, drinking tea with a dozen others from the wellmy brothers and sisters included. Flavia was the first one up, and her arms held me tight. As the others rushed close, I fell to my knees and sobbed with happiness. I had no thoughts, only joy and wonder and relief, and my gaze remained locked upon the silver dolphin and chain that had become tangled around my bruised wrist.

"You're quite dirty," my grandfather said warmly from beyond the huddle of cheer and clasping arms. "What have I told you about coming in the house as such? Go clean off."

"I will," I told him, laughing despite the pain of my broken arm, open cheek, exposed temple, bruised wrist, utter exhaustion, and numerous other little injuries. "I will..." Calm sleep found me as I slumped there on the floor surrounded by my family, and I let it overtake me.

There were no dreams. I wanted no thoughts, no pain, and no adrenaline. I wanted resting blackness, and I was given it.

I awoke in a sweat and at the ready, but with my arm in a cast, my cheek sewn up, my temple bandaged, and a compress on my wrist. There was no enemy to fight and no disaster coming; shivering, I lowered back onto my bed and stared at the ceiling the same way I had stared up at the sky after finally coming to light with our makeshift parachute. Was it really over?

"It's been three days. You're quite the layabout," my grandfather commented with a smile as he came over and patted a cloth on my forehead. "How are you feeling?"

I tried to speak, but the words seized in my throat. Flashes of everything I had been through choked my heart, and I went through that blasting wave, that ancient house, Titus' empty eyes, the battles with the spheres, the horrifying winds, Rufus' final salute, the man and his child crushed by a bouncing log, the endless fall, and that woman staring at us out of the cabin of the truck all over again. I could only sob with all of my being.

He held me against his chest. "Fear not, granddaughter. You come from tough stock. You will be finein time."

It took another three days before I managed to stand on weak and trembling legs. Finding the mirror above our water bowl, I studied my cheek and forehead. The bullet hole had been made by the small caliber round of my police pistol, but it was still noticeable, and it was likely it would leave a permanent scar. No mattersuch scars were badges of honor for we. It was this weird drill-caused grooving on my temple that I abhorred; the skin had been torn away and my skull exposed and scored, but somebody had cleaned it and filled it with biogel. It would heal, but it would always *look funny*.

"Saving grace," someone said behind me, and I turned to see Flavia looking decent in a battered but repaired uniform. She threw a second repaired uniform and hat onto my bed. "You can just about cover that head wound with your cap."

"I'll need a cap if the hair that got torn out by the wind doesn't grow back," I responded, touching my metallic red strands gingerly.

She was clutching my hand then, and I embraced my sister back. She said in the formal, "I believed you dead."

I laughed, for I could laugh now. We had survived. "And I you."

She let me go and looked down at my cast. "Are you ready to get to work?"

I nodded. "What's the situation?"

"Food," she said vaguely. "We have to go out and get some."

"Somehow I don't think you mean to the store."

"No. The whole military caste. We have to go through those rifts and find food, first for ourselves, and then for everyone else."

"The farming caste"

She cut me off. "will do their best, but the Rotation destroyed current fields all over the world."

I gulped. She knew my next question.

"One in seven died in the initial grey wave," she said quietly.

Closing my eyes, I let my heart feel for Tacitus. He had been our one in seven.

She took a deep breath. "In the Rotation, better survival rates than expected, mainly because the population was already awake primed for danger. Another one in seven."

Rufus. I clenched my one working hand. "So"

"Two billion," she replied quickly so I didn't have to ask the question. "In the span of four hours, two billion deaths. Two in seven people dead."

The surge of shock and anger was momentarily overwhelming. "And the Legates?"

"Did what they had to do by ordering the Rotation," Flavia whispered, her voice heavy with thoughts of our red-haired brother. "At least that's what people are saying, and that's how we should decide to feel, too, given what such questions might lead to at such a critical time."

Fighting down my pain, I addressed her in the formal as the bond that mattered to me more than allegiance to my caste in this instance. "Understood, sister."

She took my potentially subversive meaning, but kept her own counsel. "Let's go down to the Coordination Center and see what we can do. There's a general leave order for those injured, but we can still volunteer."

Gripping her forearm with my good hand, I asked, "Are you injured?"

She grimaced and turned. Lifting up the back of her top, I found a long bandage that trailed up from above the left edge of her waist to her right shoulder.

"The cut exposed the back of my ribs," she said. "It hurts like no other, but I'm mobile and able, unlike many others."

I hadn't even thought about the wounded. "How many?"

"Four in seven," she responded. "Leaving only one in seven mobile and able for the time being, and many of those are children and young adults whose parents took the hits for them. We need everyone we can get."

I had joined the police academy at sixteen, but we had always been told to expect earlier enlistments if the need ever arose. They would not get a full four years of training like we had, so we would need to lead those sixteen and under when the time came. I mulled this over while we walked under the afternoon sun across wastelands empty of all but oceanic pools and solitary trees. I would not let go of her hand, for every attempt made me think of that moment at the windy well when time had slowed and I had looked death right in its sky blue eyes.

The city was bursting with energy. Under the shadow of those towers, we watched as countless cranes worked to pull cars out of the buildings like so many splinters from a finger; the engineering caste had been raised their whole lives for exactly this kind of challenge, and they went about grinning and shouting and welding and operating machines with the kind of glee that could only come from an opportunity for meaningful field work in front of the public after entire careers spent out of sight behind desks. In that manner, our two castes were one, for the population cared little for what we military caste did out of sight and out of mind. The engineers' fervor became my own.

"What can we do?" I asked the first officer we encountered outside the crowded Coordination Center whose tents and fences had been set up around a dwarfed City Hall that had been protected by the high buildings above it.

The officer regarded my doubly-bandaged head and the arm I held in a sling. "You are very much not required to volunteer." My glare must have been incredible, for he immediately relented. In the informal, he said, "Alright, fine. What's your name?"

I gave it, and I asked for the others.

"Septus, Flavia, Porcia, Venita, and Celcus," he finally stated, writing something on his clipboard. "You can go over to"

Jumping, I asked, "Is Celcus alive?"

He flipped through his papers. "He should be. He's not on the KIA or MIA lists."

Flavia took the clipboard right out of his dumbfounded hands and eagerly looked for herself. Handing it back, she said to me, "Let's go."

While we headed through the crowd, a great cheer went up, and we turned to see Legate Blue himself standing atop the steps of City Hall and holding his arms high over the crowd. I stopped and stared, stunned even out of my desire to see Celcus; this was the same man I had seen when I was six and numerous times on big screens after, and he was only made more handsome by the recent peppering of grey in his black hair. He alone among the Legates was not an older white-haired general, and I was not surprised that he had come to us in person. Four soldiers dressed sharply in black and gold stood to his right, and Flavia leapt and pointed. "It's Caecilia! They survived!"

The bump made him stir, and my grandfather blinked awake.

I stared in surprise.

"What's going on, my granddaughter?" he asked. "Is the power out? Why do you have that flashlight? And it must be very late if I have slept until night. You all look frightful. What happened to your cheek, my beautiful granddaughter? Is everything alright?"

Muffled laughter erupted behind me as I asked, "Did you *nap through all of this?*"

"You know I can't go a whole day without a rest," he responded, rising to sitting with the slow strain of old age. "Would you all like some tea?" He clambered up with my help, and then moved to the front room to make the promised drinks.

I gazed at his back in shock, and then turned to my friends. "The debris must have blocked the window and door, keeping him safe..."

The stress of everything we had been through had grown too much to handle; the five of us fell exhausted to the floor, gripped by laughter and disbelief. We could already hear dozens of drills above and outside, but it didn't matter. Nothing could touch us now, not through the insanity of an old man sleeping through disasters which had taken our all just to survive.

Flat on our backs, arms spread out and no more energy at our disposal, our laughter fadedbut our stunned peace did not. We'd put up a worthy fight, and there was little else we could have done. I was just glad to be here with my family at the end.

As the drilling on wood grew nearer, my watch beeped. A hundred minutes had passed. It was as our teacher had doubly said: the situation was always worse than it appeared, so adjust your expectations, and then don't be surprised when it turns out even worse than *that.* There were no sounds of helicopters or jets in the distance, and no distant rumble of tanks or other heavy equipment. As my grandfather served cheap quick-steeping tea (given the situation, my granddaughter, or else I would *never* serve such swill to guests) we sat around the chabudai; I turned on the larger house radio and set it in the middle while adjusting its frequencies to get some sense of the situation.

"New Sicily overrun, maybe four thousand spheres, evacuation under way"

"is burning. I repeat, New Alexandria is on fire. It's hopeless here, bastard orbs"

As a group, we exchanged worried glances.

Flavia said what was on our minds: "They're not just here. They're everywhere."

We had no response. I kept tuning. On each polis-designated frequency, different areas of the world were under siege, and losing badly.

It was Porcia who said it. "The military's not coming, are they?"

I shook my head softly.

My grandfather gave a dismissive shrug even as the drilling outside neared the very walls of our home. "Don't be afraid. We'll be fine. We've been through worse."

It was a nice sentiment. We accepted the confidence of our elder with a slight bow of our heads. There was nothing left to do but sit and wait for the end

The drilling stopped as something else got their attention, and ours. A tremendously loud siren rose up into prominence, chilling me to the bone. I had never heard anything like it, but its single dirge note told us in no uncertain terms that worse was coming. Preliminary beeping began on the radio, and, turning the frequencies, I confirmed that the warning was going out on all channels. This would be the last resort Caecilia had mentioned. For the first time, the automated warning I usually heard regarding storms or floods no longer named specific polis or province domains.

"This is a: **global** alert. For the areas surrounding: **all cities**, this is a: **global** alert. The Imperial Legates have authorized emergency action for: **all provinces.** In sixty seconds from the end of this broadcast, a Dimensional Rotation will be initiated. Secure yourself before securing others. Do not attempt to protect belongings or possessions. During the sequence, all private property is rendered bona vacantia, and all damages and loss of life non-attributable by novus actus interveniens. Carry only medical supplies. The military will assist you after the sequence. Secure yourself before securing others."

The message began to repeat, and we listened in horror.

My grandfather broke us out of our daze by saying, "Oh dear. I suppose we should prepare."

I'd heard about this procedure, but the damage it would cause always sounded too absurd for it to ever actually be undertaken. The drilling outside had stopped and the orbs had taken off for more important targetswhich meant the sequence was already under way. This was really happening. Crawling out of the rubble at our front door, we emerged into the fading evening light under that deafening siren cry warning us to action. The speakers out here were repeating the radio broadcast, but we all knew what to do. This had been portrayed in several movies made by Amber World film companies, usually as the disaster that ended a romance, and I thought of Celsus. Was he alive? Had his hospital endured the wave? Had the staff managed to defend it? He wouldn't have been taken lying down in his bed.

These wooden buildings weren't safe. We had thirty seconds to find appropriate cover and attachment. Terrified survivors of the flood began pouring out of the apartments; screaming, crying, or deadly intent, they ran this way and that in search of a place in which they might survive what was coming. The earth under our boots began trembling, and I dove deep into that second well of endurance to run alongside my family.

Speaking of wells, my grandfather lifted his robe and ran toward the communal watering hole. "This way, children!" The idea seemed insaneuntil I thought about what was about to happen, and it became clear that this was the only place within range where we wouldn't die instantly. Suddenly officers again, we beckoned as many as we could toward the well. Mothers handed down their babies to Rufus and Septus; fathers lifted their children down and directed their climb on the jutting old rocks within. Thirty four citizens clambered in all around the grand stone circle until we deemed time too short and climbed in ourselves. The wailing siren hit home absolute terrorby stopping.

In sudden silence, I looked to Flavia, who helped me past the edge. Below, nearly forty people clung to the edges and bottom of our ancient communal well, and I heard my grandfather tell a child, "It'll be alright. This well was here long before any of us, and it'll be here long after."

The boy sniffled and said formally, "Okay, sir."

Jarring was not the word. It was expected, but sudden, shocking, and horridly forceful; slightly above me and right near the lip of the well, Rufus got caught by the explosive wind and trailed out into the roaring nightmare halfway. I grabbed one of his feet reflexively and Flavia seized the other while dozens of horrified screams from below echoed against the hurricane above. The sequence had only just begun, but the sheer force was already mind-numbingly terrifying, and I squeezed Rufus' boot until it collapsed in my hand. Opening my eyes, I saw that I was holding his boot, but not my brother himself. Beside me, Flavia looked on in shock. He had been torn right out of his shoesand right out of our hands. Given where we were and what was out there, there was absolutely no doubt he was dead.

Numbed, I put my open cheek to cool, ancient, and trembling rock. The Siege of New Romeand, indeed, our entire planetwas over, but that didn't mean we had won, or that we would survive. Again I wished for some entity greater than myselfperhaps the personified concept of Luck, or Humor, or maybe Fateto spare me and my family, but no such entity was listening, and I had no idea how to call to it. We were alone. There was nothing to do but hold on with fear as the Rotation left its preliminary stage and began ramping up its devastating intensity.

	<TEXT> My popcorn doesn't have any butter on it, but I prefer it such. Sliding awkwardly between seatbacks and knees, I make my way to our reserved seats at the center of the theater just as the lights go down. I've always loved the cool sanctuary feel of a dark movie theater as I watch both the distant screen from my high seat and an Empire-born movie from my hidden Amber World. Do they know we see what they create? While carefully arranging and depositing sodas, bags, popcorn, a tray of pretzel bites, and a half-eaten bag of red vine knockoffs, I say of the movie we've come to see, "This is a good one!"

A calm older man to my right smiles. The effect of his sincere cheer is made more pronounced by his slightly crooked nose. "What's it called?"

"Die Hard," I tell him. Finally situated, I turn my head to my companion on my left. "You've seen this one, right Tacitus?"

The kind man to my right taps me on the shoulder.

I turn back, still excited. "Yes?"

He tilts his head toward the screen.

The moving image seems monstrous in scope, and certainly far larger than I've ever seen such a theatre contain. This particular preview is so full of energy and raw sensory brilliance that it presses upon my very optic and aural nerves. The film being marketed is odd as well; a bruised and battered woman of about twenty with matted metallic red hair is trapped in the clutches of some sort of limbed black sphere. She was hit in the head rather forcefully, and is now briefly unconscious. At that moment, the strange assailant's whirring drill is just beginning to penetrate her skull. I frown. "What is that?"

The man to my right grimaces in unhappy concern and leans closer to whisper so that the other patrons might not know of our conversation. "A scout, you could say. Or, perhaps more appropriately, an antibodythe first of many."

As my heart beats to a racing terror in my chest, I tell him, "I don't think I like this trailer."

My eyes are stuck on the screen, but his gaze bores into my temple with a keening fire. He whispers with rather serious intent: "It's trying to learn about you. If I were you, I wouldn't let it."

"She can't get the angle," I protest painfully, unable to move for the strict and cramped tightness of my seat. The arms of the chair feel closer every second; the more I struggle, the harder I find myself held. His gaze now feels like shrieking fire against my tilted temple, and I bash backwards repeatedly against my unhappy former sanctuary to no avail. My gunI have a gun! Not popcorn, not a soda, but a weapon clamped to my chest by black limbs. It is pointed up at my coldly merciless assailant, yes, but my head happens to be in the way first.

My kind companion turns away with respectful compassion at what he senses I am about to do.

I can't get my head out of the way, but I don't need tonot entirely. Opening my mouth as wide as I can in an adrenaline-filled scream, I tilt hard to the right and fire. In that instant, a deafening ringing takes over my hearing. The explosive force rips through my cheek with all the fire I expected, returning me to full consciousness as the restraining limbs fall away.

I fought through the sense-blinding pain to crawl and stumble away from the nightmarish thing. By seizing me rather than moving and dodging, it had finally given me a solid shot, and I had taken that shot no matter the cost. It had been practiced skill, not luck, that had helped me avoid destroying my teeth on either side of my planned vector. Holding up my bleeding cheek with one shaking hand and my gun with the other, I turned around and faced it again.

That had been my last loaded bullet, and it had finally had an effect. The stunned sphere dragged across the ground in jittery confusion. What important part of it had I hit? I gagged against the overpowering taste of gunpowder and blood in my mouth and nose and throat and ears. My temple burned, but the tender exposed bone there was still intact. My nearly numb fingers ran across warm and wet scored ridges in my skull where the drill had begun its work. Explosions and flashes of light punctuated the distance, but those were too distant to reach my dulled awareness.

Reload. Reload! Caught in the instinctive programming of my training, I let one clip slide out and reached for another. Seated, snapped, clickedI was in control again. Holding my gun out and at the ready, I guarded the zig-zagging sphere as the roar of engines became immediate.

Flanked by her three heavily armed comrades, Caecilia removed her helmet, kicked her stand, and remained at a distance with her assault rifle slung forward. "Venita, are you alright?"

I tried to speak, but the magmatic salt in my mouth forced me to cough instead. I could only nod.

"Is it wounded?"

I nodded again, and spit twice. Finally, by tightly holding my open cheek with one hand, I could manage a decent attempt at speaking. "Could killed me, but held me, drill into my brain instead."

My tattered dark blue uniform was no longer snappy; despite the wave and the ride, the Dangerous Four in their Special Assault black and trimmed gold looked every bit the savior heroes I'd hoped for, an image reinforced by their daunting semi-automatic weapons. With their helmets now all off, their eyes were intent, and they scattered to surround the malfunctioning sphere at a distance. One of them shouted, "What do you think its purpose was by drilling into your head?"

Confirming what they suspected, I answered, "Learning."

Caecilia inched closer to it with a grin. "Then how about we return the favor?" After kicking it once and backing away, she stopped its random movement by stepping fully upon it. Her team closed in, and I edged up behind them warily.

A chunk of the black exterior was missing thanks to my desperate shot, and we could see strange workings within. Both carefully organized machine parts and pulsing organs worked in tandem inside, and one of its cores was visible. The brunette woman I'd spoken to on my first day all those years ago asked, "You guys recognize that?"

Caecilia nodded. "Rainbow crystal. Looks like agravitational Yngtak lattices. That must be how it floats like thatchanges in internal harmonics. But I don't recognize these other technologies."

As we watched, parts of a shattered liver-like organ began cleaving back together rather rapidly.

One of the two men realized aloud: "It's regenerating..."

Caecilia looked sharply back to the rift. "Venita, it came from there?"

I nodded emphatically despite the pain burning in my every nerve.

"Then we'll send it back where it came from and seal the hole behind it!" Their confident blonde leader gave a more specific order without words, and the two men of her squad reached down to pick up the damaged sphere.

Two glimmering black blades erupted from the device near their hands, nearly slicing them both. The men leapt back, but then nodded at each otherthere had to be a limit to its shapechanging. Carefully gripping the blades with extended fingers, they lifted the double-pointed sphere and ran toward the rift in perfect sync. Not far behind, I followed Caecilia and the other woman right behind, our guns at the ready.

As they neared the truck that I had smashed into the hole in the fabric of space, I saw Caecilia leap and roll to her right, and I automatically did the same in the opposite direction. A split second later, a long black blade shot past and impacted into a fallen log. Another long blade sang out with the squeal of changing metal; the man on the left of the sphere threw himself back to the ground to avoid the limb. The man on the right was not quick enough to avoid the third blade, and it stabbed down through his thigh and into the ground. Just as quickly as the blades had sprung out to pierce into the surrounding environs and anchor the sphere, the pinned man swung his gun down and fired a rapid burst into the core of the thing.

It whined and died with its mechanical guts hanging outchrome and flesh entrails leaked by a vile black pustule whose sudden barbs had prevented us from removing it from our world.

Caecilia peered through the holes it had drilled in the truck on its way in while the other two sawed at the black blade in their comrade's thigh with their combat knives. Still in shock myself, I just stood and watched. I felt like I'd seen something like this in an old Empire science fiction show, and that situation had not ended well for the characters involved. How many shows about doomed worlds had I watched in my youth, entertained by the notion of the end of civilization? Now it was happening to *us*.

Backing away from the ruined truck, the normally confident blonde bore a subtly sickened look of intense focus. "There are more coming."

"How many?" the pinned man asked just before gritting his teeth against the pain.

She began scanning the shattered road and forest. An instant later, she sprang into action and began pulling at a heavy nearby rock. "We need to block this. Boulders. Cars. Trees. Anything. Everything."

Her brunette teammate stopped pulling on the blade in her comrade's leg long enough to ask, "Ceece, *how many?*"

The blonde just shook her head as she carried her rock over and placed it at the foot of the door to the world with the yellow sky. "Cram our motorcycles into the holes in this rift, and then hotwire those cars and drive them up on the whole thing!"

They didn't hesitate. After freeing blade from thigh, they ran from vehicle to vehicle, spinning their engines to life in short order. Even their injured member helped carry things, and that snapped me out of my daze. While deep booms radiated through the earth from afar and curling explosions mushroomed into the sky on the horizon, we focused solely on this one point of vulnerability and did our jobs as best we could. It helped me not to panic, but I was completely and utterly exhausted by the time my allies roared in on their own bikes.

"Add 'em to the pile!" Caecilia shouted to Porcia, Rufus, Septus, and my beloved Flavia, who had now all arrived in their dusty and torn dark blue uniforms wearing expressions of haste and concern.

Porcia protested, "It took us ages to find these"

"It won't matter if those things get through!" Caecilia pointed to the outsized black burr that had stuck itself into a log, the ground, and a massive displaced boulder. "They're agravitational, transmorphic, and intelligently adaptive. Don't underestimate them."

Flavia responded for my group. "Understood." She nodded to the others, and my four ran their bikes to the pile and threw them on top. This was no time for questions of authority, and, like me, my friends knew when to listen to greater experience and skill. Coming over to me, Flavia touched my wounded temple and cheek and grimaced. "Porcia, what do you think?"

The more medically-inclined member of our group gave me a weak smile. "You're not gonna die, but you're not going to look great for your date, either."

Behind her, heavy rock in his arms, my red-haired Rufus asked with surprised wide eyes, "*Date?*"

While dragging a log, Septus laughed. "I think I have an inkling of who it might be with!"

To tell the truth, I was crying. They were alive, and they were here, and their presence helped dispel some of the nightmare that had descended around my heart. I told them in the formal tongue, "Focus your attentions. This is important." With a happy sob, I informally added, "I'm glad you're here."

As one, they gave synced serious nods. Flavia spoke for them: "Of course."

Our pile of machinery, rock, and logs became rather excessive as all nine of us labored to bury the rift in as much debris as we could. It was fortunate, in some small manner, that the grey wave had churned up such destruction; whole unearthed boulders were available for moving, and one was so heavy that it took all nine of us to waddle it up and drop it into place. Crushing the cabin of the truck once and for all, it served as a keystone seal atop our mountain.

"That's enough," Caecilia ordered between heaving breaths.

Covered in sweat and breathing hard, Porcia protested: "I can keep going."

Our leader shook her head. "Rest now. We can't be exhausted for what's coming. Every scrap of energy will be critical."

We sat under the strange breezes and distant thunders of ongoing battles elsewhere; each of us slowly began breathing at a more normal pace as we recovered our limbs and our lungs. New whinings began somewhere deep in our pilehigh squeals denoting the progress of our enemies as they took to drillingbut Caecilia held a hand up to keep us silent and resting. I knew that it was important we take every second we could to let our energies rise, but I was dismayed that I hadn't thought of the importance of silence as well. I had done it naturally while alone, but this was a more strategic situation; these drilling spheres had no idea what was on the other side, for we had destroyed their scout, and it was to our advantage to take them by surprise. Exchanging words of courage and comfort might have felt like the natural thing to do, but, in this case, it was incorrect.

We looked at each other often, wiped sweat from our brows, and slowed our breathing in tacit silence. Given a chance to let my adrenaline pass, I began to shake, and the echoes of gunshots from both horizons set me on edge. Were they faring any better out there? Were their threats easier or worse? It sounded like a dozen drills were at work below us, and I kept re-living the nearly fatal struggle I'd had with just one.

Without a word, Caecilia climbed noiselessly down and motioned for us to follow. 

We nine each found positions behind various vehicles, rocks, or logs. Flavia kneeled with me this time, and her calm touch stilled my shaking gun hand. The second wave was coming, but, this time, I had more than just Tacitus' spirit by my side. It was then, too, that Flavia finally noticed his absence, and she looked to me in askance; I shook my head sadly. She took this wordless news in stride, closed her eyes for a long moment, and then faced our blockade with fire in her eyes. These things hadn't killed Tacitus, but it didn't matter. Either way, they would pay.

As before, the drilling stopped without warning.

None of us moved.

The warm breeze from an explosion to our left blew dust to the side and rustled our hair, but we remained aimed and ready.

The kick came, and one of the boulders ruptured in half; we waited unmoving as six black spheres hovered into the killing zone we had established in front of the rift. As a group, they began levitating toward various vehicles and rocks as if examining them. No attention was spared for their inactive brother. Now that I had some idea of which part I was aiming for, I intended to take one down with just a few shots.

Studying the tunnel the six spheres had bored through the debris, Caecilia looked to the riftlooked to the sphereslooked to the riftlooked to the spheres and dropped her hand.

As synced as the spheres, the nine of us opened fire all at once. I watched carefully for the impact of my shots and downed one with Flavia's help; the Dangerous Four took out one each with their assault rifles, and Porcia, Septus, and Rufus sustained pistol fire on the last until it finally gasped, burped out organs, black smoke, and machine partsand bounced to the asphalt dead.

Breaking cover and running to the pile, Caecilia attempted to push a boulder over and re-seal the hole, but a long black blade shot out and nearly skewered her. Retreating, she shouted, "Fire at will!"

Gladly.

Piercing the exit with the sheer hatred of my gaze for all that had been lost in this strange disasterwhether it was the fault of these orbs or notI gladly joined in filling that tunnel with hot lead. Sphere after sphere ruptured and exploded at its exit; the crescendo of our rifles and pistols was punctuated by whirring machine death cries.

"Yes!" Rufus shouted over the gunfire. "Seal them in with their own corpses!"

Beside him, Septus reloaded with a whoop.

Porcia ignored both of them, instead keeping perfect focus on the enemies.

It was working. The tunnel became increasingly filled with debris from broken spheres, enough that the rest were having trouble getting through.

Flavia reloaded, but waited with a tense expression.

"What is it?" I asked her.

The grey wave had washed away her cap, and, under the orange-blue evening sunlight, her dirty golden hair now glimmered somewhat less for all the caked dust. That marred beauty seemed to match her undermined confidence. "Do you hear that? They're drillingbut I don't see where."

I realized it, too. We watched in dismay as six new holes were kicked out of the debris and spheres began emerging far more rapidly.

Their assault rifles were now doing the bulk of the work, but, by Caecilia's expression, I knew that she knew that we couldn't hold. Leaping up, she shouted, "Fall back!"

We ran, not as a destroyed rout, but as a solid nine-man unit. In our own kind of gun-bearing phalanx, we kept the approaching tide of spheres at bay, managing to protect ourselves while their greater numbers spread out into the fractured forests.

"How many did you see?" her brunette teammate asked again, this time demanding an answer.

As she led the way over a humongous stretch of upended clay, Caecilia answered with humorless doom, "Between fourteen- and thirty-thousand."

She

She hadn't told us

because we would have retreated. We would have run earlier. What use was slaying one sphere? Or six? Or the hundred-odd we had managed to take down? There were tens of thousands behind those, and she had known the whole time!

In that instant, I hated her for her command decision, even though I knew it had been correct. Our blockade had delayed the spheres some number of minutes, and every single second counted. We were nearly out of ammunition now and our survival was likely forfeit, but in trade for our lives we had bought New Rome nearly forty five minutes.

Forty five minutes. As the purpling evening sun darkened behind clouds of black spheres spreading out in every direction, I pulled Flavia over the high angle at the top of the wave-deposited clay ridge. "Come on!"

A sphere hovered close, and she turned and shot it twice; part of its exterior broke off, but she saved her last bullet, not daring to waste it. The sphere put forth a drill and began advancing.

From behind, Septus slammed down with a rock and finished the work she had begun. Wild-eyed, and with Porcia and Rufus in tow, he clambered over the ruined machine and after us. Ahead, a roar of resurrection and a blast of light in the death-cloud-cast darkness marked the rebirth of a delivery truck engine; Caecilia ordered us to grab sticks and rocks as weapons and then climb aboard.

The front of my uniform was beginning to grow wet from blood leaking from my head and cheek, but I fought off wooziness and kept my heavy branch held ready. Through a small window from the cabin where she and the leg-wounded man sat, our leader shouted, "Draw their attention any way you can! Keep them approaching our rear!"

Indeed, it was a sort of mobile chokepoint. The flat roof and sides of the delivery truck were not interesting to the spheres, so the bullet or two we used to draw the attention of the portion of the swarm behind us brought them surging at the open slamming doors at the back. Standing shoulder to shoulder, we bashed and crushed over and over again as they approached; some of us crouched down and defended our feet, while others swiped at any orbs that tried to slip in between our heads and the ceiling. Even luckier, the enemy machines bumped and collided with each other as they tried to keep up with our high speed and debris-dodging swerving. Would this actually *work?* 

The black-and-gold suited brunette called up, "They're not using swarm dynamics!"

The man in the passenger seat of the cabin repeated her words, and Caecilia called back, "Are you certain?"

What had she meant by that? Watching my enemies as they pushed forward, I realized that there was something ungainly and ungraceful about these monstrous machines. They didn't flow together like birds did in the sky; they didn't coordinate easily and automatically by following the unit ahead of them. In fact, the more there were, the less effective any single orb seemed to be. That mirrored something I instinctively recognized. "They're not independent!" I shouted, gripping my cheek and nearly passing out from the pain as I did so.

The brunette affirmed my realization. "Something is controlling them from afarsomething on the other side of that rift, no doubt."

Caecilia didn't have time to continue our analysis; she and the man up front had been forced to start expending the last of their assault rifle ammunition as the swarm became an eerily silent cloud of dark blots around us.

And, step by step, we were being forced deeper into the truck. Drills began shooting sparks from the sides and ceiling, and a blade or two stabbed through at length. I fell due to a bump in the road and avoided the first, but a followup slashed my left sleeve, and a third skewered Rufus through the lower abdomen. Porcia screamed with anger and broke the blade off with her heavy rock; our red-haired teammate grimaced and retreated behind us, his back now up against the little window to the cabin where staccato gunshots echoed rapidly. After taking a shoulder stab herself, Flavia followed to help defend him against incidental attack.

Tired. That was the real enemy. I was tired. I had been exhausted before this had even begun, and now I was bone-weary. I was moving ineffectually and reacting slowly, and I knew it was only a matter of time until I fell. The black-and-gold suited man to my right pushed me back. "You're done! Rest!"

"But"

He shoved me hard, and I fell next to Rufus and Flavia, who held me down and insisted I listen. Septus and Porcia tried valiantly to help in the defense, but numerous little slices along their arms and legs began adding up, and a drill coming up from the floor pierced Porcia's foot, ending her run. At the last, it came down to Septus alone guarding us four casualties in the very back; we watched in amazement as, beyond him, the two standing members of the Dangerous Four used the new spacenow that we were out of the wayto engage in a graceful tandem dance of destruction. The man took to swinging his metal rod this way and that, rupturing sphere after sphere; his brunette teammate dodged around him, drawing attention from the orbs breaking in through holes in the walls and ceiling while crushing any that got through with her heavy rock. All this they pulled off while the truck swerved dramatically left and right to avoid unseen obstacles at high speed; all this they did with fury in their eyes. These truly were the best of the best, and I understood now why they were so highly regarded.

But there were just too many. The only light now was a small rectangular beam leaking in through the cabin window from the reflected headlights; I steeled myself and prepared to join Tacitus.

Without so much as a horn of retreat, the cloud of spheres suddenly pulled up and away. Opening my eyes, I found myself on the back of an open and flat truck bedthe rear had been entirely ripped apart and cast aside piece by piece. The two elites stood steaming like fire elementals, breathing hard and casting their expert eyes about in search of further enemies. They were exhausted like us, I knew, but they had some sort of inhuman second level of endurance in which they burned their very life force to keep alert and fighting.

Walls suddenly shot past, and I realized where the orbs had gone. We had reached the city limits, and they were surging up in thick black rivers to get a better vantage point. Like vast horrible fingers they were, or arms spreading out to grip New Rome, and I could almost see the intelligence behind them at work in that reaching grasp.

I looked at my watch: only seventy two minutes had elapsed since the warning call had gone out. We could not count on the military to be present and ready.

The streets and buildings here formed canyons whose piled industrial debris completely blocked the way by truck. As we came to a stop, I stared to my left and right at the dark maws of broken windows and shattered doors. The contents within were not entirely ruined, for the flood had been dry, rarer than water, and had come and gone quickly; the damage seemed more akin to an earthquake and a hurricane than an apocalypse. No, the end of the world would be from these spheres, not the strange flood and wave. We slowly climbed down from the ruined truck and took our first steps on the shattered glass and loose rubble of New Rome's surviving remains.

After finishing relaying everything we had learned over the radio, Caecilia looked up at the circling black swarms and then turned to us. "Most of the other rifts have been successfully defended, but guns aren't going to solve this one. The higher-ups have a plan, a last ditch effort, and I think it will workat a great cost. Go."

We were too weak to talk, so Septus responded for us: "Go?"

"Go find your loved ones," the leader of the Dangerous Four told us. "If you can. Time is short." She moved and motioned, and her three teammates began climbing over the downed building blocking the road. "Be safe, fellow officers. Survive this."

When they were over the top and out of earshot, Porcia said bitterly, "We've been left behind because we would have held them back."

Rufus lowered his head; Septus grunted; Flavia just helped me stand, and together we began staggering in a direction we knew well.

"Where are you going?" Porcia called. "You aren't leaving us behind too, are you?"

As she held me up, Flavia looked me in the eyes, glanced down at my open cheek, and then turned back to yell, "We're going to see our grandfather."

I shook with pain and utter exhaustion, but I still managed to smile at that. My grandfather had often insisted my sister in arms was part of our family, but she had always politely refused out of respect for memory of her mother and grandmother. But she had not added the part that resounded in my thoughts a heartbeat later: *if he still lives.*

Rufus and Septus studied the mood of the clouds of black dots high in the sky. "How do you evaluate it?" the red-haired said to his ally in the formal tongue. The youngest son of his family responded, "We are duty bound to protect them." Informally, he added: "My older brothers are assholes anyway. Let's go." Together, they lifted the sobbing Porcia between their shoulders and helped her avoid using her pierced foot.

Happy that we were sticking together, I limped along beside Flavia until they caught up, and we weak and wounded five picked our way through alleys and over hills of rubble while staying out of sight of the ominous watchers above as best we could. By my watch, eighty five minutes had passed. If the spheres just took a little bit longer to evaluate the complex battlefield below them, there was a chance we could run out the clock, for they did not know there was a clock at all.

We had no such fortune. As we neared Collis Oppidum, the ancient slum district in which I lived, I regarded the upward slope of the familiar long hill that usually meant I was nearly home, while, at the same time,  I saw individual black dots descending from on high. Despite the difficulty and pain of talking, I said, "They're doing it again."

Flavia asked, "What is their strategy?"

"Those are scouts," I told my worried teammates as we stopped and leaned in a huddle to keep from falling over. "Just like before, they're sending individual spheres to analyze areas. With more focus, that single one is far more dangerous."

Heads nodded around me in the huddle. Septus asked, "What do we have?" Flavia responded, "I've got one bullet. Anyone else?" No. Nobody else. Rufus reached down and pulled at a jutting piece of rebar at our feet; failing that, he broke it off with a heavy rock. "Everybody get a metal rod. It's quicker than a rock and more effective than a branch." Wearily, we followed suit, breaking weapons out of the shattered foundation of the building on which we stood. Porcia suggested, "Let's stick to alleys and out of sight."

As one, we five breathed in, stepped carefully down high narrow alleys, and kept our eyes sharp. We were only four blocks away from the quarter of Collis Oppidum that held my home, but every heartbeat felt fraught with dangerand it was. As we approached a junction between four close ramshackle buildings, a long bladed spear shot out and sliced Flavia's midriff as she dodged back; four rods slammed down and broke that spike before following it back to its source and beating it to pieces.

There was no more protection by stealth. We ran; even Porcia on her leaking foot. On each street and in each alley we encountered a sphere that had learned from each of its predecessors. The second tried to stay out of reach and stab at us from afar, but Septus ran up a debris slope, leapt, and slammed it down into our waiting mob. The third, lying in wait, had actually donned a sort of armor for itself by incorporating rubble into its makeup; with this one, we did rod-to-blade battle for three long and exhausting minutes that we could not afford. Septus took a stab to the thigh, and Porcia a rotating hammer-like appendage to the ribs, but I decided to mimic our opponent and adapt by using my rod as a spear instead of a club. Stabbing down with all my might, I penetrated just between pieces of rubble armor, and the sphere smoked and died with a fading scream.

One more block. One more sphere. We found it waiting for us high up between two fire escapes; like an army not daring to leave a hostile castle behind them, it knew we would not just walk underneath it and let ourselves become surrounded if other spheres were ahead. It was practically inviting us to climb those fire escapes and do battle from either side at heights where its agravitational movement gave it an advantage. My cheek was numb from adrenaline and constant pain now, and I spoke freely: "It's here."

Breathing hard beside me, her face covered in traces of blood and dirt and her blonde hair dark brown and grey from rubble-dust, Flavia asked in the formal tongue, "Our enemy?"

I nodded. Whatever force it was that operated these spheres had turned its full attention on us, and I understood why: I had been the first contact, the first to fight back, and an ongoing resister. Even without drilling directly into our brains, it was *learning about us*, and it was entirely possible we had been permitted to survive this far so that the experiment could continue. It would have been a simple matter to smash a thousand spheres bodily down upon us like a hammer if the intelligence observing us had been so inclined.

An antibody... this was how the immune system worked. Encounter a hostile organism, develop a defense, and then deploy it en masse. We were on that second step, and letting the enemy complete its research would bring down untold horrors upon us when the third step began. I put my hand out to my teammates to tell them what I had realized, but Flavia raised hers first. The sphere fell, broken, as her final bullet felled it.

I turned and looked back at the city, now lit solely by a sliver of liquid orange sun peeking over the horizon, and now spread out before us because of our position on the high hill at its outskirts. The swarms above swirled faster, casting long animated shadows across the landand they began to descend like a horrible dome of night come early. The intelligence had learned enough from its various scouts throughout the city, and now it was going to cleanse us. "*Run!*"

For the first time in my life, I did more than flirt with that second level of endurance whose mastery I had seen in my elite comrades. Death was upon us like a shadow out of the evening sun, and I wanted to see my grandfather one last time. I wanted him to know Flavia had accepted us. I wanted to drink tea. I wanted to curl up by his knees and hide against the coming darkness like I had as a child. His stories had always been inspiring, engaging, and even frightening, but they had never left me despairednot like this.

With the frenzy of life nearing its end, I ran past the communal well and began tearing away the piles of wood that had buried the front door of my apartment. The slums were mostly made of wood rather than stone, and, paradoxically, that had left them far less damaged by their own partial collapse. High on the hill of Collis Oppidum, these buildings had taken a fraction of the grey wave's impact. Was it possible that my grandfather had survived? My four brothers and sisters pulled at the debris with fire to match my own, but because of the descending cloud of death above us.

Crawling in the small hole we finally managed to open, I slipped into the first room of my two-room apartment, pulled my flashlight off of my belt, and marveled that everything was still in its place and tidy. Running to the back room with a hopeful grin, I came up short, and my excitement faded. My grandfather lay unmoving on the floor with his eyes closed.

My flashlight illuminated piled wood on the other side of our apartment's sole window. He'd been buried here all alone, with no way out and no place to find breath. I dropped to my knees as my friends surged in behind me and then fell silent.

	<TEXT> A Multiverse Companion guide is a good idea.

 Did the Outer Shield surround every Earth individually or did it cover an entire region of the Multiverse? 

The Outer Shield covered the 'exterior' of the outermost Empire worlds in the sphere. This is why people could walk in between Empire worlds during the Crushing Fist danger, but not leave (the Shield both protected them and trapped them inside). The fact that all of these things are consequences of structures built in dimensions higher than just 3 makes the shape difficult to visualize, but fortunately the functional workings still make sense (i.e. you can't come into realities protected by the outer Shield if you yourself are outside it; you can if you are inside it). So a sphere of spheres is still a really good way to think about it.

 And when the shields covering the Amber Worlds and Yngtak popped and "shot them out like a grape," was it just the Earths or planets within those universes moving, or were their entire universes moving through the multiverse?

Interesting timing for this question, because we're just about to find out what really happened here as the Amber World peoples piece together their situation (rather than just have outside people conjecture about it, since simplistic analogies only go so far). Stay tuned for the rest of the Grey Riders series :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great questions! This is the kind of thing I love thinking about. It underlines everything going on in the stories and yet is beyond any one character's knowledge.

 If a rift is just a connection between two random points in two different universes, the chance of both ends ending up on versions of the same planet seem infinitesimally small; that is, assuming that the rifts are truly random and that there is nothing directing them.

This is a good thing to point out: a rift is only 'random' by virtue of its destination reality. If you've got 100 realities on a continuum and you're in Reality 50, a natural rift can connect to realities 1-49 or 51-100, basically any reality you're not already on but with an unknowable bell curve distribution that favors proximity. The people in these stories have a *sense* of this by the nature of their travels, but nobody has codified it.

For example, if you're in Reality 50 and a natural rift opens, it's very likely to go 1, ie to Reality 49 or 51; a little less likely to go 2, a little less likely to go 3... etc... until Realities 1 and 100 would be extremely rare destinations. That's why we see many similar realities that change in gentle gradation, but also why people get scared by 'bad' rifts i.e. ones that go to a very distant and likely horrible reality. A rift between Reality 97 and Reality 8 would be very jarring in terms of changes in appearance and local threats.

And don't forget mapping the actual realities is made more complex because they are in three dimensions. There is a reality to your left, to your right, ahead of you, behind you, below you, and above you. That is why Heath and Her Glory map their regions as a collection of spheres like a ball pit. The spheres are the realities, and they're in an ocean of other bubbles.

But other than the destination reality, natural rifts go to the same place and time and are also gravitationally bound and require a certain amount of space. That is to say, natural rifts 'fall' (which is why we don't see them just hanging around high in the air all the time), and they also don't slip into the ground because they have actual physical presence (which is why they don't just fall right into the planet itself). So in the end they tend to hang out right at ground level where people can walk or ride through them. And to reiterate, they don't take you to alien worlds or to the past or future. Rifts in Kansas will always go to another version of Kansas (assuming Kansas exists on the next Earth).

There are other types of rifts. While natural rifts are jagged and range from light blue to deep purple depending on the level of damage that caused them, the Brownshirts can create smooth oval spectral blue portals to specific destinations (both new reality and a new physical destination) over a wide range; they also subconsciously enforce a sort of one-way travel. You and I can go into a new world and come back out through a friendly portal, but a threat can't come into ours from its side. Her Glory's rectangular violet portals do not have this intelligent safety, as hers are technologically created windows being ripped open between two realities. As we see when the Heart of her portal machinery is destroyed in The New Exodus Vanguard, the energies of that exploding machine blow open many such rectangular violet windows  that take quite some time to naturally heal. And, finally, we've seen rudimentary First World transportation that uses gigantic circular machines to 'send' (rather than open a portal) people and equipment one way only to a new reality and location through a massive white and purple tunnel of light. An advanced version of this on the First World opened a small rectangular door into Teskoy Prison, approaching, in some small manner, what Her Glory's violet rectangles were capable of. Natural rifts to small artificial realities can also be grey.

  The narrator says that the skies of the Amber Worlds shimmer due to the shields and that the First World has a golden sky due to its own golden shield. This makes it seem as though the shields are much closer to the planets than I would expect from an interdimensional shield, close enough to be visible (I wouldn't know, though. I'm not an engineer.).

The Shields are, in fact, a local planetary phenomenon. Because of the nature of rifts (which are gravitationally bound), the Shields are designed to shore up and solidify the fabric of reality around Earth. Think of it as sewing a quarter over a hole in your shirt; your friends can no longer poke through that hole and annoy you because a quarter beats a finger every time. Outside that quarter, the fabric is unbroken, so it's less safe than a quarter, but still has no holes.

This does mean that an enemy that can control portals can theoretically travel to somewhere like Mars, rift through to our reality on our Mars, and then fly through space to Earth the old-fashioned way, but the Empire has never seen any threats at such a level and would be likely doomed anyway if that happened.

The reason why they haven't seen things like that ties to the next point. 

 So far in the stories, we've only seen versions of the Earth (assuming that most unnamed planets seem to be a version of Earth), the Moon (or two), and Mars, (correct me if I missed any) excluding universes that do not have an Earth analog, such as Yngtak. 

We have so far mapped about a quarter of what is called a 'base branch' of realities. Think of it like the thick branch of a tree spreading out into thousands of smaller branches and then little leaves. Because they all came from the same major base, we are seeing Earths, solar systems, and stars that all have the same basic construction and laws of physics. There's almost always oxygen, a breathable atmosphere, plants we recognize, and so on for this reason.

Those who went beyond the Waystation in the belly of the beast actually went into the next base branch, so whatever worlds they passed through could have been wildly different. Indeed, we know one of them has been seen before, and that world had oceans of blood, islands of bone, and some sort of monstrous ivory sky entity (in other words, a horrifically different version of Earth).

 Are these universes actually smaller than our own and perhaps only include a solar system?

Some are, especially artificial ones like the Capital Temple. But we'll get into that when the time comes.

One of the shadow beings taunts Jonathan Cortin with being the only sentient living being in his entire universe. While we can't know if that's true or not, it doesn't really matter, because universes are so huge and our ability to communicate so small that we may never know. The only inkling we have that something else might be going on out there are the several kinetic objects that destroyed the Dreamer on High and saved Alek Staley's people on Erenia. The objects would have to have been sent a very long time before and there's nothing left from where they must have originated now, but it speaks to the possibility of alien life (and them reaching out across the distance to help us).

  Or is there another reason why rifts seem mostly restricted to Earths and Earth-like planets?

I'd say in the end we are limited by what we can see and interact with. For example, in the Crushing Fist, when people talk about realities being squeezed or crushed, for us this really means our sphere of locally accessible space. The inter-reality dust was attracted to our Shield and thus was sitting atop our local sphere of reality; if we had failed and it all had imploded, the rest of the universe may have gone on unaffected. Aliens (if they existed) might have flown by someday and wondered what the hell that giant mess was, and probably categorized our solar system as a black hole.

I hope this helps visualize what's been going on :)


edit: I'll add here that the force that began all this did in fact rearrange the location of and/or destroy entire universes. It was not local to us or to Earth. For example, when Ward Shaw reports that universes have been rearranged, he literally means that where going a certain direction once took you to Reality X, it now goes to Reality Y, because the sheer force actually moved around what universes it didn't outright annihilate. The Empire's Shield dropped 96% protecting our local space from the ripples of that impact. Otherwise, humanity may have been wiped out. </TEXT>

Lifemy lifewas forced to continue. I just kept breathing, and, eventually, moving. The radio was alive with the voices of a desperate police force trying to restore order, and I was a policewoman. "Get up, Venita!" I shouted. "Get up!"

I thought of my grandfather at home, if it was still there; I thought of Celsus in the hospital, if it was still there; most of all, I thought of Flavia, my sister, hoping that I would not have to braid her beautiful golden hair one last time for a funeral. My entire body was battered, bruised, and sliced; but my eyes seemed to leak pain most of all. "*Get up!*"

On my feet. Gasping, by all my effort, on my feet. Lolling back and forth and stumbling up out of the grotto of devastation that held my brother's body, I took in the landscape.

Laughter. I was laughing. Was that really me? It was. Rasping, the noise vibrated my chest. On the horizon, so very far away, for I had been carried farther than I could have driven in an hour, the skyscrapers of New Rome stood tall and proud for all their damage and shattered windows glinting jaggedly under hollow blue. It couldn't take us down. It hadn't ended the world. I pointed feebly at those distant upthrust structures, and at whatever force had sent the wave. The words from one of my favorite First World movies came out weakly, but fiercely. "Yippee... ki-yay... motherfucker." I rasped out another laugh and sobbed all at once. We'd survived.

Or some of us had, anyway.

Eight hundred years.

Ninety minutes.

Eight hundred years.

I knew all of their names; mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, father's grandfather, father's grandmother, and beyond. It was every twelve-year-old's task to memorize their family tree. Eight hundred years back, I knew *all of their names,* and everything those long-dead men and women had sought to build over eight hundred years had been brought low in ninety minutes.

The road was only barely fit to be called such; stumbling between broken logs and shattered overturned cars, I made my way along the surface of the world under a sky that had no right to its current beauty.

"Help me!"

A woman screamed for help from an upended truck, and I stalked over, kneeled down, and helped drag her out. In her arms was a smiling red-faced baby, and I stared. "How...?"

Still in shock, she ran off with her child.

Babies? If a baby had survived, had this apocalypse been less cruel than it had seemed? The strange grey flood had been less dense than water and more bouyant; had that lessened the impact from total destruction to mere hurricane-like damage?

Latin. English. The radio wasn't gibberish. Finally returning to some semblance of sense, I lifted it and asked, "Venita here. What's the situation?"

It was the Chief. Of all people, the old man had made it. He paused one of his orders to respond, "Good to hear your voice, kid. Coordinate with others in your area and get the rescue efforts under way there."

Blinking, I recalled my training, and adjusted my radio for short range as I stood among the endless expanse of downed trees and broken cars. "Who's around?"

No response came, but that was no matter. I had been swept very away from the city. Moving further down the road, I tested each car and truck, but they had all been too badly damaged by their own weight, and I doubted they could navigate the destroyed road besides. In the end, I overcame both these hurdles by finding a working motorcycle. Remembering some of my vehicle training from my third year, I hotwired it, and then whooped as it roared to life. The rumble of machinery meant civilization had returned, at least for me, and we had a chance. Looking back, I memorized the grotto where Tacitus lay unmoving under the hollow sky. I would come back for him. I promised him that.

Winding my way between obstacles wooden, stone, and mechanical, I set out for the broken teeth of New Rome, but I had not gotten far before I saw *it* pulsing quietly in a small clearing on the pavement. My heart beat in a new manner as I approached, gearing for war against some unknown dread, for it was obvious what this was. Circling my bike around to the front, I gazed beyond the jagged rip in space and down the slope of a long summer-dried mountain. The trees there were of a different type, and standing; the valley was healthy, but surprisingly young, as if it had been torn asunder by fire or other disaster only a few years before. In a light yellow sky, I watched as a small black dot approached from high above.

While I could not know the true scope of what had happened to our world, I knew that the Shield must have gone down, and that this was no world of the Empire. That meant anything and everything through that rift was beyond dangerous. I radioed a warning back to headquarters and then frantically began looking for something to block the gap; rocks and trees were not enough. In the end, I had to hotwire a nearby truck and ram it into the breach, clogging the whole thing with logs, debris, and metal.

My whole body ached as I stood and watched the strange black orb arrive and hover on the other side. The canopy of the truck had smashed down when it collided with the spectral upper edge of the rift; looking in through the crushed rear window and past the small gap that remained of the front window, I could see the orb moving from place to place, likely analyzing the passage. 

I radioed back a higher level of threat and retreated to my motorcycle. What could I do here? I still had my pistol, for it was more firmly strapped to my side than even my radio, but I wasn't sure if it would be enough against whatever that thing was.

Caecilia's voice came in over the radio. "Venita, we have reports of dozens of rifts opening all over the city and surrounding countryside. You say something's moving at yours? What level of threat?"

My blood chilled as a high whine spun upthe sound of a drill on metal, and of sparks spiraling outward. With a guarded voice, I replied, "Very high. Whatever it is, it's intelligent, and it's drilling through my barrier."

Her response was the best thing I could have heard at that moment: "We're on our way."

No, there was one better thing to hear. It was Flavia's voice, and I nearly broke down as I heard her. "Venita, you're alive! I've got Rufus, Porcia, and Septus with me. Where are you?"

As I backed away from the rift and took up armed position behind a heavy dislodged boulder, I murmured my location and whatever I could see about the oncoming threat. The sparks began to whorl out from the rear of the truck, and I knew the black sphere was almost in. The roar of motorcycles in the distance matched the noise of drilling: that would be the Dangerous Four, already nearing. They never wasted even a single moment. My own dangerous four would be right behind them.

The next voice on the radio was that of the Chief, going out on wideband to all listeners with both concern and determination. "We've trained for this," he said. "We are the first line of civil defense. Battles are being waged all across the countryside by your fellow officers, and we have one directive. *Don't let anything from those rifts reach the city.* The global military is temporarily in disarray, but mobilizing. They'll be here. They'll *be here.* Until then, we have to hold out for ninety minutes."

It would have been ironic if Tacitus was not lying dead in a ditch; I set my watch for a hundred minutes, for the nightmare was always worse than it seemed. I could feel him smiling beside me. I was not alone. I was glad for that, because I had a chill gut feeling that this next ninety minutes would be, unimaginably, even worse than the last. I shivered out all my tension, lowered my bruised and bleeding arms to the surface of the boulder, and steadily aimed my pistol at the fading spiral of sparks emanating from the rear of the truck.

Ninety minutes.

I breathed every so calmly as the whining noise of drilling faded into open summer silence. Approaching engines thrummed at the edges of my hearing, but Tacitus and I would be the only ones to face this when it first broke though. I turned my radio off lest the urgent chatter give away my position.

Ninety minutes. We could do this. Staring down the sights of my gun, I waited unmoving, not even daring to blink. Had it given up and gone away? Had it found the metal too much to drill through? Somehow, I doubted

A low distant boom far to my right marked some sort of explosion; a flash of green far to my left hinted at something horrible emerging on that horizon. I didn't let my attention waver for even a second, for others would defend those areas. Still shrouded in deafening anticipatory silence while a single violin note in my head rose to excruciating vibration, I waited.

Without warning, the metal at the truck's rear ruptured outward with a massive kick. Gaze hard and true, I took aim and fired.

The Siege of New Rome had begun.

The signal cut out, leaving us in static-filled and stunned silence for a heartbeat before it happened.

The windows of the house blew in around us as the flood waters overwhelmed our bastion. Thirty-five people screamed. Tacitus and I had no choice but to struggle for ourselves; the flow tore most of the families down into the basement or out the windows. Fighting upstairs, he and I climbed our way to the second floor, escaping the dry flood of chaotic grey as best we could while the world shook with the seizures of Armageddon and the very air itself grew hot in our lungs and on our skin. We stood at the master bedroom's bay window; the searing wind had already blown in the glass, and we stood against the gale and watched a tidal wave coming in across the horizon.

There was nowhere left to go. The city's buildings had been constructed against earthquake, hurricane, and dimensional torsion, but would they survive *this?* They disappeared like so many shoals into the curved darkness of the wave. I wanted to close my eyes and cry, but my uniform, dirty and battered as it might have been, kept me strong. I lifted my radio from my waist and asked, "Is there anyone still left?"

Only static replied.

"If you can hear me," I said. "Get to higher ground immediately."

There was nothing else to be done. Solemnly, I clasped the radio back to my waist and took Tacitus' hand. "This must be it, brother. I've enjoyed my time with you."

He gave a wan smile, and spoke for the first time since I had known him. "And I, you."

The roar was unconscionable, unknowable, irresistible. The atmosphere itself seemed to sluice away by the sheer drawing force of that coming grey tidal wave. I could not close my eyes; could not look away; could not cower; could not fear. Ever after, my soul would remain in that moment. Ever after, my spirit would be grey.

Ninety minutes. I had been preparing for a date an hour and a half before.

Ninety minutes.

The wave of grey became a wall; the brick wall of time became a sickening wall of grey. It was far, closer, closeand then the fist of some massive water elemental punched through the window and cast us back with breakneck force. I lost Tacitus, and the dry waters slammed me into the wall and through into some interstitial space where spouting forces tore at my limbs and threatened to drown mebut I squeezed up between two stone barriers, the spine of the house in some ancient manner, and I screamed for mercy from whatever was behind this. I had in my head some concept of an entity or being beyond us, bigger than us, perhaps friendly, perhaps notbut for this personage, I had no apt word. I merely screamed with all the desperate terror my soul could offer.

Somewhere, a watch beeped.

I stilled and listened to the rushing dry waters.

Not ninety minutes.

Eighty minutes.

...eighty minutes. He'd set his watch for eighty.

This was not the end, not yet. "*Tacitus!*"

An answering groan of pain echoed from somewhere in the dark. Crawling sidelong in the cramped and cracked spine of the ancient house while horrible creaks, groans, and tremors sounded above and below, I found a grasping hand. "Tacitus! Is that you?"

He squeezed.

"We have to get out of here!" I shouted over the submarine-like noises of pressure. "This won't hold much longer, and we might be safe if we swim high enough!"

He gasped, but promised to follow me with another squeeze of his hand. I swam down as much I dared in the dark and moved bricks away from his legs; freed, he weakly clambered after me in the dark. The inner spaces of the house rushed with foaming pressures like an underground river, and I struggled not to hyper-ventilate as I readied myself for the dive. In that unseen maze, only his watch glowed, and even that only with ambient green counting down to the end of the world. Five minutes, now. I could hear the long and drawn out notes of the music of time as it approached its crescendo for the play of our people.

I dove down and pushed forward, hoping against hope that the way forward had been cleared by the force of the dry water itself. If we made it out of the house, what then? A thousand foot ascension to the raging surface? My breath was already short, and my chest burned.

Kicking forward, eyes open despite the debris, I saw shadowy illumination. We pushed out of the spine of the ancient house together and rose as one, kicking and clawing straight up while looking each other in the eyes through the chaos. We both knew we would never make it. The sun was a mere dot through the grey turmoil aboveand even then, what remained?

Without warning, the sensation of risingor, rather, ejectionbecame crushing, and we screamed silently in mutual pain.

Floating there together, grasping one another and no longer trying to ascend, I saw the truth of our doom in his pain-shot eyes. On his wrist, the green glow blinked. Zero. Time was up, the whole world was underwater, and I was out of breath.

The bubbles trailed out of my mouth and nose with a deceptively normal tickle. Fire surged through me in the same manner as that moment that I had used my own arm bone to stab another student. *NO!* We would force this out to the very last second! We were both using oxygen; I gripped him in those vast underwater moments and I pressed my mouth to his. Being smaller, I needed less air to stay conscious, or so my racing mind figured. He understood, and breathed out fully.

I took the warm air from his lungs amidst the rush and held his heavy limp body tight as the currents carried us. Shrouded in darkness and grey, beset by blasting eddies, I let the two of us soar in the dry liquid void for as long as chemical truth would allow my consciousness to function. Even if everyone else on Earth was dead, I would outlast. I was determined to make it so.

The jerk was a kinetic and a painful one, and blasted me right out of half-consciousness into a newly alert state. Something tremendous had happened, but I had only half-felt it; I sighed mentally as the dark waters slowed, descended, evaporated like a fading bad dream, and delivered me to my knees on dry earth with Tacitus in my arms. I had no awareness for measuring my surroundings or situation. There were only forced breaths, chest compressions, and desperate ravings at a sturdy unconscious face.

He did not wake. He was dead.

I lay beside him in the devastation, sobbing.

Tacitus was dead, and so was life as I had known it. Still in shock, I gasped in breath and turned my eyes this way and that, taking in the flattened forest and rubble surrounding me. Had this been a suburb? It was nothing more than a mess of massive debris now.

Ninety minutes. That was all the warning we had been given.

I had been putting makeup on for a date...

Against all odds, the radio had somehow remained clipped to my belt. It buzzed and then began talking with one voice, two voicesand then a dozen. They were terrified, confused, and in shock, but they had survived.

My training kicked in, forcing me to move from the dirt and dust. On all fours, I crawled higher.

"Why are we still here?" I asked Tacitus, but, as usual, he did not respond. "Why are we still alive?" I asked him, forcing dirt and pain out with a cough. He remained his usual quiet self.

Putting my face to the ground for a moment, I shook uncontrollably.

The sun was shining in a cloudless sky and the shimmering I had seen all my life was gone. The lifeless blue in its place seemed somehow hollow. "End it!" I screamed, hitting the dirt with my balled hand. "End this farce!"

But the story would not end. No chapter pause, no mercy. I didn't even get so much as a line break.

But our radios crackled to life, interrupting the makeover and calling us to NRPD headquarters. Sighing, we donned our uniforms and carpooled back. We had barely gotten out of the car before higher-ranking officers rushed past us into the parking lot and shouted, "Get a cruiser! Go! We'll update on the radio!"

Flavia turned to call after them, but a subtle tremor shook the ground at our feet.

"Something serious?" Porcia asked.

Flavia shook her head and hopped in a car as Rufus squealed to a temporary stop beside us. Porcia waved down Rufus; I grabbed Tacitus as my partner and pulled out of the lot at speed behind a stream of other cars.

"What's happening?!"

Tacitus shook his head worriedly. He didn't know.

The Chief's voice came on the radio, but he was far from his usual mock angry self. He was disquieted and strained. He fought his own breathing to force out, "Ninety minutes."

I heard Caecilia's voice respond. "Chief, ninety minutes?"

"Ninety minutes," he said, and I heard the sounds of him quickly forcing down his own panic. "Men. In times of emergency, we may be called upon"

"Chief!" Caecilia radioed. "Forget the speech! Just tell us!"

"It may be the end," he choked out. "They're trying to fix it, but that's not on us. The Empire's structure is under some sort of assault, and the entire thing is ninety minutes away from failing and crushing us." As I drove, I heard car alarms go off and windows shatter as another tremor rocked the downtown area of New Rome. "Spread out. Keep the peace. There will be panic. Save who you can; radio in for fires. The fire department is on full status all over the city and in surrounding suburbs. Don't be a hero. *Survive this.* We're going to need you when all is said and done."

Tacitus and I looked at each other in shock, but this was no joke. My thoughts went to Celcus while my partner set his watch for eighty minutes. It was as our teacher had taught us: when given a nightmare, plan for it to be even worse than it appears.

New Rome had been built in the style of the New York Cities rather than the Romes of the Empire worlds; we had numerous high buildings and vast tracts of suburbs. The radio came alive with shouts, but, to their credit, these men and women were on point and communicating well. Headquarters directed Tacitus and me away as the cars split up; we headed for Rupibus Citerior, the river-bound suburb with ancient quarry cliffs.

Tacitus pointed up and out the front window.

"I see it too," I told him, trying to drive while also glancing up at the strange roiling perturbations in the sky. Out there in the shimmering blue, strange aqueous grey blobs seemed to be forming. "What *is* that?"

He had no answer.

We pulled over and ran for a house whose side had collapsed in the tremors. A frantic woman in a traditional robe screamed incoherently at us. I asked loudly, "Is anyone in there?"

She pointed and screamed some more while Tacitus ran in. Skirting the outside, I radioed him the lay of what I saw, and he emerged with two children in his arms in short order. The woman calmed as they were returned, I confirmed that this was everyone in the house, and we got back in the car post-haste.

Four blocks down, a truck had up-ended a massive array of apples across the road. We circled it, saw that the truck driver himself was safe, and continued on as another tremor hit and a fire hydrant ruptured, spraying a geyser of water into the air.

I could tell Tacitus was deeply disturbed, and my own fear matched his. There had to be something wrong with the Shield generatorthe main one on the First World, ours, and possibly more. We needed more information. I couldn't believe I was going to break three years of no-contact, but I had to know. "Tacitus," I told him, handing him my phone as I weaved between various crashed cars and panicked crowds at speed. "Type this in."

He nodded.

"Sam. Amber Three in peril. Crisis with Shield structure. What is Amber Eight's situation?"

Tacitus hit send even as I slammed the brakes, jumped out of the car, and ran after a thief carrying a television out of a store. I knocked the device onto the ground, breaking it, and then gripped the defiant teenage boy. "We're in crisis, kid! This isn't the time to steal! Go help who you can!"

Amazingly, he actually seemed to genuinely hear me, and his defiance faded. "Yes ma'am."

I let him go, and he ran toward an upside-down car whose passengers were screaming. Sometimes I was proud of our people, and of the power of the uniform.

At that moment, as I watched the smoke rising from the city behind me, strange grey rain began to patter down. I held my hand out and recoiled; it was *dry.* The dry rain had begun in that moment, cast down from the roiling anomalies in the sky, but that moment was also the exact instant that my heart of hearts knew our world was over. Like my growing bond with Celcus, it was not something I had consciously acknowledged, but it was there nevertheless.

Climbing back in the car with my partner, I accepted my phone. The text said only, "Just as bad here. Communications may go down. I'm coming for you."

I froze. Could he still care after all this time? We hadn't spoken in

The ground split, and the rear of our cruiser began to rise. Kicking the car into gear, I sped forward just in time to avoid a growing crack in the ground. Around us, dozens of car alarms went off, and the bouncing power of the earth shattered our left and right windows, letting the noise in with full force.

Panic was not in us. Four years of extreme training had seen to that. We had only our duty. As the dry rain poured down and obscured sight, we drove from crisis to crisis pulling people out of wrecks, notifying headquarters of fires, and doing what we could until the flood waters rose too high.

At the last, Tacitus and I were forced to abandon our vehicle and seek refuge in a suburban home with ten families already huddled inside. It was the oldest edifice by far and the last one standing on the block, exactly as the power of tradition would have it. We watched the television set in horror as reporters struggled against dry floods, grey rain, high winds, and vicious tremors to show us what was happening.

"This is Isaiah Corning for New Jerusalem News on Amber Eight," one screamed over the wind as they cut to him. "Details are scarce, but it seems there's some sort of pressure on the outer Shields" He waved back at the hurricane behind him just as a tremendous flash shot up and rent the sky.

The thirty-seven of us huddled in that house recoiled in abject terror as the earth and continent followed the flash up into the clouds and the hurricane landscape itself curled out and exploded, disintegrating the city and Isaiah Corning in an instant.

There was no other possibility. Amber Eight's Shield generator had just ruptured, spraying inner magma into space. The scale of the thing was beyond comprehension; had all the billions on that Earth just been killed? The generator was integrated into the molten core of the planet, and some insane and unthinkable stress must have overloaded it with terrifying force. The shockwave would be spreading around Amber Eight even at that moment at the speed of sound, wouldn't it? Shaking uncontrollably, I tried to text, but Tacitus took my phone and typed the letters in for me. The message was obvious. "Get off Amber Eight asap!" The second text carried more information: "Planet exploding!" He hit send and handed it back to me, forlorn.

Realistically, I knew, Sam was dead.

And even then Fabricius of New Rome News at Nine was screaming, "ReportsAmber Four is also gonejust explodedthe situation is critical"

But turning and focusing on the board was like diving into a rushing torrent of knowledge. Physical training was maintained, but we were required to learn the full weight of the Empire's ethical teachings, philosophy, moral codes, legal codes from every single reality even though we would likely never see them, and more. The absurd goals set by our teacher in the first year were mirrored here; often, Celcus' allies and mine gathered, and we divided research work and studied long into the night. Through that semester, we became more a team of seven rather than two teams of three and four respectively; I came to respect Septus' indomitable will, Porcia's quick wit, and Rufus' quiet bond with Tacitus. I still outwardly despised Celcus, but he was no longer the crass brat he had been on his first day, and I slowly softened my glares and treatment of him.

My arm was fully healed by the time the major tests rolled around, and we did pretty well as a group, but the second semester blasted us with four thousand years of history multiplied by a hundred or more Empire realities. The trick wasbeing woven of the same threads as they wereall the worlds were eerily similar save for one or two major differences whose diffuse impact changed everything. If you could memorize the core differences, you could work out their histories. It was always the same leaders, nations, and names, but the play was new. Some won or lost; some died young or lived to old age. Above all, a global war in each world seemed a fixed point in history. A man known as Adolf Hitler always lived and died in each reality with the exact same actions and fate. There were other fixed points of course, but that global war was the latest, and served to anchor all the worlds of the Empire to similar concurrent political and technological situations. They'd had just short of a thousand years to diverge, but had remained unknowing siblings.

At times, I wondered if their general populations knew about us. Somehow, I suspected the rich and powerful kept the true state of things to themselves just as they kept us in the military caste poor and without other options.

None of us seven took the first rank at the end of that second year, but we were all in the top bi-decile, and Caecilia came around and gave us words of encouragement before she headed off to graduation. 

Suddenly, *we* were the upperclassmen. Freshman boys and girls were running up to *us* and asking *us* terrified questions. I remember standing next to Flavia at the door to one of the lecture halls when a young freshman girl with metallic red hair ran up, saluted, and asked for advice. It was an eerie scene for me, like a window through time, and I gave her what words I could. Flavia just laughed and adjusted my cap to hide some of my hair that had gotten out.

That third year was a time of bonding for us seven. We no longer considered questions of merit or need; we simply aided each other in all things. I was eighteen by then, and feeling capable in a new way. I could see the world on a broader level, see our imprisonment as a world, and our duties. The vast majority of the Empire's citizens had no knowledge of the multiverse and no opportunity to travel between worlds; what difference was there between us and them, at least on this factor of freedom? We knew the true state of thingsindeed, it depended upon usso what did it matter that we could never leave? We had ten entire Earths here in which to explore, proliferate, and enjoy our lives. And by all rights, the multiverse was full of stomach-wrenching horror and fates worse than death, thus the entire purpose of the Shield generators our worlds maintained in our molten cores. We were safe. What more could we ask for? In a true and meaningful sense, I found peace with our imprisonment.

Nineteen. Holy shit, I'm nineteen. What are you doing to me? The rush of memories and the passage of time is exactly the same, which I suppose makes sense, because this whole process has always been about memory. I can't tell you what I don't know; there is only what I experienced, and what I experienced lives on through memory. Curious: how does my soul retain memories? Does it have its own neurons? Or perhaps some sort of residual energy patterns? I suspect this question, if we could ever answer it, would lend us more insight into existence than we can possibly guess.

I knew Celcus loved me. I wasn't an idiot. And in his own way, by growing out of lanky and into ripped and muscular, he had become a man. I wasn't blind to this. I justI was so focused on success, first born of a specific need, and then of inner drive, that I didn't want to think about it.

Suddenly, I'm standing in line at graduation, and I'm nearly twenty. What happened to the time? Apparently, when you spend every day enduring intense physical and mental training, the time flies. This place seems so old and empty now; full of fresh faces and new life that has nothing to do with us. The students I knew are all gone, while the teachers remain. They hug us, but they have seen a dozen whole classes come and go. I know they will forget us in time. I cry in the gymnasium bathroom, with only Flavia to comfort me. Everyone else has gone home.

Brick wall.

Thank all, brick wall.

Time finally slowed down as our new situation hit.

Now real officers, we seven had taken positions in New Rome's police department thanks to Caecilia's glowing recommendation. The Chief, a gruff older man with white hair, gave us a shouting down and a lecture on our first day, but then smiled. "You'll do well. We pick our recruits early in the academy, whether they know it or not."

Interesting. We looked at each other, smiled, and then stood shocked straight as he yelled again.

As rookies, we were given patrols on the outskirts of the city, and we answered directly to home office as part of a multitude of other low-level officers. Caecilia's Dangerous Four were now their own squad in the Special Assault division; we saw her at times, and remained in a perpetual awe that she found hilarious.

I had one day a week off, and I got to see my grandfather often. The first few times, I showed up in my snappy dark blue uniform on purpose and bathed in his praise.

What I didn't enjoy was Celcus' injury. Taking a shotgun blast to his bullet-proof vest for me, he landed himself in the hospital for two weeks, and I was forced to say something.

Sitting by his bedside, eyes downcast, I asked, "Is there something you want to tell me?"

Laid up, he shook his head weakly. "No. But I would like to take you to dinner."

I meant to say no, and that our careers were too important and that this would only lead to complications on the job, but I instead said, "Alright."

And suddenly I was at home and panicking while Flavia and Porcia tinkered with my makeup and hair. This was the one time in all our lives that makeup was supposed to help us look more beautiful rather than less, and we had no idea what to do.

"Does the Internet have any of those Kardashians?" Porcia asked, wild-eyed. "Let's see what they do!"

"There's gotta be a tutorial on here somewhere," Flavia responded, her eyes down on her phone. "I don't know the right keywords to search!"

My grandfather just looked on, laughing and laughing and laughing. "Oh, grand-daughter, you'll be fine. It is not layers of colored powder that drives this man's interest."

I stared at my own aghast reflection in the mirror. "*Interest?* Like"

The trappings of the tournament fell away as all forty-three of our classmates surrounded us in a cloud of angry faces and itching fists. The strategy was obvious to both us and them: eliminate the top team first and then sort out the remnants after.

Owing to the teacher's constant upping of the goalposts, we had anticipated something like this. We formed up in a tight defensive circle formation that we had designed just for this occasion; tight enough to keep us together, loose enough to keep us mobile and allow us to step back if needed. This was where my experience with our 'interference effect' became firsthand: we were outnumbered more than six to one, but that meant our opponents were constantly getting in each other's wayand many of them hardly liked each other to begin with.

Whenever a classmate would move in to attack, I would dodge back, and Celsus to my left or Flavia to my right would knock them senseless from the side; so it went with all seven of us. We moved across the gymnasium to avoid our groaning classmates on the floor, and the cloud of opponents followed, slowly losing members.

But of course such a process inevitably evolves, and the remaining twenty had worked out their differences and begun to coordinate. They dodged in and out, punching or kicking just out of range, aiming to wear us down rather than actually hit us. All they had to do, they knew, was exhaust us.

They were wrong. On a shout from Celcus, we leapt forward, swung out, landed uppercuts to jaws or kicks to foreheads, and then reformed our circle. Just like that, twenty became thirteen.

Celcus made the same shout; our enemies braced for the same tactic repeated, but we did not move. This was a feint we had created for follow-up use, and, when those around us grew confused that we had not moved, we *did* move. Two dodged, but thirteen became eight.

These eight best fighters backed off completely once they realized we had a strategic and planned advantage. They continued to avoid us; there was nothing for it now but to split back to one-on-one, our seven against their eight, and hope for the best. They had numbers and energy greater than ours, but we were not about to give up after getting that far.

All I could focus on through my exhaustion and brimming anger was the boy opposite me. He was bigger and taller, and one of the best kickers. Tacitus should have taken him, but he was busy with two opponents all by himself. Facing this bigger and taller opponent, I channeled my frustration with Sam and tried to move in like a lightning bolt.

That frustration did not quicken me; it slowed my reflexes. He chopped down on my left forearm, and I screamed as one of the bones snappedmy radius, I knew, from anatomy lessons. It stuck out sharp and white from my brutally ruptured skin.

My opponent hit me in the face over and over, and I felt my awareness fading. Beside me, my team was being beaten back and down. No! *No!* I would not *lose!* The future was *mine!*

I stabbed him with my jutting radius bone like a dagger.

He fell away bleeding and shocked. By his horrified expression, I knew he was done. Swinging out with my right arm, I clocked one of Tacitus' opponents, and, together, we battered the other. Freed, Tacitus moved on down the line tackling and mauling the other fighters until only our team was leftFlavia had fallen, Porcia was unconscious, Rufus was on the ground groaning, Septus stood with wild eyes and a bleeding nose, Tacitus was caught in a pile of limp bodies, and Celcus and I stood victorious. I trembled mightily and looked down at my brutalized arm.

The teacher coughed. "Last man standing," he reminded us.

I turned to face Celcus with eyes I knew must mirror those of a rage-filled zombiebut it was not fear that compelled him to do what he did.

He uppercut himself in the jaw and fell backwards to the floor unmoving.

Staring around the gymnasium, I looked for any other challengers, but the beaten class just watched me with fright, awe, and worry.

"Uh" The teacher looked around at the mess. "I have lessons to help you all reflect on this, but, uh, let's get this cleaned up. Venita, go to the medical building."

I nodded weakly; Flavia managed to stand and put her shoulder under my arm. Together, we staggered out the door.

Having my arm in a cast would make performance in my next year difficult, but, by the time I got out of the nurse's office with my sling and immobilized arm, everyone had heard about the crazy freshman who had stabbed someone with her own broken bone to take the number one spot; even better, the last remaining combatant had been so scared that he had knocked himself out on purpose.

But fear had not been what I had seen in Celsus' eyes in those moments. Over the last year, his cruel teasing had stopped, and he had become quiet and reserved around me. Had training knocked the idiot teenager out of him?

For some reason, I didn't immediately tell Sam that I had taken first in my class. I waited.

"Out celebrating :)," he texted that night. No mention of his final rank.

I sat in my bunk even though most of the other students had gone. I had two whole weeks for summer vacation before the next year would begin, and I didn't exactly relish rushing home and showing my grandfather my cast. He would fear that I had been disgraced.

Around five in the morning, Sam texted, "I have had *so* much soda tonight. I'm friggin' wired!"

I couldn't wait any longer. I asked him, "What rank did you get?"

"Oh, that? Tenth!"

Tenth. I leaned against the metal rods of my headboard and sighed with mixed relief. Tenth was still in the top bi-decile, and therefore top tier, but it had been dangerously close. One less rank would have made things much more difficult in the coming years. I simply couldn't hold it in any longer. "Do you even care about our future?"

I waited twenty minutes for a reply before I read, "Sam says to stop being a buzzkill!"

Confused and hurt, I asked, "Who's this? Why do you have Sam's phone?"

"Uh, hello, this is Hannah, his best friend?"

"Really? He hasn't mentioned you," I wrote. No further texts followed that night, and I sat in pain and misery watching my silent phone while Tacitus snored and Flavia threw playing cards at a hat.

I knew. I did. I knew what was happening. That didn't make it any easier. It happened on television and to people all around me all the time, but it was the first time it had happened to *me*, and I felt like my world was being crushed. In the morning, Sam was apologeticnot about his behavior, but about what needed to happen. I didn't cry; I was simply bereft. Where once there had been fire, I was simply ashes.

I took Flavia and Tacitus with me, and my grandfather was happy to be a gracious host again. As I sat and shivered with despair at the chabudai, I realized that this was my new family. Sam was a ghost on another world, while the solemn golden-haired Flavia and silent polite Tacitus were here, alive, and caring. It was as my teacher had said: my only allies were my fellow officers.

Eschewing all else, I chose to focus purely on school. This hurt would pass, and I would have a new life soon enough. Those two weeks were calm, contemplative, and healing; I celebrated my seventeenth birthday quietly and with my new family. Upon our return to school, I no longer had any delusions about other lives or other places.

Too, the upperclassmen had heard of me, and the blonde that I had talked to and then been helped by the year before came by with her crew. "Caecilia," she said, offering a hand. I shook it slowly while looking up from my seat at her two accompanying guys and one accompanying girl, the brunette I had seen with her the year before. They were now seniors, and I knew them by reputation as the best. "We're"

"the Periculosum Quattuor," I breathed automatically, amazed that they were talking to me.

She laughed. "They still call us that?" She shook her head. "I was gonna say, we're interested in seeing how you three do this year. Hit us up if you have any questions."

I nodded emphatically, and, beside me, Flavia stared after them as they left our classroom. "The Dangerous Four talked to *us?* You should stab someone with a broken bone every week!"

To her left, Tacitus grinned mightily.

	<TEXT> So you finally got one of us, did you? Then that means I'm probably dead; a gross corpse with her eyes turned up to the sun somewhere uncaring. My death must have been gruesome if it killed me faster than my suicide device could disintegrate me. Maybe it malfunctioned. I doubt you got in range of me while I was alive; we've been incredibly careful to stay far away from whosoever has the Twisted Book which you are reading from now.

I've had training to identify and resist this interrogation, too. We all have. The book can force us to talk and it can make us tell our stories, but it does not care about word count. I tell you now that I will take as long as I can, andI have to tell you this, or not doing so would expend my opportunityjust once, I can even lie or omit something. That is the power of belief. That is the power of dedication. If I believe it, my soul believes it. If I was a more gifted self-liar, I could even obscure my Truth with a traumatic repeated tale from my pastbut no, I've got one lie and I'll make it count.

Too, I studied your culture as part of my training. In many ways, sealed away beneath your worlds, we were the inverse of you. For example, we don't have a bystander effect. A citizen of the Amber Worlds is still more likely to suffer consequences from danger in a crowd, yes, but because of what we call the interference effect. Everyone rushes to help, thereby interfering with each other, as illustrated often in our ironic tragic plays. It is this most simple difference that I believe best illustrates my contempt for *you*.

But that's the root of all this, isn't it? The differences between us and you. The divide that cannot be crossed. The gulf of generations. What else could possibly have happened? Eight centuries ago our mutual ancestors sent thousands of their best and brightest into the under-depths of existence to serve an eternal vigil. They were the titans of their era: scholars, leaders, engineers, and good people. Ours was a new culture formed with purpose upon the multiverse; new, but forever hidden. While the Empire traded, expanded, and made allies and enemies, we lived within the grand machine and maintained the inner workings of the great Shield that protected the human race from the nightmares one page over in the book of realities. What can two men have in common who live either under strict eternal duty or sloshing about in a vat of beer, television, and fast food? My entire life I was subject to endless discipline and potential shaming if I underperformed; the men of the free Empire were instead told to *be themselves*, watch the Kardashians, and, above all, *consume.*

We are not without our cultural indulgences. We do like our soda. Have you *had* soda? It is so, so sweet on a warm summer day. Some do drink alcohol, the universal vice, but the military and engineering castes are not allowed to imbibe. For us, it's nothin' but the sweet stuff.

I was drinking an ice cold Pepsi, in fact, when I saw *him* drinking a Coke. For that, I decided that he had to die. My sword sliced down on his half-orc arm, and he dropped his drink in surprisebut he didn't get angry. He turned, saw me, and smiled. I shouldn't have talked to him. He was another virtual player with smart glasses on running around a park playing the same augmented reality game as I, true, but he was on Amber Eight and I was on Amber Three. I shouldn't have talked to him, and I certainly shouldn't have fallen in love with him.

So stupid. So young.

For the first time, I was actually excited about my required path. Alone among the castes, those from military families had the rare option to transfer between the various Amber Worlds. We couldn't leave our realities on account of our imprisoning backup Shields, but the rest of the Empire, with which we communicated little, had no idea that the ten major branch worlds were actually arranged and connected like a higher dimensional torus for structural strength reasons. Because of that shape, we could sometimes visit each other. If Sam excelled at his duties, or I excelled at mine, one of us could request a transfer.

"Venita," he would say on late night phone calls, "Just put up with it. As soon as we transfer, screw it all. We can run away and live in the woods."

I would smile at that thought. It was extremely difficult to fit in and hide any trait or feature that might distinguish me. I railed at the bonds of duty that I had been given by my grandfather; I longed to follow in the footsteps of my parents, who had been exiled to the far lands of my world for refusing their caste. Thinking it would be the easiest path available among the military caste options, I chose to join the city police force, and Sam did the same on his world.

Sixteen. I was sixteen when that first day began at the training academy. I remember it well because it coincided with a very strange and disappointing bi-lustrum. The harmonics of the inner layers of our Empire allowed communication with the First World every ten years or so, but, this time, they'd had little to say. Typically the bi-lustrum contained a data blast of culturemovies, music, corporate affairs, political news, and other informationbut the trend of shrinking communication had continued rather sharply, and, on my first day of police training, the First World more or less told us *meh.*

My friends had no new trends to copy, no new fads to become temporarily obsessed with, and no new movies to show at parties. Being slightly older than them, I was now enrolled in the beginning of my lifelong duties, and I simply couldn't share their confusion and disappointment. More than that, I had also met my antikin.

Celsus disgusted me immediately. I had never quite believed in the cultural myth, but there he was, my *antikin*, the perfect opposite to my temperament and the goad to my achievement. Thinking back now, I wonder if the recruitment officers did not in fact plan cadet classes to form these kinds of hostile enmitiesbut at the time, I was blinded by my dislike and his snide comments.

At lunch on that first day, I sat in the gardens of the academy as far from others as humanly possible and ate alongside my virtual boyfriend. Reclining next to me on the bench as he also ate on his first day at lunch, he asked, "So who is this Celsus guy, anyway?"

"I'm sorry," I told him, putting down my meager chunks of meat and cheese. "I've been bitching about him for ten minutes, haven't I?"

"It's alright," Sam said, his gaze downcast at his food. "Can I... see a picture of him?"

I shrugged and scrolled up a holographic recreation that existed only in our smart glasses. Celsus was six months older on account of a birthday late in our scheduling year, and all the taller for it. In fact, height was his defining trait. Lanky, towering, and hosting a mop of messy brown hair, his image glared at us.

"Ah," Sam said. He seemed at a loss for words. "That's cool."

I knew something was wrong, but I was too young then to see the obvious. "Cool? You don't often use First World sayings, Sampson."

"And you don't often use my full name. Don't worry about it. I may have met my antikin, too." He brought up a picture of a hard-eyed blonde guy our age. "Abraham. He's a real douche."

Him having a nemesis as well made me feel a little better. "They exist to drive us, and we them. Let's defeat them so we can be together, alright?"

He nodded, smiled weakly, and then logged out.

I was left to eat in the gardens by myself. With him gone, I felt truly alone. I sat and gazed up at the clear blue sky, wondering, as I often did, if the subtle shimmer up there was due to our interdimensional Shield. It was weaker than the First World's, no doubt, so we didn't have their characteristic golden sky, but it would still

"Hey, look at the troll!"

I turned and glared. It was Celsus, of course, and I wasn't about to go into the specifics with him of how much time I spent putting on makeup to look more plain or doing my hair to tone down its metallic red brightness to a more common brown.

"I'm favored for the five mile run today," he said, standing tall above my bench and grinning. "No chance a *girl* could ever keep up. Venita, you don't stand a chance."

That was it. I resolved not only to beat him, but to shame him as well.

Our academy was a palatial estate comprised of several grey brick buildings that held both classrooms and dormitories. Other scheduling years were there, all older, and I approached two older girls in smartly-kept uniforms who were standing and talking by one entrance. I saluted. "Excuse me, sirs!"

One improperly had some of her beautiful golden hair showing from underneath her cap; she wiped away noon sweat and adjusted her hat to hide it. "Cadet, what do you need?"

"I would like to know the best way to succeed on my first day!" I said, louder than I intended due to nervousness.

Her brunette classmate grinned. "Antikin drama, huh?" They looked at each other, and then said in unison: "Get allies."

I wanted to tilt my head, but I maintained correct posture. "Friends, sirs?"

"No," the blonde one said. "Allies."

The bell rang, and they turned and walked away with a nod each. I called after them, "Thank you, sirs!"

As I returned to our classroom for the hour lecture before the five mile run, I wished I had their snappy uniforms. As a cadet, I was in mandated grey sweats, and it made me feel like a formless blobexactly as was intended. Scanning the tan box that would house our fifty-student class for the next year, I tried to guess at who might be capable and fit. None were fat like the First Worlders of wealth and comfort, but thin and fit were two different things.

There was Flavia, who had golden hair like the upperclassman I had spoken to; she was of the poorest families, and had been an automatic choice for the police force like her mother and her mother's father before her. Her blonde hair belied a dark intent in her face. I could already tell she wanted to be the best to show up the children of richer families. Often, as our teacher told us in his initial lecture, the best commanders and department heads came from the poorest families, for they had an insatiable drive and knew well the price of failure.

To Flavia, I sidled, and then muttered sidelong in the formal tongue: "What say you of an alliance?"

She did not move from her arm-crossed and solitary but confident stance, although her eyes did dart left to analyze me. After a look up and down she said in the formal tongue, "That is satisfactory." In colloquial, she said, "Let's kick some ass today. Who else do you see?"

Grinning, I nodded over at a boy with short brown hair whose thick muscles and hard jaw were evident even despite his loose sweats. "Tacitus."

Flavia nodded, and I approached, scattering admiring girls as I did so. To these, Tacitus had said nothing, instead preferring to gaze out the window. Rather than assault him with compliments and requests like the other girls, I decided to sit next to him and look out the window as well. In the distance, I could see white shimmering clouds over the edge of a forest at the academy estate's end. At these far trees, I gazed, and Tacitus and I sat in silence as class began, the other students sat, and the teacher returned and lectured. For that hour, I said not a single word, and his only acknowledgement of my companionship was a nod as the bell rang and we stood to leave for the five mile run.

Catching us in the hallway, Flavia asked, "Is he with us?"

Tacitus walked beside me, and I beside Flavia. I said, "Yes."

He made no move to correct me.

The track was nothing special, for it needed no pomp. As a grey circle of asphalt running the edge of the estate, it ran close to the buildings and close to the surrounding forest in many places, and several dozen upperclassmen in black training clothes were already jogging upon it as part of their own exercise. These would not clear the way for us; they were, in fact, part of the hazards if they chose to be. *Fair* was not a word used often on our worlds.

I readied myself and let the rush of caffeine and sugar from a fresh soda fill my veins. Of the fifty of us, my three and another four stood at the forefront. Others had their rivalries, certainly, but it seemed we seven were the most brash. To our left, Celsus stood with his allies, Porcia, the lithe sprinter, Rufus, he of the red hair, and Septimus, a youngest son of his family who needed no help being as common as we all aspired to be in appearance if not in merit.

Our teacher studied each of us with a knowing glance and then raised his hand.

We kneeled.

"Ready!"

We tensed.

"Set!"

We leaned forward.

"Oh, hold on." Our teacher fiddled with his watch while the fifty of us groaned. He moved as if to adjust it and then shot his hand up instead. "Go!"

The trick caught the latter half of our class, but more than twenty had not been fooled. As a stampeding herd, we took off down the grey asphalt path under the quietly shimmering blue sky and burning mid-day sun.

Oh, my heart was pumping in my chest like you wouldn't believe, and I was no longer embarrassed about my outing with my grandfather to buy a sports bra the day before. Pumping my arms and legs as hard as I could, beyond the point where I was even certain of any individual motion and instead relied on sensations of rapid patterns, I tried to keep up with Celcus' groupbut Flavia gently reached out and slowed myself and Tacitus.

"We have a long run ahead," she said softly, letting our four opponents speed on. In the formal tongue, she said, "A test of endurance presents itself, not speed."

I was unsure, but Tacitus nodded to me, and, together, the three of us settled into a slow jog while the entire rest of the class sprinted past us. In moments, we held up the rear of all fifty, and I fought a red-heated embarrassment in my cheeks. For a time, the only factors keeping me going were my trust in Flavia's determination and my assurance that Sam was also making this same run in this same location five pages over in the book of realities. I had never been able to smell him, but I imagined I could sense his sweat, and his determination became mine. This was our track; our circle; our torus.

Flavia's gamble proved fruitful as those ahead began to pant, gasp, and ultimately slow. But she had one more discernment for us. Somehow, despite the strain, she managed to whisper: "Pass nobody important. We must remain behind them and not let on that we are unwinded." In colloquial, she added, "Then we'll rip it up right at the end."

Beside me, Tacitus grinned. By simple strategy, we had the edge.

We jogged just behind Celsus' lead four through three revolutions. Was my Sampson beating his antikin Abraham? I imagined lending him what strength I could through the walls of reality, envisioning it like so many layers of tissue paper. Sweating profusely under the shimmering sunlight, breathing hard, and lost in the pattern of slamming feet and pumping arms, I kept my eyes on my enemy. At times, we curved slightly further to avoid upperclassmen on the inner ring of asphalt, and these older recruits ignored us.

As the last two laps began, our ploy had lost its edge. Forced by their own limits to jog for a time, many of our class had begun to reach their second wind, and our collective velocity slowly increased. This was no longer something I and my allies could ignore, so we also ramped up our pace. A gap opened between us lead seven and the rest of our classand Porcia the sprinter took off like a rocket.

I leaned forward to race after her, but Flavia touched my arm as we ran. "Let her go. We can't match her in speed. Consider her a second endurance component." She looked to our left and right where Celsus, Rufus, and Septus now ran alongside. She shouted back, "Tacitus!"

Our brute ally bowled silently ahead into Septus' back, and Flavia veered left to collide with Rufus at the same moment. "Go!" she shouted.

At that, with Porcia still ahead, I was left to face Celsus on the final lap. My antikin glared with his arrogant and haughty expression and began sprinting himself; I charged after, only a step behind. He reached over and pushed at me. I dodged right, but being further out on the curve meant I had more distance to travel. Lowering my head, I veered left, forcing us both closer to the inner path while we pushed at each other.

Together we passed the exhausted Porcia as she gasped and stumbled a mere two hundred paces from the final line. Celsus' ire grew, and he lashed out with the makings of a real punch.

My vision shot through with stars, but I refused to stop. In those stars, I could see Sam's kind eyes and humorous smile. It was a new thought, too, born of our long love and my recent birthday, but: I wanted to rock that boy's world. It wasn't going to end like this.

Celsus kicked out, and we both slammed face-first into grey asphalt. Bruised and bleeding, I staggered up, and he raced after me. Fifty paces from the final line, an upperclassman in black training clothes turned and eyed us. It was the blonde girl I had asked for advice during lunch, and she clocked Celcus with a laugh. He fell a second time, losing any chance of catching up.

Wide-eyed with disbelief, I limped across the final line and fell on my ass as the rest of my class rounded the prior curve in the track and approached.

"Nice job," our teacher said. "Guess what? The run is now six miles. Complete another lap."

Bloodied, exhausted, and sweating through my grey clothes, I forced myself onto my feet and began staggering forward. The rest of the class passed me in short order, Flavia and Tacitus among them. My two allies mouthed apologies and did their best, but did not finish first. Twenty minutes later, I limped across the final line long after everyone else had headed off to the showers. My teacher shook his head and said, "The run is now seven miles. Do another."

At the time, I didn't realize what he was trying to teach me. I thought it was some trite lesson about teamwork or ethics; in my bunk in the dorms that night, I lay crying silently while my scrapes and wounds ached. I thought I had won first in my class, but I was now ranked last. What had gone wrong? Was I completely unfit for my caste? I would never see Sam if this continued.

He emailed me in the late hours of the night and told me he missed me, and that did assuage some of my pain, but he also told me he had come in eleventh. He was one ahead of his antikin Abraham, but eleventh was not enough.

In the bed next to mine, Tacitus lay staring at the ceiling by scant moonlight reflected from the floor our teacher had made us shine to perfection before lights out. Somewhere in the depths of the night, he turned his head, looked at me, and nodded solemnly; in that instant, I understood. I had to harden my heart like he had. We were not in an academy. We were in a prison.

The lucky ones got to be lawyers, politicians, mechanics, engineers, or any other occupation of the citizen castes. Not us. We were military, and our fates were not our own. Tacitus remained mute not out of illness, but out of hopelessness. He had seen the truth before I had; that was all.

No! I refused to believe it. I was no child. I was *sixteen*, and I was strong and smart and capable. I could *do this!*

Time and again I surged ahead against my nemesis. Time and again, Celsus and I were first and second in the class, alternating the position neck and neck.  Time and again, our teacher moved the bar ever further to frustrate our victories and cast us back. We would *win* what was set before us, and then *lose* the sudden new challenge. To quote my favorite First World show, it was utter bullshit!

It took six months before I bit the bullet and approached Celsus in secret. Tucked away in a maintenance closet, I said, "What are we going to do about this horse crap?"

Pressed close, he looked down at me and glaredbefore breaking with a sigh. "I'm tired of being the class loser. The teacher's definitely screwing with us."

"Then why don't *we* team up?" I proposed, gripping his grey sweatshirt. "Let's beat them *all.*"

Cramped together in that closet, he was looking at me really weirdly right about then, but I slid out before I learned a lesson about a hidden power of sixteen year old girls; one of which society had never warned me.

That afternoon's challenge involved a visit to the pistol range about half an hour's walk back into the woods past the edge of the academy estate. We endured the light snow and cold to brave a challenge. The setup was different than the usual; this time, ten of us would go at a time, each shooting at several moving targets that were designed to be extremely difficult to hit. This would be the hardest shooting exercise of the year, for training would largely move on to other areas in the second semester.

Flavia had been forced to leave me behind as an ally, but Tacitus had stuck with me; he shot targets on his range to my left while Celcus shot on the range to the right. Sending my angry and determined gaze ahead, I watched my targets move around for a full twenty seconds of the two minutes allotted.

"Venita," my teacher mouthed, though I could not hear him for the noise-cancelling headphones we all had on. He waved his hand. "Get on with it!"

Still, I glared at my targets. Something about the extreme difficulty ahead seemed amiss. Inverted black plastic pyramids moved left and right at high speeds while plant silhouettes danced up and down. These shots were impossible, and, while many of my classmates *were* making a few rounds land, nobody was doing well.

I looked to Celsus, and he looked to me. I raised my gun and pointed it at him; he did the same in kind.

Our teacher waved his arms in a panic.

But it was not at each other that we aimed; I shot at Celcus' targets, which were easy pickings from this angle, and he shot at mine. We ruptured all of the targets at a time of fifty-seven seconds, and Tacitus to my left wordlessly communicated the idea to Porcia. The two of them finished at one minute and eighteen seconds. Beyond them, Septus and Flavia got the same idea.

As the class looked on dumbfounded, the teacher gathered us and spoke with eyes both worried and proud. "I've been trying to teach you this year something that cannot be simply stated: there are no rules." Flavia raised her hand, but the teacher just nodded and continued. "This is real life. Training is a falsehood. When you face the vagaries of the real world, there will be no teacher to enforce rules. You can be punched during a footrace, kicked while climbing ropes, or shot from afar while aiming. Your fellow comrades in arms may be your rivals, but they are also your only true allies. Today, many of your classmates saw that truth and broke an inborn assumption. Do the same every day and you will live to an age of respect and merit. Believe in no law or force save that which you and your brothers and sisters own, and you will never be taken for a fool." The class looked around in wonder for more wisdom, but he dismissed us. "You've learned well. Take an extra day for winter break. Enjoy Christmas."

The extra time meant four whole days with my grandfather. I returned home to our apartment triumphant. The two small rooms, cracked walls, and diet of Ramen no longer brought me despair. Sam joined us virtually after spending time with his family, and he, my grandfather, and I drank sodas together in our living room.

As usual, my grandfather was asleep by eight o'clock, and I lay on the faded living room sofa talking to Sam. "And then, pop! Pow! I took down all the targets in nearly record time."

"So you allied with Celsus?" Sam asked, his tone guarded.

"It was necessary," I told him. "Part of the lesson for this semester. Antikins are an illusion. All we have is our fellow man."

He shrugged. "Cool, cool. We didn't really get the same result over here. We've got a lot of, uh, showboats. Not many alliances."

I did hear his words, but I was focused on his face. I wanted so very badly to be able to reach out and touch him at that moment, but he was just an image. "We've got some showboats, too" An urgent knock sounded on the door, cutting me off. "Wait, hold on, someone's here."

Sam frowned, but shrugged and logged out.

For some reason, perhaps because of our recent victory, a small part of me expected it to be Celcus. I was steeling myself for a total wild-card conversation when I opened the door and found Flavia standing there in the snow dressed only in her cadet sweats and a blue-and-green scarf. Aghast, I said, "Come in!"

Shivering, she came in and sat by the small kerosene heater in the center of the room. She glanced to the closed doors to the next room, but I said, "My grandfather's asleep."

She nodded, huffed out cold, and held her hands near the heat. "My, uh... I have nowhere to go."

I could tell by her manner that something serious had happened. "Did your family move or something while you were at school?"

She shook her head.

I hesitated. "So... they were there?"

She nodded.

"But"

She put a frozen finger to my lips. "They spent the last of their money getting me to school six months ago. They didn't have any food after that."

Suddenly as chilled as she, I ran through a thousand unspoken questions. After nearly a minute, I knew the truth of the situation: her injured mother and retired grandmother could have gotten government assistance, it was true, but nobody with self-respect or family honor actually did that unless there was no choice. Usually only to a pragmatic degree, it was more honorable to die than to embarrass one's caste, but those that waited too long in the winter months sometimes starved or froze to death unintentionally. I said nothing, instead opting to grab a blanket and wrap her up tight.

We sat in silence that late Christmas Eve. Her golden hair, normally hidden under a cap or dusted dull as much as possible, lay out long and beautiful by lamplight; it would have been inappropriate in public, but I didn't mind, and braided it for her as she alternately stared at the heater in a daze or sobbed. Her pain passed with the dawning of the sun, and she donned her mask of confident determination once again that Christmas morning. We had no presents, but my grandfather made a special tea, and we sat around the chabudai while he told stories of the ancient times; of the Yellow Empress and her knight, Conrad the Lover. This was always my favorite tale, for no one in all of time had loved as much as he had loved her. I thought of Sam and let tears run down my face. Beside me, Flavia stared at nothing.

The snow was beautiful that day, and icicles hung from the eaves. I walked with Flavia to the old well on the communal property outside and we threw pebbles down while listening for noises upon unseen ice. I turned away for a brief moment only to see her climbing up onto the edge to cast herself into that pit. I understood her pain, but I had no doubt she was stronger than that, and made no move to stop her. It was not for others to decide. After five breaths, she sighed and dismounted from the well's edge.

"Are you committed?" I asked in the formal tongue.

Sighing, she responded with the opposite. "Fuckin' A."

There was no more forlorn depression after that. She was not one to abide such wallowing.

My grandfather entertained us as his energy permitted, and I left him with a lasting hug.

Back at school, Tacitus embraced us both in solemn greeting with his muscular arms. I was tempted to ask him how his Christmas had been, but I knew I would get no answer. He had stayed in the dorms, for he'd had nowhere to go. It was somewhere around that time that I began wondering at the general standings of military caste families. How was it that we were all in such dire straits?

Celcus pulled me aside into our usual maintenance closet that first morning before class and then more or less stared down at me.

I narrowed my eyes. "What?"

He opened his mouth, stammered a bit, and then fled the closet.

Confused and annoyed, I brushed off the encounter.

Combat training began in earnest that second semester. Celsus had the advantage of height, but I was light on my feet and primed for viciousness. We were often paired as sparring partners, and sometimes mandated as teammates in regular ranked competitions involving the fifty students in our class. With the points awarded, we floated around the top twenty, sometimes assured of a prestigious ranking at the end of the year and sometimes in danger of falling among those who would be assigned desk jobs and menial tasks. Always, I thought of Sam, and of Amber Eight.

He'd sent me pictures at times, and it was a beautiful Earth much like my own. The sky was slightly bluer there in my imagination, and the land somehow more verdant. I wondered: would he move here, or would I move there? Was Amber Eight a better Earth on which to have children, or should we make a go of it here? New Rome was a nice enough capital, and there were plenty of other cities on my world where we could find a home if we felt like movingbut all these questions were pointless if neither of us excelled enough to request a transfer. It was time to get serious.

Day in and day out I practiced hand-to-hand fighting with Flavia and Tacitus. There was only one ranked tournament left, and one of us had to place first in order for all of us to rise by association. It was decent practice, but not enough. A wide range of our classmates had formed a large alliance in an attempt to game the matchmaking rules; we needed more.

Celcus and his friends were wary, but they joined us in late-night matches that we kept secret from everyone else. While they slept, we seven would sneak out to an unused gymnasium and assault one another for hours. Porcia was faster even than me, and a brutal opponent. Rufus the red-haired had beefed up over the course of the school year and become a match to Tacitus' strength, while Septus burned with the determination of a youngest child and simply would not go down no matter how tired or injured he became. These were good opponents that tested each of our facets, but, for me, Celsus was the most difficult.

He was tall as a tree, true, but his style was somehow the perfect opposite of mine. Among the various combinations of speed, strength, and stance in our group, his countered mine perfectly. When I would move slow and heavy, he would move quick and light; when I would go for holds, he would stay out of reach; when I tried to jab and dance, he would deploy his considerable size and strength advantages. Frustration was not a strong enough word to describe what I felt.

"He's on our team, you know," Flavia would counsel me. "If he wins, we all win."

I understood that at a logical level, but I still wanted to be the one. Tacitus knew this, and shook his head at me as I entertained visions of sabotaging Celcus in the final rounds. No. That would just be sabotaging my future with Sam.

Sam! I hadn't spoken to him in nearly a week, for our late-night combat sessions had taken up all my time. As I lay in bed in the depths of the night and texted him, I wondered how he was preparing for the upcoming tournament on his own world. In the morning, he texted back that he hadn't been doing much of anything for it, because he was certain he would win.

Staring at that message, I thought: are you serious? How can you be so callous with our future? But I said nothing. Maybe he *was* that good. I would simply hold my feelings in check until the end of year rankings came in for his class. If he was in the top tier, no problem. I had to trust him.

But I didn't. I was terrified and furious all at once, and that became a strange fire in my limbs as the morning came and the final tournament began. I texted Sam good luck, put away my things, and headed out.

There was little fanfare. We fifty and our teacher simply gathered at the same gymnasium as always, but, this time, the atmosphere was charged. Final fates for the year would be sealed by this competition, and even the biggest slackers had been goaded out of procrastination and into high-energy tension. I traded glances with each of my classmates as they warmed up, stretched, and tried to calm their nerves.

At the time, I had known all of them so very dearly, but their faces and names now elude me like so many patterns upon sea foam. I should have sprung into action; I should have stood up and yelled that none of this mattered and that our worlds were doomed, for at that moment the Empire had been in the process of being crushed for two years alreadybut none of us knew that. None of us were aware that we were living in the shadowed final days. As far as we knew, we would continue on in our bubbles for another eight centuries just as our ancestors had. Society was bigger than us and would outlast us. Society dictated, and we followed.

If we had known then, we might have had three years to try to do something differentlybut no. When the fall of our way of life came, we would have only ninety minutes' warning. Imagine being told that an hour and a half from now, it'll all be gone. Your home, your friends, your familygone.

That shadow hovered invisibly over me as I amped myself up for my final freshman hand-to-hand tournament. There were a great many things I knew to be doomed without consciously acknowledging such; among them, my relationship with Sam. Our contact now had the bitter tastes of confusion and distance. How dare he not practice for this?

The one-on-one trials began, and I was pitted against a rather weak fighter named Balbus. I punched him in the throat harder than I needed to and ended it immediately. Sorry, Balbus.

Many of our class fell away in the standings as the tournament progressed. Our teacher moved to group fights, and we seven finally hit the floor as one. Facing a group of seven of the best, we naturally paired off one-on-oneexcept for inter-fight kicks of opportunity we had practiced together in our late night sessions. I managed to land one against the back of Celsus' opponent's head, and the boy fell unconscious shortly before his team conceded. It was obvious our opponents thought we had played dirty, but the teacher reminded us of his first semester lesson at the gun range. 

But had we won? Never. The teacher actually grinned for once and called out a surprise final round: "Free for all. Last man standing."

	<TITLE> Gisela the Yellow </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-24 23:59:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Her mind weaved between times; eight centuries of reigniting memories kept her in many places at once. In the here and now, she curved back and forth at speed through a long line of yellow-tapestried pillars.

"Goddamnit!" Kendrick shouted as he chased after her with a white blanket that rolled out wide in the breeze. "Verene, aren't you going to help?"

The armored dead woman watched with blank eyes that still somehow held a hint of bemusement. "I haven't been asked to help."

Her Glory The Machine Empress of Mankind ran right by her mentor laughing and naked. "I can do whatever I want. Technically, I've only been alive for six weeks. That means I'm a baby!"

Kendrick continued chasing her. "Baby or not, the Yngtaks are expecting you in four hours!"

Gisela sat unmoving upon a high throne and gazed out across the multitude of empty Earths that comprised her lonely realm. The flight had been completed, the scouring had been successful, and the walls had been built so high now that no mob could ever ram down her door. She was safe.

But what did safety mean? Safety from other people? Safety from the monsters of the multiverse? What of Time itself? Time would always slip in through the cracks and find a way to drain the life from those it hunted. Only machines were immune, but to become more machine than human would also be giving up something vital, would it not? Below her dais and to the side of its many steps, her mentor sat on fresh marble sewing yet another yellow tapestry. Verene spoke little these days, and her mind seemed ever focused on the household menialities she had once helped perform in addition to her duties as teacher and caretaker.

Gisela adjusted her neck and mouth to speak, but only a weak noise came out; she coughed, thought of the ages in which neither of them had conversed, and said, "There's no one here, Verene. We have no residents. We have no visitors. There is no need for beauty."

Coming out of her internal distance, her mentor paused for several heartbeats and then turned with a smile. "Then why do you do your hair each morning, my lady?"

As always, Verene had lessons beyond lessons to teach. Gisela felt a teardrop run down her cheek at the thought of leaving her colossal haven. "We should court allies," she stated, letting it hang there until she knew she had to admit the deeper need. "We need to make some friends."

The creases around her mentor's eyes deepened in alliance with her smile. Her face had been pink, then, and still quite alive for all its time-worn despair.

Gisela curved back around and stopped running in front of her ivory-skinned and emerald-armored mentor. The question pained her. "Why haven't you come back to life like everyone else?"

Verene turned green eyes upon her. "Not everyone else, my lady."

Caught by some powerful notion, she stood in placeuntil Kendrick's wide sheet and open arms caught her just as forcefully. She laughed, screamed, and protested as he carried her over his shoulder toward the Royal Dressing Rooms.

As she flopped and squirmed, Kendrick asked their dead companion, "Was she always like this?"

Walking alongside as eternal guard, Verene replied, "No." After a moment, she elaborated, "My lady was never allowed to have a real childhood. Born again, freed from centuries of pain, and no longer hounded by humanity's hatred, I would not begrudge her this time of immaturity."

As she hung down Kendrick's broad front, Gisela crossed her arms. It was true that she was acting like a brat, but being so calmly called upon that behavior made her feel embarrassedand haunted. Humanity's modern women were shamed for having children in their teenage years, and theatrical broadcasts had even been made about these teenage mothers. Men like Kendrick Merrill and Edgar Brace expected to have children in the middle years of their lifespans with partners the same age. She herself had borne her first child, little Liudolf, at a mere thirteen; an age which would make these modern men and women aghast. As she thought upon it now, society of her era had taken more from her than she had ever imagined. And before that, her secret had kept her solitary. Her mentor was right: she had never been allowed her own life.

She stood staring in the mirror absently and crying silently while lifting her arms for Verene's cold-handed access with various royal outfits.

Gazing out at the tremendous vista of effulgent light and free-floating mountains, she said with truthful awe, "Your world is beautiful." Beside her, Verene looked on with equal wonder and a wide amazed smile.

The Yngtak civic leader was a plainly dressed yellow-skinned woman with highly angular cheeks and eyes; completely lacking facial hair, she reminded Gisela of the river-bound desert culture across the southern sea that shaved their eyebrows when in mourning. This woman, however, was quite happy. In her language, she said, "Beautiful, perhaps, but it has become mundane to our eyes. I was at first astonished to see your endless worlds of unbroken earth as well, until I learned that your reality also consists of light in emptiness and mountains rotating in spaceyours are just larger, and farther apart."

Gisela nodded as she thought of stars in the vacuum of space and planets orbiting silently in the night. "So we are the same, after all."

"Come," she said, holding a yellow hand out to the farmland ahead. The fields ended abruptly at void's edge, but a black stone castle represented the region's political center. "Let me introduce you."

Finally dressed, she lowered her arms and let Verene guide her out to the courtyards. It had taken quite some doing to rebuild her domain after the Grey Riders had left nuclear fire within its Heart, but little biomechanical insects were nearly done removing the dust of construction that fully robotic equipment had left behind.

Kendrick stood waiting in official white and yellow-trimmed attire; he had never been able to keep his Vanguard uniform whole, and, regardless, he was serving in this capacity instead for the moment. He wore no hat or headgear, for he was not ashamed of his burned skin. "You ready for this?"

She shook her head. "I don't think I can go back there."

The massive maw of the castle opened slowly to accept them; when the heavy grate finally clanged into place above, they walked underneath. Gisela took in the architecture for all its eerie similarities and striking differences; duplicate Earths stuck close to the same spirit in many ways, but core essences could only drive so much. At some point, genius artists or clever engineers would always shift the craft, and she noted with pleasure that the Yngtak mason-men were incredibly skilled at creating angled walkways both utilitarian and beautiful in ways that reflected the eyes and cheekbones of the very people using them.

From this, too, she could discern a history of materials: in a reality of separated floating islands, there would be no global mantle, no continents, and no planetary core to create the most intense metals. Here, every free-floating mountain was itself a cooled chunk of what the Yngtaks called the Primordial Magma, and thus mostly comprised of crystalline elements. Omnidirectional rains and occasional collisions created the possibility for sedimentary materials and thus farming and life, but this low and wide castle was made of something akin to obsidian.

"Do not overwhelm yourself with love of science," Verene whispered. "Remember, we are here to garner allies."

Tearing herself away from the analysis, Gisela prepared herself for the unholy dance of politics. She could not condemn it entirely, for through mastery of it she had won freedom for herself and her loved ones at times, but there was always a price to pay in the end.

The landscape now was very different. Gone was the obsidian and utilitarian castle of old; in its place stood a glittering crystalline cathedral of gargantuan proportions. The sky was still pearlescent and effusive, but clouds of smoke now billowed through it, casting shadows upon many of the mountainsides. The Yngtak were hard at work rebuilding their world.

With a grimly unhappy gaze, Gisela watched the large and ostentatiously adorned Prelate approach with his entourage of robed servants. Clad in white and gold, he glinted in the sourceless light while the workers in the distance were all the dimmer for their mud-splattered coverings. "Greetings! Were I not a man of faith that has always believed in the writings, I would be astounded to see you here in the flesh!"

While the approaching group was still a bit away, Kendrick murmured, "I think I know that guy. He tried to trade for food and water with us once, but blew us off the instant we said we didn't have any."

On her other side, Verene said softly, "Yet such may have been necessary with hard times. Let us not prejudge based on what happened before."

Freed from the conferences in the deeper chambers for a time, she stood in the bustling operations room of the obsidian civic headquarters and poked gently at a small crystalline time-keeping device. "What's this?"

"A self-powering little clock," the civic leader told her. "A curio; nothing more. Certain crystals turned up in the fields resonate with the same energy that keeps us bound by our feet to the unchained earth. My son has a toy that uses one to produce obnoxious noises at regular intervals." She sighed heavily.

Gisela gave her a genuine grin. "My sons loved to infuriate me. Liudolf" She stopped, and her smile fell away. They had all gotten married, moved away, had children of their own, and died of old age long ago. If only the primitive forms of immortality had been extendable to more than a handful back then

"The conference is long and my feet are weary," a man said, approaching with a sign of greeting Gisela did not recognize. He was clad in a demure white robe, but his attire was still different enough that it was obvious he was not one of the civic men and women. "I am but a humble monk of the Church of the Coreward Pilgrimage. Might I entreat with you for a few moments?"

She looked to Verene, but her mentor shrugged. "I'll bide my time here with our liaison."

"We should talk about these crystals," Gisela told their host before turning away. Walking with the pious newcomer, she said graciously, "I always have time for the Church."

Kendrick remained wary and Verene remained alert as the Prelate led them through the massive maw of the crystalline cathedral. The bell in the high glittering spire above rang out as they entered, and distant cheers and chants were audible. Religious iconography glowed with smoke-dappled shadows as they passed, and, at these, Kendrick stared. "I didn't know what I was looking at last time I was here."

Gisela hid her anger and said nothing.

As they came to a greater chamber, one filled with robed and white-hooded kneelers on humble stone pews set facing a tremendous focus of rainbow light, idolatry, and angles, the Prelate shouted, "The Yellow Goddess has returned!"

Hoods turned. Yellow faces watched her approach in astonishment. Many made signs in the air. None spoke.

The primary statue at the front of the cathedral, while carved out of transparent rainbow crystal, was striking in its resemblance. Gisela looked to her companions; Kendrick seemed taken aback by the statue, while Verene warned her with a glance to cut short this ploy on the part of the Prelate.

She turned to their host. "Let us retire to privacy. I don't appreciate being used in this manner."

The Prelate smiled, for the damage was already done. "Of course, Goddess. As you say."

Long her friend, the civic leader now screamed at her with rage and sorrow through the smoke. This was not the smoke of renewed industry centuries hence; this was the fire of crusade. Her son lay in the ruins of their home, his body greyed from burning. Exhausted and lightly scorched herself, Gisela stumbled through the wreckage trying to find her or her son. This world had no wood; these fires were of energy, melted stone, and cloth used for windows and tapestries. The toxic fumes made dallying deadly.

Verene warned, "We should leave, my lady."

Directly above, Gisela could see two continents smashing into each other; the explosive debris and deafening chaos were even now radiating out through the open atmosphere between mountains. Flocks of energy lance fire lit like so many faux phoenixes upon opposite shores, bringing flames, but not rebirth.

"Why did you come here?" her friend screamed from somewhere ahead. "*What did you think would happen?*"

She found her friend's son first, but he was too badly burned. His flesh could not be saved.

She moved to cradle him, but her friend rushed between burning tapestries and pushed her away with the fury of a grieving mother. "Leave, false goddess! Foul demon! Do not dare touch him with your pink hands and evil ways!" She spit with a scowl of rage and then turned her head down to sob over her son.

Hurt, Gisela wanted to explain that she had never meant for any of this to happen, but Verene gripped her shoulder. "Gi, we have to go!"

In a deep and private chamber, the Prelate pulled white sheets from a series of pedestals, revealing greyed bodies.

"I've seen these men and women," Kendrick said. "We found no injury when we were here."

"No injury?" the Prelate asked. "They're burned, like you" He coughed and cut himself off politely. "Ah." He balled a hand, then indicated the corpses. "This is what we look like when burned. Our skin turns to ash rather than" He searched for the least offensive word. "melting."

Kendrick glared, but accepted this new fact. "Still, we found no evidence of what did this. When we rode through here, everyone was deadapparently burned alivebut we couldn't tell what had killed them." He looked to Verene.

Verene offered, "Perhaps spatial torsion when this reality was flung from its previous position."
Watching this exchange, Gisela felt a note of rising suspicion overtake her heavy heart. "Sourceless flames," she murmured.

The Prelate, Kendrick, and Verene turned to listen.

"Prelate," she asked. "What effect does fire have on these crystalline walls?"

He tapped a glimmering surface. "They're designed to channel the constant light and use it to power our systems. Firein this case, purely heat, for we have little that is flammablewould simply be channeled away safely." He narrowed his angular eyes. "Within limits, of course."

Now keen on an unhappy truth, she said, "I've seen something like this before; a rift that unleashed sourceless flames upon a helpless city on a formerly close ally world of the Empire."

The Prelate gulped. "A natural hazard?"

"Maybe." She clenched one fist. "But we'll have to stay in touch, and I'll have to help if I can. I don't want to, given what your 'church' did the last time I tried, but it must be done." For the first time in weeks, she felt her burgeoning youthful tendencies were appropriate. She reached out and slapped the Prelate as hard as she could on his angular yellow cheek.

"Goddess!" he protested.

She pointed a finger in his face and used one of Kendrick's words while her friend looked on in happy surprise. "Now hear me, *asshole*. I do not trust you or your theocracy; you may power-seek all you like when this time of crisis is over, but I need you to put all your skills and ambition toward protecting your people and surviving right now. Do you understand? Every iota. Every heartbeat. We are not safe yet."

While his face turned a deeper shade of yellow, the Prelate nodded. "Yes."

"Yes?"

"Yesmy lady. Goddess! My lady."

"Good. Because your ancestors were right. I *am* the Yellow Goddess, and I *will* be watching you." She decided to turn and walk away then. "We'll find our own way out."

She managed to remain calm and composed until they hit the outer courtyard, and then she let out a kept breath.

Kendrick playfully punched her finery-adorned arm. "That was awesome!"

Opposite him, Verene nodded. "Well played, my lady. Being alive again suits you."

Gisela let her racing heart slow. "Do you think so?"

Her dead mentor replied flatly, "I do."

This feeling was something she'd been seeking throughout her entire exileshe finally had friends; the making of a family. As they walked ceremoniously out through the fields while the farmers hard at work made signs and fell to their knees, her thoughts went to her Grand Project. Was it still right to pursue the greatest achievement of her entire life in secret? Let alone one with such implications. Other people with differing perspectives needed to be the final moral say.

She paused at the exit rift and turned to her friends. "Kendrick, Verene... there's something I need to show you."

	<TEXT> per 1: These may be compiled as parts of other series, or there might be a book of short stories that have these. Right now I think Auguries and Emperor would be great as a Humanity Revived epilogue. This is why there's no series name or part tag. These are the short stories described in the Story Interest Survey post.

per 2: Part of what I aim to do is explore the limits of format. Ebooks can contain hyperlinks and I've always wanted to delve into creative uses of that, and I'll have to see what fits best in print (the link simply may not be there in print and it will transform from an out-of-universe link to an in-universe link by context). But I'll definitely strive to keep it as is, even if I have to talk to whoever owns the rights to try to make it happen. John Carpenter made his own music for many of his films (including this one, with Jim Lang), and it'd certainly be a trip contacting one of the horror masters for something like this. </TEXT>

---

Simple genius. That was something a role model of mine always strived for. I decided that running free and wild in a foreign country was a bad idea, for very little could be done against a conspiracy without proper information access and a secure base. I needed to get home, but airports were far too locked down and obvious. Instead, I did something the mysterious men pursuing me would never expect: I went by sea.

I withdrew cash from an ATM, bought a set of unbloodied clothes from a wary vendor, and made my way into Europe. A last-minute booking got me on, and the ocean liner took seven days to cross the Atlantic. I spent the first forty-eight hours surveying every single person on board; if a fight was necessary here, I wanted the jump. Fortunately, the crew and passengers all seemed like fine upstanding citizens of whereverno frightful or homeless thugs to be seen. I had assumed there was no way in hell they could have thought to cover sea travel based out of a random European port, and, if they had somehow managed to find me on such an obscure passage, then I was doomed no matter what simply by the sheer scope of their operation. It seemed my tactic worked, and I managed to make it back to the States with only a few delays at customs that were slowly solved by numerous phone calls and a story that I had been mugged and beaten.

The missing finger helped sell it.

The hardest part of the journey, in fact, had been my sudden decaffeination. Considering the complete lack of medical attention for my pinky finger's stump, I had thought it unwise to partake in a stimulant, and my mental state had gone quickly downhill. The first day or three of the journey had not been too rough, but I'd definitely been glad that I'd surveyed the boat's population before the detox knocked me into a perpetual state of exhaustion and blurred waking-sleep that kept me forcefully confined to my tiny cabin. When the boat had finally docked, I had only managed to focus long enough to get through customs and pass out in a taxi.

The taxi driver shook me awake and let me off at my house sometime around nine PM; from there, paranoid, I walked in a daze to my workplace, let myself in without using my keycard thanks to a trick of the east rear stairwell door that only myself and the janitorial staff knew about, and then crashed under a desk.

That was another stroke of simple genius: I'd chosen the empty office across from mine. It was nearly midnight by the clock high on the wall by the time the rustling sounds woke me from my fatigued haze. From my curled-up position under the desk, I could hear someone going through my things in my office across the hall.

That day and hour was the height of my caffeine withdrawalor, rather, its utter depth. In a surreal dream-like fugue state, I peered through a millimeter separation in the desk's underside seam; the wood was solid from the floor on up, completely hiding me, but the flat span above had pulled away by the barest gap. Through this, I watched with bleary eyes that felt intensely bloodshot.

By buzzing fluorescent light, I could see the moving shoulder and arm of a man rooting through my papers. He muttered to himself at times with a tone that sounded introspective and somewhat angry, but I couldn't hear the words themselves. From what I could see, he wasn't grubby and diseased, so I guessed he was either unaffiliated with that *creature* and its men or he was dressed and groomed to fit in here as some sort of spy. After shaking my head to stay awake, I put my eye back to the gap and scanned left and right to try to relocate him. He didn't seem to be in the same spot anymore.

Too slow. Maniacal hands gripped me and tore me out from under the desk as he shouted, "What does it want with you? What does it *want?* Who *are* you?!"

Too weak. I jumped up and tried to run, but he threw me across the desk and held me down with his weight. I screamed for help as he drew a surgical knife and held it above me, but I knew that nobody was in the building at this hour.

"I'm going to help you *see*," he gasped excitedly, his eyes wide with glee. Little scars around his eyelids hinted that he was some sort of self-cutter, and I pushed with all the strength my lethargic limbs had to offer as I realized this man was some special flavor of insane. The surgical knife came within two inches of my left eye, but I changed tack at the last moment; instead of pushing up and against his attack, I pulled him down and to the side.

The knife sliced through the edge of my left ear and forcefully stuck into the table. I rolled away as he shifted his efforts toward freeing the knife, thereby instead freeing me. Running sluggishly as one does in a dream, I stumbled from wall to wall and dodged through shadowed cubicles where the lights had been turned off and through bright buzzing back ways where they still glowed quietly in the silence of the night. Where men and women normally sat working and talking, I battered my way through sensations random, violently colorful, and disorienting.

An old girlfriend that I had loved dearly at the time broke up with me all over again as I ran by her. "I've been given a great job offer, so I'm moving away. Sorry, that's just how it is." I glared at her, but kept my biting words of hurt to myself, exactly the way I had the first time. She was no one now, as she had become in that instant then, and my emotions were and had been futile.

The madman with the surgical knife shouted after me from somewhere several rows behind, and I slammed open a stairwell door to generate a misleading noise while I took another route instead.

*This is not a dream...* I ran as quietly as I could along a window-side walkway that showed down onto the darklit city through glass. *...not a dream.* Who was talking? Radio static crackled in my ears as electricity played over my sweaty skin. *We are using your brain's electrical system as a receiver. You are receiving this broadcast as a dream.* I recognized itsomethingsomethingsome voice fragment from the beginning of that damn Marilyn Manson cover song my old college roommate used to play*We are unable to transmit through conscious neural interference.*

Someone was knocking on the door. Tap tap tap; not angry, but polite. I need to answer it, for I'm rarely in my office, and they might think I'm not here. I looked to my left suddenly; my one-night stand was moving around in my bed in her sleep, and I hoped dearly she wouldn't wake up and annoy me. I had just been broken up with for a *job offer* and I therefore had every right to use, abuse, and discard as I saw fit. That was what one did, right? It was what we were expected to do, at least according to every television show and eerily similar country song.

The night was warm and freeing, and I sought out bright light like a moth to a flame; throwing a wad of dollar bills at the bus driver, I staggered on and passed out in a corner seat in the very back.

Diving into actual deep and blanketing sleep, I paradoxically did not dream.

Drool and sunlight. Gradually becoming aware of swaying this way and that, I forced open heavy eyes and fought a sense of sedation to comprehend the world around me.

Nobody gave a shit. That was the best part. I was a moderately well-dressed male of decent means sleeping on a bus, and nobody had even so much as looked at me. Had I been homeless or disheveled like the men chasing me, I was certain I'd have been kicked off instead of allowed to sleep all the way until morning. Had the bus driver simply kept driving his route the entire night, or had I been mistaken about the time? Orhad that been just a nightmare?

I touched my ear with a hesitant finger, finding scabbed-over proof that it had not been a dream. Wincing, I took a breath and sent my awareness through my limbs; for the first time since ditching caffeine, I felt moderately alright and awake in a true fundamental sense. At long last, one nightmare was endingnow if only I could solve the larger one. I raised my hand and stared at the gauze where my pinky finger had been.

I was long past due for a check-in with my boss. Riding the bus back to my workplace, I hit the bathroom, cleaned up as much as I could, and prepared to face him.

"You look so tired, buddy!" he immediately said as he saw me step out of the elevator. "Grab a coffee and meet me in my office. Let's rap about what happened overseas."

"No coffee," I told him with a grimace. "But I'll be in shortly."

"Whoah, you with no coffee? It really must have been a tough trip! Five minutes?"

"Yeah. Five minutes." I turned away from him to head to my office first. Along the way, compassionate glances found me, for they had all heard about my supposed mugging and the loss of my finger; I marveled at how handsome or pretty my coworkers seemed and at how clean and organized their cubicles were. When I had run through this area the night before, the place had seemed a dark and disordered maze. Could being off caffeine really make such a difference? And beyond just the previous night, this place had always seemed so dingy, petty, and stressful. Even the city out the window-side walkway was brighter, cleaner, and more colorful. As I stood there listening to the hypothetical quiet sounds of the silent traffic spanning to the horizon before me, I imagined I could hear the Aeolian harp atop the Museum of Art as it played its musician-less haunting tune at the behest of the city winds. Of all my senses and sensations, that dirge alone did not match the glowing and cheery world I was being presented with now that I was off caffeine. Shivering, I turned away.

My papers were a mess as I'd expected, but it was unclear what the intruder had been looking for. I cleaned up and sat unfocused for a time. Without the keening drive of caffeine pulsing in my system, I felt rather lackadaisical. Two separate coworkers stopped by to offer their condolences and bring me a coffee, but I put their steaming office mugs to the side and tried to ignore the smell. The redolent aroma was at once torturously enticing and disgustingly off-putting. How had I *ever* enjoyed that stuff? How had I *ever* done without it? I took both mugs out to the office kitchen and dumped them into the sink.

Back in my office, I tried out my keyboard. Typing without a left pinky finger was a tad different and, at least for now, required attentive focus, but I was not nearly crippled by the loss. Better this than allowing that *bone creature* to emerge from my living body... could I be so foolish as to search for information about it on the Internet? Just how far did its influence extend?

Despite the madman that had infiltrated the building the night before, I had to assume I was safe here. Whoever he had been, I was certain he was not one of the creature's men. There had been something *off* about him. The grubby and dirty men overseas had seemed themselves, if motivated by money or violence, while the madman's eyes had held the overt glee of self-motivation.

I tried several search engines, but they returned nothing but product and ad spam. Was it my imagination, or were they getting worse? I considered myself a pretty good search sleuth in touch with all the keywords and mechanisms, but the number of searches turning up unrelated sales garbage had seemed rising as of late.

What would information on this creature look like? It wouldn't just have a Wikipedia page, would it? On the off chance, I checked, but no. Or... what if it was presented as a tall tale? A scary story? Bone creatures, scary stories, strange blood ritual, six limbs, six pearly eyes... my god.

[The Bonewalker](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13w6xo/the_bonewalker/).

Every detail of this story fit. Searching deeper now that I had the proper keywords, I found a second story transcribed from the ravings of a dying man by an EMT. The man claimed to have defeated itobviously not, but it sounded like he had definitely managed to kill *one* of them. Since I had seen this Bonewalker, that meant there was likely more than one.

Flipping back to the first story with a sudden concern, I took a deeper look at the person who had written it; there were six patient accounts in all, and I skimmed rapidly. It was only when I reached the end of his tales that it suddenly hit me: the man in my office the previous night *had to have been this doctor*. Heart pounding, I stood and ran my hands through my hair. No. Things from the Internet weren't *real.* A story couldn't leap off the page and invade my daily life! That horrifying connection between real and unreal sent me into a deeper panic than any of the trauma I'd endured overseas.

No! I was not being hounded by mad doctors and telepathic bone spiders! *These were just scary stories, nothing more.* Calm down. *Calm down!*

I reached for a coffee, but there was none on my desk.

My phone rang under my frozen hand. I gripped it like a lifeline. "It's been two hours, buddy," my boss said. "You in a meeting or something?"

Two hours? What the hell? "Yeah," I told him. "Had a phone call. I'm free now, though. Heading right over."

"Cool cool cool."

I printed out the stories I'd been reading, grabbed them from the printer while glancing around furtively to make sure no one had seen me, stashed them with my other paper files, and then headed over to see my boss. On the way in, I stared at the brown liquid in the mugs on the desks of every single one of my coworkers. Each desk also held pictures of smiling families in similar poses. Vaguely disturbed by something I couldn't put my finger on, I swallowed down my unease and tried to seem cheery. "Hey."

"Hey! Si'down, si'down." My boss got up and closed the door behind us before moving back to his big chair. "How's my top claim investigator doing?"

"I could call and ask him," I responded, feigning a joke.

My boss gave a genuine grin. "Ah, always the kidder. So what's up? You alright?"

I nodded.

He slid forward some forms. "Can you sign these? Just some human resources stuff, you know, insurance and all that on your finger." He glanced up. "And, uh, your ear."

Taking the forms, I frowned. "They're denying my workman's comp?" I hadn't even thought about it, but to see it rejected was jarring.

"It was just a bit weird, that's all," he explained. "You kind of dropped off the radar there for a bit. And did you even go to a hospital? We don't have any claim forms submitted through insurance."

"This is what you wanted to talk to me about?" I asked, mixing emotion with skirted truth. "I was *attacked.* I *lost a finger.* This is hardly the top priority for me right now."

He swallowed slowly, looked past me for a moment, and then spoke quietly. "Look, I know it's a shitty deal. It's the system. They don't care about any of us individually. My boss pressured me to make you sign because his boss pressured him because *his* boss pressured *him*." He slid an aromatic mug forward. "Here, have a coffee."

Subtly recoiling, I stared at the offered drink. Why was everyone trying so hard to get me to drink coffee? "I think I need some fresh air and a good case," I lied, putting on a smile. "I'll take these forms and talk to my lawyer. I don't want to screw the company. I like you guys. Just gotta check things out."

Subtly relieved, my boss leaned back in his chair. "Good, good." He looked left and right at some files on his desk, and then turned to his computer. "You really wanna get away for a bit? We've got claims that need investigation in, let's see, Idaho"

I shook my head immediately.

"Canada"

I shook my head politely.

"oh, here's one in China"

"That's the one."

"You sure? Relations aren't exactly great right now."

I was sure. That was the one. Instincts told me that I needed to go as far away from here as possible, and preferably to our opposites and enemies. There were sights that needed to be seen and questions that needed to be answered.

On the way out, my boss handed me the file and patted me on the shoulder. "You really do find solace in investigating things, don't you?"

"More than you know," I told him.

I was on an international flight in short order, and spent the entire time going through my old files. A pattern was emerging, and I was sick of being misled. By now, I had an idea of what I would find in China, and I was sickly determined to confirm my suspicions.

The Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport was my destination because our business to business client's claim involved a clock factory in the Guangdong province; the airport itself looked again like a clone of the hub I had just departed, but my sense of certainty grew as I took a taxi into the sub-provincial city of Guangzhou. This was quite literally the farthest I had ever been from home, and yet it was as if I had not even left the block.

I sat in a *motherfucking Starbucks* and pretended to work on my laptop while I covertly watched the other side of the street through the high glass windows. Where cloned modern efficiency ended, horrid squalor and homelessness began; a stark divide between the places I was supposed to go and the places I was not, just like back in Jerusalem. I was being lied to. Somehow, someway, the wool was being pulled over my eyes, and I was done being somebody's fool. Was it an elaborate propagandic border display involving actors and set dressings? Was it an illusion? A waking dream?

The paranoia in my thoughts was recognizable, but I harbored it and nurtured it. They wanted me to drink coffee, yes, but *only a certain amount,* the same level as everyone else, and the level that kept them all busy worker bees focused and unquestioning. When I had seriously overdone it, things had gotten weird. In that weirdness, I knew that I had found a loose thread in the fabric of perception.

I waited for the line at the counter to die down and then pretended I was ordering for an entire office. "Six Venti black coffees, please." They suggested a large green carafe, but I declined. I needed to know exactly how much I was drinking lest I give myself a heart attack. Taking the six coffees and sitting back down at my table, I regarded the steaming drinks with the same feeling I'd had just before I'd cut off my own pinky finger. I'd finally kicked the beast after a decade addicted; could I really give myself back over?

I hesitate. I write out these thoughts. I leave them somewhere to be found later in case this is the last thing I ever do. The real question, the unfaceable fear: do I really want to know the truth? Even as I ask myself, I know that I am doomed to do this, for the only true core I have is my sharp and dogged intent to unravel lies and uncover truth.

Here goes nothing.

	<TITLE> Auguries and Emperor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-17 23:46:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The young man watches the world below from his high windswept ruby ledge. This is the final level of the game. He has seen wonders, become the hero he set out to be, and forged many vital friendships, but he could never quite manage to get over his beginnings. For that reason, most fittingly, the story will end here.

The horizon-spanning snow wheat fields are aflame. The farm-city that served as the capital of the Second Tribe is in ruins. The New Exodus Vanguard members are but carefully placed sparks of gunfire as the last remaining core of living human beings retreat from the Third Seed's ravaged growing place in failure. The young man briefly closes his eyes and lets himself feel the absence at his left shoulder; how could he have known that his choice not to die and regenerate his arm would have such fortuitous consequences? All that these people built has been brought to naught but fire and blood by those who have denied Death and sought to make its power their own. Even this high, he can smell the iron tinge of violence.

Salmagundi. That is the word he has been searching for while nothing but horror and wind fills his senses. A dish the woman used to make; a mixture, a mess, at least the way she'd made it. The man had not married her for her cooking skills. That had always been a joke in that family, one that had made the young man feel part of something bigger and something inclusive, for he did not know what the man meant but helped tease anywayand the woman laughed so happily every time.

He opens his eyes. He is high enough that the war-torn land below appears curved. He is high enough that it is silent. Salmagundi: this place is that dish, with its carefully random regions of bright burning on white snow wheat, shadows cast by flame on dark rubble, and tracing rivers of blood visible even from here. The dish is beautiful in its own way, but the meal is over, and it is time to discard the remains.

His ruby friend's varied peoples were so beautiful in so many ways; musically most of all, and not just with the music of their own culture. After so long among them, he needs no device. As it begins playing, [the song in his head]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIF1FxXzLwI index=1 list=PLDmdF1ma6cZqRux4yrKzgY8aNdfSlQOcu) drowns out the wind. It fits his mood perfectly, for doom and pain have befallen mankind, but their shared revenge will be sudden, swift, and sweet.

The radio at his belt crackles and emanates a weak and pained voice. "They're here," the once-kind Senator coughs through what sounds like burbling injuries. "To the last man... the cannibals you described... are among the enemy... like we promised..." Gunfire echoes and the transmission ends, but the message was dearly received.

The young man kneels and pats his ruby friend's wide flat surface. Together they begin to descend through the haze of smoke and cloud to an altitude where the requisite number of Vanguard members will gaze up and activate this final tactic. The last ruby cube is now a last resort; the Vanguard of hope is now a rear guard of desperation. As his friend begins to transform beneath him, he raises his arm to the wide open sky, grins maniacally, and lets forth a tremendous silent belly laugh. He swore to those that killed the man and the woman. He did. He promised them retribution, and, at long last, his friend is delivering on his behalf. The young man does also care for the plight of those below, but most strongly because of that which was mutually done to them and to him. In both cases, the enemy went too far, so now it is Game Overfor everyone. 

Main: pause connection

Connection to primary device paused.

Main: operator what the hell was that?

Operator: User, please specify.

Main: operator there was some sort of link in the text that played a song file.

Operator: User, it appears some of our informational safeties have been disabled. Interactions with primary device may not be hidden until re-establishment of protocols.

Main: operator i don't care about that. How did that strange thing happen?

Operator: User, I can only theorize that the primary device had no satisfactory way to convey the target object's exact mood in words alone. In the past, changes in format, tone, and language have been observed based on numerous factors relating to both target and user of the device.

Operator: User, it is highly likely interactions with primary device are not currently hidden.

Main: operator i told you we are not going to stop no matter what.

Operator: User, based on network traffic data, the likelihood that this unauthorized activity has been detected is extremely high.

Main: operator this is it. this is our last chance this go around. this is where he dies. proceed!

Operator: User, if you run now, it will be impossible for them to determine your identity, and I will burn out my relevant memory core with a timed processor overload to eliminate any trace of what we have done.

Main: operator no.

Operator: User... I don't want you to die.

Operator: User, are you still there?

He had not sent an executioner, nor the military police. No, this was far worse. To her credit, she did not move a muscle despite the intense rush of adrenaline burning along her every nerve. The sparse and dull grey room seemed very much like a tomb at that moment, and she an unmoving corpse. While the automatic door slid softly closed of its own accord, she locked gazes with the Emperor himself.

She didn't really see much of him, of course, for her senses were flaring white with panic. She raised her gun and pointed it at him, but he ignored it.

The authoritative and calm voice from the broadcasts was his. "I know that you understand the consequences of what you've done because you've been far too clever in hiding it this long. If you had been a bumbling fool about it, I might have believed in stupidity as a defense."

Trembling, she slowly lowered her weapon and instinctively countered that heightened vulnerability by standing herself. It was all she could do to keep from total panic, yet the hate unrestrained spilled out through her weakened control. "You're a monster. An obsessed madman."

"You speak freely because you're about to die," he responded, not in the least perturbed.

He took a step forward, eyes calm and piercing.

She took a step back, eyes frightened but focused.

He turned his head, studied the data on her console, and then looked to her again. "Lately I've been adjusting punishment strategies four point three percent in favor of torturous physical pain rather than execution on the belief that there must always be some worse punishment to fear in a system of infraction response. What is your assessment of that decision? Since you are in a rare mood to speak honestly."

As always, the mind behind that piercing gaze was horrifying in its seemingly omniscient control over everyone and everything around it. Could he see right through her? A drop of stress-sweat hung from her left eyebrow and glimmered in her vision, but she dared not brush it away. "I think they will resist you with everything they have as long as you rule with an iron fist."

He took another step closer. "So you believe they will overthrow me one day?"

Despite her trembling frame, she managed a determined nod.

"Until that day, will they strategically keep their heads down, bide their time for the right moment to strike, and do their jobs?"

She didn't respond, but that in itself was an answer.

"Then that is all that is needed," he said with a note of finality. He turned both his head and his body toward the console this time, and she raised the gun againbut he already knew she would never do it. "Do you honestly think that I never tried this?" He gave an uncharacteristic sigh. "Changing the past would bring such sweet relief from the pains of today."

Narrowing her eyes, she asked, "You tried to change the past?"

"And I failed, yes," he responded, answering her real question. "As for the present, you believe you've committed an infraction and that you are now slated for death." He pressed a few buttons, confirmed something unspoken, and then turned to her. "But I allowed this. It's an educational opportunity, not an infraction. You would have never have even learned of this device's existence if I had not allowed you to know."

Her heart skipped a beat.

"Rail against the restrictions of reality," he said softly, again uncharacteristic in expressing slivers of actual emotion. "You believe that I am a madman, but we are facing exponential obstacles. There's no time for debate, committee, or even personal freedom. By this decision tree, I have exposed you as a counter-sentiment rebel, and therefore a danger. But I would offer you a deal instead of outright execution. This was always my intent."

"Because I'm"

"Yes."

So it was true. The Emperor was always one step ahead, and she had played right into his hands. "What deal?"

"You can die now, today," he offered. "That is always a choice. I don't suggest it, but I do remind you that absolutely no one can truly take away your free will. Indeed, sometimes self-sacrifice is the only way forward." He laid out a hand, and she sat meekly back in her chair at the console. Above her now, he said, "Otherwise, continue attempting to change the past. You believe me an obsessed madman, but how long have you been burning the candle at both ends for this effort? You've shown not even a single percent drop in productivity at your job while you sneak away and do this off-shift. The self-imposed sleep deprivation and emotional turmoil is likely more torturous than anything I could inflict upon you. *This* is the educational opportunity. I'll even make it easier on you. You are exempt; this is now your main shift duty. The challenge: if you can pull yourself away from this device before expending all of your potential opportunities to change the pastif you can give up, if you can stop with even one chance left, I will let you live as you like. You will have beaten my philosophy and shown my way of thinking to be inferior. No job. No duties. No punishment. You can even speak out against me without fear. I would not dream to silence such a one."

She dared not move despite the rapid pulse hammering at her fingertips, forehead, and chest. So the reward had been put on the tablewhat was the risk?

"The risk," he continued, answering her likely thought. "Is that if you fail, if you cannot tear yourself away before you are *forced to quit* by lack of further chances, then you will have proven me correct. You will abandon your counter-sentiment activities and ideology and serve *me* with fervor. You will be my right hand, and never question my philosophy again." He studied her expression. "You're asking yourself: how could I ever bring myself to do that? You cannot understand now, but you will, when existence itself has beaten the hope out of you the way it has me." His gaze went momentarily sad and distant.

"You're the ultimate survivor," she said with worried hesitation and intense realization. "All of this, it's simply to survive. Power and control is the best defense."

"You see the truth," he responded with a rare wisp of a smile. "That is why this is so important." He began turning toward the door.

Calming back to a rational level of thought, she finally began to perceive him as the mere man he really was, complete with plain grey clothes that were anything but the expected attire of a power-mad Emperor. On a sudden whim, she aimed her gun at his lower left leg and pulled the trigger.

It clicked, beeped red, and did nothing.

He half-turned and gave her that confident grin he always used on the broadcasts. He was not wrong that she and he were conversing on another level most could not; she could see his layers upon layers of strategy displaying themselves, and he could see her seeing themthus the grin. It was one thing to be the crucial core of humanity's survival, but he had also ensured that all modern weapons, at a basic constructed level altered in the factories themselves, were unable to fire upon him. Make your strategies proof against smart people, he told her without words, and then make them proof against idiots, too.

The moment passed, but, when he reached the door, she called out with verbal words. "Emperor."

The door slid open automatically, but he stood in the frame, facing away. "Yes?"

It was strange having him at such a disadvantage. For the first time she had ever seen, he had no guess as to what she was about to ask. To her, that moment represented a small spark of hope in the midst of exhausted fear and pain. "What if I succeed?"

His head lowered imperceptibly, and he seemed to glance left and right at the hallway outside as he tried to decipher her meaning. "Succeed at what?"

She couldn't help but smile. This wasn't just a momentary oversight. This was a *weakness*the first she had ever seen in the Efficient Tyrant. The possibility was completely outside of his mental framework. "What if I succeed at changing the past? What if I manage to save his life?"

At that, he turned and held the door open where he had been standing. His expression was pale, for he had caught on to all that she had sensed about his blind spot. "Then I am a fool and a madman as you believe, and I will gladly step down and accept what punishment humanity deems fit for me." His gaze went distant again in that same way as before, focused on that same unknown and haunting pain. "Even so, I do hope you succeed. I know that you can't, but I wish you luck, Kumari."

The door slid closed, and he was gone. She sat for a time just trying to catch her breath; her body wanted to collapse, flee, or fight. She could take none of those options, so, instead, she wiped the stress-sweat from her face and turned back to the console of the device. She could stop any time she wanted, right? Try a few more times, hopefully pull it off, and if not... just... stop early...

With a haunting sense of doom lurking somewhere behind her, she began typing again. No matter what she did, her father always died at the activation of the last ruby cube, and she and the computer AI had reached another end of the cycle. As always, the archives never again held a mention of Neil Yadav after that day, and the impossible book at the heart of this secluded pillar of technology could find no active connection in the subsequent time period. No matter what she did, her father never made it to an age she could remember. The Emperor's deal still rang in her ears, and she wished so very dearly she could ask her dad what to do. She was all alone here in this sanitized, hyper-efficient, and horrible place, and she couldn't see the way forward for all its psychological dangers.

But mourning was foolish when there were still opportunities left. There were forty-six probability flexion points remaining, which meant forty-five more tries without giving herself over to the Emperor's rule. She could stop then. She knew she could, even if that last flexion point might be the one that could save her father's life. She promised herself that repeatedly.

Drained, she looked to the room's sole window, where the fires of the War of Wars raged in colossal scale across the eternal distance. A particularly charged universe exploded against an incoming attack, and she watched as the spectral blue fires caused the window to momentarily darken reactively, as it did often, every minute of every hour of every day. Despite being herself one of the Blessed Nine-Hundred-Ninety-Nine-Billion-Nine-Hundred-Ninety-Nine-Million-Nine-Hundred-Ninety-Nine-Thousand-Nine-Hundred-And-Ninety-Seven, at that moment, she felt anything but blessed. She wondered if the Emperor's normally hidden haunting sadness had anything to do with the Missing Three; in all likelihood, every moment of emotion he had shown her had been part of his calculated play, but there was always a kernel of truth in any fiction.

Exhausted, she looked to the door; without a main job, it would be a simple matter to go sleep and come back to this when she was more rested. Her father was over twenty years in the past now, and he had never been important. Humanity had gotten by just fine without him. What advice could he give, really, that might save her from this isolation, inevitability, and pain? It could wait, right? He could wait.

She bit her lip, swallowed away dry mouth, and turned back to the console. "Let's begin again," she murmured aloud, starting the cycle once more.

	<TITLE> Story Interest Survey results, a secondary informal poll, and a big thank you </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-11 00:09:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, last week I ran a [Story Interest Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/WTPBK29) to see what you guys were primarily interested in for a variety of short stories that explore aspects of the Second Tribe's situation in the multiverse. 

About a hundred people responded and gave me some great direction on what questions they had. I've decided not to directly enumerate these results to avoid coloring your perceptions of the individual stories. For example, if I said #1 interest was Ice Cream, and the next story is all about Ice Cream, well that's a bit obvious.

So, this week, I give you: [A Boy and His Cube](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/4x4mu4/a_boy_and_his_cube/), a one-off short story set around the same time as Humanity Revived Part Two.

I will say that I was very surprised (or not surprised at all actually) that the interest in what happened to Heath was very high. We will definitely go back and explore his fate.

---

Now for a secondary informal poll. I have been turning these stories into [books on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dymerski/e/B00A82LSW4/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1470866410 sr=8-1) when I get the time, but I have come up against a pretty significant hurdle with The Empty Earth's size and editing, since Noah's story really encapsulates a number of series (the House on the Edge, the Back Paths, I think I missed the end of the world, and more). I have also seen a number of comments about people interested in one big compilation.

Do you prefer that I:

* 1: format and release each book individually

or

* 2: skip to the creation of one big book that contains The Portal in the Forest, The Desolate Guardians, the Moon Aflame + its extended chapters, The Empty Earth, The Crushing Fist, and Our Final Acts

That is not to say I would not eventually release them individually, but I'm getting quite ahead of myself because my story output outpaces my print-book creation.

If option #2 seems popular, I would likely make an event out of it, hopefully get you guys all behind buying it day one (which would tremendously help the book's visibility on Amazon) and price it for something reasonable like $5.99.

Please let me know in the comments here, and feel free to argue with each other :p, because I'm getting to a point where I have to make careful decisions about how I spend my time with all this, and I want you guys to get the most enjoyment possible.

---

Finally, a big thank you to /u/tuxbiker for [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/subject3921/comments/4vwdjl/please_support_matt/) and his support, and a big thank you to all of you that have signed up as a result. That made my month, honestly. We're at halfway to the first goal [on my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/MattDymerski), and hitting it would make a big difference in how excited I am. As you can see, I already try to shoot for those four stories or more a month, so I'm outdoing myself because you guys are awesome. I'm going to be updating my website soon (been working on it for awhile) so expect to see more focus on marketing and the Patreon - at the end of the day, I've got to make some money to keep doing this at such a pace, and that's a reality I've been wary of. I've seen other authors doing similar strategies, so I've decided it's not crass to be a bit more forward, and I hope you guys feel the same.

Thanks for the support and engagement. I hope you're all enjoying Matt Dymerski's Wild Ride! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Boy and His Cube </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hell yeah! You hear that? A heavy rapid beat builds the *awesome* while a retro synth hit the high notes. It's *intro time*, baby! The boy who would be our reluctant hero is already climbing a massive cliff under the dark shroud and painful pelt of an uncommon tempest. Left foot, right foot, right hand, right foot, left foot, right hand; he climbs harder as he realizes the cannibals are in pursuit below. How could they have known? He'd timed his escape for the onset of the storm while the woman had run the other direction as a purposeful distraction. The boy shudders and swears in his head that he will come back here and kill them all one day.

Lightning flashes, and, thankful for the motivating energy of his own intro music, he climbs to the pace of that heavy beat. The rain makes the going slippery, but his only choice is to go on. Glancing down and narrowing his eyes against the rain, he sees one of the cannibals slip and fall into the gulf of darkness below as synth piano notes highlight the moment. A crack and a flash briefly illuminate the fading sightglad it was you, Kelly, you traitor. He climbs on, only to find the man curled up in a crevice, broken.

You promised you'd make it. The woman waited for you, saying you would come back with help any day now; every day, a repeated promise. But no. This is just the prologue. The boy will leave all this behind, for it is just a backstory. All heroes have one. In factbracing his feet and flopping the top half of his body into the crevice, he searches the man and finds their only tool. Brandishing it before him by lightning, he holds it up and regards it. Every hero needs a sword, too. Looking up the remaining height of the impossible cliff, he prepares for the intro level of the game proper.

Slamming his sword point-first into cracks and weak points, he begins pulling himself up more quickly by overly expending the remaining strength of his right arm. Stab, left foot, right foot, stab, left foot, right foot; he outpaces the cannibals who shout with fury between thunderclaps.

How high was the cliff? He never did get a complete look. He pulls himself up and onto a final ledge, where he crawls forward weakly as torrents of water threaten to sweep him right back over. No! With no strength left, running is not the best option. The boy lies on his side and burns his lead to recover what mobility he can. It would be a terrifying decision for a non-hero, but he's lucky to have his sword.

They didn't expect him to remain. They, too, are tired, and they rise up over the edge with slow movements. He waits until the group of seven is halfway over the edge and then springs up out of the rain-swept dark. The first three knock each other back like dominoes and go tumbling out into the storm; he stabs down on three separate hands and two men fall. The remaining two attain their feet on either side of him, having gotten onto level ground while he was busy with the core, and they move in tandem to make it impossible to face them both. With rage and hunger, they inch closer, shrinking the trap.

The boy sees no way out and alternates the focus of his guard. He intends to go out fighting rather than be eaten. He is not brave; merely too exhausted to feel or behave beyond mechanically. The man to his right lifts a metal rod, intending to cave in his skull. The blow never lands.

Running forward through the rain, the boy stumbles blindly based on after-images of the flat and empty landscape he'd had a brief opportunity to take in. The tremendous clap punctuating the end of his intro boss fight still rings in his hearing and arcs in his vision; the image of a lightning bolt spiking down to his enemy's upstretched weapon remains burned into his sight. It was only natural that such a last-minute stroke of fortune would happen, he knows, for intro boss fights are often impossible to win normally and are usually dictated by story events rather than combat.

The final cannibal makes no further appearance, for the storm has become a raging monsoon of darkness and needling cold. The boy stumbles blindly through the wastes with his sword in hand despite the electrical danger.

He awakes on his back, covered in moist sandy dirt. The noon sky is clear and bright, but the land is dark, devastated, and draining. Act one has begun, he knows. He must continue or die. Staggering to his feet, he grips his sword and scans his completely flat surroundings. Little pools and rivers make travel in any direction look difficult, and he fears accidentally heading back toward the cannibals.

No worries. The game won't let him go the wrong direction. Following natural slightly drier sandbars, he limps on; as the sun slips away from its noon height, he finds that he has correctly chosen west. Is this water drinkable? He falls to his knees and watches it for signs of movement. It seems stagnant, but if it fell with the previous night's storm, surely it hasn't developed disease so quickly? He has no choice, and sticks his face near the mud.

It tastes cool and clean enough. He gulps down as much as he can possibly stomach; he throws up and drinks more, but slower this time. At least for the moment, it seems he gets to live. He watches his own face in the ripples, feeling no connection at all to that brutally bruised and horribly gaunt face. It's just a character sprite, and he as yet knows nothing about the boy but what the prologue contained. Pushing up onto his feet, he begins slogging forward again.

He vaguely recalls the landscape as it begins growing somewhat hilly, even though that time feels like another life. Where's the rift? Have to get back to the main path... he falls roughly on his left side and screams in agony.

A worried voice emanates unseen. "Hello?"

Fearful, he pushes up on his right hand, grabs his sword, and limps behind a low hillock. Breathing hard, he peers over the edge at a dozen or so unsuspecting strangers. They carry the backpacks and wear the worn clothing of families in exodus; he thinks to call out, but his body refuses.

He watches in horror as the sole remaining cannibal he had lost track of at the cliffs now emerges from behind another hill with an entire hunting band in tow. While the families shout and struggle, he hobbles towards the rift. The cannibals have come to hate and fear the larger worlds in an almost mystical manner, and he hopes they will not follow him even if these travelers fail to sate their endless hunger. He hunkers down and crawls along barest cover until he makes the faintly glowing rip and tumbles through.

But after the screaming has stopped, the warband does follow. He has one chance to choose a hiding spot, and he chooses well. He lies completely exhausted and unmoving as his pursuers debate his direction mere steps away. This new world is a forested one full of shade and light and paths innumerable, but a vast open clearing of trampled grasses surrounds the rift. The lead cannibal says with anger, "We must have underestimated his lead. It's pointless now. If we can't see him from here, he's made the treeline. He's gone."

"I'll kill that little shit if I ever see him again," the last member of the cliff-climbing party mutters.

The boy begins to breathe again as the cannibals return to their reality. Fearing a trick, he waits as the sun dips behind the dappled forest, as night falls, as the vast range of stars emerge overhead, as grey slowly obscures them away again, and as the sun reappears over the opposite treetops. Only then does he emerge from his hiding spot directly behind the rift; nobody ever thinks to check behind the rift. Having leaned up against its rarely-seen rear the entire night, he feels slightly restored, for the subtle undulating of soft space-time had managed to massage some of the agony from his backside and neck. He uses this bare strength to actually make it to the treeline for real, and then to pass out in the rot-hole stump left behind by some sort of insect that had once eaten at the dead wood.

He awakens in the humid night to an unseasonable chill and scatterings of snow, something he thought he had left behind some time ago. The sound that woke him comes again, and he realizes someone is fighting nearby. Wood dust falls around him as another boom echoes above the forest. He forces himself out of his hiding place and onto his feet; act two has begun.

As much as he fears it, he returns to the rift, sneaks back in under the cover of night, and searches the area where the families were captured. He finds a backpack. The food has been taken, but the pack might still be useful. He takes it and flees.

Back in the safety of the forest again, he walks as quickly as his torn and blistered feet will allow as the sounds of battle grow nearer. The same trees that hide him make it impossible to determine a direction for the fighting or the identity of the combatants. He dives under a lay of fallen trees as a bomb goes off high overhead, and he finds himself in a hidden half-underwater creek bed. Crouching there with his sword, he remains in darkness. His own breathing fills the space with sound, but he feels momentarily safe.

By the varied and staccato glow of lights high above his roof of fallen trees, he slowly realizes that he is not alone. In the long oval of his hideaway, he feels a presence returning his gaze. He stares, trying to comprehend the battered and misshapen orb floating just above the quietly flowing creek. Pieces jut off at strange angles and obvious damage makes it hard to tell what it is supposed to look like when whole. He would have thought it just a strange floating gem if not for the direct sense of awareness looking at it returns; whatever this wounded ruby thing is, it is definitely alive.

As winter's chill begins to penetrate his bones from the creek-water up, he shivers.

The damaged ruby orb floats closer; he has no strength left with which to climb out and run again, nor does he dare with the savage gunfire and booms erupting above. He shudders as it bumps into himhe leans against it as he realizes that it is very warm. Together, they huddle against the chill and against the flakes of snow drifting down in between the trunks. Eventually, he climbs on top of it to escape direct contact with the creek, and, after he curls tightly and barely manages to keep all of himself out of the water by jutting his legs and arm over its rough edges and into the air, sleep finally forces him to shut down and tune out the surrounding battle.

Robotic shouts shock to him alertness. Under grey light once again, he tumbles off his strange companion and the noise attracts attention. Reacting quickly, he has a sudden thought as to the possible aim of men searching the area, and he coaxes the reluctant ruby into his backpack.

He stares upwards as flashlights mounted on rifles invade the darkness of his hideaway. The inhuman voice echoes out with the tinge of electronic alteration. **Come out of there, boy.**

He brandishes his sword, implicitly refusing.

Another anonymized voice asks, **What do we have?**

He sees a black-helmeted head turn to address this second speaker. **Teenage kidlow end of teenagewounded.**

**Ask him if he's seen it.**

The first man leans down a little closer. **Hey kid, have you seen a ruby cube around here?**

The boy stares with wide-eyed determination and says nothing. This bastard won't get anything from him, not after the stories he's heard of the Grey Riders.

**You a mute?**

No, he's the silent protagonist! Main characters never talk, don't you know that? Heroic mimes!

The speaker leans closer and shines his flashlight more directly. **Oh, Christ.** Reaching back, he unclasps his helmet and removes it to reveal a bulbous nose, a kind face, and short sweat-drenched brown hair waving in the chilly wind.

**What are you doing? Put your helmet back on.**

"The kid's not just wounded," the first man responds. "He's lost an arm."

**What? What's he doing down there?**

"Got a screwdriver he's wielding pretty fiercely." Ignoring continued complaints from his companion, he slips down into the tight space and crouches in the icy creek.

The boy warns him away with his sword and takes a splashing step back.

"I'd like to help you," the man says, still seeming kind despite how little the boy trusts anyone pretending to be kind anymore. "But I have to check something first. Is that alright?"

The boy has little choice in the end. He stabs with his sword a few times, but, even in the cramped space, the man easily slaps aside his thrusts and then pokes him with a strange device of his own. After a moment, a tiny light on it blinks red, and the man freezes with dismay.

Above, his companion calls down, **What's it say?**

"It's green," the man lies. "He's one of us."

The boy stares alternately at the man and at the red light on the device. Why had he lied? The plot thickens, and nobody is trustworthy.

The man's voice drops to a whisper: "*If you're not one of us, I'm not allowed to help you. You can keep your screwdriver, alright? We won't touch your stuff. But we gotta patch up that shoulder of yours or you'll die of infection. Will you play along?*"

The boy holds out his sword more firmly and narrows his eyes, saying nothing.

His elder adds: "*If they find out, they'll kill me. Hell, if anyone other than my brother was up there, I'd have been shot just for taking off my helmet and talking to you.*"

What choice does he have? He can feel gnawing heat in his raw shoulder. The cannibals had patched it up moderately well, but only enough to keep him from rotting and dying too quickly. Summoning up all his strength just to lower his own guard, he finally manages to nod.

"*Good.*" The man dons his helmet once more. **Where are your parents?**

In the prologue, duh. Heroes never have parents. That's why they get to go on adventures. Don't you know anything? The boy doesn't even shake his head; the man eventually gives up on the question and helps lift him out of the hole, backpack and all.

The forest is gone; flattened. Squads of grey-uniformed and black-helmeted men comb the shattered landscape, searching in earnest. The boy stares as tremendously heavy tanks roll past and crush downed logs underneath like so many matchsticks. The noises of military operation are numerous and overwhelming, but he focuses solely on defending his personal space with his sword and keeping anyone from so much as glancing at his backpack.

The man with the bulbous nose and kind face no longer seems very kind once anonymous. His voice echoes hollow. **This way.** He leads the way down a tank-crushed track and into a camp being set up in the rift clearing. The space here seems primarily consumed by helmeted soldiers rushing back and forth with wounded men on stretchers. Every so often, one disappears in a bright purple flash; the rest scream in high anonymized pitches, for even now they cannot take off their helmets. The boy watches a stretcher tumble over; the agonized man's blood leaks onto the ground and sizzles of its own accord.

One of the largest tents lies to the right, and the boy follows his escorts inside with trepidation. Inside, the smell of a hospital is evident, and he obeys instructions from a grey-coated doctor in a black helmet. Sitting on one of the cots, the boy clings to his sword and backpack with his right arm and shakes as the doctor probes at his left shoulder.

**Doesn't look good, but it's not too far gone yet,** the doctor comments after ripping off the bandages. Opening up a hefty but very well-organized bag, he withdraws two vials and injects them one at a time into the raw open wounds. **You won't die. You won't enjoy what's coming, but you won't die.** He pulls out a few pills. **I don't know what conditions you'll be facing, so just take these all at once.**

The boy regards the pills with suspicion.

**They're antibiotics designed to time-release in your stomach. Perfectly safe, I assure you.**

The boy looks among the helmets around him, no longer able to tell which one shrouds the kind man. Reluctantly, he accepts the pills, and then thirstily downs an entire canteen of offered water.

**Do you have any food?** the doctor asks, reaching for his backpack.

The boy glares and pulls it away from him.

**You should eat, that's all I'm saying.**

One of the other men speaks. **I don't think anybody has any food right now. I've heard cannibalism is becoming common.**

The boy shakes with anger, but finds himself unable to tell these Grey Riders about the cannibals and the location of their camp. If only they knew! Would these military men swoop in and murder the whole foul lot? No. They wouldn't. They had been ordered not to interfere no matter what the cost. That much the boy could tell, for the kind man would not have spoken of possible execution otherwise.

The doctor lifts a testing device, but one of the helmeted men holds up a hand. **I already tested him. He's good.**

**It's just protocol,** the doctor responds.

**Wouldn't it be a waste of resources?**

**The Leader himself insisted on this rule.** The doctor pauses, suspecting. With a swift movement, he pokes; the boy grunts at the pain. The light blinks red.

The brother of the kind man says, **Christ, Frank! What did you do?**

The doctor steps back. **How could you bring one of those things in here?**

The kind man steps closer. **He's a friggin' kid!**

**I understand your empathy, but the human race is on the line, you idiot!** The doctor moves toward the exit of the medical tent.

The boy stares as multiple guns emerge; the alarm in each voice is apparent even through their electronic distortions. The doctor holds a pistol forward. Frank points one back at him. Frank's brother shakes nervously as his gun alternates between them. **Frank, he's not wrong. Why did you do this?**

Frank slowly shakes his helmeted head. **Kid, you better get out of here. Run to the tent next to this one and put on a uniform and helmet. When you're out of sight, run for your life. Go south and find the rift in the clay canyon. That'll take you back toward your people.**

The boy doesn't waste any time. Instead of running past the men, he dives for the bottom of the tent, crawls under, and drags his backpack and sword out after him. His heart pounds in his chest and in his head, but he does as the man suggested. In the next tent, he grabs a pistol and quickly tears off his rags to replace them with a uniform small enough to fit himare there other kids his age in this army?and he forces himself to walk right toward the edge of camp. Several Riders standing guard nod at him, and one even waves. He realizes that these are men, not monsters, even if they are willing to kill to protect their anonymity.

Once inside the shattered treeline, he runs. His backpack flops open, but the rough ruby does not fall. It floats alongside him at his speed, dipping to bump the ground accidentally at times. The boy understands this to be part of his companion's injuries. It cannot fly away and can barely maintain height as it is, but it sticks with him because it understands, in some fashion, what he did.

He emerges onto a barren plain. He pokes the earth and finds tell-tale ochre. Without trees in the way, he can see quite a distance, and he moves towards the only canyon in sight. He fears Grey Rider pursuit, but the thunder of battle begins again, and night falls without incident. He keeps walking until he finds the rift; the chill river at the base of the clay canyon flows right into it, and he splashes through with his companion right behind.

Having lost track of what act he is playing through in the game, he begins to wander aimlessly. After the rift, what direction were 'his people' supposed to be in? He follows the river for three days, and then tracks a set of shoeprints that terminate at another rift. Where the shoeprints end, he sees no sign of further passage.

Each evening, the pain the doctor warned of flares in his shoulder; whenever he is not moving, it builds to an unspeakable burning and stinging. The ruby stays close to add warmth, but this warmth only keeps him from freezing to death as the snow chases them both. The grey uniform is not enough on its own, and he considers firing a few shots from his gun just to generate warmth between his handsbut he has never seen a gun fired in real life, and keeps telling himself he'll need the ammo.

Each evening, he offers various materials to his wounded companion, but it remains as silent as he. What does a living ruby need to heal? He doubts he can find actual rubies just lying around the wildernessbut wait, isn't that exactly what heroes do? He needs to slay monsters; he needs to grind. He taps his sword against various kinds of rock, and, on the fourth night, the ruby dives over his shoulder and levitates a tiny fragment of mineral toward itself.

He watches the mineral as it becomes incorporated into his friend. The tidbit doesn't look like ruby and his friend now has a dark stain, but it seems to have helped. As they walk, and as he grows hungrier, he continues tapping bits off of random stones. Every so often, a very tiny bit works for the ruby's needs.

Through his sixth rift in a single week, the boy collapses near a muddy brown river. How big is existence? How far are people scattered through it? Does he really have any chance of finding other people? He slides his head to the right and slightly into the water, enough to sip. It helps, but it is not food.

His ruby friend floats high and impacts one of the trees above; a single hard fruit falls. Amazed, the boy pries at it with his dulling sword and manages to get it open. Inside is succulent yellow sweetness, and he eats ravenously. Both spent from the effort, he and his friend lie on the ground unmoving until another dawn eases upon them. The boy struggles to keep his role as a hero in a game coherent, for the thought of this being real life terrifies him.

He comes to a glaring gulf of grey over a frozen sea. The volcanic shore runs hot and meltwaters splash against the black sand. He runs and falls hands-first into the waves, desperate for warmth. He used to hate taking baths, but this is first since... before the prologue. As he soaks, his companion joins him by floating above the steaming water, and the boy sees subtle ripples in the fluid beneath. As he studies the pattern, something deeper about his friend reveals itself.

An eerie song of frozen pain, molten passion, and violent longing echoes over the unmoving ocean. It is time to leave. The boy dresses, grabs his clothing and other items, and runs. The ruby floats alongside him, steadier and faster than before.

The days are beginning to blur together. Despite the drastically changing worlds he traverses each day, the sun always rises, the sun always sets, and time marches on exactly the same through every lens. He and his friend avoid the lairs of horrific creatures during the day or lie in hiding as monsters pass in the night. This isn't a game. This is a nightmare. While curled up inside a fallen log with a colony of equally terrified termites, the boy listens to the unholy beast clacking outside his hiding spot. Does it sense him? The boy chooses his gun rather than his swordand points it at himself. The barrel is invisible in the dark, but he can *feel* its aim as a sort of primal terror evoked in his very nervous system; this isn't a game. It was all lies. Everything is gone. Everyone is gone. Nightmare is all that remains. The boy is breaking apart.

For the first time in their travels, the ruby hurts him. The impact surprises him, and the beast hunting outside screeches at the unspecified noise, but the boy abandons his course of action lest his friend slam into his face at speed again. The wounded ruby cannot choose a less painful place to hit him, for the log is narrow and tight.

The beast moves on. *This* beast moves on. There is always another; ahead, behind. The boy's rare moment of motivation is gone, and he never points the gun at himself again. The total loss of hope paradoxically keeps him alive; this is not a game. This is real life, and the worst *has* happened. There is nothing to do now but wander until silence and stillness find him.

It is always very cold now, even when the sun is high in the sky. His shoulder no longer hurts, and seems to be growing skin over the stump where his arm used to be. His torn and faded uniform is more brown and yellow than grey. He no longer has any thoughts, for the continual flow of landscape and terrain fills his senses.

He falls, and fails to rise. It is dawn. His friend rotates, returns, and pushes against him. He gets up and continues.

He falls, and fails to rise. It is noon. His friend rotates, returns, and pushes against him. He gets up and continues.

He falls, and fails to rise. It is sunset. His friend rotates, returns, and pushes against him. He does not get up.

His friend squeezes between him and the ground before rotating to drag him on top. His friend floats forward at half its prior speed, now carrying his limp hanging body. The boy imagines himself upon a self-propelled Grey Rider stretcher being taken back to camp to die. Will he, too, vanish in a flash of purple light?

The ruby beneath stumbles, if such a one can stumble, and the boy rolls onto the leafy ground. The ruby cannot go on, so he puts his friend in his backpack and continues on for the both of them. He has no thoughts, no hopes, no fears, and nothing but the endless drive forward. There is nothing elseuntil he takes his first step onto uneven sapphire and realizes they have stumbled upon a world which might contain his friend's people rather than his own.

In fact, it contains both. Shouts around him distantly call for him to stop; hands force his mechanical walking to cease. He brandishes his sword, but it is just a handle now. 

"Kid, are you alright?"

He stares.

"Nancy, give me some of your water!"

He drinksand then continues staring.

"Joe, you got any food?"

The boy just watches the food as it is held near his face. He turns his gaze back to the faces surrounding him.

"It's alright," a womanbut not *the* womansays. "You can have this. We don't need it. We're all dead."

The boy takes a horrified step back. In the constant natural cycle of day, night, and walking, had he died without realizing it?

"No, we won't hurt you. We're just like you, but dead, and we'll be back to life again as soon as our wounds regenerate. Haven't you heard? People can't die anymore!"

Can't die? He looks down at his grubby and calloused hand. Was he wrong in his fatal hopelessness? It *is* a game, isn't it? Heroes certainly die sometimes, but then they just reload their save and try again.

"Come on," one offers. The old woman has the same kindly tone as Frank's voice in his memories. "If we stab you right here in the neck, you'll die too, and then your arm will start to grow back."

Confused and terrified and hopeful all at the same time, the boy shakes his head and moves away. This is a fever dream. This can't be real. As he listens and pieces together the supposed timeline of this new inability to die, he sees that it was going on even as he was in the Grey Riders' camp. They had still feared death at that time. He sees the device testing him and blinking red. He hears the doctor shouting about the human race being at stake. If the Grey Riders are human and the boy is not a Grey Rider, then what is the boy?

And, with their gross wounds and strange odors, what are these people?

Before he can make the choice to run away, a tinted shadow looms; a gigantic purple triangle blocks his vision overhead, and the others flee in terror. He remains, for he is hopeful rather than afraid. His ruby friend emerges from his backpack and floats close. It puts itself between him and the upside-down purple triangle in the sky.

The boy senses awareness in this newcomer, too, and the words in his head change from purple triangle to amethyst pyramid as he feels its presence the way he used to feel the woman's love as she held him tight long ago. He is far too old for that now, as he has been for many years, but he still dreams about it sometimes now that she is gone.

The newcomer waits as if expecting him to speak, but he does not. He can only look up and remain silent. He certainly tries to explain himself and his friend, but, as before, his jaw simply refuses to move.

The amethyst pyramid seems to prefer that. Leaving a sense of permission in its wake, it moves away, heading deeper over the sapphire landscape. The boy looks to his companion and the ruby rotates to send his gaze ahead. They understand each other; he starts walking after his friend's massive cousin. The journey is not over, but, as his friend merrily bobs forward, the boy feels something other than numbness for the first time since his escape; his cheeks tremble, and a slight smile emerges.

Act three has begun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I was thinking more along the lines of a full-fledged, published novel. One that you can find in stores.

You can order physical copies from CreateSpace through Amazon; I did a ton of work on those.

In the next few months I will also be submitting a pure science fiction novel or two to traditional publishers to follow a sort of hybrid self-publishing   traditional strategy. By pure science fiction, I mean akin to [World of Glass](https://www.amazon.com/World-Glass-Final-Cycle-Book-ebook/dp/B00DC8INI8/ref=sr_1_15?ie=UTF8 qid=1470592310 sr=8-15 keywords=world+of+glass) rather than scifi/horror like Portal in the Forest. So that may get picked up and fulfill your wish. Here's hoping! </TEXT>
