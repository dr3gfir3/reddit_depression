	<TEXT> Hello there!
I'm looking for for two points of advice!

1) I'd like to price check this bicycle

All I know is that it has been "barely ridden" and is a 21speed townie cruiser.

2) Would that be a good bike for neighborhood and city biking? If not, what would you recommend? 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Would you say your Airbnb stay is pretty far from Yosemite? 

We're in Groveland. It's a town like 35 min out from the park, about an hour from yosemite valley? I don't know for sure, I've never been. I'm just going off google maps.

 Any hikes that are a must for morning or sunset for the best views?

I have been trying my hardest to find recommendations for this. 

I've been told anywhere in the Valley is great for either because the way sun hits the valley walls. I was thinking of trying to get out to Mirror lake for a sunset because I heard there are great views of Half Dome from there. I'd like to do Glacier point for sunrise one day since that's a great overview of the entire valley. But I'm inferring from what I've read in guidebooks and online, nothing specifically says "be here for sunset/sundown". I'm assuming since hetch hetchy is all about the falls there's nothing special about any given time of day. Though maybe watching the sun from the dam could be good? 

If you find anything out, please let me know!

	<TEXT> I didn't know this was going to be on and just happened to be watching PBS when it started.

This. Was. Amazing.

The whole climate change aspect was not too heavy handed and they made many good points about how the glaciers melting formed the valley to begin with. 

The amazing videography (word?) left me breathless. They obviously used drones to capture footage from OVER THE SEQUOIAS. I've never wanted to climb anything but now I want to go scale el cap...TOMORROW(jk). And the little pikas...aww so cute. I couldn't get the video to load but I'm going to keep trying so I can watch this again and again...and again and again!

Question though, the firefalls they showed, was that this year(2017)? How new was this footage? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too am headed to Yosemite in Mid-May!

At this point I am in a holding pattern for my planning. It is not clear if big oak flat road or glacier point road will be open by then. I've planned a full day of hikes in Hetch Hetchy since that seems to be the only park of the park that for sure will be easy to get to. I'm expecting wild temperature swings as other have posted so I plan on dressing in layers. Here is what I have for a day in Hetch Hetchy and I'll be posting my other 2 days once the road situation is more clear. We're novice hikers so I chose all "easy" hikes but I expect to still have a great time.

 Saturday May 20th - Hetch Hetchy

 6.5 hours of hiking in seldom visited Hetch Hetchy should afford some spectacular views of early-mid season waterfalls. If we are able to get to the Carlon Falls trailhead by 10am we can have lunch after the first hike. Or halfway through each of the first 2 hikes; both have good picnic areas. There isnt much in Hetch Hetchy, so we should plan on bringing food and water. Then we can decide if we want to do both Lookout Point and Wapama Falls, or choose one over the other. If we do both we could be done with Lookout Point by 2:30 and head to the Wapama Falls Trailhead by 3pm. Well need to be out of Hetch Hetchy by 9pm but we would back by 6pm.

 **Carlon Falls**

 - 35 min drive from the the cabin
 - 4 miles
 - 2 hours
 - Riverside meandering hike
 - 30-foot Falls
 - Good place to picnic

 **Lookout Point**

 - 20 min drive from Carlon Falls Trailhead
 - 2.8 miles
 - 1.5 hours
 - Great view of OSaughnessy and the Hetch Hetchy reservoir from a distance

 **Wapama Falls**

 - 20 min drive from Lookout Point Trailhead
 - 4.8 miles
 - 3 hours
 - Includes walk over OSaughnessy Dam
 - Most of the hike is along the Hetch Hetchy reservoir
 - 2 falls, Tueeulala and Wapama

Let me know what you think! Any feedback is welcome!
Also we're doing an AirBnB but there's 4 of us so the split cost ends up being less than a hotel. For 2 it might be worthwhile checking out the hotels/inns.

	<TEXT> My maternal grandmothers family were wealthy furriers in NY until the great depression. Apparently overflowing with money and affluence. By the late 1930s they were flat broke. My grandmother wanted to go to college and decided to go to a pubic school and that she would work to pay for it herself. She was disowned by my great grandmother and written out of the family estate. She insists they did her a favor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Asa gift for a friend I'd like to get a full set that is made of better material than the basic set. I've looked on etsy and see a few really expensive sets that don't actually look great. Is there a fancy set that is mass produced? Is there a kickstarter I can get into? Anyone that makes custom sets wanna price it out for me?

Thanks, </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a guide for shells and overcoats? I found some cheap wool/cashmere overcoats that I kind of like but I'm not sure what to wear it with or how to size it. On a whim I bought a dark blue one that comes down just below my knees (I'm 5'9"). Thoughts? Ideas? I figured the standard peacoat is out now and I was hoping for something slightly more formal anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Staying in Groveland. I think there's stuff to do around there just outside of the park too.

I'm expecting it to be nice(70s?) in the day, cold at night(40s) and hopefully not too wet.

I figure we'll stick to the valley for the most part. I was hoping to do El Capitan, Half Dome, and maybe Glacier Point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Community!

I'm headed to Yosemite in May and would like to plan some hikes and activities. Anyone got any good advice on what we should see? Can anyone recommend a good guide book or two? It'll only be 4 days so we want to hit the must sees/dos but also any other hidden gems would be great. We won't be camping or doing any over night hikes. 

Thanks for any and all advice, information, or wise remarks! </TEXT>
