	<TEXT> I've never understood this relating o or identifying with characters thing.

I'm a straight white American guy, so there should be a ton of characters I can relate to, right? Seeing as there's a ton of characters like this, there's probably some who I've had similar experiences to.

But I don't identify with any of them.

That's not because they happen to have superpowers, or don't struggle with the same things I do, or have different values. Even if there was a guy who lived on Earth 616 who was just like me, I wouldn't identify with him. He would just be a character in a story.

I'm not criticising wanting to be represented in comics, and I like that more and more people are able to find characters they relate to. But I just don't get it. It's hard to articulate what I mean, but if anyone can explain how they relate to characters or what that even means (other than, "I know what that's like"), I would appreciate it. </TEXT>

I love Preacher and I can't imagine anyone else doing it justice. No one else's style (that I can think of) would fit well.

However, I look at his work on Thunderbolts and I'm confused as to how he ever got hired. I don't know. Its crazy how it works so well for some things and not at all for other things. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently got the Apocalypse Now steelbook and it is fucking great. Really good transfer, both versions of the movie, the Hearts of Darkness documentary, and 9+ hours of other special features.

I had no idea. I just got it because it's one of my favorite movies and I thought it was a cool case at a good price.

I've been looking at some other though, and I'd rather have special features than nice packaging (usually). So for example, Heat has a new release coming, but also a steelbook. Is there a way to know what SFs come on it? The distribution stuff is confusing to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't see any mention about a counterweight or how big the "tray" is.

On the back of the arm near where it's connected to the rest of the turntable, I'd there a little circular dial? That would be an adjustable counterweight, which prevents the arm from pressing down on the record too hard. If that happens it slowly degrades the quality of the sound, which you may or may not notice for a while, depending on your speakers, preamp, or if you're an audiophile. Also, if may have a decent counterweight without the adjustable dial, I just don't see those often in new players.

The size of the "tray" (put in quotes because I've never actually known the true name for it) where the record actually sits is also somewhat important. If the record hangs off more than about an inch and the counterweight isn't damn near perfect, that can warp the record.

I didn't see either of those specs listed on the page, and it may very well have them. If you're using other speakers and those specs are met, I don't see anything wrong with it. Affordable sound systems have really gone up in quality since I started in the hobby a few years ago, apparently.

If you're not super concerned with the condition of your records and don't need that "perfect sound", you should be fine. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why do you kill other players for no reason? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> A few hours ago I was doing some MC work and we had sone several jobs, fairly smoothly. It was pretty fun as jobs aren't usually that good with randos.

At one point, me and one of the other guys were having a skirmish with two other players not in the crew, out in the open hills. All well and good, they were trying to get the cargo.

Then some guy started sniping all of us. No one could get him back since as soon as we would spawn, we'd be shot because he had the high ground, good aim, and a lot of ammo.

The mission ended. He continued to kill us for no reason. I can't imagine killing players who can't really fight back is fun. I had to quit because there was literally nothing else I could do.

There went my crew.

Anyway I guess that was sort of a rant, but I want to know the point. Are you people just cunts or is there something you get out of it? I might have missed something as I haven't played since my 360 days, until recently.

Edit: So this game's for idiots. Got it. </TEXT>
