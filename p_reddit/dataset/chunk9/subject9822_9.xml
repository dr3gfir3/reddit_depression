	<TEXT> Hey everyone,

Very inexperienced gay guy here, only been with one guy in my 23 years on this earth. The guy and I have hooked up consistently on the DL all throughout our junior high years up until now...he's getting married so that's coming to an end. 

He had a freaking gorgeous dick. The kind you can just stare at and tear up. The Meryl Streep of dicks truly. Probably about 7-8 inches and fairly thick. I'm a total bottom and he was a total top, we fit together perfectly. I didn't hate bottoming for him but sometimes did not enjoy it. It hurt like hell and it was pretty rough sometimes. Regardless a few times it felt amazing and I loved it and all that jazz. 

Fast forward to now, I've met a new guy. So nice, so sweet, good looking, treats me well everything fuck it's great. We haven't hooked up yet but ya boy is thirsty so I know it's coming. There's one problem: he's sporting about a 5 inch, average dick. This is such a stupid question I can't believe I'm asking it. I KNOW bottoming will feel different but will it be to the point I feel nothing?! Please someone tell me they got the 5 inch or lower dick train and it was great PLEASE. I promise I'm not a size queen I just want to make sure everything works fine for us getting nasty.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Terrified of Coming Out </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey gaybros, sorry this is going to be a book.

I'm 23 years old and have been a closeted gay my entire life...I'm 100% bottom but very masculine which hides it well for the most part. I've dated and had sex with women and it's never worked out. I've been with one guy my entire life and have done everything imaginable with him. It started out in high school and has went clear up until now, all in secret. He's getting married and I simply can't do that with a married man so I've been on Grindr trying to find someone to scratch the itch per say. 

Well I met a guy on Grindr who is tall, handsome, extremely nice to me, very masculine, total top, good job...the entire package. He's out to everyone and looking for a relationship which is the only problem. I've been toying around with the idea of coming out for awhile but let me rant for awhile. 

I'm not sure how my parents will take it. I live with them and I know they would never kick me out but I can't shake the feeling they will hate me and the situation. A couple months ago I went through a bout with depression (caused in part by my closeted ways) and my dad made the comment to my grandma, who made the comment to me that maybe I was "gay and too afraid to tell him" and that if that was the case to say something.  So I'm thinking he has a clue and would be fine, my mother I have no idea. Then I'm also worried about other people's idea of me once I come out, potential people who I could lose in the process, etc. I still find the idea of a relationship with a guy to be strange and foreign but I could chalk that up to only being with a booty call my entire life. I have this feeling of shame in my mind that for some reason I'm supposed to get married, have kids and be a typical story but I know deep down that's not what I want. 

Basically I'm wondering if any of you have been in a similar process and if so, please help me, I'm losing it here.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I know you did and yes, I read all your comments. I simply wanted to keep pummeling it into your mind that generalizing an entire group, especially in the mental illness realm, is not only dangerous but disingenuous to all involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I refuse to get into a debate on Reddit with you regarding this but let me sum up my feelings really quick. As someone who changed their life with weight loss, goes to the gym regularly, gets regular sleep, eats well and still battles anxiety and depression issues I can say I'm disappointed in you for your comments. Not all mental illness is the same and yes, there are those who abuse medication and use it as a crutch. However, there are some of us who have tried all options and it's our only shot at having a normal, healthy life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lost about 40 pounds of fat and put on about 22 pounds of muscle through personal training...essentially totally re-shaping my body. However, I will say there are two sides to the coin, you can have a really damn good personal trainer and I've seen some absolute shit ones. If that's an avenue you want to go down I say go for it 100%, just make sure you get a trainer who 1) knows what they are talking about and 2) cares about pushing you towards your goals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only trained about three months before I did this one and actually felt totally fine. My biggest recommendation for anyone training for a tri is to get the swim down. Swim well over the distance you're going for and make sure to swim in open water a couple of times before the race. The swimming was by far one of the most physically and mentally demanding events of my life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey loseit! 

Backstory: About a year and a half ago I weighed in at a whopping 331lbs. I was unhealthy, borderline diabetic and worst of all - severely depressed. After contemplating suicide a few times I decided to take back my life and never looked back. Since then I've lost roughly 118lbs and have never felt more alive/happier. This past week I ran my first ever triathlon and loved every minute of it!

 I love skimming through here and seeing all the progress pictures and posts so I figured I would lump mine into here too! Keep up the good fight everyone! Battle those demons in your head and beat the ever living piss out of them, they are the only thing standing between you and your goal!
