	<TEXT> I really liked the books. I enjoyed the more rugged and realistic world when compared to other high fantasy novels. Also enjoyed the way the Witcher books mixed real world and fantasty world. For example several references to stories by the Brothers Grimm and H.C.Andersen. 

But everyone on their own, I can see how these books wouldn't be for someones taste </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been a while since I played it but I think the first one, altought I did not finish it (played maby 70%). It had the best world but the third one captured Geralts character and the whole witchering thing the best. The second game captured the war ridden land feeling well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even thought I don't agree with him, I can see why the games bother him. People who come from the games see cdprojekts vision of the world first, then Sapkowskis and these two are pretty different. I read the books first and then played the games and I can say that the game world felt very different and it affected on how I enjoyed the games. And Sapowski said that he thinks cdprojekt didn't capture the feel of the world he had in mind.

Especially since I've seen people online complaining on how the books aren't consistent with the game because they think that the books were some kind of prequel written for the games. Or complaining on how different characters of Geralt and Dandelion are. Or how Geralt has a relationship with Yennefer instead of Triss. (I have seen all these complaints made about the books, many of them in this subreddit)

Before you go trashing him, saying that he is pathetic or idiot or a fucking dumbass, remember that this is his life's work. Even though he completely agreed to cdprojekt making the games and has no right to be complaining about them, it must hurt seeing world **he created,** his life's work, being shown incorrectly and getting praise, while the fans who don't bother reading the books and the original, his vision on the witcher world. 

And while **I don't agree with him**. I can see his point and how the games could hurt the experience of the person reading the books after playing the games. So try to see this from his point of view. 

EDIT: Also, for those saying that the games are what made it popular, no, they did not. This books series was reall popular in several countries before the games. For example in Poland and Russia. And if the books were translated before the games were made, I'd say they would have been popular in many other countries too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I managed to make the perfect looking character and now I can't really play other characters because they don't look as good. I have 3 "main" characters and 2 of them I mainly play, other because he looks good and the other because he has great backstory. And third just kinda is there because he was my first character </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's good game to play solo, but there isn't much RP in the G. Questing is lots of fun, magic classes are great and powerfull and there is justice system so you can spend time stealing stuff or assassinating npc's. But the quest decisions doesn't really have any real consequences (some have who lives, who dies types of things). But they are alot of fun and alot better than in most mmo's. Also the voiceacting is suberb.

In summary: It's good mmo to play solo but if you are looking for meaningful and complicated story like in singleplayer rpg's, you might want to look at singleplayers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been around plenty of cats and short of a cat meowing and looking at a tin of food this is the extent of a conversation that I have had with a cat.

Funny story about that, one of my moms cats is basicly a mute. He can't really meow, so he communicates by purring and making this kinda funny growling sound. And the other cats rarely meow (unless they want something) but he often "growls" when just playing around. Also some use their paws to kinda get attention like waving and pointing around. But one thing I love about dogs is that they do communicate better than cats. 

My dogs get progressively more frustrated when I don't do what they are asking me to do. You can hear it in their voice and in the way they behave.

My parents dog does that too, but I've noticed that cats can hold crudges longer than dogs. For example one of our cats with long hair had to go get her fur trimmed because there was alot of knots with things like needles from trees and such after she was hunting in forest after rain (my parents live in country and the cats run free outside) and week after my mom had taken her for vet to be trimmed, she left the room everytime my mom went in and gave her some evil looks. 

It's fun to talk to people about these things because everyones pets are so unique and different in their nature. </TEXT>
