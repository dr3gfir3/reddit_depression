	<TEXT> Well, regarding endless wars, earlier in the interview, Stone says that Trump doesn't want to carry out a "regime change" and a war in Syria (as happened in Iraq and Libya), and so far that's true--so far, yes, but Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, and Hillary Clinton all spoke out against Syria in their campaigns, and I think they would have ordered a lot more aggression by this point in their administration. Here's what Hillary was saying last July:

	<TEXT> Well, you could say even more so that Trump was even deeper into the establishment because he, unlike Stone, was close with Republicans as well as Democrats for decades, and I realize that SOME people see Trump's agenda as just being a continuation of the standard U.S. Republican agenda in all areas, but I think that Trump's campaign was not part of the establishment machine, and that his administration isn't either, as the establishment keeps trying to get rid of him. In fact, Rachel Maddow had a whole segment the other day about how the "Russia" scandals should or will result in the forcing-out of both Trump AND Trump's biggest policy supporter, Vice President Pence - http://archive.is/tfaRs

	<TEXT> He definitely does. He's been referencing NYTimes articles for a year and a half now--he talked about in dozens of speeches throughout his campaign, calling the paper "the FAILING NYTimes," and he'd use that label while quoting something from it; he wouldn't just say "I don't like the Failing NYTimes." It's the same way he references segments and commentators from CNN (tweeting about how so-and-so just lied about him and he "doesn't watch anymore") and even Saturday Night Live, just as he reads the Wall Strete Journal and watches Fox News (tweeting about how Megyn Kelly just lied about him and he "doesn't watch anymore"). The NYTimes is still the United States of America's forefront newspaper and "paper of record." Trump himself even paid to publish a full-page ad in the NYTimes, on September 2, 1987, seeking to change the mind of then-President Reagan: http://i.imgur.com/MaNcHZI.png

 The New York Times has long been regarded within the industry as a national "newspaper of record".[10]

As Business Insider reported the other day in an article listing the 11 fastest-growing apps in the US from Dec 2014 - Dec 2016, Bitmoji is #1 as well. This has been viewed 177,000 times since it was posted 4 days ago. It gives a very useful look at where the mobile Internet (i.e. the Internet) is going.

	<TEXT> What politician represented the original late-1970s punk movement in Britain? None, as that was the starting point, the initial defining opposition movement, and that movement was a reaction against the establishment political class. As for what politician is a manifestation of rebellion against the establishment political class since then, it is only just now there is one, and actually several: Nigel Farage (UK), Donald Trump (US), Marine Le Pen (France), Geert Wilders (Netherlands), Frauke Petry (Germany), and Norbert Hofer (Austria). Each of those political figures is rebelling against the establishment political class--and that's what makes this tidal wave of populism so unusual and so historic. When the US election was Al Gore vs. George Bush, or Barack Obama vs. Mitt Romney, that was two candidates who were very much long-time entrenched members of the ruling elite. (Romney was a top executive of a financial firm, called Bain Capital, from 1984 to 2002, and was then the Governor of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.) But those others I just named are definitely not members of that elite--and the nonstop media attacks against them are an indicator on that.

	<TEXT> If the culture is embodied by the leader of a country, does that mean that on Election Day 2016, the American majority switched from leftwing-dominant (where conservatives were the counterculture) to rightwing-dominant (where liberals again became the counterculture)? There were about 136 Million people who voted, but then another *100 Million* eligible voters who chose not to vote at all. So their vote was at least against BOTH the main candidates, if not against the whole system itself. Or perhaps many of them don't even care at all and just figure the voting makes no difference.

	<TEXT> His main point is that there has been flip in that the right was authoritarian side in the '70s, but that the left has become the authoritarian side today. He showed a few clips of conservatives in the '70s who wanted to censor punk music and culture. Now there is a continual effort to censor and stop conservative or pro-Trump sentiments. I myself have been permanently banned from a few subreddits (such as Feminism and AfricanAmerican) for posting videos that show a conservative point of view, and had previously posted many non-conservatives posts in Feminism and WASN'T banned or blocked or anything. 

Conservatives control the main religion of the US, yes, but how strong is that religion, or any religion, in many of the states that just voted for Hillary? Millions of Christian American adults are celebrating Christmas and Easter, but how much are they doing anything beyond that? 

And how are Conservatives dominating economics? For one thing, Conservatives want to totally get rid of food stamps, and yet there are at least 43 Million people living from month to month on food stamps, as Politifact, which hates Trump, even acknowledged:

http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2013-01-04/putting-trillion-dollars-platinum-perspective

Dec 2013: White House Seriously Considered Minting A Trillion Dollar Platinum Coin To Avoid Breaching The Debt Ceiling

http://www.businessinsider.com/white-house-seriously-considered-minting-a-trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-to-avoid-breaching-the-debt-ceiling-2013-12?op=1

From the ZeroHedge comment section:

 Platinum is too expensive. It should be made out of copper. No that is too expensive, make it out of plastic like Fisher Price:  http://tinyurl.com/a6l5cwt

 Better yet, just make it out of paper, or even better just type in $1,000,000,000,000 into a computer. 

QUOTES:

"All paper currencies are toilet paper, the dollar is simply two ply." **- Thomas Caplin**

"All the perplexities, confusion and distress in America arise not from defects in the constitution or confederation, nor from want of honor or virtue, as much from the downright ignorance of the nature of coin and circulation." **- John Adams in a letter to Thomas Jefferson**

"We are in danger of being overwhelmed with irredeemable paper, mere paper, representing not gold nor silver; no sir, representing nothing but broken promises, bad faith, bankrupt corporations, cheated creditors and a ruined people." **- Daniel Webster, speech in the American Senate, 1833**
 
"Money is a new form of slavery, and is distinguishable from the old simply by the fact that it is impersonal, there is no human relation between master and slave." ** Leo Tolstoy**

 We started covering the platinum seigniorage fiasco in June of 2011.  We thought it was a joke.

	<TEXT> Maybe you're right (I'm the person who shared the article), but if there's no manipulation, I think that the reason there are such a higher number of comments on other stories is because many of those stories pertain to more hotly debated or disputed topics or people, so the are both more people voicing their view, and then there are more arguments ensuing and extending more threads. In *this* case, there are more people who wish to highlight the story, but don't feel or have an additional need to opine or the subject or the article. 

As much as we in this sub are well aware of who Monsanto is (forget even Cargill, mentioned in the title) and the various outrageous things they do, I don't think more than 1 out 100 random adults walking down the street in any big U.S. city would be able to answer the question of "Who or what is Monsanto?" Certainly the mainstream media isn't covering the company's activities much. 

 Agenda-setting theory is the theory that the mass-news media have a large influence on audiences by their choice of what stories to consider newsworthy and how much prominence and space to give them. Agenda-setting theorys central axiom is salience transfer, or the ability of the mass media to transfer importance of items on their mass agendas to the public agendas. As political scientist Bernard C. Cohen wrote in 1963: **"The press may not be successful much of the time in telling people what to think, but it is stunningly successful in telling its readers what to think *about*."**

That's from an earlier version of this Wikipedia article. (I've seen Bill Maher talk about Monsanto 2 or 3 times on his show, but that's all I've seen about it on TV, and that's where I myself first head about it, and that's on HBO. )

 **Mr. Ackman's $4 billion loss in Valeant more than wiped out the $2.2 billion he made in 2014 on Allergan. Mr. Ackman had never invested in the pharmaceutical industry when he put over $3 billion into Allergan.**

 In an email to The New York Times, Pershing Square said, "Valeant is an anomaly in an outstanding record over nearly 14 years."

 But while his funds notched an exceptional 40 percent gain in 2014  much of it attributable to the Allergan trade that has drawn the lawsuit  Mr. Ackmans funds lost 13.5 percent last year and 20.5 percent in 2015. Through March 15, Pershing Square is flat.
Other hedge funds have turned in poor performances as well in recent years. And it is not clear whether or to what extent Mr. Ackmans investors have reacted to his firms losses by fleeing. Pershing Square declined to disclose redemption figures.

**http://www.investopedia.com/news/ackmans-valeant-holdings-lost-pershing-77-million-day-vrx/**

Look at the acquisition spree that Allergan itself was on, over the past few years! See how many times "Acq" appears on the chart! No wonder he thought, in May 2015, that Valeant could be a "very early-stage Berkshire" -

	<TEXT> If a large percentage of members of country do not support the currency of that country, that can correlate to social instability and a rising populist sentiment. You don't see how that can be possible? The people don't like the monetary system that the country is forcing them to transact in. Therefore, there is a rising instability (lack of confidence) and the desire for a return to their own national currency (as has been seen with demands for the drachma among people in Greece).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The euro is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 28 member states of the European Union, and the euro entirely replaced the national currency of each of those eurozone nations. Thus, the percentage of support for that currency is an indicator of the sentiment of citizens of European countries towards the eurozone and broader European Union project.

	<TEXT> I myself still have a flip phone, but I think Snapchat will be huge, and here are many reasons:

First, regarding news, the NYTimes and Washington Post had enough faith in Snapchat to partner with the company just last month:

NYT: http://investors.nytco.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/The-New-York-Times-Announces-Upcoming-Launch-on-Snapchat-Discover/default.aspx

WaPo: http://fortune.com/2017/02/13/washington-post-snapchat/

And here are some recent articles with some different views, which I agree with. One major thing is its video business.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2017/03/12/snaps-ipo-was-a-success-because-it-fell-19-not-despite-it-falling/

Comcast invested: https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2017/03/07/heres-why-comcast-is-investing-in-snap/

Vice Media partnering: http://variety.com/2017/digital/news/vice-snapchat-shows-action-bronson-1202008566/

April 2, 2015, Bloomberg: Snapchat is "the new MTV."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-04-02/snapchat-s-discover-feature-video-ad-model-resembles-tv

Feb 5, 2017, The Wall Street Journal: Snapchat is "the new TV" altogether.

Feb 16, 2017, TechCrunch: Snapchat is "the HBO of mobile."

And Snap's only 2 apps, Bitmoji and Snapchat, are currently being downloaded more than any of the 4 Facebook apps (Fb, Mssnger, IG, and WhatsApp), which I'd say makes them the B2C Internet company with the most potential to be the next big one. Bitmoji has been #1 or #2 every day since Juan 11, 2017. Keep in mind that Facebook's stock took 15 months to climb back up to its IPO share price (May 2012 - Aug 2013) -
