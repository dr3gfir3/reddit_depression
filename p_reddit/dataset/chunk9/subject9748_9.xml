	<TEXT> And funny no one asked about my being adopted beside a cornfield! My parents were supposed to adopt twin boys but when they arrived the father had put a stop to the adoption so my mom said "Well, what else you got?" And it was me. But for some reason they had to drive across the county line and wait beside a cornfield for the social worker to bring me to them. Black market baby? Hmm...I wonder. Bet I could make up a story about that!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I was a photographer stationed in the Navy for Fleet Intelligence in Pearl Harbor. I had some tough times there and much of what happened to me fed into my first novel, A Human Element. It's also one of the reasons I have no desire to ever go back to Hawaii. Military shit can get dark and real, real fast. Especially between the military and locals at times.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do! First, I would love to go back to England and do research there as a new book I am writing has a medieval flavor! 
Recently, as I mentioned, I was called to write a book in NH where I used to live (still in progress) and had to go back and see it. It was hard to visit that place again where I'd been a child - now with my mom having died. It's on Squam Lake in a tiny town of Holderness, where they filmed On Golden Pond. 
I was zapped back in time to the 1970s  and being nine-years-old. Suddenly, I was a child again, living each day in the moment. Swimming in the pool, fishing with my dad on Squam Lake, romping through the woods, collecting dead butterflies and shotgun shells, playing pinball machines, and spinning 45 records on the jukebox in the recreation hall. 
Returning was an emotional gut punch. I could be a child again in that place of innocence, a place where my mother was still alive. It also resurrected painful moments from childhood as well as joyous. I wrote a piece about that here: http://www.subject9748.com/throwbackthursday-story-childhood/
