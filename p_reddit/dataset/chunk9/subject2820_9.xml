	<TEXT> I don't see how people can say that Trump won this debate. His delusional answers lacked any substance and he didn't stay on topic at all. Hilary answered the people's questions while giving clear insight into her plans. She also was more personal and spoke directly to the individuals. How does he win when all he did was attack his political opponent repeatedly instead of offer legitimate plans and responses? And his response to the pussy video was god awful.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The rendering is fantastic and the colors are very realistic. Some friendly advice I would give would to have more shading and colors in the white part of the eyes to give it more depth. Other than that fantastic job and i look forward to see more facial feature until u can create a whole face as detailed as this eye. </TEXT>
