	<TEXT> It is really awful, and as I said it caused quite the furor. It is however, of a fundamentally different character than raping someone. It's cruel, it's thoughtless, and the kind of thing a group of young people can get carried away with; you might not realize just how bad the situation is until it's finished unfolding.

"Get the the kid and tie him to the sculpture!" can turn into, "Yeah and pants him!" which turns into stripping... and then a couple of the truly screwed-up people piss on him. What started as a bad idea, and turned into a *really* bad idea, didn't really become monstrous until the very end. 

There is no point at which you're penetrating someone with a broomstick, when you can mistake that for something other than what it is. "Go for their ass" is not the cry of people who have pranks or hazing on their mind, they're just nuts who happen to be young. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People act like WL do the hacking themselves. If people don't leak them docs they can't publish them. If WL doesn't want to publish certain docs then you can call them biased but you can't dispute the evidence and you have to consider it.

This is the problem... and it's an *old* way to defame people. The truth, whether you like it or not, is that a lot of people do a lot of 'wrong' things, and the numbers look worse when you look into politics and business. That shouldn't be acceptable, but here's how you can make it *look* like you care, while only helping or hurting some people.

So, I have information which says basically... everyone in Group X is corrupt. Instead of releasing that however, you could just... target certain members of Group X. You won't be telling any lies, you'll just be releasing "truth" in a selective way designed to mislead people. 

That's a very generous assumption by the way; often you might target someone over an emotive issue to cover up for a more important one. Maybe you have a far-right candidate who is essentially a neo-Nazi, and a standard POS politician up against her. So, you release the *accurate* info on one, and simply let the other go. You haven't lied, but you've given the impression that one party is corrupt and not the other.

All by selectively telling the truth.  </TEXT>
