	<TITLE> Wrestling Terminology Definition #1: Card Subject To Change </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-15 15:39:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see that some people here are not familiar with the phrase **CARD SUBJECT TO CHANGE**. So I thought I would give you a definition into what this actually means

All Events that WWE Hold have a disclaimer saying "Card Subject To Change" this means that just because Bray Wyatt is booked to defend his championship in two months doesn't mean he will hold it because Card Subject To Change let's the consumer know that the matches on the card are not set in stone, and thus not a spoiler and thus you're not giving us all new information by posting about it.

I thought I needed to clear this up considering I've seen 101 thousand posts about possible spoilers from house shows, hopefully this might decrease the number of these posts popping up. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 20+ 2 81+ Pack Opening </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-06 13:41:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after my pack luck recently I decided to open 20 of them and share what I get

6: Savi(82)   Carrasso(81)

7: Iborra(82)   Orellana(81)

8: Mertesacker(83)   Smolnikov(81)

9: Vierinha(81)   Carrasso(81)(DUPE)

10: Marchisio(86)   Gaitan(85)

11: Rulli(82)   Moya(81)

12: TOTT Kabor(81)   Shatov(81)

13: Subai(83)   Villa(82)

19: Glik(83)   Lamela(81)

20: Rulli(82)(DUPE)   Gignac(82)

So I could have stopped here but I went fuck it and I'm gonna open some more, so as a little Intermission here's 5 Gold upgrade packs:

Mickie James, Alexa Bliss and Natalya vs Naomi, Becky Lynch and Nikki Bella (Pre Show)

Gallows   Anderson vs Cesaro and Sheamus (According to wikipedia this is on the Pre Show) Two Referees for the match

Sasha Banks vs Nia Jax (Pre Show)

Rich Swann (c) vs Neville for the Cruiserweight Championship

Charlotte (c) vs Bayley for the RAW Womens Championship

Kevin Owens (c) vs Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship

AJ Styles (c) vs John Cena for the WWE Championship

30 Man Royal Rumble Match

Matches that should be on the card but probably wont be:

Dean Ambrose (c) vs The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship

American Alpha (c) vs ??? for the Smackdown Live Tag Team Championships

Dolph Ziggler vs Kalisto

	<TEXT> He's a fantastic wrestler with a great work ethic and he always gives 100%, sure he hasn't added the flashiest of moved to his Move-Set but he's added: Springboard Stunner, Hurricanrana, Sunset Flip Powerbomb. Plus his Move-Set used to have moves like the spine-buster. His move set is forever changing, I don't know this for sure but I'm pretty sure he's pulled out the Emerald Flowsion. The point is he has plenty of moves, he just gets a bad reputation for having his five moves of doom (Shoulder Tackle, Hip Toss, Spinout Powerbomb, 5 Knuckle Shuffle, AA/FU) but he has plenty more moves. </TEXT>
