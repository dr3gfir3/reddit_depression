	<TEXT> It's not so valuable. But I rather save time in that area and spend money instead. I do need to invest time to play a game, and to make sure the time invested is optimal and not Grindy i rather skip the grind for the character and instead grind WITH the new character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, because it's costing me time. After a long day of work and other things I don't have enough time to grind like that just to unlock the character. I rather have the character right away and start saving up steel to gear him out by rep 3 instead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does a super getting trashed because someone has better gear than them make it simpler? You now have an end goal to achieve in order to be at their level. Once you finally achieve that goal you can finally go toe to toe with them and have a clash of gods. Seems to me it adds longevity and even more difficulty lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well Ubi had plenty of deals and the game forces you to launch Uplay anyways. I know it was split 50/50 forsure. But that's neither here nor there, and what you meant was the game is dying in steam, not in general, since in Xbox for example it's still close to 100k nightly </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk where you got these numbers from but I've never seen the player base drop below 70k at night east coast time on Xbox one. So idk where you got 15k? I'm assuming it's from steam since that's the smallest player base given most PC players play this game through uplay </TEXT>
