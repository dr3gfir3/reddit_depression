	<TEXT> The primary requests a voluntary contribution to the school maintenance fund of 45 a year, which can only be used to invest in the improvement of resources. The message to parents added: Camden schools have not escaped the pressure on local authority finances and our funding is likely to face real-terms cuts over the next four years.

Teachers at Rosary Primary School, in Belsize Park, meanwhile, are running a 1-a-week lottery, with the money divided between a weekly winner and the school. Parents have been told that money will help pay for iPads and interactive whiteboards. At Fitzjohns Primary School, in Hampstead, parents are being asked for funds for library furniture that the children will benefit from.

The schools were contacted by the New Journal about their fundraising methods, but we were directed to the councils communications department for further comment. The issues around fundraising are not confined to those who have made appeals to parents, with education leaders either speaking publicly  or privately  about how funding has not risen with the increasing cost of running primary and secondary schools as class numbers and staffing have gone up. </TEXT>

Years and years of fake benefits and scroungers press has done this. It's why there's a lack of a majority voicing outrage for disabled people losing thier benefits. Due to the years of 'disability fakers' stories. 

Even when people chatted about immigration at work someone brought up people faking thier ages and attacking people. Getting the refugee crisis hit pieces confused with immigration.  </TEXT>

- Sent telegram to Mexico about siding against the US. Admitted to it and it caused the US to join WW1

- Was in the meeting where the Kaiser decided to go to war. Arthur was kinda pro-war so his influence was there. 

- Was behind Germany support for rebellions in India and Ireland.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Manning (ne Wagner) has a long, storied history of bashing birth control. In a 2003 radio interview she said, "Of course, contraception doesn't work. Its efficacy is very low," despite the fact that prescription birth control methods are 91 to 99 percent effective with typical use and even higher with perfect use. She believes that emergency contraception (aka the morning-after pill) causes abortions by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus while the medical definition of pregnancy doesn't even begin until implantation. Manning claimed in 2001 that a "a major, if not dominant, mechanism" of the morning-after pill was preventing implantation. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists begs to differ, saying these pills "function primarily, if not exclusively, by inhibiting ovulation, thereby preventing fertilization from occurring.

She previously worked for two anti-abortion groups: as a legislative analyst for the Family Research Council and as a lobbyist for Americans United for Life, the group behind boilerplate legislation that dozens of states have used to enact abortion restrictions. She's also written that there's an "undisputed" link between abortion and breast cancer, which is patently false. The White House would not confirm the appointment to Politico, but Manning's name is already listed in the HHS employee directory and The Hill later confirmed the news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Millwalls battle against the seizure of its land by the local Labour council has taken an unexpected twist, with a supporters group candidate set to stand in the general election.

The plan to compulsorily purchase land occupied by Millwalls community trust and sell it on to an offshore-owned developer was abandoned in January. An independent inquiry into the affair is being carried out by Lord Dyson, a former Master of the Rolls but the beached scheme continues to cause uncomfortable vibrations, not least as part of a profound sense of distrust between club, supporters and local politicians.

Against this background the Millwall AMS supporters group plans to put up an independent candidate in a Lewisham constituency to highlight the continuing unhappiness at local Labours treatment of the boroughs chief community sporting asset. </TEXT>

When Joss Whedon read the first draft that I had written of Guardians of the Galaxy, he thought it wasnt James Gunn enough. I had actually been holding back. I was afraid that to make a huge commercial movie, I had to make it like other movies. Joss said, I like the parts that are James Gunn. Just make it more James Gunn. And thats what I did. I was glad he gave me that vote of confidence

Think lot of directors and writers have fallen foul of this when they get given bigger movies to do. Not surprised many hold back or get nervous

	<TEXT> studios understand the risk and that success if unknown till its released. Even the best directors make the odd bad movie. Studios would like to avoid complete flops (likely why we are seeing more sequels as it will sell tickets) but they know sometimes you can feel like you have a hit and then something goes wrong in production somewhere and its not a hit. 

I went to a talk and one producer pretty much said 'you can't make a bad script good, but you can easily make a good script bad.' It could go wrong due to a big reason or little ones like the costumes don't look right or bad casting. Yet they won't know till audiences have watched it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time I heard of a case where this happened. It was already evidence but its just the one side missed or hoped the other wouldn't pick up the key part. 

It was part of [this](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-framed/#chapter1) mad case 

The Easters had executed the plot together while a babysitter watched their kids, the prosecutor argued. One had planted the drugs while the other acted as the lookout.

Even if the Easters had swapped phones, the records put Kent Easter at the scene.

Guess where her cellphone is? Duff said. By the victims house. Oops.

This seemed to catch the defense flat-footed. Because he had already finished his closing argument, it was too late for Bienert to try to convince jurors this was junk science. After the jury left the room, he railed against the prosecutor. He said he had been sandbagged.

Duff replied that Easters team had had the phone records for years.

Either the defense had not looked at the records, Duff said, or was hoping that I didnt look at the records.

Judge Thomas Goethals saw no reason Duff couldnt save a good argument for the end.

Dear Mr 

We have been alerted via social media to an open letter from you addressed to Bassett, Chief Executive of the Electoral Commission. Although we have not yet received a copy of the letter, we thought it would be helpful for you to have an early response. I am responding on behalf of Bassett.

Under the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 (PPERA), there are controls on who can donate, lend money or give credit to political parties registered in Great Britain. These transactions must be recorded and, if above a certain amount, are reportable to us by political parties on a quarterly basis. We publish these reports on our website. Parties must only accept donations and/or loans from permissible, mainly UK-based sources.

To answer your specific questions:

1. Donors or lenders have no legal responsibility to report transactions to the Commission, therefore HSBC and IPGL did not and were not required to inform the Electoral Commission of these transactions

2. Our online register of donations and loans shows reported donations to the Conservative and Unionist Party from IPGL Limited. When accepting these donations, the Party was responsible for ensuring it was from a permissible source; there is nothing in your letter to suggest it was not.

3.   4. As we have not been presented with evidence that a breach of PPERA has occurred, we will not be taking further action in this matter. 

Please see our Enforcement Policy here for further details, in particular chapter six for details regarding how the Commission handles allegations. The other matters that you have raised regarding governance at IPGL Limited are not matters for the Electoral Commission.

I hope this information is useful. If you require any further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact the Commission.

Yours sincerely

Head of Regulation </TEXT>

	<TEXT> CNN has refused to run an ad made by President Donald Trumps team due to its labeling of several prominent news anchors as fake news.

The ad was made to celebrate Trumps first 100 days in office, including a list of things he has accomplished since his inauguration. The narrator in the ad then says, You wouldnt know it from watching the news. It then features images of CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, MSNBC anchor Rachel Maddow, and others along with the graphic reading fake news.

CNN requested that the advertiser remove the false graphic that the mainstream media is fake news,' CNN said in a statement. The mainstream media is not fake news, and therefore the ad is false and per policy will be accepted only if that graphic is deleted.

Michael Glassner, the executive director of Donald J. Trump for President Inc. called CNNs refusal to air the ad shamful.

It is absolutely shameful to see the media blocking the positive message that President Trump is trying to share with the country, Glassner said in a statement. Its clear that CNN is trying to silence our voice and censor our free speech because it doesnt fit their narrative. </TEXT>

...

There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from balconies. Many of these incidents have involved British nationals under the influence of drink or drugs. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place while youre under the influence of drink or drugs. Some local councils will impose fines to those caught behaving irresponsibly on balconies or practising balconing.

If I can get a successful block or grapple I'd have better odds on stabbing them in return and stopping the attack or be able to run away. Or even if I do get stabbed I can slow them down with stab back or keep the amount of stabs down to a minimum. However this is in a 'I cannot run' scenario.

	<TEXT> volunteers have been terrible for libraries. Librarians do more than just shush and hand out fines. 

Some of the duties can be they have to organize and update the stock (which they currently has been no money for due to cuts that fuels their death cycle), run projects to modernize the library (like increasing digital content or expanding into new areas), archive important local knowledge and books which are not digital yet, organize repairs and IT systems, set up rooms for community education and clubs, maintain a quiet study and work space etc. 

Why you need a qualification be a librarian and even universities have to funding and pay staff to keep knowledge and services running. It's same in the public but they handle a much wider group to think about than students.   </TEXT>

I'd say still good follow up to the last film. Great bad guy really felt emotional part of the reveal so well set up.

Badish (but doesn't ruin the movie). Groot almost got annoying i still laughed though. Lots of jump cuts to other scenes which was bit jarring. Almost too much exposition  </TEXT>
