First time he said i just needed to get a job and that i'd be fine. 

Second time he actually listened to me and diagnosed me.

Sadly it took me a year between visits as I was terrified if being brushed off again.  </TEXT>

I know when my mother found out she made me show her them. I was at a restaurant at the time and was very uncomfortable. 

She also brings it up from time to time and it annoys me. 

I used it as a coping method, but since starting my anti-depresants the thoughts of doing that shit again have gone away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One on the side of my hand from breaking into my own house. 

See i had locked myself out of my house in summertime and it was hot out. I realized that my cats were locked inside my bedroom and i had to get inside to them. 

So i took a hammer from my garage and smashed the basement window open, pulled out the glass with my hand and cut myself accidently. Ended up seeing the white globs in my flesh, and bled for 15 minutes. Got back to the side if the house and then crawled through the window and played with my cats. 


Another scar is on my foot from when i tried running through a field at school. See some asshole had placed pencils sticking straight up in the ground and I just happened to run over one. Got it lodged through my shoe and into my foot. It was not a fun tine walking after that happened. 

Thankfully I had surgery a few months back to get the pencil lead removed and can now walk with little to no pain now. 

I have a scar on my stomach where I was cut open as a child and had a feeding tube put in. Also they cuffed my stomach as I threw up a lot. So now i an unable to. 

And the last scars are on my forearm from self harm.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would take the death note in a heartbeat. 

Think about it, you are being held hostage, so just put their name in it and they die. Perfect solution. 

Or long line in front of you? Well just whip out your death note and kill them all :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if they count as celebrities, but I won a day trip out to Disneyland in Florida. I got to meet the mickey mouse people, they were fun.

My mother entered a contest while i was out, and then i got a letter in the mail months later and almost pee'd myself.
I was so happy, got to hangout at fucking Disneyland for the day with free food and free rides.

I got a special wristband to skip the lines on all the rides, was a blast. </TEXT>
