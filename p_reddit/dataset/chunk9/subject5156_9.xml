	<TEXT> r/legomarket is pretty active, especially people looking for star wars stuff. The light up figures are probably the most valuable: Luminara-$20, Vader-$24 and Mace Windu-$23 according to bricklink. Ki-Adi Mundi is worth about $12 and the blue 501 clone tropper about $7.50. Captain rex can be $15+. Most of the other plain clones and stormtroopers are worth about $2-$5 probably. Some of the rarer R2 units are valuable too, R8-B7 is worth about $12. Battle droids are worth about $1 each, a bit more for the super battle droids. </TEXT>

The ship is 100% complete. But only comes with two minifigures, Jack Sparrow and Will Turner.

Looking for $200 via paypal which does not include shipping. Would prefer only to ship to CONUS.

Would consider trades of equal value as well,  either modulars or Star Wars.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, if it's so easy to 2* and so hard to 3* I would think there would be a lot of tied wars, so % would play a big factor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They added the extra 30 seconds in the same update that added the poison spell. Since troops didn't run away from the poison spell, you could clear a clan castle in just a few seconds. I think they took away the extra 30 seconds to balance out the fact that it really didn't take any time to lure and kill clan castles. Now that troops run out of poison spells and you have to actually spend time luring and killing clan castle troops, I think they should add the 30 seconds back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a unique figure, only released in that one set. There are a lot of people who only collect star wars minifigures, so if they want to complete their sets, they need a Darth Malgus. It's basically a function of supply an demand. Any minifigures that were only released in one set can go for a premium. Another example is Queen Amidala from set 9499. It can fetch close to $50. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Schmi's statement isn't ambiguous at all. Why did Anakin never try to find his father? Why is there never any mention of his father at all? Deadbeat or not, as the most powerful force user in the galaxy, he probably would have wanted to find his father at some point, even if it was just to kill him for abandoning him. From the canon section wookiepedia article on Anakin Skywalker "Believed to have been conceived by the Force, he was born to Shmi Skywalker and moved to the Outer Rim world of Tatooine at a young age, where he and his mother were slaves." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is way more evidence of a virgin birth than just a deadbeat father. His midiclorians levels are off the charts. Schmi says there was no father. He's the Chosen One, declared by a prophecy. There's the obvious Jesus Christ comparison. And then add the conversation with Palpatine talking about how Plageus created life...while sitting in front of a giant egg with sperm flying into it. I don't think it could be any more clear. Also, in the 2012 Darth Plageus novel (no longer cannon, but whatever) "Using his newfound power to heal his own body, Plagueis decided to take his powers further and reached out to the midi-chlorians across the galaxy in order to gain dominance over them, but the Force resisted his efforts and refused. In response, the midi-chlorians acted of their own accord and conceived a child within the Human slave Shmi Skywalker." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure exactly what you mean by the reliability of Bricklink, but I've made multiple purchases, mostly smaller lots of individual bricks or minifigs and have never had an issue. You can see how many sales a store has had and view feedback just like ebay. Obviously buying from a new store with little feedback is riskier than buying from an established store. To answer your other questions:

1. Ebay is probably the most reliable. It has protections for buyers and sellers. Prices tend to be higher on ebay due to fees. Bricklink is probably the second most reliable since it is an established marketplace. I've never sold on bricklink, only bought. Prices tend to be lower than ebay. There's also r/Legomarket which I have made multiple purchases on. There's a feedback system so you can see how many successful trades/sales people have had. Prices tend to be equal or a little lower than bricklink, since most users know about bricklink and use it to find values of sets.

1. The best way to ship completed lego sets is to take them apart and put the pieces in ziplock bags. Depending on the size of the set, you can either send it in a padded envelope, (usually about $2.50 in the CONUS) or in one of those USPS flatrate boxes. I think the smallest size is $6.80 to ship. You can use newspaper, packing peanuts, or really anything else as padding.

1. Depends on how much you value your time. It can take a long time to make sure sets are 100% complete, but those are the sets that will get you the most money. The 6 month average sale price for the UCS yoda is $287 on bricklink, and the AT-TE is $100.
