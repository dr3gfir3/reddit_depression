	<TEXT> This is so true. The same resume should not be submitted for all job applications. Recruiters (mostly not familiar with the field) use keyword search software to make a shortlist.

	<TEXT> Red: never cook as they taste sulfuric. Only use raw.

White: lower sugar content and milder flavor (compared to yellow). excellent for marinading and when strong onion flavor is not required. Used a lot in Mexican cooking. Use both raw and cooked.

Yellow: The best of all. Has highest sugar content and caramelized brilliantly. Don't use raw. </TEXT>

http://www.cookingandme.com/2016/06/kerala-fish-pickle-recipe-meen-achar.html

The only twist was poaching the fish in a curry paste made with all the gradients (instead of frying the fish). This way it will be much less oily which I prefer. I used frozen salmon!. This curry is an excellent way to cover for cheap frozen fish.  </TEXT>
