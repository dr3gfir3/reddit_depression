President and all of senate assassinated in capitol--blamed on Islamic terrorists...better suspend the constitution while we figure this all out. Suspend immigration. In fact, let's get the Jews outta here...they have their own country. Let's look to Jesus for redemption. Divorces are illegal now...in fact, 2nd marriages are illegitimate. Let's get rid of these gender traitors too--gotta purify our society. In fact, let's start from scratch...too many ladies are working right now, let's just suspend that...just for a bit. </TEXT>

Finishing up [**Judas by Amos Oz**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28114464-judas), audiobook. It's on the longlist for the same prize. I know the shortlist is out, but I wanna get a couple more under my belt before I see what made it. </TEXT>

I seem to recall making an argument about the book *addressing* racism and colonization which in hindsight seems obvious. I'l have to read it again.

	<TEXT> Are you exclusively used? Will you be able to order new books? Are you eventually moving to new book sales to become a hybrid? I worked in both new and used, and one hybrid. The hybrid really did it the best, I think, because it was able to cater to virtually every taste and desire. I'll tell you what the used bookstore did wrong: inattention to their inventory. Books would come in continually and be distributed to section leaders, but they would just sit. I had my own sections that I was constantly trying to prune and improve, and circulate, create new displays, etc. While others wouldn't do anything until a book moved out. Keep it lively, that way returning customers don't feel like they're looking at the same dead space every time.  
  
Also, if you buy and sell records, play some in the store. That's some great atmosphere.  
  
One of the things I got to do was podcasts: I would play book-related podcasts for a couple hours a day (this was at the hybrid), and we'd get a few sales from people hearing interviews with authors or hearing about a new book. Some we'd have to special order. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I *just* finished that book. It was fantastic. It really juxtaposes how the things we do everyday without a second thought or take for granted (visiting our mothers, spending a weekend with our grandchildren, raising a 2 year old, planting a tree in your backyard) with how they are done there and adds a new, malevolent--even riskier--element. These stories feel significant even though they are the minutest plots, and feel very important. </TEXT>

The [Longlist for this award](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/110598._Best_Translated_Book_Award_For_Fiction_Longlist_2017) is always 25 books plus so it's a big ask...the shortlist is a little more manageable.

	<TEXT> [**Judas by Amos Oz**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28114464-judas), audiobook. I'm starting to get through the [Man Booker International Prize Longlist](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/109710.The_Man_Booker_International_Prize_2017_Longlist), and this is my second title from that list.  
  
[**Black Moses by Alain Mabanckou**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32072988-black-moses), book. This is my third title from that long list. Set in an orphanage in the Congo, its a little funny, a little bittersweet, a little depressing.  
  
[**The Accusation: Forbidden Stories from Inside North Korea by Bandi**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30358510-the-accusation), book. Somehow, someone is writing short fiction *inside* North Korea (Bandi is a pseudonym), and it has been smuggled out for publication in South Korea, and now translated into English. These stories are affecting portraits of every day life in North Korea, and about how the things we do everyday without a second thought or take for granted (visiting our mothers, spending a weekend with our grandchildren, raising a 2 year old, planting a tree in your backyard), all take on a new, harrowing --even life or death--element when set in North Korea. These stories feel significant even though they are the minutest plots. </TEXT>
