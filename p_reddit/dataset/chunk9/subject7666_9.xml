	<TEXT> Bookstores? I've been buying Pratchett since I found a used copy of "Strata" and since I was a Niven fan at the time and this was a parody of "Ringworld," I went for it. A few years later I heard about Discworld -- he was three books in by then -- and I started buying them as they came out. Little tricky in the states since this was way-pre-Amazon, I had to order import copies from a science fiction bookstore in California. Worth it. There are a couple missing from the shelves, on loan to my housemate.

Gaiman I've loved since "Sandman" and have been buying his stuff on sight since. Some of his rarer stuff I have as ebooks, thanks to his recent HumbleBundle sale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At a con in Florida years back, I got to talk to him for awhile at his booth when there was a break in the action and he was pleasant, funny, friendly, and maybe a little tipsy but not something I really noticed (this was before his problems were public). I was surprised at how muscular he was, since Xander wasn't known for his bulk and the show hadn't been over for that long. Came away thinking he was a really nice, fun guy.

But at a Whedonverse panel later in the day, he was clearly drunk and disruptive.  Nathan Fillion led the panel and did an excellent job of keeping him focused, but it was awkward to watch.

[Here's part of the panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK5E1Z_yKwk). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've taken pictures like anyone else, all my life, but in 2009[ I went to a Jon Bon Jovi concert](http://imgur.com/a/vQoDq) and shot pictures so my wife could relax and just watch the show, and I really liked how they turned out. That led to shooting local live concerts and then into portrait photography as a PT job.

Looking at the pics now I want to slap my younger me upside the head and teach him about framing and light, but I still like the energy and colors. 

What was the image you shot that made you stop and think you might really want to do this some more? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I re-read a lot. When I was younger it was because I couldn't afford to keep buying new books and couldn't always get to the library, but now maybe every 3rd or 4th I read is likely one I've read before. They're like old friends.

Some books I tend to re-read every year or every couple of years, the way you'd rewatch a favorite movie. Sometimes a new book will come out in a series and I'll get motivated to go back and reread the rest (a bit of a problem with Discworld and Spencer books, after awhile). Sometimes something will trigger a memory of a passage I really like and I'll find myself picking the book up again just to get that feeling again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Older science fiction fans know him. When science fiction went wild and weird and surrealistic in the late 60s and 70s, he was in the middle of it, and it's hard to say a Hugo winner and World Fantasy Award winner who was nominated for many more awards was never read.

I think there are several answers as to why he's all but forgotten now. I think because his work was so uncategorizable, he was harder to market and harder to place. I think that readers tend to pick a favorite in any given area, and Phillip K. Dick seems to have grabbed the trippy writer gig while Robert Sheckley owned science fiction humor then and Douglas Adams took it over in the 80s. I think that his work didn't lend itself well to movies or TV so his name never got much farther than the sf bookshelves. All guesses, of course.

Lafferty has been described as a writers' writer. He didn't hit the big leagues himself, but he inspired many who did.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Motor Girl" lets him bring some silliness into a story with some pretty dark themes and I think it lets him stretch his muscles a little bit. He can be cartoony and complicated.

I think I like "Rachel Rising" a bit more than "Echo," which was great but was also a fairly straight-forward story. Can't say if I like "Motor Girl" more than either, it's early days yet. But I'm loving it so far.

(None of these match "Strangers in Paradise," which has to be judged separately, like a great novel compared to great short stories.) </TEXT>

 Can I be obsessed with taking the perfect picture of The Batman, the one that defines him forever? Which would, of course, require me to place innocent people in peril and then wait in just the right location to capture his heroism, and then endanger more and more people because the first pics didn't come out the way I wanted and I was peeved I didn't catch his leg just right and his cape needs a bit more flourish welp better sabotage another commuter train </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since he is talented with Photoshop, I'm going to take some unsubstantiated guesses why someone would impose that limitation on themselves.

* He might like seeing the image immediately, right there and then.
* He might like the challenge of doing it in camera, the extra manic desperation of trying to *get it right* that can sometimes trigger aha moments like poses that he might not have thought of otherwise.
* He might get results that wouldn't occur to him to add in Photoshop. Maybe a secondary reflection of the light off an arm back onto the body, or a glow through the skin or something, that would only be discovered by actually doing the thing rather than trying to create it later.

Or he's pretentious. No idea. But he shoots amazing stuff and if that's how it works for him, more power to him. </TEXT>

(Not gonna pirate it, but starting to understand the impulse.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had found unpretty's work and burned through her superhero fics and onto her [Avatar: Legend of Korra stuff](https://archiveofourown.org/works/2808119) and just kept going, even though I had never seen any Avatar and had only a passing idea who any of the characters were. Enjoyed it enough to start watch the show.

	<TEXT> Been googling and apparently, our happy little flowers are wedelias, and are considered an invasive species where we live in central Florida. Haven't noticed them moving beyond the front of the yard where they've been for a couple years now -- not invading the neighbors or anything -- so we'll probably leave them be. We haven't been tending beyond removing fallen branches or occasionally pulling some vines out to keep them from strangling the other plants and even that's something we do maybe two or three times a year.

	<TEXT> We have a patch of yellow wildflowers that have grown wild in our front yard. Everything has, really; when we moved in the area had just been carved out of the woods and we liked the wild look, so we've left our yard untended and wildlife-friendly. 

But we had a hard freeze this winter and the flowers died off. Now they're starting to come back but the plants are still covered in dead leaves. For the health of the flowers, are we better off cutting off the dead leaves, leaving them alone, or cutting them all back to the ground to grow fresh? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One morning a decade or so back I had been cut off in traffic and had to swerve to avoid a wreck, and I was furious. Just, screaming in the car, ready to punch somebody furious. I drove into the city and passed a church and the ubiquitous sign outside said something like, "You can use anger, but rage always uses you."

Cliched, hokey, and *exactly* what I needed to see at that moment. My rage just drained out of me. I pulled over and just laughed at myself for a few minutes, and ever since I may get annoyed or aggravated at other drivers, I don't let them get to me. I even started driving more defensively and made sure I always had space around me on the highway, even if I had to slow down to get it. Best church advice this atheist ever got. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just explaining something doesn't qualify as "mansplaining." To truly mansplain, it has to hit the following qualifications:

* It must be unrequested.
* It must be delivered to a person who already knows it, and may possibly know more about it than the mansplainer.
* It should include some element of condescension, since there's clearly no way a woman would know this.
* It must come from a man who either does not notice, accept or really care that the listener already knows it.

The last one really nails it. Absolutely there is mansplaining and women bear the largest brunt of it, although truly egregious mansplainers will do it to anyone, male and female alike.  </TEXT>

Considering how much military sci-fi I've read, thinking back on it, I think I'm still fine reading military sci-fi that focuses on people rather than tactics and great big weapons.

	<TEXT> Terry Pratchett story: Saw him at Necronomicon in Tampa many years back, brought a suitcase of books to be signed (I went through the line three times so as not to hog him). A friend with me didn't own any of his books but really wanted to get something signed, so I suggested we stop by a market and grab something random. "Hand him a box of cereal," I said, "and say 'I really admire your work.' See what he says."

I got my first load of books signed while I stammered something at him, and then she thrust a box of Captain Crunch forward, with her compliments. He looked at her for maybe 10 seconds, then grinned and signed it "Yum, yum. Terry Pratchett."

She spent years after that, taking the box to conventions and getting it signed by various science fiction writers and actors. It's still sitting proudly on her shelf. </TEXT>

Odds are good that people in this sub are, generally, heavier readers than most, with a better likelihood of a wider range of interests.

	<TEXT> Terry Pratchett used "strata" in most of his early books (and his first ur-Discworld book was named "Strata.") Not a word I hear a lot and it kept popping up.

An unreasonable number of Robert J. Sawyer's main characters in this time period are scientists or professors who like the same pop culture and all obsess on Star Trek to the point where an episode or quote from the show becomes an essential element in Sawyer's book. I like his work, but seriously, dude, meet some new people.
