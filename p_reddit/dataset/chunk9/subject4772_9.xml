	<TEXT> Am about to make a substantial order with a online liquor retailer and am looking at grabbing a nice scotch.


I believe I like most scotches and intensely peated ones like Ardbeg 10 but the only sherry cask one iv'e had was Glenfiddich 12yr which I disliked. 


So out of these three what is best value or very special and a must try scotch in AUD dollars.


Bunnahabhain 12yr - $91
Dalwhinnie 15yr - $87
Glengoyne 12yr - $72

When they test screened the movie, it wasn't going over well so they practically begged diesel to do the cameo. On his condition that he personally gets to keep the car from that cameo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only good FF movie is Tokyo Drift.

1) Interesting location.

2) Interesting characters.

3) A plot where they are grounded, not take down the Colombian druglord and hardest heist in the world nonsense.

4) It was about babes and importantly cars.

5) Stunts, cinematography and soundtrack were A+.


Only nitpick was the supporting actress not being a very good actor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I recall correctly in one of those seven losses they were up against the cowboys and got out to a 18-0 lead within 25mins... but proceeded to concede a shitload of points and not score themselves again.

	<TEXT> To be fair was what they were doing before working in the first place?

I thought attack was good, Dragons just nailed every 1on1 tackle and warriors were never able to build pressure through their kicking game either.

But hell that try where dugan ran through mannering and lillyman was not the coaches fault. I even saw the player outside lillyman shove him to cover the gap as if anticipating it but he budged an inch and stood like a statue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was thinking how as tech advances and we get stuff like siri but actually useful, hearing Tommy's voice would be heartmelting.

Imagine getting into your self driving car and hearing Tommy say "Oh hai (users name) where does my best friend want to go today?" and as your driving along a random "Anyway, hows your sex life?" drops or "You look so sexy today".

Also saw Francos movie 'Why Him' and he has an AI home assistant with Kaley Cuoco's voice... I realize it's fictional but that's the idea!

I hope he might be up for something like this if he get's a good paid offer to read the words and lines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IKR! also everyone saying "he needs to take control more and get involved" don't get he shouldn't be running the ball on every 3rd/4th tackle, he's the first choice kicker and needs to pick his opportunities to run.

He's insanely clutch and did everything he could the last three games, literally took it into his own hands to take the lead back heading into the final 15mins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is when the warriors would throw the ball around they push passes that are not on, make errors etc. and invite the opposition to attack.

And i'll be critical in saying jungle ball was not working for them the last x5 years... the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over but expecting a different result.

	<TEXT> I also liked it! but it was far from being a "great" movie. Last year the Horror genre would had about x5 "great" movies with the witch going down in time as a masterpiece.

I just wished comedy had that kind of productivity, i really feel like it's producing 1-2 great movies a year when I know it should be doing better than that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bad Moms, Bad Santa 2, Zoolander 2, Mike and Dave, Dirty Grandpa and Office Christmas Party are the examples of uninspired and easy to write comedy i'm seeing a trend of.

There have been some standouts like Popstar, What we do in the shadows and everybody wants some etc. But they only come in like at 1-2 great movies in a year!
