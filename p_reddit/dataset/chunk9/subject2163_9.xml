	<TEXT> Thanks for the suggestion! I actually took them back to Hockey Giant and they suggested the same. I'm gonna duck tape over my blisters and skate in them a few more times just to make sure they don't need to be broken in. The place I took them to get punched said I should skate in them a bit longer before altering the skate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Give it a try man! I was so proud when I learned how to play. I may be a bit biased but I think hockey is one of the hardest sports to play/master. Some people can barely skate on ice, let a lone play a full contact sport while doing it. Being a hockey player is one of the most rewarding things I've done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my best friends suffered from depression, abused pills and had an alcohol addiction so I can sympathize. I admire people like you who can overcome that using something they love. Keep doing what you do man! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's an amazing story man. There's nothing quite like playoff hockey! I'm glad you're doing better and that hockey also pulled you out of that dark place. Keep your head up and know that the greatest game ever is always here for you. </TEXT>
