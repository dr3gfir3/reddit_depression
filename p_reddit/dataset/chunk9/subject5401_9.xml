	<TEXT>  This may come as a shock to you, but when a black person dies due to foul play, 99% of the time, it has nothing do with race.

LMAO this told me everything i need to know about you...get out of your troll lair every once in a while and stop being willfully ignorant you sound somewhat intelligent so its kinda sad...i dont need to do anything to divert from the fresno massacre...the white supremacists do it there damn selves lol...like the guy who stabbed a random black dude with a sword to send a MESSAGE </TEXT>
