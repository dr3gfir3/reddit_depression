	<TITLE> Daily Acid Reflux </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi all. With my psychiatrist's help, I recently weaned off the Zoloft I've taken for the past year to help with my GAD and depression. I have recently started having acid reflux multiple times throughout the day from the time I wake up to when I go to sleep, with breaks during the day when I'm too busy to think about it. It's terrible and makes me nauseous. During my depressive episode before the Zoloft, I developed IBS but that felt very different.

I'm not sure if it's related to coming off Zoloft, a dietary thing, or connected to my anxiety. It's really been bothering me and my next check in with my psychiatrist isn't until next Wednesday. What do you guys think? Have any of you had experiences with something like this?

Edit: There is a slim chance that my digestive issues are being caused by Acticlate which I am taking for my acne, but it would still be nice to know if anyone else here has experienced this due to anxiety. My GAD makes me a bit of a hypochondriac and I never know what to believe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Random people asked me to play comp with them and I agreed, playing characters they asked me to.  My gut told me not to try ranking this time around... I should stop trying to be so nice.  I scored gold the last two times before!  What happened?! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Teaching is a profession of passion. No one can tell you whether or not you'll be a good teacher, it's about whether or not your heart is in it. Even if the kids walk all over you because you're nice, classroom management skills can be learned if you have the right mindset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great recommendation. Subbing can help you become familiar with different age levels and give you a feel for how much you enjoy teaching. You also have the ability to make your own schedule at some places, so you can go to school at the same time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I broke down crying for hours this one day. My principal told me to go to the doctor where I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder and major depression. I managed with meds, 2 weeks of mandated group therapy when I want allowed to work, individual therapy, and by leaving that particular school. </TEXT>

When I gave the word door, he answered whore. </TEXT>
