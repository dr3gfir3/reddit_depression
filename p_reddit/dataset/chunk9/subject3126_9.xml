	<TEXT> I just got it a week ago and haven't finished training so they aren't paying me right now.

All money I get goes into food - they don't buy food as they eat out - and the animals, otherwise the animals will live in squalor and starve. When I buy myself some food for the week they just eat it all anyway, so what money I do get I put into buying a sandwich and crisps for that day so I can finally eat something. I've been trying to get by with selling short stories and the odd piece of art, but it's not much.

I'm sorry if that doesn't make sense. I can't stop crying right now. </TEXT>
