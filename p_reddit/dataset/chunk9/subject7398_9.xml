	<TEXT> Of course not, I was being facetious. I just kinda think its funny the buck stops with the VHS stars. Jesus it's not like porn stopped after the VCR was surpassed by laser disc, DVD, internet streaming, virtual reality. All porn stars are like professional athletes in my opinion. You have a few great years, then you retire and figure out what to do with the rest of your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its all a fucking sham the WSJ created to stab at youtube. There are some videos that show the journalist who published the articles photoshopped images of ads onto the videos that came out almost a year ago. Those videos never made any ad revenue because youtube cited the racist titles and removed ads. One dead give away was the view count that did not change between different ads. How can multiple ads play to the same viewer on one viewing? Doesn't work that way on youtube. Nice try WSJ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually there is. I compost and use a tractor to cultivate about 300lbs of it into the soil about 30-60 days before planting. So the soil isn't "hot". The soil in this picture is a little damp so it looks a lot more red and dark as opposed to when the surface is dry. </TEXT>
