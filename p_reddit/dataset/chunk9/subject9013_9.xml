	<TEXT> If you ask someone to rank their five sense by importance, smell is probably near the bottom. Sure, it's great to avoid odors that are unpleasant, but this quote from the article shows how much smell can impact someone's life in unexpected ways:
I joke I cant smell my daughters diaper. But I cant smell my daughter. She was up at 4 oclock this morning. I was holding her, we were laying in bed. I know what my son smelt like as a little baby, as a young kid. Sometimes not so good, but he still had that great little kid smell to him. With her, Ive never experienced that. </TEXT>
