	<TEXT> You know what comedy on Reddit is like? It's like the end of *Murder on the Orient Express*. 

(Spoilers)

At the end of that story, we learn that the murder was not committed by one person, but by thirteen people: *"They took it into their own hands to serve as Cassetti's executioners... Each of the suspects stabbed Cassetti once, so that no one could know who delivered the fatal blow."*

And on Reddit, one person isn't guilty of killing the joke through overuse. **Everyone** is guilty, and the person who delivers the fatal blow may be using the joke for the first time. It's everyone's fault for having said it so much, not one person's fault. 

When it comes to driving a Reddit joke into the ground, the **group** is guilty, but the **individual** is innocent. The individual may very well be making that joke for the first time; it's the group that overused it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the ending, because it shows the shortcomings in Vincent's approach. 

Vincent has spent the whole movie tightly controlling everything around him, wielding all the power, zeroed in on his goal. But then, in that [final shootout](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMS4lYA-hEo) between Vincent and Max, there's a subway door between them. The middle of the door is metal, with windows on either side. 

And Vincent, because he's always been controlling, precise, and aiming for center mass, fires dead-on, straight for the middle -- and his bullets are blocked by the metal of the door. 

Meanwhile, Max, who was been unprepared and improvising throughout the whole movie, fires wildly and blindly -- and his bullets go through the windows, hitting Vincent, killing him.

You can see it [here](https://youtu.be/EMS4lYA-hEo?t=9s): Vincent's bullets dent the metal door in the middle, while Max's bullets shatter the windows on either side.

The script describes the moment like this: 

 "Max screaming, face lit only by the GUNFIRE, clumsy in how he holds Vincent's H+K, firing one-handed, not aiming, not looking where he's shooting...Vincent's Para-Ordnance BOOMING OUT MASSIVE ERUPTIONS OF FLAME..."

Improvisation beats control. Max kills Vincent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thoughts:

- The opening bit sounds pretty obviously like a young guy faking an old man voice. 

- "We are a show that discusses the paranormal, conspiracies, the supernatural, UFOs, and anything else weird, from serial killers to cults." Why put "serial killers" and "cults" **after** the list of topics? It's like you're saying: "the paranormal, conspiracies, the supernatural, UFOs, etc... and serial killers and cults."

- (Also, "the paranormal" and "the supernatural" are basically the same thing.)

- The narrator's EMPHASIS is a bit EXAGGERATED, like he's getting PUNCHED in the STOMACH on EVERY other WORD.  

- The background drone sounds really cool.

- The promo definitely gets everything across, but as for funny? Not so much -- there's not really a chance to be funny, because it's all information. 

- I take it you're familiar with *The Outer Limits*, and that show's opening credits? Might as well learn from the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suppose I'll start things off here, at the eleventh hour. 

*Archive 81* has a killer premise: it's succinct, it's dramatic, it poses an interesting mystery right here in the first episode. The atmosphere is outstanding, and the characters all feel different (something other audio dramas have struggled with)

But what it's not doing is building. Instead of **escalating** its story, *Archive 81* is **reiterating** its story. It is adding another strange element to the pile, rather than taking another step in the journey.

I read movie scripts for a living, and one of the most common problems I see is a story that's lingering on the starting line, reiterating its state of affairs, but neglecting to move forward. We know our characters, and we know their situations -- so what's next? These scripts drift for thirty or forty pages, before beginning the main story around the halfway point.

And unfortunately, *Archive 81* seems to be falling into the same trap. Six episodes in, it's still setting the stage.

It makes me think of *Limetown*, and why that podcast was such a success, and I think it's because each episode took a step forward: each new episode advanced the narrative it began with, and revealed more and more information **relevant to its core premise** (i.e. the vanishing town). And that's what *Archive 81* isn't quite doing: we can't tell how all this information is relevant, because it doesn't seem to be related to the core premise (i.e. Daniel's disappearance).

So when I hear Daniel talking with a rat, or when Melody questions a security guard, or when Carlos walks us through meditations, or when Melody tracks down an un-recordable man, or when an announcer describes Cassandra Wall's bizarre artifacts (the sound design in that chapter was incredible, by the way) -- I'm left wondering what this has to do with the core premise. Everything feels somewhat connected... but not connected enough. *Archive 81* is caught in a slightly uncomfortable middle ground between an anthology series and a serial narrative.

How does each new episode build upon the information from the previous episodes? How does the story advance, upon a path *that we can identify*? That's the important part: there may very well be master game plan here, but we can't see it, and we don't know it's there. And this means that the only story unity we'll ever feel, is one that we feel in *retrospect*, as we're **told** that all the previous stories were connected -- but they don't feel connected now. 

And I'm worried, because I like this podcast, but I have the feeling that *Archive 81* is painting itself into a corner by introducing more and more (seemingly) unrelated elements in each episode. And we have to remember all of them, because we don't know which elements are important and which aren't. We can't focus on the important stuff, because we can't tell what the important stuff is.

*Archive 81* isn't following one story; it's following twenty. And maybe all these stories will tie together in future episodes. But until then, it is -- as the title of the fourth episode explicitly states -- a collection of disparate strangeness. And that makes me... kinda nervous.

	<TEXT> (Forgetting for a moment the fact that a modern remake of *Scarface* is currently in production-ish). 

Read a lot of scripts. It sounds like a dismissive answer, but it's really the best thing you could do. Pick a movie that you think *works* -- not just a movie you *like*. A movie that made you say, *Wow, this story comes together really well.* Then find the script for that movie and read it.

In addition to that, watch these three movies (and read the scripts for them): *Chinatown* (1974), *Superman* (1978), and *The King's Speech* (2010). Because all three of those movies run like clockwork.

Then, write up an outline for the movie you want to make. Make sure each scene leads into the next scene. Make sure the characters are active, and not reactive. What do the characters want, how can they get it, and what's standing in their way? 

Make the scenes dramatic, and remember: **Drama is a battle over power**. Maybe one character has the power and the other character/s try to take the power away, [like in this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4PE2hSqVnk), or [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7LsBMA-rKg), or [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lydYhl1982Y). Maybe the power distinctly transfers from one character to another, [like in this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFHYiOfBRng), or [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARJ8cAGm6JE).

Once you've got the outline written and finessed, download Celtx or WriterDuet (or Final Draft, if you can afford it) and translate that outline into script form. Match the formatting of some established scripts closely, because formatting matters: spacing, margins, how to write scene headings, how to use parentheticals. 

After the script is done, put it away for a few weeks, and then dust it off and read it. Revise it, based on what works and what doesn't work. 

And then do it all over again with your next idea.

And as for getting the script made... that's a whole different ballgame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *The Black Tapes* podcast, because the premise is inherently flawed: exploring *video* tapes in an *audio* medium. 

And I know exactly what that podcast is trying to do. It's like they always say: the monster in your imagination is a thousand times more scary than any monster you could see. But since it's an audio podcast, we're **already** using our imagination to fill in the blanks, and relying so heavily on video footage (that we can't see) doesn't make it any deeper. 

All it does, is force us to wait until the video footage is over, and then Alex Reagan comes in and recaps what just happened on the footage that we didn't see. And that's not good storytelling. Being **told** the plot points in retrospect via disinterested/collected voiceover is not as engaging as watching (or hearing) them unfold in the moment. *The Black Tapes* podcast is not using the strengths of its medium (as opposed to, say, *Archive 81*, which does recognize the fact that it's an audio podcast -- although there are some issues with that one too). 

And then there's the format of the show. The model for each episode seems to be: something weird happens, Alex Reagan thinks it's weird, but then Strand offers an explanation, and the script ends on this anti-climactic ambiguous note. The weirdness is never confirmed or dismissed; it's just "Maybe so, maybe not". *The Black Tapes* never takes a stand (unlike, say, *The X-Files*), and constantly has to reset to square one, because it's too afraid to change its world and take a step forward. 

After listening to the whole first season, the culmination of those twelve episodes was just another maybe. *Maybe* all the tapes are connected, *maybe* Strand's wife is still alive, *maybe* there's an enemy approaching in the form of Thomas Warren. So way to go, *The Black Tapes*, you wrote an eight-hour first act. 

I could write a dissertation on the things *The Black Tapes* does wrong. It's got such a great idea, but the execution is falling apart. </TEXT>
