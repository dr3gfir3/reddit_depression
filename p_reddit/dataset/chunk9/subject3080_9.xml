He's in the trees now. Needs to dig deep and just take each shot as it comes, and forget about everything else. </TEXT>

Haven't played more than a couple of rounds this year due to injury and too much stuff going on. I also have to drop my membership and find another course, because my local where I'm a member is now over an hour away. 

At least it's Masters week so that will keep my mind off things. Really looking forward to Thomas Pieters winning it this year!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi folks,

Are any of you members of country clubs in The Triangle area? I'm moving from Apex to Wake Forest, and I'm considering joining a country club in that area. I've been looking at the Henderson Country Club, The Hasentree Country Club, and The TPC Wakefield.  

Golf is the priority for me, with somewhere to swim and workout as secondary.

Can someone recommend a club that's worth joining?

Thanks! </TEXT>

There's days like today when I'd love to pack in my job and set up an organisation to help kids that have recently come out as atheist and been thrown to the curb by their families, but I have my own family to provide for unfortunately. It happens all the fucking time, whether you're an ex muslim or ex christian. It's always the same bullshit. Religion is a fucking cancer.

	<TEXT> Friends, friends of friends, family. It was a weekly struggle on a thursday evening or a friday afternoon/evening until my sister's mate started working in the off license. 

It was awkward because the bar we drank in had an off license... so they thought I was 18 and I drank in there from 15 onwards. When it was finally my 18th birthday which we had at the bar the owner pulled me aside and wasn't too happy that I'd been drinking there for three years already.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I see atheists on here regularly equating atheism with belief. It has nothing to do with belief at all, it's a lack of belief "a-theist" and the clue is directly in the name of it.  

The example given by others was that I don't believe there's a saucer with a cup on it orbiting Pluto. My non belief is not a belief. It's a lack of belief. To say "you believe there isn't, and that's a belief' is inaccurate.

Semantics, sure. But it matters. 

I'm an anti-theist, not an atheist. Even if god revealed himself/herself/itself, I would reject their authority over me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work as an infosec engineer.

I'm really surprised the Notepad++ developers were pulling in DLLs and not verifying their signatures.

Also, just verifying if a DLL is signed isn't good enough - you should be verifying who signed it. I wouldn't be surprised if the CIA can spoof certs, or even probably sign their own DLLs. 

You really need to verify the DLL is signed by who it should be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Try being in Dublin, fuckin nightmare.

Try being in the USA. Moved from Ireland in 2011. They celebrate Paddy's "day" for a week here. The celebrations started last Friday and they're still going. 

I went to the ATM last night, and had to avoid an outdoor event in the car park of an Irish bar around the corner. Everyone decided to park in around the bank. I was very lucky not to run over a few kids. 

What is it with people bringing kids to drinking events? Fuck off you cunts! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a great game from a neutral point of view. Scotland fucked themselves from early on. Should have been a red card in the second minute.  

Scotland just never seed to be in control, didn't have enough of the ball. Weren't involved in the breakdown. 

Easy from England. Champions for a reason, they can kick on when needed.

Nervous for the game next week. If this weekend is anything to go by then Ireland should be destroyed in Dublin

	<TEXT> If you read Letters to a Young Contrarian, Hitchens will delve into subjects and authors that inspire him. It was from reading this little pamphlet that I discovered Emile Zola. Hitchens talks about The Dreyfus Affair, so I read that after I was done with Letters to a Young Contrarian.  

The best polemical essay I have ever read, is Zola's A Plea for the Jews. It's a timeless outstanding piece of work. 

Thomas Jefferson's writing is wonderful as well and was hugely influential to Hitchens, as was the brilliant Thomas Paine.

Hitch took influence from great literature as well. Orwell, Nabokov, Saul Bellow, John Updike, Charles Dickens, Martin Amis and his father  Kingsley Amis, Evelyn Waugh, P.G. Wodehouse, Graham Greene.  

If you want to think like Hitchens you need to understand C.L.R James' Dialectics. Hitchens built his life around understanding arguments from both sides.

Read all of Hitchens essays and his books. He tells you what makes him tick in Hitch-22. Read his reviews and essays on a wide range of subjects in Arguably. 

I could go on for hours about this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP, if you really want to piss your friend off you could tell him that people like him are directly responsible for the situation in the middle east today. 

They carved it up in the early 1900s. Iraq didn't exist in its current form until Gertrude Bell created the borders. 

They promised the land to both Palestinian Arabs and the Jews, and then left without settling it, which set the stage for war and created the current conflict between Israel and Palestine that we see today.  

And that's without even thinking about the African colonies.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I won't rest until I can quote paragraphs of what he has said and written. There's times when I'm having a conversation with someone and I know Hitchens talked about the same topic in an essay, and I can name the essay but can't recall exactly what he said. I can paraphrase it but I always butcher it. That's frustrating, and something I strive to get better at.  

If I can recommend some more books to you. Hitchens interviewed George Packer on the subject of Orwell -- Packer put together two editions of Orwell's essays. These are a must read as well. Hitchens knew Orwell's writing intimately... and when you get to know Orwell on that level, and you read Hitchens, you can see exactly where and how Orwell influenced his thinking.

The video of their chat is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGrLDs8EdCc

Please pick up the books as well. Enjoy! </TEXT>
