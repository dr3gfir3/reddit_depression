	<TEXT> I toyed with the idea of an oath for my Shepherds, but I'm undecided on whether or not to actually follow through. 

The Scriptures the Shepherds live by contain passages that can be interpreted as saying that oaths are not righteous (As I am incorporating a sort of Judeo-Christian worldview, the verses "Let your yes be yes and your no be no" come to mind, though I'm reading some interesting articles arguing otherwise at the moment)

In any case, in the event that I do decide to have an oath, it will be something like this:

*As surely as the Lord, God Creator, lives so I swear upon my soul this oath*

*With all my heart, I will serve the Monarch, Most High, with the strength of lions and the gentleness of lambs*

*With all my soul, I will hold the crook of the Shepherd, protecting the flock of the Lord, everything that is life.*

*With all my mind, I will learn, defending myself from evil, and defending the will of the Lord.*

*With all my strength, I will commit myself to the cause. I will protect the realms, until it is time for me to sleep.* 

*I will serve the Living Lord, God Creator, Monarch Most High, and Holiest Spirit* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, in the Bible, there's a few examples that can explain it.

The unnamed young man in the Gospel According to Luke, tells Jesus that he has kept the commandments all his life. Jesus says that this is good, but in order to gain eternal life, the man must sell all he has and give it to the poor. The young man walks away discouraged, for he has considerable wealth.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_and_the_rich_young_man

Susan does not want to make the sacrifices necessary. She likes material objects. And in both cases, the individuals meet Jesus/Aslan.

There's also the Parable of the Sower. The wheat (meaning Susan's faith) is planted, and cultivates, but is choked out by weeds (the ways of the world).

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_Sower

This one is pretty self-explanatory. Susan is caught up with "nylons and lipsticks and invitations" rather than the literally-everything-else, including Narnia.  </TEXT>

In all seriousness though, by all means, read them and enjoy them just as much as you did as a kid.

C.S. Lewis said it best:

When I was ten, I read fairy tales in secret and would have been ashamed if I had been found doing so. Now that I am fifty, I read them openly. When I became a man I put away childish things, including the fear of childishness and the desire to be very grown up.

	<TEXT> Thank you!

I never understood the confusion surrounding Susan's fate, given the foundation that had been set in the previous books.  

And I also think it's worth mentioning that C.S. Lewis did say that Susan could find her way back into Aslan's Country, "in her own time."

Considering this in the context of *Screwtape Letters,* where a demon tries to tempt a church-goer, I find it odd that people consider this Susan's final fate.

On that note, while a lot of people seem to like Neil Gaiman's short story "The Problem of Susan," which I find...bothersome. 

If anybody is interested in fan fiction for Susan that explores a different interpretation, you can't get much better than this:

	<TEXT> If the story of Christ was boring, then what kind of ultimate truth is that? He knows that's not a knockdown argument for the existence of God. But he thinks if the Christian story was dull, that would be evidence against it, so it matters to him that it isn't. For the record, I think he's right... whatever else you think about the Bible, it's a pretty damn good story.

	<TEXT> Oh, the crisis of faith/temptation in *Silver Chair* is one of my very favorite scenes in the entire saga.

(Context, the villain is using a spell that dulls the senses and try to convince the heroes that the city she has built far beneath the earth is the only world, and there is no Aslan. Puddlegump, a Marsh-wiggle [Sort of a frog-elf] objects)

"Suppose we have only dreamed, or made up, all those things  trees and grass and sun and moon and stars and Aslan himself. Suppose we have. Then all I can say is that, in that case, the made-up things seem a good deal more important than the real ones. Suppose this black pit of a kingdom of yours is the only world. Well, it strikes me as a pretty poor one. And that's a funny thing, when you come to think of it. We're just babies making up a game, if you're right. But four babies playing a game can make a play-world which licks your real world hollow. That's why I'm going to stand by the play-world. I'm on Aslan's side even if there isn't any Aslan to lead it. I'm going to live as like a Narnian as I can even if there isn't any Narnia." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it might help to put Susan into proper context:

Susan becomes a very vain and superficial person as an adult, and it was foreshadowed as far back as Prince Caspian, when she not only is the last of the children to see Aslan, she actively tells Lucy off for imagining things.

In Voyage of the Dawn Treader, she is allowed to go to America with her parents, because she "was the pretty one." She is also described as not being good at schoolwork, contrasting Peter, who is studying with Professor Kirke for examinations. Susan is being rewarded by the world, for the world's virtues. Virtues that are not necessarily in alignment with Aslan's.

In Last Battle, we learn that Susan is only interested in "invitations, nylons and lipsticks." She's a shallow young woman whose primary concern is social events. Compare this to Lucy, who loves Narnia most, or Jill, who has joined the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts, and is active in her community, directly because of her experiences in Narnia.

Most damningly, Susan laughs at the very idea of Narnia. She tells Eustace "fancy you still thinking about those games we played as children." </TEXT>

A few years back, there was a faith-based film called "To Save A Life," which focused on a teenager dealing with the aftermath of the suicide of a childhood friend. 

Now, I enjoyed "To Save A Life," but given that there has been a lot of criticism towards "13 Reasons Why," I wonder whether or not the film did more harm than good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Grimnoir Chronicles by Larry Correia.

Science fiction meets diesel punk meets noir meets superpowers.

The books are a heck of a lot of fun, but what makes it stand out to me most is the following exchange when the protagonist, a man with the power to manipulate gravity, is asked a question about President Roosevelt's plans for registration:

"FDR can go to hell. I'm a man. Not a type, not a number, and sure as hell not something that can be summed up as a logo to wear on my sleeve. A *man.* And I ain't registering *nothing.*" </TEXT>

Not necessarily. The Bible says not to cast your pearls before swine. It also says that believers may find themselves opposed to family members they love, but they must love God more.

But then, Lewis always had a very martial view of Christianity what with all the battles and killing. Didn't relate a lot to what Jesus preached.

Next to Billy Graham, I don't think there's a single person in the twentieth century who has done more for Christianity than C.S. Lewis. 

Did you ever actually read his non-fiction works? Lewis is far more complex than you give him credit for. </TEXT>

I agree, this is even worse. 

Hydra!Captain America sucks, because Captain America is the Paragon, the hero we're supposed to aspire to be. 

But Magneto is the vengeful villain that we're supposed to feel uneasy about, because we ask ourselves "How do we know we wouldn't do the same thing if what happened to him had happened to us."

How could they justify this?  </TEXT>

(Also, I'd argue that the MCU's version of Captain America is not a liberal, at least in the current sense of the use of the word. He seems above mere politics, in pursuit of what's right. If I had to describe him as anything, I'd say constitutionalist)

	<TEXT> So she lives her life in our world to the fullest--she was told outright she'd never get to be a queen in Narnia again. 

No. Susan lives life by the standards of the world. And the standards of the world are **not** the standards of Aslan. 

I'd agree with you assessment about Susan if the novel Prince Caspian didn't include that revelation from Aslan. She sort of had no choice but to give Narnia up.

It's a darned certainty that Aslan instructed her and Peter the same way that he instructed Edmund and Lucy later on, to take what they learned in Narnia and apply it to their home world. And to know Him by the name He has in their world.

Peter applied himself to his studies, while Susan shrugs off schoolwork as unimportant. 

Lucy and Jill apply what they learned in Narnia to their own lives--Jill joins the Scouts and takes up archery to be ready if the need ever comes again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That IS what happened. Thank you, SOMEBODY WHO ACTUALLY READ THE BOOKS!

To elaborate on your point:

Susan becomes a very vain and superficial person as an adult, and it was foreshadowed as far back as Prince Caspian, when she not only is the last of the children to see Aslan, she actively tells Lucy off for imagining things.

In Voyage of the Dawn Treader, she is allowed to go to America with her parents, because she "was the pretty one." She is also described as not being good at schoolwork, contrasting Peter, who is studying with Professor Kirke for examinations. Susan is being rewarded by the world, for the world's virtues. Virtues that are not necessarily in alignment with Aslan's.

In Last Battle, we learn that Susan is only interested in "invitations, nylons and lipsticks." She's a shallow young woman whose primary concern is social events. Compare this to Lucy, who loves Narnia most, or Jill, who has joined the British equivalent of the Girl Scouts, and is active in her community, directly because of her experiences in Narnia.

Most damningly, Susan laughs at the very idea of Narnia. She tells Eustace "fancy you still thinking about those games we played as children." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think one of the things that helps me is that I tend to look for "Missing Moments." Tiny little stories, slices of life at Hogwarts, with minimal shipping. 

I also focus on characters that received some, but not a lot, of attention in canon. I find that more palpable than building something out of nothing in an existing universe. (How on earth did Daphne become so popular?)

On that note, I liked the stories that focus on the "Silver Trio" a lot:

	<TEXT> "Nightmares of Future Past" is one of the original Peggy Sue stories, and as such, has some of the tropes that you've mentioned, though it does so in a relatively mild way [Dumbledore isn't evil at all, he's merely seeing Harry's actions as disturbingly similar to Tom Riddle's and conflict arises accordingly].

Seeing as it more or less started many of the tropes that make up a huge chunk of canon-deviant fan fiction (compared to Missing Moments like "Fire and Air"), it seems worth a mention.
