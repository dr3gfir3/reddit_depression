	<TEXT> Has there ever been a worse name for a sports car the Prelude?

Prelude:

noun


 a preliminary to an action, event, condition, or work of broader scope and higher importance.



Before every car was relegated to a alphanumeric designator, they had names. Teams of men sat in smokey Madison avenue boardrooms, and hashed them out. They would look for a word that evoked a certain emotion. The Ford mustang, for the rugged individualist cowboy. The Dodge viper signifies the sinuous styling, and the potency of the performance. 

What exactly are you supposed to be gleaning from the name Prelude? It is like they picked a random word out of the dictionary. They should have named it the crescendo, or the finale, something with machismo and authority. 

Then again it takes a wishy-washy cunt to buy a FWD sports coupe in the first place.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am pretty insane with kitting out my bike. Basically the only think left stock on my escape is the frame, and the drivetrain. That will change next year when I upgrade the components lol. 

First thing I did to my escape was cut about 1.5 inches off of the handlebars on each side. They are too wide for city riding. Then I took off the saddle in exchange for a squishy one. I put full planet bike fenders on, ditched the crap pedals for some big comfy platform pedals. The stock tires are also crap so I put on specialized armadillos at a much larger 700x32. 

All that ran me around $225 but really made it my ideal commuting bike. That really solved all the shortcomings I found from the factory. 

Then I started doing the cargo aspect. I got a rear rack, and a big wald front basket. I cycled through a bunch of paneers but settled on 2 Timbuktu bags. 

[Basket](http://i.imgur.com/btUF0ac.jpg)

[Handlebar accessories](http://i.imgur.com/ig2kDKG.jpg)

I have gone pretty nuts with accessories on the bars. Burger Bell, rearview mirror, cup holder, cellphone do k, and super super bright flashlight, with adapter. 

It is now certainly the SUV of bikes, but it really didn't add that much to the weight. I still move out with it no problem. I rarely ever even drive my cars these days. I even do my grocery shopping via bike.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a few random thoughts:

On the lower end I would avoid specialized unless there is a sale. In recent years they have begun skimping on components for their entry level bikes, and at msrp you will be paying a premium to get the logo. If that is the only LBS then go ahead, but shop around, and be sure to take decently long test rides to be sure that the geometry fits you. 

As a fellow big guy I recommend you start out with a hybrid bike. I also have a fancy specialized carbon road bike, but it is not ideal for commuting. I currently have the giant escape, and it is layed out very well for a tall rider. 

Do not skimp on accessories. It really makes all the difference to dial in a bike exactly for what you want. I would plan on immediately changing out the saddle, pedals, and tires as soon, as I get any bike. You should include this in your buget as this will run around a additional $150-200. 

I highly recommend you get some puncture resistant tires. I personally really like my specialized armadillo 700x32 I am currently riding, some people find them too hard, and swear by gatorskin tires. As a big guy we are much more apt to get flats then a 150lb rider. With the armadillo tires I rarely ever get flats. 

Make sure to get a decent pump, and never leave the house without pumping to the recommended psi. Heavy riders will get pinch flats all the time. If the tires are not pumped up it is easy for the rim to hit the tire, and poke a hole. 

Another really important thing to get is as bright a set of lights as possible. I use a flashlight adapter, and a generic Amazon 18650 flashlight that ran me about $20. This combo is brighter then most bike specific lights that cost over $100. Invest in a really bright tail light as well. If you are not a slave to fashion then wearing a high visibility vest is also highly recommended. Remember all cars are out to kill you, and the impitus is on you to be visible. 

Bags are a matter of preference. A rear rack is a must though. A good inexpensive beginer setup is a rear rack with a milk crate zip tied to it. Then get a cargo net with hooks to secure your bag inside. 

Paneers are quite expensive, and no one has yet to nail the perfect ones yet. The dual ones are great but a pain to carry around. I have settled on a Timbuktu tote bag, and messenger bag with waterproofing but neither is ideal. Go for the milk crate, and water resistant backpack first, and get a feel for how much gear you want to tote. 

You will need a tool kit. Never leave the house without a spare tube, tire levers, and a small pump. You should also buy a collapsable rain coat. I have a few Patagonia ones that fold down to the size of tennis balls, but have saved my ass many times. A more affordable one is the Columbia rain coat which I think runs around $30. 

All of this is expensive. Your kit will probably exceed the cost of the bike, but think about how much gas, parking, or even a bus pass costs over time, and you will eventually come out ahead. 

Plus you will eventually be a slightly less big guy in the end. 

Good luck

I have the same bike! 

I love mine. Picture is before it took it's final form with 32 wide tires, and Timbuktu saddle bags. 

I was actually going to buy a Cannondale that was priced much much higher then this. My salesman told me to take this for a spin, and I was in love. 

Only complaint is the cheap components. I will give them another year or so, and then I am going to totally redo them with something better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in the same situation as you. I have a roubaix, and my LBS cautioned me against putting a rack on my seatpost. 

I ended up buying a Giant escape hybrid for commuting, and outfitting it with a basket, and 2 Timbuktu saddle bags.  I can now stop at the grocery store on the way home, and load up a decent amount. I also set it up to be super comfy for a casual ride squishy seat, 32 wide tires, lots of lights, cell phone holder, and ice coffee cup holder. 

I have 0 regrets. I love my road bike, but honestly I much prefer to ride the upright comfortable position on the way to work. Also ironically since my giant is a triple, vs double on the road bike it climbs hills much easier and I arrive less sweaty. 

It is nice to keep the road bike as my weekend ride. Makes it feel special when I pull it out, and theft is a big problem here, so it is liberating to be able to leave the giant parked withoutworrying that my $$$ bike is going to walk away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am as guilty of this as anyone, but as cyclists we often get into a zone going down hill, and often don't account for the repercussions of our speed. There is nothing more fun then bombing hills, but in a emergency situation, you either get lucky, or are going to be in a world of pain. 

You got lucky today. 

My advice is to slow it down. As far as the wobble you will have a hard time diagnosing it, but I would be your brake got stuck, or your wheel wasn't tightened properly. Honestly it cannot be avoided in all cases when a wheeled object is traveling at a high velocity, and makes a drastic change of course you are bound to lose stability.

Honestly it is better on a bike. On a board it is the longest couple seconds of your life knowing that you are going too fast, and nothing is going to save you from the asphalt.  </TEXT>

 I will keep that in mind. The slow data is usually no issue.  In certain ways  it is a blessing, that I am not stuck to my phone while taking in a new country. 

However NZ was really egregious, since I couldn't do my research at the hotel due to wifi restrictions. 

I will certainly keep that in mind though. This year is Mexico so I don't think I need to worry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the time (November 2015) TMobile was only offering 128kbps. It is anecdotal, but it seemed to run much slower then other countries I have traveled to with the free data. To my recollection, manually switching carriers didn't make much of a difference. 

It was much to slow to run maps, and doing any serious research for activities. 

In a lot of countries you need to jump through hoops, and deal with language barriers to get a local sim. There are Vodafone stores everywhere, and it couldn't have been simpler to get it setup. I think it was well worth the money to get fast data.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can only speak to south island, but we did have coverage all through the rural areas. It was to slow for me though so I ended up buying this. 

http://www.vodafone.co.nz/travel-sim/

They range from $29 to $99 for 1-8 gb. The Vodafone Sim had flawless coverage, and fast speeds. 

I found it necessary because unlike most places I have traveled the wifi is very tightly metered in NZ. Even in my relatively high end hotel in Queenstown, we were limited to only 1 gb of data per night. If you go to a coffee shop, you are often given a code for comically small amounts of data like 50mb.  </TEXT>

He wore shorts even tighter, and higher cut then these. He positioned his treadmill looking out at the courtyard, and for 90 minutes per day his cock was just flapping around for 10 houses of people to look at. Literally 0% of his cock was contained by the shorts. 


At least I was on the other side. The guys in the duplex next to him got to here the sounds of testicles slapping thighs over the roaring treadmill every day.  </TEXT>

 I can't perfectly articulate, where this becomes unethical, but creating all the conditions for someone to commit a crime, and then arresting them before they have the chance to have second thoughts is somehow beyond upstanding for me. 

This is essentially the same as the police doing a bait car sting, and arresting a guy as soon as he looks in the window.  </TEXT>
