	<TITLE> I created a goal oriented reading challenge to encourage readers and non-readers alike to branch out and read some books they normally wouldn't in a relaxed, 'non-time based' (i.e. Annual) format. </TITLE>

It includes 100 categories, covering both fiction and non-fiction, with a spot to fill in the Title and Author as you complete it. Some categories include:

* A Book From A Non-Human Perspective
* A Book Whose Author Shares Your Initials
* (Non-Fiction) A Book On A Foreign Leader
* (Non-Fiction) A Book Whose Subject You Disagree With
* A Book Featuring an LGBT Character
* A Book Published Over 100 Years Ago

Etc. Etc. I'd love to get some opinions and see if anyone would have interest in such a thing. I've had a few printed out for friends and family and have had mostly positive reviews!

EDIT: Swapped out the photos for higher quality ones. Hopefully you can read them now.

EDIT 2.5: I put it up on my Etsy, I've been getting some requests for a digital download...ask and ye shall receive. $5 for BOTH posters formatted to be printed in high resolution up to 24x36 [Link to purchase](https://www.etsy.com/listing/506848787/) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [REQUEST][PAID] 1:00 Movie Trailer-esque recording for an "Honest" trailer. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-08 15:45:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm throwing together an honest trailer for a board game. If you've never seen honest trailers, check out the YouTube channel ScreenJunkies. They're hilarious! But I digress, this is just a fun little project for myself to go into a demo reel, so I'm not able to offer much. How about $10? Looking for someone with a deep voice much like you'd see in a movie trailer. (Think the clich "In a world...").

Sample of the script:

"For anyone who aspires to be Indiana Jones, but from the comfort of their dining room table comes a fast paced, temple exploration game by Queen Games.

With exciting features like:

Rolling dice to discover new chambers
Rolling dice to move around
Rolling dice to acquire gems
Rolling dice to unlock treasure chests
Rolling dice to roll more dice.

Seriously, this is all you do."

Please post a sample below if interested! Thanks!!

Edit: Completed. Thanks! </TEXT>
