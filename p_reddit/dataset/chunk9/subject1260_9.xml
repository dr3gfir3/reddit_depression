Drink some water and wait 15 minutes if still hungry drink some more and wait another 15. If still hungry eat an apple or something. Gum has helped me by giving me something to put in my mouth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started counting calories on Wednesday and yesterday (Friday) was the first day I didn't actual go over my calorie limit of 1600, I was at work yesterday so maybe that distracted me a bit more. I wasn't hungry at all though and drinking water really really helped. I'm hoping this good mood and tiniest amount of success lets me continue with this today. Christmas shopping later anyway so I wont have money to spend on much food anyway :)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm part of /r/Xboxone and /r/Titanfall and both subs have people getting angry at people not buying games. Xbox One had a thread the other day about low Xbox one sales of FFXV and people complained that now Kingdom hearts is unlikely and people should be buying the game to support the company. Same happened when Recore came out people were getting angry and telling people to buy it because it was an Xbox exclusive. Similar things are happening with Dead Rising 4, people saying to buy it to show support to Xbox one exclusives when people don't want to.

I've seen it a lot this generation people getting angry and people not buying games, what is this about? It seems like madness. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm obese. I used to never care about my apparence or anything to do with that but since getting a girlfriend I want to be the best I can be not just for her but for me to. I'm not comfortable in my body and I actively avoid the mirror. Comparing pictures of other 200+lb people I don't think I look that bad but I am.

I've decided that as part of my change I want to be accountable here with questions and problems I've encountered etc. Is that okay? I want to say everyday but probably be every other.

Currently trying to eat at 2000 calories. Let's do this.

Edit : I'm 22 years old and walk for between half hour and an hour a day </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Battlefield 1 is about the battle. It's about the comradery of everyone together. All for one for all! It's about being stuck in a trench with a few of your brothers, desperately trying to keep everyone alive. As a medic no one dies on my watch. It's a game of playing your role, Assaulting the vehicles, healing people, providing covering fire and supporting everyone. It's about war, real cold dirty war. 

In all seriousness I own both and they both are completely different games maybe Battlefield 1 isn't for you and Titanfall is. That's okay! They're both my game of the year. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The penalty for dying in Bioshock Infinite </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-25 12:46:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yes I did a Bioshock post a few weeks ago to but ok replaying the games with an objective critical mind. One thing I didn't mention in Bioshock was the death system. In the first game you could just respawn over and over again eventually killing the enemy. I can't remember there being a penalty maybe other than some eve and money. However in the first one you could turn the vita chambers off making the game harder. In Infinite you just respawn a couple of feet away with less money and the enemy's gain some health, not all of it, some.

Playing Infinite on hard and I just find it too easy because I can exploit the death system, each fight has no sense of threat because I can just try try try again until it's done.

What is the real penalty of death in Infinite? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you blame them? Ea access trials have convinced me to buy three games this year. 2 of which are my most played of the year. A beta isn't a complete representative of the final game sure, and yes people can acknowledge things have been changed. But I know alot of people who aren't willing to risk money for a new game on something they may not like and they sure didn't like the tech test. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me GTA was always a single player game first. The series is full of brilliant characters and ways to tell a story. GTA IV probably being my favourite with dlc showcasing completely different sides of the story. I don't really like GTA online so if they're not supporting single player then I don't feel particularly valued as a consumer  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played Bioshock a few years ago and it went near the top of my favourite games of all time lost. But I think I was revelling in the plot and the twist of the game. I'm replaying it now and while I do like it I do feel it's very repetitive. Each level is a series of rooms you go through, at some point you'll have to find 3 things to make something else to go on to the next bathysphere with a few big daddies in the way. The formula for the game is so repetitive in my opinion and I never found the combat very good either. With the right tonics you can make the game a breeze.

does this example as game as art only apply to story? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For some context I've played Bioshock 1 and 2, but its been years and I forgot most of it. So I decided to familiarise myself with both and had an absolute blast from 1. However I remember me liking 2 but not enough to play right away again now. I however have never played Infinite and would love to jump in. Is it enough now that I've replayed 1 or should I get familiar with 2 again to? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it's not a good version of the game. The developers know this they even delayed it. If a game with no effort or thought sells loads of units it's sending the message "we can just make lackluster remakes that require barley effort and make loads of money".  </TEXT>
