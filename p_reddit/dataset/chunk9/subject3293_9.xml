	<TEXT> How has your experience been having a kid named Ulysses? Some of the criticism we've had is that the name is so "heavy" or "serious" or "a lot to live up to". Does your kid dig it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if my brother fully understands that I'm pregnant. He is not verbal at all, as he lost his speech about 5 years ago, so it's tough to know if he fully gets that he going to be an uncle. He loves babies though and I think when we bring the baby home he will be so excited and he'll get it! Unfortunately I live across the country but we do get to FaceTime, which helps a lot. Thanks for linking to the shirt, I was gonna ask where you got it! That's a great idea! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My brother has DS too and is 27 years old, and this will be his first time being an uncle! I love that you got him an uncle shirt! I'm going to do the same for my little brother. Maybe with the whole hospital thing, I would personally change my vocabulary when talking with him if he seems to be kinda fixated on the word "hospital" and associating it with bad times. Maybe instead say you are going to have the baby with a special doctor who goes to  school just to help mamas have their babies. And talk about that more than the physical place where it happens?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Diclegis really helped me out when I was puking on average 6 times a day and couldn't keep anything down. It also really helped to drink a protein drink/shake first thing in the morning before I even got out of bed. 

The protein is supposed to reduce nausea and it also keeps you full longer. Having an empty stomach makes the sickness so much worse. It's one of the ironic cruelties of morning sickness that it can spiral into more sickness as your stomach becomes progressively empty from puking.

Try to keep her entertained with books, movies, podcasts, anything to make the time pass. For most women, things get better after 12 weeks. Hang in there!  </TEXT>
