I'd switch to frozen peas instead of canned - the taste is much much better and the cost is about the same.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked in bookstores for years and getting kids to read something that they would find interesting is such a huge thing.  A lot of people can't just start out reading serious things - it's better to read something like Sweet Valley or Goosebumps purely for enjoyment and they naturally become a stronger reader and have more confidence.  

I know there are people out there who don't appreciate Captain Underpants books but so many kids who really don't think they want to read find them appealing.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When she fell asleep, the world was doomed. When she awoke, it was dead.

In the wake of a fever that decimated the earths populationkilling women and children and making childbirth deadly for the mother and infantthe midwife must pick her way through the bones of the world she once knew to find her place in this dangerous new one. Gone are the pillars of civilization. All that remains is powerand the strong who possess it.

A few women like her survived, though they are scarce. Even fewer are safe from the clans of men, who, driven by fear, seek to control those remaining. To preserve her freedom, she dons mens clothing, goes by false names, and avoids as many people as possible. But as the world continues to grapple with its terrible circumstances, shell discover a role greater than chasing a pale imitation of independence.

After all, if humanity is to be reborn, someone must be its guide.

[From Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29806086-the-book-of-the-unnamed-midwife)

The special part of the /r/books bookclub is that you will get to talk to the author after reading the book.  Meg will be here to do an AMA on March 30th.  

The Book of the Unnamed Midwife won the 2014 Philip K. Dick Award and was listed as a Tiptree Committee Recommendation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had a similar situation but it involved a very bad sewer backup and a lady who wanted to take her kid into the bathroom.  There was another bathroom they could use in the store next door too.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Facebook links are not banned site wide but many communities do choose to ban them entirely because of the problems that can arise when people post something they shouldn't.  

A lot of things on Facebook would not break site rules if it's just someone posting a link like that facebook page for a public figure like a musician or politician.  What becomes an issue is when someone who is not a public figure is singled out.  Our personal info rules are meant to prevent harassment and witch hunting so it's important to keep that in mind.  

I've given a bit of a breakdown of what can be considered a public figure [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/5v4mry/reminder_no_posting_personal_information_you_will/de1zalk/?context=3) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The kind of Facebook page you describe would most likely be okay to post a link to but it would not be okay to dig through the people commenting there and post that to Reddit.  The personal info rules are meant to keep people from receiving real life harassment and stop witch hunting.  In general it's better to err on the side of caution when things involve personal info.  

A good way to gauge if someone's name is considered personal info is to do a quick google search.   If you find news articles, video clips of news stories, magazine stories, and other things from the media?  This person's name would likely not be considered personal info.  On the other hand if you find social media, LinkedIn, twitter, and some gossip on a blog that is a good indicator that this person is not a public figure and it's not okay to post their name.  

Often someone's name may not be considered personal info but the names of their kids, phone number, personal email, address, workplace, etc...  are very likely still considered personal and are not okay to post.

	<TEXT> I recently read an article about Truckers Against Trafficking and it sounds like a really neat organization.  It's not something I ever thought of but truckers are probably fairly often traveling the same routes that someone up to no good would travel.  </TEXT>
