	<TEXT> Pallet wall looks dope to me!! I don't love contrast with stone face of the fireplace though; too busy. A plain white facade would look stellar with the wall! Nice job either way!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Owner of lady parts, but I definitely assume many Reddit users are male. Possibly because I generally think all trolls are dudes, and there are many trolls about here. Trolling is a decidedly male activity, in my eyes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Possible. Also, thinking back on it, my boyfriend was extremely closed off to the idea of anything paranormal or "unproven." So he very possibly could have been simply refusing to see the man. And the man looked fully solid, not apparition like. But there wasn't any sound of breathing or running emitting from him or his movements.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, but my now ex boyfriend wasn't the kind of dude who would mess with me in that way. Especially not once I started tearing up and pleading with him to admit he saw the man too. He swore he hadn't and tried to comfort me, so I dropped it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's always shocking to see so many racist comments on any posts that makes it to the front page and involves a person of color. Reddit has become Stormfront: The Millennial Edition. 

What is wrong with white people?!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. Don't want to say anything bad about her parents, but I would have definitely woke my mother up at this age if one of our animals had gotten into something. It makes one wonder why she felt she couldn't wake them. 

Cute email nonetheless.  </TEXT>
