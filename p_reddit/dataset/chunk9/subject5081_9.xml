	<TEXT> From a price-to-performance perspective, people here are right, as of today RIFT wins. 

**But if I had to buy today, I'd buy a Vive again, for the same reason I bought it the first time: Lighthouse tracking.**

Today we discuss Lighthouse tracking 'only' for its accuracy, but by next year, when tracked accessories will be a thing, this system will show its superiority over Constellation. 

Also, I'll be able to 'mix and match'; lighthouses from HTC, controllers from Valve, HMD from LG, accessories from Logitech...

It's simply a superior ecosystem - and time will show it. </TEXT>

But these games should allow for world scaling. Not implementing it is bad programming in my opinion. I understand it's not easy, but it's also a big thing in a mean where immersion is paramount.  </TEXT>

White/Green/Red/Blue pixel = stuck pixel.

The Mura effect will show some greenish hue in the pixels, to the extent of making some of them VERY green.

What you might have is a stuck pixel. I had one on my TV, it went away by itself after a month or so. I wish that happens to you as well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got it first-wave in 2016. Played daily until last month, then I stopped gaming altogether for a while as I've dislocated my thumb. 

I was back in yesterday playing Arizona Sunshine Co-op with a friend and holy hell, that's the future of Co-Op gaming.

The Vive is in my habits. I cannot play First Person games anymore, they're ruined forever - VR or nothing. I still play third person games on a flat screen (Just finished TellTale Batman, going to start MadMax), and before my thumb accident I played a lot of EVE:Valkyrie and the casual Onward match.

But honestly, I have a busy life, so with games out / coming out like Obduction, Technolust, Anyland, AliceVR, ORgan Quarter, IronWolfVR, Robinson: The Journey, Dark Legion, Paranormal Activity, Budget Cuts, PULSAR: Lost Colony, Dead Secret, Eagle Flight, Soulkeepr VR...

... I do have stuff to keep me busy until FallOut 4 VR is out! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I'm sure that HTC will match the price somehow (maybe giving the new head strap and wireless included in the fall?), If I had to buy a VR headset now, I'd still buy the Vive, because of the lighthouse system. That's the single reason it convinced me one year ago. 

Also, only small studios will say yes to exclusives. In one year's time, when the total HMD out there (Oculus+PSVR+Vive) it's gonna hit ~5 million, We're gonna see bigger studios entering the game, better comfort and resolution, cheaper price, and cool accessories - and that's when the lighthouse system will really shine, and allow me to buy the HMD from, say, LG, controllers by Valve, gun by Logitech, wireless by TPcast etc - mix and match!

	<TEXT> The light house system and the ability for third party pheripherals still position the Vive above other headsets. 

Oculus reduced the price of their HMD cause their sales weren't as good as expected. Good for the market as a whole, but an indicator that the Vive did better. 

Last but not least: Fallout 4.

	<TEXT> While i agree with you, that everything is hackable, my question is: why would I want to go that length to do it? I am an engineer, did plenty of cyber security courses and was a 'hacker' back in my teens. 

It's not like in the movies or TV shows where an hack takes minutes. It takes a lot of planning, a lot of resources, a lot of time, and a lot of risk. 

Sure I can hack my friend's Android phone to mess with him. But hacking an Amazon Alexa/Google home/any unsecure smartphone would need to have a strong motive behind, cause the time/risk outweighs the potential benefit.

Pro tip: enable 2 factor authentication on everything, use different (long) passwords for different services, secure your WiFi and don't connect to networks you don't know, and unless you've something to hide / very valuable to steal, you'll be fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shot in the dark as I don't have any information, but since you're new to the family:

Avoid any possible reflection. If there's a mirror, picture frame, painting, window - anything reflective - this might cause tracking issues. 

In the SteamVR settings menu there's an option to see lighthouses coverage. This might help you understand if any of the lasers bounces on a reflective surface, thus messing with your tracking. 

I recently moved my play area and I immediately checked for 'weird tracking spots' - sure as hell there was one because one picture frame reflected the lasers and messed with hmd positioning.  </TEXT>

You won't be able to crank stuff up to high or ultra, nor supersample (if not for very few basic games).

Supersampling = increasing the resolution of the image before scaling it down to the HMD resolution, which produces a sharper image effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I can run it just fine with my GTX970, however I've tried the in-game supersampling (135) and oh, the sharpness! :) kind of wish I could play with that all the time, hence the urge to upgrade! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't agree more, and unfortunately there's not much love for EV in the r/vive subreddit. I understand the price point is high, but man what a game. Best graphics I've seen in VR so far, for the first time I felt the urge to upgrade my GPU! 1080ti here I come! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, I agree with everything you've said, Gaben himself said "VR at current level is just good enough". 

But that's why we're here, because people that bought in gen 1 want to be at the forefront of technology! We're not discussing if VR is ready to be used by grandma - but if you're a gaming enthusiast, VR is more than ready. There's no flat screen game that compares to the shittiest VR experience.

So, while VR is not ready for mainstream adoption - is definitely ready to transport you to another reality! :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I bought the Vive in wave 1, so it's almost a year I've had it, and I don't regret any second of it. 

Eye tracking and full body tracking will be here, for sure, but not earlier than 2018. If you want to wait another year without VR, your call, but I'm sure it's not "worth the wait", because the experience won't be improved *that* massively until we have gen 2.0, which probably will be late 2018. 

So yeah, I think that if you have the budget for it, waiting is just wasted time :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's "only" lasers, cycled and synced between the two for spatial positioning. That's the beauty of the system - is cheap, simple, and super effective.

Any new HMD that uses that tech, would be backwards compatible with the old lighthouses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We need your computer specs to help you my friend. 

Edit: just saw your specs. Ok, nothing wrong with them apparently. What OS are you running? 

Usual troubleshooting: 
- make sure you have no malware/viruses 
- make sure you clean uninstall/install the graphics drivers, there's a program for that but I don't remember there name (maybe DDU)
- make sure your system settings relative to power are set for performance 
- try changing the USB port you use for your Vive
- try disabling camera/lowering camera refresh rate 

If all fails, if you have a friend with a good rig, is test the Vive with his computer just to rule out Vive issues. If it works, clean install of the OS and you should be good to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can I ask you to try and buy the games on Steam, try it out, and then if you don't like it refund it? this way the developers know that there is interest in the VR platform but their game sucks.

Pirating a game is never a good idea, especially indie games, because you're directly hurting small developers. 

Thanks for taking time to read my comment and apologies for my unrequested advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Fact 1**, VR Games are ~~largely~~ financially ~~unviable~~ challenging if you plan to make a AAA game because there's no market to support it yet. Indie games are doing ok, some of them are even doing very well.

**Fact 2**, Oculus is throwing money at ~~ financially unviable games~~ games that were for the most part already in development and/or sweeping up finished games from a free market (KingSpray etc), not really to push the market but to sway consumers to them.

Now, while I don't like the practice, I do understand that for some devs this might mean see their game released or not. I do not blame those devs, in their position I would have done the same. 

**Fact 3** is the only one I agree with, however, it ties to the fact that WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY DEVELOPERS EXIST **SOLELY** THANKS TO OCULUS. So it's kind of a moot point.


Regarding "pushing VR further". I can't see it happening from Oculus, sorry, so you don't have to reply, because you won't convince me :) (unless you show me statistics where 70 out of 100 developers got into VR just thanks to Oculus). 

Oculus started VR, that's for sure, with DK1 and DK2. I don't even blame Carmac / Luckey for the whole Zenimax shenanigans. I blame the FB acquisition. Valve was working with Oculus for the first prototype. They showed Oculus their Roomscale technology, and had no plan to go to other manufacturers. Then FB money came in, and Valve got no reply from Oculus anymore, so they decided to find another partner, and HTC came into play. 

In an ideal world, we would have an Oculus Rift with Lighthouse tracking, if FB shady big corporation practices didn't come into play. But maybe that's for the best, as competition is what drives any market.

So I guess we'll have to agree to disagree here! The last line is, we both use VR and it's awesome, and it's only gonna get better! :)
