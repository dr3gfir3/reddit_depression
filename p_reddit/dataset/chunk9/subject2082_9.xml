	<TEXT> After the 2nd movie, the director went back and remade the first movie in the style of the second one. It's way uglier.

The warmer palette and the outdated 3D effects used in the second movie don't work as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The HD graphics are pretty good, but there are a lot of things that don't feel quite right.

The Zerg are the worst. Look at [this picture of HD graphics](http://i.imgur.com/AmfolmM.jpg) vs [SD](http://i.imgur.com/mA9DqDk.jpg), taken from [here](http://www.teamliquid.net/forum/brood-war/520464-an-interview-with-the-devs-of-starcraft-remastered).

Zerg buildings look desiccated. In the gifs, they aren't throbbing like the originals. The spawning pool, should be a pool filled with liquid. Now it looks completely dry. Zerg buildings are supposed to look like scary fleshy things, almost like exposed human organs. They need to add some of that living, organic look back. Pump them with water.

Not a big fan of the Ultralisk tusks which look like mammoth tusks instead of blades. The queen looks okay, but the original was a bit better. The defiler has lost its hind legs.

The hydra is probably going one of the most controversial. I always imagined it differently, as a kind of fleshy blob.

-
The carrier isn't quite as nice. The new "lines" which they added don't look right. The proportions of almost all the parts also aren't right and the material they used looks too reflective.

The BC mostly gets it right, but the cannon barrels are too flared. They look like cheap props.

TvP comparison: [HD](http://i.imgur.com/NtelxId.jpg) vs. [SD](http://i.imgur.com/Y5ItkU4.jpg)

First, props for getting the dragoons right. The cannons on the siege tanks are too short and the "dual flashlights" at the bottom are way too big. They weren't visible in the original and it should probably stay that way.

The vultures hover a bit too high and are now less visible. Not a big deal.

The water is less detailed. They didn't draw the parts where the water meets the shore. The [zealots and temple HD](http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/lichter/SCR/ZealotsHD.jpg) vs. [SD](http://www.teamliquid.net/staff/lichter/SCR/ZealotsSD.jpg) shot also shows how they didn't bother to add quite as much detail. The medallion isn't filled back in with a carving, but looks empty  (there is a subtle carving if you zoom in). The zealots look good though ;) In other shots, like the snow one, I feel like they lost some of the beauty of the original, but it's hard to pin down. Tiling is more obvious in many places because of the fine details.

More comparisons [here](https://starcraft.com/en-us/) (moving gifs made by Blizzard).

The probes look too much like bugs IMO and those cannons don't look right. In that last shot, the undeployed tanks look pretty ugly. Their threads don't have any shadows, the proportions are wrong, and they're missing some details.

The minerals also look wrong. They lack any internal reflections which gives them a plastic look.

They still got a lot of it right, and it's an impressive effort as HD graphics are not cheap to make.

	<TEXT> Turning off the UI in W3 made the experience so much more enjoyable. Too bad you can't really play this way. The default UI just has so many indicators and stuff going on, you'd think you're operating an aircraft. 

That's also why I play Skyrim with iHud, which fades the HUD away unless you need.

Personally, I don't like the complexity of these games anymore, inventory management, mutagens, potions, crafting, comparing gear. I would like to just be able to play the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bioware has been gradually moving away from their Dungeon and Dragons (DnD) roots. Kotor was a kind of simplified Dnd in space. ME was more focused on action, but the combat still resembled Dnd. The first Dragon Age was very close to a Dnd experience. ME2, and then ME3 became more action focused. DA2 was action focused and DA:I ditched the DnD combat in favor of MMORPG combat, while preserving as an option something that resembled the old Dnd combat, but only superficially. Now ME:A has completely purged the remaining Dnd elements. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Games are now huge productions and sadly writing isn't properly valued. One problem is that it's hard to determine what is good or bad writing. Executives have a tendency of wanting to play safe by reusing a story that worked in the past. It's also hard to show off good writing in a demo.

Also, videogame companies won't really hire dedicated writers who have a liberal arts education. Avellone for example had a major in English and a minor in fine arts. John Gonzalez (FNV and HZD) has an English major and a master in social work. Drew Karpyshyn was working on his masters in English when he was hired by Bioware.

These aren't necessarily the profiles companies are looking for. </TEXT>

That's funny because KOTOR has some of the most horrible talking animations: https://youtu.be/irnl-3B0qE0

KOTOR2 developers Obsidian lost a ton of time trying to make precisely executed cutscenes, only to find out that the engine wasn't capable of that kind of fine control.

The problem is that Bioware seems not to have improved much since then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was an article a while ago about how Microsoft severely mismanaged many studios that were developing exclusives for it, to the point that it almost drove some of them into bankruptcy by making unreasonable demands or cancelling games at the last minute. E.g. Obsidian was working on an exclusive RPG for the X1 named Stormlands which got cancelled late into development. By contrast, Sony has nurtured developers, even going as far as giving The Last Guardian a decade or so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. Is it that fun to get stuck on the dog puzzle? In reality, this is a poorly designed puzzle that should have more hints. The game designers probably never play tested it. 

I like the idea that the world is laid out in a semi-realistic manner. But backtracking and having to carry random items for 20hours with a very limited inventory is not good design.

This video obviously edited out the tedious parts, which the game doesn't. I'm all for modern game design that respects the player's time. </TEXT>

No it wouldn't, especially not a translation from Japanese to English which requires creative adaptation. 

IMO, the translation is a derivative work, but it's still owned by the translator. He doesn't have the right to distribute it, but the company can't use it either. If they could, then does that mean that Bethesda could just take Skyrim mods and sell them since they're also derivative works?

Maybe /u/VideoGameAttorney can provide a better answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because voters are ignorant and polarized. Many people don't vote, or vote on a single issue (abortion), or just listen to Fox News all day. They never bother to look at what the politicians they vote for are actually doing. Or they buy their views that all forms of regulation are bad. 

For example, that [higher mercury emissions create jobs!](http://www.manchin.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/in-the-news?ID=85d6083f-53c2-4042-b039-fda7b0ce825a) "Manchin has previously introduced legislation that would delay the implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's Utility Mercury and Air Toxics Standards. The standards are designed to limit exposure to mercury and other air toxics from U.S. power plants." "From the day I arrived in the Senate, I have been determined to stop the EPA's jobs-killing agenda, and this Resolution of Disapproval takes an important step to rein in this out-of-control agency" This is from a Republican senator's website.

You just need to tell voters that the FCC is a regulator, and that it's curtailing freedom, and they'll agree with you, as long as they don't find out you're actually talking about giving their sole Internet provider the permission to spy on them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You kind of drifted off on another subject midway with Citra. So let's ignore that part.

I don't see how videos could hurt an emulator. I know that [JohnGodGames](https://www.youtube.com/user/pcmaker2) files bug reports for rpcs3. By watching his videos, I can quickly see what is the state of PS3 emulation, even if I don't own all those games, or can't be bothered to test them. His Patreon is currently at 1$ and I don't think he gets any income from youtube, so I don't think he's ripping anyone off.

RPCS3's official channel reposted a youtuber (BlastProcessing)'s footage for Catherine. So, they're finding it useful.

There's not a lot of content in this sub, so why not have a few videos? I agree that some are really annoying and low quality, but I think that they mostly get removed.

	<TEXT>  The library was kind of meant to be that, but different. It wasn't intended to import your entire collection into the library, just the games you're playing.

I see. Well, it kind of suggests to me that I would import my whole library.

If you grab the quark shaders, they are pretty decent. They can certainly do everything Snes9X can do and more. But maybe Snes9X has more made for it, I'm not sure.

I know that there are external shaders, but I'm not going to try them if they're not there by default (nor will most users).

A nasty, nasty side effect of Windows. Their default list view is so limited as to be completely useless. To allow per-cell icons, fonts, colors, etc I have to custom draw the control. And after doing that, it stops auto-handling text search ahead. Have yet to find a workaround.

I can't help you, but having a good UI is really important. Have you seen MedLaunch (Windows only). This [screenshot](http://medlaunch.asnitech.co.uk/user/pages/03.screenshots/games02.png) gives a good idea of how it works. While not perfect by any means, it has a search bar and it's able to scrape info from Mobygames and other sites. You can sort games by year, last time played, etc. It's really great in this regard.

(An issue that I'm having right now is that I can't change my library location (wanted to move it out of my C drive). Higan will just do nothing when I select a new folder and of course I can't just type in a new location. Is this normal?) Thanks for responding to my post btw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's literally, open program, choose "Library - Load ROM image", pick game, you're playing it.

My suggestion would be to add "File - Load ROM image".

 It would be more intuitive as 

1) A file is being loaded that is not in the library, so this has nothing to do with the library. Normally, files have to be added to a library in order to be loaded. It's illogical that the option to directly load a file be found there. In Itunes for example, I can't directly play a file without adding it to my library first. This is probably the concept that most users are familiar with.

 2) This is similar to what other emulators do. 

3) It would put the most important and most desired functionality first. This is always a good thing. And it would create a positive reward loop for users of your emulator. They might then be interested in learning how to use the more complex library function. </TEXT>

If it's useful for some users, why not keep it as an option, but with a warning (like Dolphin does). I will not go into a settings file unless I absolutely have to, and 99% of users won't either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's awesome that you're developing these cores. Kega Fusion is good, but I'd rather have everything under one emulator. 

Also, I think it's really cool that you're doing this. It's not just about the end result, but also about the process of trying to reverse engineer a system.

My gripes about Higan right now are actually about really small things, like the fact that it's not possible to search within the game library, or press a letter, say "G" to jump to games that start with this letter. There's also no "recently played games" list. For some reason, I need to remap my control input all the time because Higan forgets it. And the controller configuration doesn't automatically jump to the next button. And shaders of course aren't as good as SNES9x. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not just Bioware IMO. Torment:Tides of Numenera, WL2 and Pillars of Eternity all have somewhat sketchy writing. 

It shows how hard it is to write compelling characters.

Bioware has some pretty good writers: Drew Karpyshyn (ME1) and David Gaider (DA:O). They were not perfect or anything but they wrote mostly good stories.

I wonder if some of it is due to millennials being brought up in the digital age and not reading as much as previous generations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not overly surprised by the delays. CR doesn't have a very good track record as a manager. Microsoft had to come in and kick him out on Freelancer because development had bogged down because of feature creep. It kind of seems like the same thing is happening here. His standards are insanely high. Development was delayed by months, if not years to get that unified animation system. He has a tendency to always be chasing the latest feature and wanting to "get things right", which can result in endless delays. 

I'm sure that Bioware hit the ground running ME:A. They knew exactly what had to be done to deliver the game and I'm sure that it was still a lot of work with plenty of unexpected setbacks. They had an engine and tools and a company and experienced artists and programmers, which CR all had to build up. CR doesn't have experience delivering AAA games. CIG spent much of its time working on backend features, cool ships, and marketing, but did they understand the work that would be required to deliver a AAA single player game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obsidian seems to think that world building can replace narrative. It can't. Lore is just background stuff. It's the setting for the story, but it's not really interesting. 

Games like KOTOR or DA:O have interesting companions because they react to things happening in the world, to what you say and do, and also to what other characters do. They're not just ranting about what happened eons ago. The lore in those games tends to be kept reasonable. We know a little about what happened in the past, but we're not overloaded with information. 

And you have a clear objective. You're saving the world. A bit cheesy but you're never wandering aimlessly around the world.

	<TEXT> I'm not far into the game, but the writing so far is very janky.

In the first area, there are three events where you relive a memory. The writing is kind of confusing. But I think it's just a bad idea to have you read three different short stories in a row. What novel starts off with 3 unrelated short stories? It takes a lot of effort to get into a story. I don't want to spend the time to immerse myself into that story just for it to be discarded moments later. 

These elaborate stories are just for turning on lights that allow you to progress. Any other game would just have had you click on them and that would probably have been better.

What made PS:Torment great was not that it had lots of pretentious writing. I don't think the writers were trying to be pretentious at all. It's that it had genuinely funny characters. It also had an intriguing world and good hook: Why can't I die? Who am I? Why do I keep losing my memories? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The first game was in development for 7 years, while the second one was rushed out in about 2 years.

But more significantly, Bioware abandoned its PnP/Dungeons and Dragons roots. (Coincidentally, DA2 was developed after Bioware was acquired by EA in 2007.) The first game was a reimagining of the classic Dnd experience. It was an infinity engine game in 3D but much better, with deeper choices and well written characters.


DA2 was mostly an action game, designed to appeal to a mainstream console gamer audience. Brent Knowles says it well here:
"During the pre-development of the game, Brent Knowles, a veteran lead designer who had been with BioWare for a decade and the central figurehead behind Dragon Age: Origins, decided to resign during the designing process of Dragon Age II and eventually left the company, stating "I'm not the same person I was when I started, and BioWare is not the same company." He later went on to clarify his decision to leave, elaborating "I never thought Dragon Age II would be a terrible game. It was just that a highly cinematic, action-leaning RPG was not what I wanted to work on. That is all."" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age_II#Development

It's pretty clear to me that EA gave orders to produce a game to fit a mainstream console target audience and the game was rushed out to hit a certain quarter. Bioware had never focused as much on the "dumb" mainstream console crowd, though it had been slowly transitioning towards making more mainstream games. It had however always thrived to make intelligent games. DA2 was their first "dumb" game IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you consider yourself to be a hosting service as opposed to a digital conservation project? Why wouldn't you want to edit the library cards of items in your collection? 

On a practical note, do you check for viruses? Some files say that they include cracks. So they're not the original file and could contain a trojan. At least, you should make it clear that they're not the original disk.

To make a definitive archive, you'd need to have certain standards for dumping disks and try to identify different revisions of the software, as well carefully preserving the game manuals, box art etc. A bit like what /u/byuu is doing with snes games.

Your archive will be fairly useless to researchers and users in general if there's no standardized metadata.

There are just some really strange things in there, like this: 

"Free Internet Design Solutions Inspirations Collection .
This Archive Is The Result Of 8 Years Searching The Web . 
Now I Choosed Them As A Gift For Kind Believers In GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful .
I mean The Believers Who Believe In GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Because OF Love , Not The Believers That Believe In GOD  , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Because Of Fray From The GOD . I Mean The Believers Who Love The GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Because Of The GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , And Their Hope Is Going To Be In Paradise , Not The Believers That Believe In GOD , The Most Beneficent , The Most Merciful , Becuase Of The Hell ." (https://archive.org/details/FreeInternetDesignSolutions)

I'm not saying that it's not valuable, but... 

The collections you have are a bit confusing. For example, you have: "MS-DOS Games", "MS-DOS", "Software Library" and "Classic PC Games" that all contain MS DOS games. If you were curating the games as a single collection, it would make sense to have all the MS DOS games in one place, all the Apple software in another, etc.

I guess it makes some sense if you're just creating a collection of collections and not curating them yourself. I just noticed that each collection is curated by a different archivist. They're self-contained universes. 

Maybe you should make that clear and explain your project better. I don't see any explanation of what you're doing. There's only a bit of text tied to each collection, but what are your goals for the whole project? You should write something explaining your goals and methodology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. 

I looked up the exact timeline:

According to Wikipedia Bioware was bought by EA in October 2007. DA:O was released in late 2009 and ME2 in January 2010. Development on DA:O started in 2002. It was revealed as Dragon Age in 2008. So, I'm right that it was one of the last games developed before the acquisition. Development was almost over at that point. ME2 development was started in 2008, so after the acquisition. So, I was right concerning DA:O, but not ME2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I really feel like this and ME2 were the last great games from Bioware, everything since has just felt uninspired in comparison. 

I agree. ~~They were~~ DA:O was also kind of the last games developed before they were bought by EA. DA2 was rushed to hit a certain quarter ~~(I think that was just before they were bought)~~. The game was unfinished and I didn't like the "edgy" dark look or the focus on action. Inquisition wasn't really memorable. It had a pretty cheesy villain and the plot wasn't really interesting. Combat was ripped from MMORPGs and not very interesting.

Edit: According to Wikipedia Bioware was bought by EA in October 2007. DA:O was released in late 2009 and ME2 in January 2010. Development on DA:O started in 2002. It was revealed as Dragon Age in 2008. So, I'm right that it was one of the last games developed before the acquisition. Development was almost over at that point. ME2 development was started in 2008, so after the acquisition. So, I was right concerning DA:O, but not ME2.

	<TEXT> Syberia 3 is coming out at the end of April btw. 

Here's the [trailer](https://youtu.be/ch_nARLiru0). They also have some [gameplay footage](https://youtu.be/XhrdtC3n6u4). It looks great IMO and keeps the same style as the original games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's great. They have many Official Xbox Magazine discs, but not [all](http://redump.org/discs/quicksearch/official-xbox-magazine/). Same for [PC Gamer demo disks](http://redump.org/discs/quicksearch/pc-gamer/).

I'm glad that there's a project like this that at least tries to preserve all that stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was glad to see that they also have a software section. Visicalc won't be lost to the world. 

Their latest contributions page shows dubious contributions: https://archive.org/search.php?query=mediatype:software sort=-publicdate 

It seems really poorly curated. Understandable given how little money they have for their super ambitious project (archiving the Internet and everything else). Maybe they should include better information on how to contribute. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might not be accurate, but I found a price of US $19-80 per square meter for gorilla glass tablet screens. That would be pretty expensive. It makes sense. Ipad and phone replacement screens are expensive. They got from $200 to $600. (https://support.apple.com/ipad/repair/screen-damage) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's an adventure game, so it's actually quite different. You point and click on stuff to solve puzzles. Check out the first two games if you're interested. </TEXT>
