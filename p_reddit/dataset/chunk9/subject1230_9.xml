Indeed, that is exactly what is happening.

Here is the information for the Bitcoin whitepaper:

The SHA-256 hash of the file, b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553, is in the OP_RETURN output script of that transaction. </TEXT>

Here's the transaction id for https://bitcoin.com/bitcoin.pdf

09b39d2f822c7cc9412997f584fe41742c9f35314ca3d6dd6cbbaac0137bd3dc

And here's the transaction id for https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf

09b39d2f822c7cc9412997f584fe41742c9f35314ca3d6dd6cbbaac0137bd3dc

What I can tell thus far:

* The hash being used is SHA-256
* The SHA-256 hash is b1674191a88ec5cdd733e4240a81803105dc412d6c6708d53ab94fc248f4f553 and is in the OP_RETURN output script.
* The files on bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org are identical
* This file was already notarized on 2017-04-11

Thanks for setting this up Roger and bitcoin.com! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Technically not untrue, but he omits the fact that he is blocking SegWit

* Miners can do what they feel is in their best interest, that is how Bitcoin works
* If you really feel like making accusations about this anyway, [Bitcoin.com](https://blockchain.info/pools) has only 2.2% of the [37% of hashpower currently supporting BU/Classic](http://www.nodecounter.com/graphs.php#blocks_pie_graph).

which would solve scaling issue short term

So would BU, and into the medium and long term as well. I don't hear you talking about SegWit supporters and undecideds blocking BU.

Lightning would solve it medium term and allow instant transactions.

If SegWit does not activate, Lightning can still be activated.

Also, he does not mention that BU would put control of the fee market into the hands of miners.

The entire premise of BU is to put control of the blocksize into the hands of all users (regular users, developers, and miners) instead of just a small handful of developers.

Weasel Ver.

Please help us elevate the level of conversation in the Bitcoin community.

Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If there are concerns about the blocksize, i think there should also be concerns about enforcing a minimum block size if the miners are really doing this for the users. The ability to game the block chain implimentation mining empty blocks for 40% extra hashrate is not going to help out the users either.

This assumes that mining empty blocks is gaming the system.

Many would consider mining empty blocks to be leaving more transaction fees on the table for other miners. </TEXT>

Yes, but I personally doubt that it will. The parties involved in the infighting have made it very clear that they are generally petty and childish and seem to be willing to do as much damage to Bitcoin before losing their death grip.

or is it better to diversify into other crytocurrencies at this point?

Depends what you mean by better and from whose perspective. Personally, I think it would be crazy for someone to be into cryptocurrency and *only* be in Bitcoin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it started as a debate over how to properly scale Bitcoin, but now it's pretty clear that that was just a proxy issue and the real issue is who gets to control Bitcoin.

The network is stuck at about 3.5 transactions per second and cannot increase any further, with no scaling resolution in sight.

[Bitcoin has fallen to below 70% of total cryptocurrency market capitalization as altcoins without the scaling issues and toxicity gain momentum.](https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/#btc-percentage)

Censorship, propaganda, removal of users from github repos, and character assassinations abound.

I have my own speculations about *why* this is all happening, but it's not speculation to say that current leadership and community in Bitcoin is toxic and is driving Bitcoin into the ground.

These are two good articles on the censorship:

https://medium.com/@johnblocke/r-bitcoin-censorship-revisited-58d5b1bdcd64

Also, visit r/btc and r\Bitcoin to see the split that has developed in the community thanks to the rampant censorship by mostly a single individual. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything you just said sounds extremely rational to me.

It's just that what /u/MaxTG said:

50%+x can completely wreck the utility of the network, the value, and especially the perception of security/longevity. To make a network change and keep all that value, it has to be **much** higher than 50%. Sure, the machinery will run, but nobody will want to hold the coins if they're under threat of instability or attack.

seems to be a huge logical leap from what you've said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hitler did not say this.

Gregor Strasser said this:

Gregor Strasser (May 31, 1892  June 30, 1934) was a politician of the German Nazi Party (NSDAP). Gregor Strasser believed Hitler was a socialist. He reorganized the whole NSDAP structure, both in its regional formation and its vertical management hierarchy. During the Nazi Party purge, also known as the Night of the Long Knives, Strasser tried to take credit for Hitler's ideals. He was imprisoned and then assassinated on Hitler's personal order by the Berlin Gestapo on June 30, 1934. His assassins shot through a window into Strasser's cell, killing him.

https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Gregor_Strasser

 * We are Socialists, enemies, mortal enemies of the present capitalist economic system with its exploitation of the economically weak, with its injustice in wages, with its immoral evaluation of individuals according to wealth and money instead of responsibility and achievement, and we are determined under all circumstances to abolish this system! And with my inclination to practical action it seems obvious to me that we have to put a better, more just, more moral system in its place, one which, as it were, has arms and legs and better arms and legs than the present one!

 * "Thoughts about the Tasks of the Future", by Gregor Strasser - (1926 June 15) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Twice in less than a week the insecurity and fragility of BU has been exposed.

As much as whoever is doing this is an asshole, from a strictly technical perspective, every single one of these attacks is making [Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/) even stronger.

The next one will be even worse.

Don't disagree there.

And following that, [Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/) will be even stronger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Form 8949 is used to report capital losses and capital gains and, under current IRS rules, would require bitcoin owners to declare their profits.

Reporting would only be required if Bitcoin were sold, thus implying capital gains or losses?

Maybe most of Coinbase's customers are hodlers.

Do I misunderstand something? </TEXT>

Keep an eye on sites like 

http://www.nodecounter.com/

or

https://coin.dance/blocks

It could technically happen once BU is over 50% (or before, but they'd have little chance of success), but I suspect they will wait until they have about 60% or 70% and then publicly coordinate to produce a block marginally larger than 1 MB, like 1.1 MB or something like that. </TEXT>

I think the Bitcoin Percentage of Total Market Capitalization is going to keep going down until Unlimited takes over, and even then altcoins have already gotten massive exposure from the shenanigans in Bitcoin-land. </TEXT>
