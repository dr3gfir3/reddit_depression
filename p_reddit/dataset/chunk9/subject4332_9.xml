	<TEXT> I'm thinking it may not be completely seasoned. Cooking spray is a quick fix but not a long term solution.

I've followed the advice here and had great luck with cleaning an oven 48 hours after cooking with no rusting or discoloration:

	<TEXT> A few tips to make things easier for people new to dutch ovens:

1. Using charcoal can make getting the temperature for a cook easier to obtain. Each coal represents approximately 25 degrees F. So when a recipe calls for a 350 degree bake you know you need 14 coals.

2. When placing coals, unless the recipe tells you otherwise it is best to put 2/3 of your coals on top of the oven and 1/3 under the oven. Placing too many coals under the oven will result in a burned meal.

I can add  more of this sort of stuff if anyone is interested in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is a fun dessert - this is from: http://www.createdby-diane.com/2011/08/smore-cobbler.html

I've done this twice on camping trips - I just converted it for a dutch oven from her conventional oven recipe.

S'more Cobbler 

1 box chocolate cake mix

1 cup whole milk

1 5oz chocolate pudding (cook serve)

1/2 cup butter

6 whole graham crackers

1/2 cup mini chocolate chips

40 large marshmallows

Combine milk and pudding mix and place into greased dutch oven.

Place graham crackers (broken in half) on top of pudding mixture with space in between each one

Add 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips.

Spread DRY cake mix over top and place the butter by tablespoons on top of dry mixture.

Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes (9 briquettes on top 5 under). 

Mix slightly so there isn't large areas of dry ingredients.

Add marshmallows and bake for 8-10 minutes and if needed 1-2 minutes with all coals on top to brown.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing to be aware of if you have a nut restriction - pesto - which is in some sauces can have cashews in it as a filler for pine nuts. If the nut allergy is someone in your family you probably already know this - but just in case.

	<TEXT> What type of dinner do you want to do? Something beefy? Pasta?

I've served 9 with this and had left overs:

A nice salad and some crusty bread with butter and it makes for a very filling dinner.

	<TEXT> Actually, I think the State Store system lends to the possibility of them selling pot. Think about it - you already have the store fronts, the sales people, the shelf space. All you need to do is add a small amount of counter space and you have your entire network of stores already in place.

Imagine if PA got into the legal pot sales business before NJ does. Instead of letting NJ get all the revenue from the casinos for decades before PA finally got with it - the reverse could happen... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is always a good idea to meet with the person you will be turning your work into for approval before beginning the work. I'm a councilor for several badges and I've had issues where boys were interpreting requirements in a very different fashion than I viewed them. It all worked out in the end but I worry that at some point someone will have put a lot of time and effort into something that doesn't meet the requirement and will end up discouraged to hear they have to 'do it over'.

Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Chew a piece of gum to put some moisture in your mouth.

Good idea. It's strange, I feel like I'm drinking the same amount each day - some days I feel great the whole way through the run, other days I just feel like crap right out of the gate. I ran quite a bit in college and I'm trying to get back to it - decades later.

Thanks everyone for the advice, I appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I need some tips for ensuring I'm hydrated properly. The problem is I run in the morning before I go to work. I'm in bed by 9:15pm and I'm usually out the door running by 4:15am. I drink a glass before I go to bed and I will drink one when I wake up. However, in my last two runs I just feel very - dry. Is getting properly hydrated more of an all day process? I drink throughout the day, just not enough I guess? </TEXT>
