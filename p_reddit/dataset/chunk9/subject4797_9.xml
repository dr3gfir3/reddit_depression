	<TEXT> Personally but i am also an out of college person living at home and working in the city i go to Huntington station because it's a yearly fee of 75$ of the parking there.

I know Wyandanch's parking structure or at least the new one is monthly and like 90 bucks. 

I can't say anything about Deer Park but it will be cheaper if you go go where the town owns the parking and not a private company.

You can't think of any reason why random redditors are bringing up questions/ideas/points that professional journalists who have an questions to ask, relationships to maintain, agendas to complete, literally anything that incompasses a job.


And you are wondering why random nobodies with nothing to lose, no boss to answer to, not sitting in the briefing room with dozens of other reporters and so and so forth.


You really can't think of any reason why redditors are able to ask/pose/bring up questions and points that reporters in the briefing room didnt.

	<TEXT> I'm pretty surprised at how Tillerson has been one of the more reasonable cabinet members.

There is nothing reasonable about Tillerson actions as a cabinet member.

He's treatment and/or lack there of his press members. He's refusal to answer any questions anywhere unless at a press conference. He's refusual to stand up for American journalists when the Russian Foreign minister insulted one in Moscow.

Tillerson is not reasonable because he didn't want the job in the first place. He can't get a deputy, he let go career civil servants. 

Tillerson's actions and sometimes lack of speak a lot fucking more than some lip-service comments here and there.  </TEXT>

There is no reason for it to be completed now. Congress has just returned to session this past week, presumable the White House has been prepping the tax reform plan and working the details. 

They released a press explainer that shows some of what they want to accomplish now they just have to work it out legislatively and put a bill together. </TEXT>

It's not like this is just what OMB, Legislative Affairs and the Economic Council came up with and is giving to congress. This isn't the law or the legal papers of it.

People in this thread seem to think this is something more than what it is or assume it's supposed to be more than what this picture is.

It's nothing more than a press explainer of what they intend on accomplishing with the tax plan/legislation.

	<TEXT> Considering the Turkish govt hasn't confirmed something so harmless is skeptical.

This whole thing makes no sense on the surface and as Rachel Maddow continues to say if it doesn't make sense on the first look it will make sense on some other level.

Right now, with no government statements from either I'm not inclined to believe this to be true. 

The Erdogan government has far more to gain from lying and claiming this happened then the W.H does by this actually being true.

I work at a major media company, I've seen nothing or heard nothing that makes me think this is legitimate right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats where I disagree. I think the creator does have a right to control the distribution of their content regardless of the transaction of money.

For example, a neo-nazi group takes a photo i took that wasn't intended to having meaning to a neo-nazi group. They aren't selling the shirts but they had them made up to wear to their protests.

I believe I have the right to demand they ceist and desist the creation and distribution of those shirts with my photograph. They didn't ask for permission or anything, they just took it and it's being used in a way in which i don't approve and could cost me work if i'm a pro-photog and it gets up a neo-nazi group if using my photo.

Copyrights and patents are different things and trying to discuss them in the same conversation will get difficult. I have no interest in patents here, only copyrights.

Information is not what get copyrighted.

You can't copyright the idea you have for a photograph/photoshoot or movie

You can copyright the script you wrote from the idea or the photo you took.

Copyrights are for tangible, existing things and thats how it *should* be used.

	<TEXT> I agree with the overall idea but this is a sentence i take issue with.

But beyond that I want there to be no legal avenue for you to impugn me on the basis that I use something you publicly distributed and which I purchased in a way you do not like

I'm not sure if we agree or just have our wires crossed. Publicly distributing something in what way? In a what you are stating this is in the public domain or any and all use? In Creative commons where it cant be used for commercial reasons only non-commercial reasons? It ennds up getting complex.

So as an example a photo i have in a photo gallery for which i have all the rights for ends up on a t-shirt you are selling on your website. You never asked for permission or licensed the photo as you are expected.

I find out that this photo if being distributed and used on a t-shirt. I would then send cease and desist letters to stop the sale and try to work something out with you, be it monetary compensation or just the stopping of the use of the photo and money not being the problem.

It for the creator to control their property and distribute as they want. Which is public domain is a thing and copyright is a thing, they are different avenues of distributive laws you can pursue depending on your intentions with the content.

The issue is that you create something that and the laws are there to give you and your content the protection from illegal distribution or use. Such as your photo you took ending up on a t-shirt at walmart that you still hold the rights to wholly, for example.

Hence why most issues around copyright i notice are dealing with people who don't ask permission to use things in a certain way, be it big business or youtuber. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you say isn't very convincing to me. I'm in favor of protecting intellectually property. I think life of the author + 70 years is fine, it allows for the author and their family or estate to control that which the author created and how it can be used after they are gone for a period time. I work in media now and studied it in school. Can you explain somethings, perhaps to try show me I am wrong or  at least better understand your problems here.

Why is the an issue that matters to you? What exactly is wrong with this, okay you seem to think the time is too long. Why is that? What do you propose instead?

If I create something that becomes a very big thing or is marketable, makes me a lot of money or whatever else I would want the ability to control it's use and who else makes money from it during my lifetime and at least for some time after. If that's what i am leaving the world I'd like to know it won't be destroyed or used in a manner which i feel is inappropriate. </TEXT>
