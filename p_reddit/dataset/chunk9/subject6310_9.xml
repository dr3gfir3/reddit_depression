	<TEXT> ok then there is your answer, TC stops people that are unauthorized from building in and around it. What my guess is that someone built up to your window, broke it down with tools. took your loot and jumped out and replaced the window and destroyed whatever build up they had. 

The reason for doing this is they hope you think its just a glitch that you lost all of your stuff and don't address your base flaw. Basically double dipping into your loot with the same base design. 

My suggestion Build a TC, always.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you have an accessible TC? if so they might have accessed the TC and rebuilt your base after breaking through. If not there could have been a way to jump into your base through a window. I would suggest not putting up windows unless you can afford metal window bars and they're on the 3rd floor or higher.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not quoting it out of context. You were literally talking about vending machines being used as storage. Also was the 4th comment down. Didn't have to "drudge" far. You used that word incorrectly too. For someone that uses big words i suggest looking up what they mean before using them. Using diction without knowing the correct connotation just makes you look ignorant. 

Also what law is there to not use Vending machines as storage units? 

Don't let your [self-implied] Idiocy show so brazenly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you put the blame on me, in your own words its not my fault its facepunch's fault. You tend to contradict yourself a lot. Also your big words don't make you seem smarter. You sound like a douche. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's Facepunch's responsibility to ensure that items are used as intended, so if they're unable to find a way to discourage vending machines from being used as storage without compromising their value in trade (something this game sorely needs), then they should just remove it. -OrbitStorm88 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lol we had 2 new vending machine loot rooms with all of our best loot
They take an additional c4 to destroy and hold 30 items, why wouldn't you use them to hold your loot as a safe?  </TEXT>
