	<TEXT> Well, the decree does state that no child support will be paid as long as I'm paying the mortgage as well as the private school tuition. When the house is sold, child support shall be calculated pursuant state law.

What it states is "The husband agrees to pay the private school tuition for the minor child for so long as the Wife resides in the marital residence. Upon the sale and the Wife's vacating of the marital residence, the husband agrees and shall pay to the wife at least 900.00 per month toward the private school tuition. This amount is in addition to whatever child support shall be determined to be due at that time. </TEXT>

So all know, this isn't my father. It's the comic artist Derf Backderf. The link below is his Facebook page.

https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1683329228633449 id=100008691630090

They grew up together, in the dense neighborhood between South Main St. and Summit Lake in Akron, Ohio.  A few blocks to the south, the sprawling Firestone plant belched thick smoke and the sour smell of rubber into the air.  Noisy streetcars clattered down Long St. where the Family Backderf lived, wheels screaming as they hit the turn at the bottom of the hill. On South Main, a bustling commercial district sandwiched between the factories serviced the neighborhood population. Dad pushed a broom at Kreske's 5 10. Cliff's family ran a corner tavern, one of many in this predominantly German part of town. 

Cliff's father died horribly when Cliff was just a boy. He stumbled and fell into a vat of acid in one of the tire factories. Cliff's mother quickly got re-married, to an alcoholic brute who hated young Cliff. It got so bad at home, my Grandfather, a gruff foreman at Goodrich, took in Cliff and raised him as his own. This was the depths of the Depression and money was tight, but my Grandfather never hesitated. Cliff regarded the Backderfs as family and was forever grateful. He waxed longingly about my Grandmother's baked treats and warm hugs for the rest of his life. Dad and Cliff shared a bedroom in their teen years, and attended South High together. They were an odd match. Dad was a brainy stringbean. Cliff was a brawny extrovert. But they were brothers.

When war broke out, Cliff enlisted at 17. He was a paratrooper in the Pacific. He fought hard and lived large, the classic GI wheeler-dealer with a dozen schemes going at once. Cliff was always a guy who fully embraced life and all the good times that could be squeezed out of it, even on the front. Dad joined up a year later and served aboard the battleship USS Arkansas. After returning home, unscathed, much to the great relief of my grandmother, they both attended Akron University on the GI Bill. The family decided to move to the bucolic Lake House my grandfather bought in 1940 and leave the stink and clank of innercity Akron, but it needed to be converted from a summer cottage. The house was jacked up and Cliff and Dad spent an entire summer digging out a lower floor, by hand, pushing the dirt up the hill to dump, wheelbarrow after wheelbarrow. They'd canoe across the Lake to catch the Main St. bus for the long ride to the university. Cliff usually got home first and Dad would yell at him from the other shore, but Cliff was often fast asleep on the couch, so Dad would have to swim it, which was no fun in the Fall. We still call one of the bedrooms "Cliff's room."

Dad went on to grad school and a long career as a chemist and stayed in Akron. Cliff became a businessman, got married and raised a family and moved to California. He loved it there, living the fine life in the sunshine. He liked to call in mid-winter and describe the weather to Dad, often while noisily eating an orange he had just plucked from a tree in the backyard. He frequently visited Akron, especially in retirement, and he and Dad spent countless hours on the golf course. Last year, he and his son went to Australia together, even though Cliff's health was failing. The dude just wouldn't be stopped. 

Cliff was inconsolable when Dad died. "I've lost my brother," he sobbed when I delivered the news. 

This is my favorite photo of them, from 1938. Dad is on the left. Two teenagers with their whole lives in front of them.

Safe travels Cliff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To add some clarity, at the time the decree was drawn up I was living on the other side of the country and not knowing when I'd be back. I couldn't afford a lawyer and the idea of a 6 year old traveling across country was not realistic, at least to me...especially since I had been in the military prior and essentially the amount of time I'd been around her amount to 2.5 years of her life. Deployments suck. 

I'm seeing what I can discover before possibly needing to hire a lawyer to amend the decree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here is the actresses interview regarding that scene](http://www.pamferdin.com/interview/index.html)

FB: What was it like to kiss Clint Eastwood, in The Beguiled? That's a pretty amazing scene!

Pam: Well, you know that was pretty interesting for me because I was...when he kissed me, it wasn't in the script. How we rehearsed it up to the point, where they started the camera rolling--he was supposed to cover my mouth--because I saw, apparently, I was scared and he didn't want me to scream 'cos I saw some troops coming by. So that was the way we'd rehearsed it when we were up there in the bayou, so he went over--without my knowing it--I guess he had this idea that, it might be--I don't know, a little more provocative I guess.

I don't know cos I wasn't privy to the conversation. He went over to Don Siegal, who was the director, Clint Eastwood did, and Siegal said, "Hey! Why don't you kiss her, instead of covering her mouth with yr hand?" So basically that scene, the way I looked was actually (real). They printed the first take and that look was definitely (laughs) not a put on! Because I had NO IDEA IN THE WORLD THAT HE WAS GONNA KISS ME. So I was kinda stunned! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She spent 15K of my reenlistment bonus putting it up her nose and me being the dipshit I was, forgave her. Then she started taking more drugs, cheated on me, got tossed in a crazy bin, OD'd and finally left me. Oh, and she smacked me around and then called the police complaining I was hitting her. Thankfully they believed me. But we both got tossed in jail for the mando 24 hour cool down (Texas).

I was an enabler but when she walked out that door, it was over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd love to see more movies based upon the initial discovery of the Americas and the initial exploration of it. Think along the lines of the movie [Black Robe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdD9YUeBDlI) which is linked to the full movie.

Also, there is a book called "The Terror" which is historical fiction based upon Captain Sir John Franklin's lost expedition of HMS Erebus and HMS Terror to the Arctic in 18451848 to force the Northwest Passage.  This would make for a fascinating movie. </TEXT>
