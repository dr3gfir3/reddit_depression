	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey /r/basketball, I am an indie developer who just released a very simple basketball game at:

http://basketball.frvr.com/

I would really like your feedback! The game is 100% free to play and works on both web and mobile.

So, a few questions I would love to have answered from true fans:

1. Are you more likely to play the game because it's basketball themed?
2. Is the gameplay experience acceptable, even though the gameplay is fairly fare away from a true simulation.
3. What would make you recommend this game, or a game like it to fellow basketball fans?

Full disclosure: posting this here, I naturally hope that all of you like the game and plays it :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well you only get the pop ups when you die, so that should not be a problem for most players? ;)

No, seriously you are right I moved it around a bit so it has the following new rule set.

* You must have scored a goal before it shows
* There will be a 5 minute cool down

Hard reload to get the latest version of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey /r/WebGames here is my latest HTML5 game, this time a fun little Basketball hoop shoter. While not super complex I spend a lot of time making sure it's fun and addictive.

The game was created as a verification of the the FRVR development platform, and from idea to end total development time was 28h and 29m.

Feedback and questions are as always incrediably welcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey /r/iosgaming a bit more than a year ago I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3o43f8/what_started_out_as_a_test_ended_up_as_a_crazy/) [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) and Reddit loved it. The resulting success of you sharing the game has allowed me to build games full time ever since!

So here is my latest game [Basketball FRVR](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1185836177). Similarly to Hex FRVR it's not particularly complex, but did my very best to make it addictive. All in all I ended up spending more time playing the game than actually making. Oops.

My personal best is 71.

	<TEXT> It's getting harder and harder to be an indie as platforms becomes established. 

Typically when a new platform goes live Indies takes the chance and jumps onboard, then over time the platform matures and only people with huge marketing budgets have the means to become successful on said platform.

So, if you like indie games look at less established platforms, or platforms where few are trying to compete. Currently you should be able to find amazing inde HTML5, VR and Desktop (itch.io, gog, etc)

An interesting segment I can't figure out why more Indies are not targeting is Facebook Desktop games. There is literrally still billions to be made on this platform, but everyone seems to like Mobile so much more.
