	<TEXT> So by that logic OP couldn't identify as female until she had the surgery?
Yeah, that's how gender identity works... 
/s 

(Also, brushing up on your reading comprehension might be a good idea since you just paraphrased what I stated   didn't add anything new to the conversation other than ignorance)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm probably in the minority here, but I think you're a disrespectful little shit.  You went out of your way to bring over a girl to your parents house, knowing full well the consequences if you got caught.  It doesn't matter if nothing happened,  you still showed no respect for their religion/ culture/ beliefs 

You need to apologize,  sincerely,  to them. </TEXT>
