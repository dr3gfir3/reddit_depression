	<TEXT> So I am on the road and trying (and succeeding) to maintain ketosis but goddam I hate the food industry. 

I just bought a spinach, egg   feta cheese wrap and was planning on just eating the filling. I admit that I ended up eating the whole thing since it smelled so good toasted.

 According to the label, it had 19g net carbs so I decided I could be extra careful for the rest of the day if I indulged. The problem is that for some reason its acceptable to call a small wrap 2 servings instead of one. This wasnt even a big wrap, it was more or less the size of my fist, I never even considered that it was two servings.
