**Abstract:**

At sufficiently high temperature and energy density, nuclear matter undergoes a transition to a phase in which quarks and gluons are not confined: the quarkgluon plasma (QGP)1. Such an exotic state of strongly interacting quantum chromodynamics matter is produced in the laboratory in heavy nuclei high-energy collisions, where an enhanced production of strange hadrons is observed2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Strangeness enhancement, originally proposed as a signature of QGP formation in nuclear collisions7, is more pronounced for multi-strange baryons. Several effects typical of heavy-ion phenomenology have been observed in high-multiplicity protonproton (pp) collisions8, 9, but the enhanced production of multi-strange particles has not been reported so far. Here we present the first observation of strangeness enhancement in high-multiplicity protonproton collisions. We find that the integrated yields of strange and multi-strange particles, relative to pions, increases significantly with the event charged-particle multiplicity. The measurements are in remarkable agreement with the pPb collision results10, 11, indicating that the phenomenon is related to the final system created in the collision. In high-multiplicity events strangeness production reaches values similar to those observed in PbPb collisions, where a QGP is formed. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The genomic changes underlying both early and late stages of horse domestication remain largely unknown. We examined the genomes of 14 early domestic horses from the Bronze and Iron Ages, dating to between ~4.1 and 2.3 thousand years before present. We find early domestication selection patterns supporting the neural crest hypothesis, which provides a unified developmental origin for common domestic traits. Within the past 2.3 thousand years, horses lost genetic diversity and archaic DNA tracts introgressed from a now-extinct lineage. They accumulated deleterious mutations later than expected under the cost-of-domestication hypothesis, probably because of breeding from limited numbers of stallions. We also reveal that Iron Age Scythian steppe nomads implemented breeding strategies involving no detectable inbreeding and selection for coat-color variation and robust forelimbs. </TEXT>

It doesn't. This is not a conscious decision to look like a snake. This is all happening at the genetic level; mutations that together start looking like a snake. It's random and there are only so many genetic combinations that will create only so many types of morphological outcomes. None of this is planned and again it takes many many generations, thousands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist popping in here! Someone summoned me further down but I figured I'd share here too. This is a masterpiece of evolution. :)

This species is *Hemeroplanes triptolemus* (family [Sphingidae](http://www.butterfliesandmoths.org/taxonomy/sphingidae), more on them [here](https://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/nature-blows-my-mind-caterpillar-looks-like-snake-hemeroplanes-triptolemus.html)). Mimicry is a pretty fantastic and fascinating part of evolution! This caterpillar is the larval form of Hemeroplanes triptolemus a moth of the family Sphingidae (more on them here). These guys are found in parts of South America, Africa and Central America.

This type of mimicry is called [Batesian mimicry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batesian_mimicry), where a harmless organism mimics a harmful organism. In this case, the caterpillar is mimicking a tree viper.

This process is very very long and takes several generations. Don't forget about all of the caterpillars that hatched and didn't make it, there are a lot of failures along the way here. So for this path to snake looking caterpillars, I'll explain this as plainly as possible; a few caterpillars hatch and grow, maybe some sort of resemble the coloring of this snake or have better overall camouflage than their brothers and sisters. They survive to breed and with others who also have advantageous morphology. From there those that look even closer to the snake survive and so on and so forth. It's usually *a very slow* process that takes generations for them to mimic something on such an impressive level. It's not always only one mutation that does this either, it may take many mutations to really get it "right."

Batesian mimicry is an incredibly successful form of mimicry! The other kind is [*Mllerian mimicry*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCllerian_mimicry), where two or more harmful species that look similar in appearance mutually advertise themselves as harmful. An example here would be many [wasps and hornets](http://www.wildones.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2013/09/BeeAndWaspChart.jpeg) having black and yellow striping to advertise they are unpleasant to be stung by or [poisonous tropical frogs](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/cb/41/ab/cb41ab5d510e2e2808c8286caada9852.jpg) having similar patterns and bright coloration. Fun thing about wasp coloration they are also part of the Batesian mimicry scheme of other harmless organisms such as [this hoverfly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/Wasp_mimicking_hoverfly.jpg) or this [robber fly](http://bugguide.net/images/raw/LQB/R3K/LQBR3KVR3KNRYKWRI01R70CQM0BR3K1RRQCQ20CQG0VRHQJQYKBRXQAR3K1RHQFR90FQU0S0P0OR.jpg).

**Abstract:**

Recently rediscovered black phosphorus is a layered semiconductor with promising electronic and photonic properties. Dynamic control of its bandgap can allow for the exploration of new physical phenomena. However, theoretical investigations and photoemission spectroscopy experiments indicate that in its few-layer form, an exceedingly large electric field in the order of several volts per nanometre is required to effectively tune its bandgap, making the direct electrical control unfeasible. Here we reveal the unique thickness-dependent bandgap tuning properties in intrinsic black phosphorus, arising from the strong interlayer electronic-state coupling. Furthermore, leveraging a 10nm-thick black phosphorus, we continuously tune its bandgap from 300 to below 50meV, using a moderate displacement field up to 1.1Vnm1. Such dynamic tuning of bandgap may not only extend the operational wavelength range of tunable black phosphorus photonic devices, but also pave the way for the investigation of electrically tunable topological insulators and semimetals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist walking in here. I really love this gif! If ever there was a reminder of how closely related we are, here it is. I never make two trips either if I can help it. My man RandyMagnum here is speaking with some insight.

As we all know, we share [98.8%](http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/permanent-exhibitions/human-origins-and-cultural-halls/anne-and-bernard-spitzer-hall-of-human-origins/understanding-our-past/dna-comparing-humans-and-chimps/) of our DNA with these amazing animals. Though I see that percentage change depending on the source, but not by much. It's incredible to think such a tiny number of nucleotides separates us. 

There are two species within the genus *Pan*: [Common Chimpanzees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee) (*Pan troglodytes*) and [Bonobos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonobo) (*Pan paniscus*). They diverged from a common ancestor around [2 million years ago](https://www.eva.mpg.de/3chimps/files/apes.htm) and are very different in the way they look (morphologically) and behave. I have no idea which species our fruit carrying friend here is, I'm not a *Pan* specialist. I do know, however, their social structures are very different as is their behavior in general.

Bonobos are much smaller than the Common chimpanzee and used to be called "Pygmy chimps" before Bonobos. They have redder lips, are more slender and their faces are black. Females also have very large clitorises which makes sense given their common sexual behavior. Bonobos have a female dominated hierarchy, fighting is rare between males and females, males are fairly tolerant to young even those from other males, and they have an interesting sociosexual dynamic. Bonobos frequently use sexual behavior to promote bonding, after fights to sooth relationships and tension, between members of the same sex, and aside from humans they are the only other animal to engage in face-to-face sex. They are considered the "nicer" of the two species.

Contrastingly, the common chimpanzee can live in several social groups of all males, females with young, or both sexes. Males form a dominance hierarchy and tend to be very aggressive. They also do not exhibit the sociosexual relationships Bonobos have, but they do care for their young, play and have warm relationships with each other.

I linked this above, but the [Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology](https://www.eva.mpg.de/3chimps/files/apes.htm) has an awesome table listing out their differences. I recommend giving it a look.

Both species are incredibly fascinating and there are a ton of articles out there if you're interested in learning more. I've shared really the bare minimum here because I am writing this comment and making pancakes, sausage, and bacon. :) I type a little between flipping. If you're into it, you might like /r/ScienceFacts or my [Instagram feed](https://www.instagram.com/fillsyourniche/?hl=en) which is all nature and facts about the organism in my photos.

	<TEXT> Ecologist popping in here.

I can certainly understand why everyone is so upset, but this headline is really fishy (sorry, no pun intended). Polar bears are naturally solitary, as /u/Iamnotburgerking has stated. They actively avoid each other in the wild because they will cannibalize each other's cubs. [As far as I know it is male bears that do this](http://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/dramatic-footage-shows-polar-bear-cannibalizing-cub/), I'm not aware of females but that doesn't mean it doesn't happen - I haven't read about it. A heads up on that link, it does contain a video you may not want to watch of a male bear chasing down a cub, but the article describes males eating cubs. If that makes you uncomfortable the video doesn't start playing unless you click on it, so you can ignore it. I'm only using it as a source for my claim.

That being said, putting two females together will still be stressful though certainly not as stressful as with a male partner. I see from articles that the female who died was 21 and lived in the zoo for 20 years. She may be a little more used to company if she was raised in this situation, but that built in discomfort of being around another bear doesn't go away. That's part of the species and to assume it doesn't exist because they lived together for 20 years is incorrect. We have to remember bears are not humans and not even social which would change their dynamic greatly. If we were talking about animals that were social and lived together in groups, as many primates do or elephants or even wolves then this would be another story. 

PITA is anthropomorphizing these bears which can be very dangerous. Anthropomorphizing can lead to putting animals in stressful and dangerous situations because we assume they think and feel as we do, but in all honestly they don't. I can't stress enough that solitary animals together in a small enclosure is not healthy.

Another point to be made, a 21-year-old polar bear is a very old bear. On average polar bears [live 15-18 years in the wild](https://polarbearsinternational.org/polar-bears/polar-bear-faq/), and can live longer in captivity. That is not a guarantee they will and it doesn't take away from the fact that 21 is still quite old. Elderly animals get stressed much easier and their bodies have a harder time responding to that stress than a younger animal. This does not mean the bear was heart broken, it means her daily routine has been interrupted and she cannot cope with it. We have no way of knowing exactly what that bear was feeling and jumping to conclusions doesn't do anyone any good here. Least of all these polar bears if we continue to pair them up when they should be alone or honestly not in zoos at all. Polar bears have incredibly long ranges in the wild and keeping them in a relatively small enclosure is not healthy at all.

Finally, Sea World is not known for taking excellent care of its animals. :/ I won't speculate or jump to conclusions myself without knowing exactly what that enclosure was like and how the lives of those bears went, but knowing their work with Orcas I don't have a lot of faith in Sea World.

I know you guys are concerned and seem to love the bears. I understand. We have to think with clear heads here though. There are a lot of factors to consider in the death of this bear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A frill-necked lizard was featured on the reverse of the Australian 2-cent coin until 1991. Some folks keep them as pets.

These lizards are actually fairly large at 85 cm (2.79 ft) in total length. They flair their frills out like this when they are trying to scare off a predator to make themselves look larger. 

[National Geographic fun fact](http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/frilled-lizard/):

Besides defense, this lizard's colorful frill may be used to help regulate body temperature.

[The babies are actually pretty cute!](http://rivista-cdn.reptilesmagazine.com/135105802.jpg?ver=1400005992)

Some folks even keep them as pets. Reptiles Magazine has a [Care Sheet](http://www.reptilesmagazine.com/Care-Sheets/Frilled-Lizard-Care-Sheet/) on them. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The discovery of planets orbiting double stars at close distances has sparked increasing scientific interest in determining whether Earth-analogues can remain habitable in such environments and how their atmospheric dynamics is influenced by the rapidly changing insolation. In this work we present results of the first three-dimensional numerical experiments of a water-rich planet orbiting a double star. We find that the periodic forcing of the atmosphere has a noticeable impact on the planets climate. Signatures of the forcing frequencies related to the planets as well as to the binarys orbital periods are present in a variety of climate indicators such as temperature and precipitation, making the interpretation of potential observables challenging. However, for Earth-like greenhouse gas concentrations, the variable forcing does not change the range of insolation values allowing for habitable climates substantially. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ecologist flying in.

While hummingbirds enter torpor in the evening (a short form of hibernation), this poor thing has definitely gone on to meet its maker. Hummingbirds are prone to heart attack given their accelerated heart rate and metabolism. It is also especially likely right now as we are in full swing for migration season. According to [this journal article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01920240?LI=true)

Small hummingbirds achieve the highest known mass-specific metabolic rates among vertebrate homeotherms.

That takes a toll on the heart and circulatory system. Adult humming birds of the species *Eupetomena macroura macroura* have resting heart rates of [428 to 460 beats per minute on the average](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ar.1091590402/full). Compared to the average adult human resting heart rate of [60 to 100 beats per minute](http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/heart-rate/faq-20057979).

It could have also waited too long to get food, or could be injured from a fight. There are a lot of variables here.

Brian Doyle has a great [write up here](https://theamericanscholar.org/joyas-volardores/#) for more information on hummingbirds and their lives.    </TEXT>

Seriously though, there's nothing wrong with canon. First, calling things you don't like "autistic" is pretty lousy. Second, I love that the new media all fit together within the Universe. Why not bridge the gaps and create a cohesive storyline? It works just fine. Everything is timed out to work so yes "that shit can happen." </TEXT>

A scene in high contrast this thoughtful night skyscape is a modern composition inspired by M. C. Escher's lithograph Phosphorescent Sea. In it, bright familiar stars of Orion the Hunter and Aldebaran, eye of Taurus the Bull, hang in clear dark skies above a distant horizon. Below, faintly luminous edges trace an otherworldly constellation of patterns in mineral-crusted mud along the Uyuni Salt Flat of southwest Bolivia. The remains of an ancient lake, the Uyuni Salt Flat, Salar de Uyuni, is planet Earth's largest salt flat, located on the Bolivian Altiplano at an altitude of about 3,600 meters. Escher's 1933 lithograph also featured familiar stars in planet Earth's night, framing The Plough or Big Dipper above waves breaking on a more northern shore. </TEXT>

**Abstract:**

The relationship between dinosaurs and other reptiles is well established1, 2, 3, 4, but the sequence of acquisition of dinosaurian features has been obscured by the scarcity of fossils with transitional morphologies. The closest extinct relatives of dinosaurs either have highly derived morphologies5, 6, 7 or are known from poorly preserved8, 9 or incomplete material10, 11. Here we describe one of the stratigraphically lowest and phylogenetically earliest members of the avian stem lineage (Avemetatarsalia), Teleocrater rhadinus gen. et sp. nov., from the Middle Triassic epoch. The anatomy of T. rhadinus provides key information that unites several enigmatic taxa from across Pangaea into a previously unrecognized clade, Aphanosauria. This clade is the sister taxon of Ornithodira (pterosaurs and birds) and shortens the ghost lineage inferred at the base of Avemetatarsalia. We demonstrate that several anatomical features long thought to characterize Dinosauria and dinosauriforms evolved much earlier, soon after the birdcrocodylian split, and that the earliest avemetatarsalians retained the crocodylian-like ankle morphology and hindlimb proportions of stem archosaurs and early pseudosuchians. Early avemetatarsalians were substantially more species-rich, widely geographically distributed and morphologically diverse than previously recognized. Moreover, several early dinosauromorphs that were previously used as models to understand dinosaur origins may represent specialized forms rather than the ancestral avemetatarsalian morphology. </TEXT>
