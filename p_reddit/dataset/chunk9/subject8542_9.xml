	<TEXT> I survived a severely emotionally relationship and I can confirm that gaslighting is one of the most clever, subtle, and damaging forms of abuse that there is. I have several other peers from support groups who've experienced similar circumstances, and I have yet to meet a single victim of emotional abuse who was able to realize they were being gaslit while it was happening. It's almost doing a disservice for people to continue talking about how idiotic Donald Trump is. The act of inflicting verbal abuse, reeling yourself in, and then convincing your victim that the abuse didn't happen is an incredibly calculated and intentional act; he knows exactly what he's doing, and we as the American people need to start recognizing this behavior and naming it for what it is.

	<TEXT> Social Work student specializing in mental health here. There are a LOT of misconceptions about schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is actually a pretty broad term, and there are a variety of symptoms that can manifest - it doesn't mean that you are just watching around in a perpetual acid trip, despite how it's commonly portrayed.

Depression isn't always, as a particularly shitty counselor once told me, the "common cold of mental illnesses." Depression can manifest as psychosis and catatonia in severe cases - just because it is commonly recognized and widely treated does not mean that it is easy to live with, by any means. </TEXT>
