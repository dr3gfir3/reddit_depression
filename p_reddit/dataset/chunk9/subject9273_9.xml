	<TEXT> Young Destiny player here, this is why i can never do lfg or raid with randoms because 90% of players that put up posts for raids or nightfalls always want adults ONLY, this is why i've only ever beat one raid with close friends. But i can agree there some stupid kids out there that don't follow instructions or just be an idiot. </TEXT>
