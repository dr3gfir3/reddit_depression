	<TEXT> Okay, I think I see what you're attempting to say here.

I think my the issue I took with what you were saying stems from the fact that I thought you were making a blanket statement instead of talking about cards that are already powerful.

Even in that context, what you actually said the first time is still pretty wonky. It actually directly contradicts this 
 A card or strategy can break a format, if it's both broken and difficult to answer

the qualities are different, but one is a modifier on the other.

from my understanding you said this 
The fact that an opponent can or can't interact with a card does not determine brokenness. A card or strategy can break a format, if it's both broken and difficult to answer; but those are two different qualities.

and meant this:  
The fact that an opponent can or can't interact with a card does not determine brokenness in and of itself. A card or strategy can break a format, if it's both broken and difficult to answer; but those are two different qualities.

Saying interaction doesn't matter, than proceeding to list all the ways to interact with will to prove a point is a little weird.

I would say that once a minimum amount of power is reached, the inability to interact with an effect is an indicator of and modifier on power level regardless of even the competitive game in question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this What your opponents can do is not relevant to a card's power level.

Is silly. of course it is.  If it wasn't hexproof wouldn't be a mechanic, and threat resiliency wouldn't be a thing. you're essentially saying the ability to interact with a spell isn't relevant to a that spells power, which is not remotely true. 

Fast mana enables nonsense. ban the fast mana, ban the nonsense, or print better answers to both.

they consistently print more nonsense and they inconsistently  print reasonable answers, but they have been banning enablers in every format for years, so it looks like opal or spirit guide get the axe.

Keep in mind they now have a buisness model of printing nonsense, so yeah.

To be clear, I don't think either spirit guide or opal should be banned, but they will mostly because current card design breaks these cards. Failure to balance cards that end up in modern is way too visible for this stuff to keep existing, and the bar for bans is getting lower all the time.

So for image reasons, opal gets the axe.

	<TEXT> cool, ban spirit guide too.

Look, they pretty clearly need to ban threats, ban enablers, or print answers. They want to make better threats, ban enablers, and make answers suck most of the time.

Opal is probably getting the axe, cause Wizards has cognitive dissonance on lock when it comes to bannings. 

Also consider how many fewer large modern events there are/ will be, and what this deck does to players at the local level, especially in light of Wizards focus on removing events that would weed this thing out. Consistency matters a lot less at fnms and 5 round swiss monthlys.

Ultimately, the increased ban schedule allows them to react better to changing perceptions, so they will. If they didn't have a decreased focus on data, they would have just left the schedule as it was so they could collect more data from bannings.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> legacy is so much slower, playing around/ through daze takes a turn/ waste takes another, then force blanks another turn. delver doesn't have the full sequence often, but partially doing this causes the whole format to slow down and makes cards like [[tireless tracker]] and [[knight of the reliquary]] much more playable.

In modern, I'd settle for wasteland though. most modern combo decks slow down considerably or fold after getting their first land cacked, but more importantly the card forces those decks to reevaluate which hands are keepable.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get a better story that way, but power level balance still gets the shaft by R D pushing iconic cards. 

thinking about it though, blaming them is hard because focusing on story/setting/characters can be hit or miss. you get fifth dawn or ravnica, kamigawa or nemesis, "The Gathering Dark" or freaking " Scourge"

OTOH, "Brothers War" was character focused. Maybe the key is not treating your audience like drooling idiots and cooptiing the worst parts of comics, like retcons and multiple character origins, and reboots and crossovers that require reading 3 other titles to know wtf is happening. 

Even comics are coming to the realization that this is a problem, and are doing what they can to fix it. 

btw, any sort of successful MTG movie or video game will be the no turning back point, because then you have the "MTG cinematic universe" and if you think you're tired now... </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-26 11:52:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> disclaimer: I typically play legacy and draft.

Hi!  I've noticed a petty big hole in my ability to play certain decks/ analyse certain gamestates, which is my inabilty to notice when to switch gameplans when the clues are subtle, and this comes up most often when I am playing a mirror match.

I've noticed it happen at two points: when sideboarding, and when both players have similar board states, and it gets so much worse the more information is hidden.

The good news is, when you choose wrong in legacy, you get punished immediately, so I get good feedback that way. I get to point to exactly what I did wrong and say " that was where I missassigned my role."   

heres an example of a board state that usually gets me killed:  

My board: 2 x plains, rishadan port, aether vial@3, flickerwisp,
thalia guardian of thraben, In hand swords to plowshares.  

Oppenent has: 2x plains, port, vial @3, serra avenger, sanctum prelate @1, One unknown card.

The play for me is clearly nothing, but what is my plan here?

example sideboarding disaster in the making: Lands mirror. what is the plan? not individual sideboard cards, but what the heck am I trying to accomplish here?  Is it a race or are we trying to go over each other? Am i trying to disrupt or to prevent disruption? note those questions are interlinked.

I'm not trying to get answers on a case by case basis, but to illustrate my core problem of missassigning my role when my role is  some combination of fluid and hand dependent, and my opponent has a similar deck/ board state.

until I get this figured out, I can't competently pilot any deck capable of switching gameplans that consists of cards which do similar things like delver variants, lands, or miracles, and even death and taxes to a lesser degree. I actually need to pilot decks with a more shoeboxed plan, which actually keeps me out of most of the tier one strategies of the format. 

Hilariously, I'm priced out of brainstorm on the strategic level. I can only cast it even close to correctly in storm or other combo, where the plan is pretty clear. otherwise, i'll missassign  my role and promptly lose.

What do you guys suggest I do to learn this aspect of the game? Is there a specific format that showcases the consequnces of the lack of this skill, where I can practice?

	<TEXT> I was going through the depths for the first time and just got the sewer key then I opened the door to the bonfire and got invaded while pressing the button to interact with it, then died in front of the door. 

Then the same guy invaded me again, I fought him just before the basilisks in the basement. luckily, he had to kill the things to get to me, and more luckily I beat him. But I never got to even see the petrification breath, and next time through was caught completely by suprise.

Then he invaded me again, and I killed him in a spell and a combo. He didn't come back.

Just to be clear, this wasnt one of the preset invasion guys, he had a name like "ArmRAmor113" or something equally silly, this was a real guy.

This made me curious about pvp etiquite, so i looked it up.

The thing is I don't even care about this facet of online play, and killing a guy in front of his bonfire seems like a dick move.

IDK, just salty i guess.        </TEXT>

KTK seemed way better upon including the rest of the block, despite being good in all the ways you stated otherwise.

kaladesh block has been them incorporating lesser versions of all their previous mistakes.

Vehicles: too good or hot garbage, depending on activation cost, see mirrodin  

improvise: not enough support, see saviors of kamigawa and "hand size matters"

fabricate: usually not a choice due to format context, arguably see tribute here.  

revolt: overreward the agressor for actions they would take anyways, see Origins and Renown.

Seriously though, the whole reason they started this up was so that they could tell the story on the cards better. if they have to resort to the website to this extent anyways, what was the point?

keep in mind, urza block was a trainwreck because they had to add Urza artifact story at the 11'th hour. They've gotten better at getting creative and R D on the same page, but all the underlying problems still exist, which is why we got kaladesh. They still need to push iconic nonsense, In urza's block they screwed up the theme and in kaladesh they screwed up on individual cards.

In both cases, power level balance took a back seat to story. </TEXT>

I can now:  
-Go through the underwater place a bit, but transient curse is really expensive    
- tackle the depths, I looked around in there a bit but got kinda scared when i saw the rat get eaten by the floor.  
-go to blighttown via valley of the drakes, turns out the drakes on the ledge are easy to pull and kill, and that "nurgle" dragon isn't as scary as it looks.  
-darkroot garden pt 2 from basin, not sure if thats a can of worms I want to open yet.  
-whatever happens to be past the skelotons in firelink

I also have floating 20000 souls, I was told to use on upgrading my weapon to magic but I can't find green titanite to save my life, I can't even find large titanite for normal upgrade purposes.

Grossest enemy so far: the toad/manta/mushroom thing.

funniest: The guy i killed while he was screwing his dog in the depths kitchen. I wonder if he finished first? lol.

	<TEXT> Honestly, depends on the supporting cast. I can't imagine Delver being better in this film than he was in his breakout blockbuster "Insects in the RUG", but maybe the other cast members will overperform.

Making this film on a lower budget for a niche audience should allow for greater creativity on the part of the director, too. He shouldn't be afraid to try different film techniques and casting options. 

Btw if this film becomes a cult classic, who do you think will be most scared by the unique brand of horror that this movie specialises in? I've watched " The Bugman, the Pyromaniac, and the Necro-cannibal" and that brand of horror didn't do anything for me,
especially the zombie fish thing in a world with that sick demon.


TL, DR: movie theme, budget deck should be okay and question of what this delver variant is good against.

	<TEXT> diablo 3 collectors, bought at launch so i could play it but now the drm has locked me out. Battle.net doesn't even recognize that i have an account but also wont let me make a new one, and customer service says i'm SOL.

I'm never buying blizzard again, both because they're terrible and because I really can't.

I have starcraft 2 and warcraft 3 that I have to pretty much throw in the garbage too, the only thing i can do with the D3 CE is sell it.

tldr: blizzard sucks, can't be their customer if i wanted to.  </TEXT>
