	<TEXT> Since 2001, herbs, spices, some herbal infusions and teas, peanuts, almonds, cashews and pistachios are irradiated in Australia. Since 2002, nine tropical fruits have also been irradiated and these are: breadfruit, carambola, custard apple, litchi, longan, mango, mangosteen, papaya and rambutan.

http://www.wholesomehub.net.au/view/irradiation-fumigation/23

Inhibits sprouting does not actually say it stops it, I'll plant a few Alphonso seeds then, supposed to be very good.

Didn't know about the flowers. Why are we even importing flowers ?

Mate used to export Kangaroo Paws to Japan (air freight out of Coffs)

From memory he was getting $6 a stem, then Israel started growing them and it became uneconomic. 


Another guy here was growing long stem Carnations and doing the same thing, he couldn't quite get them to 36 inches tall which the Japanese wanted so that the flower would last a month with an inch getting cut off daily. Became a Hydro lettuce farm, then was sold to Indians who are growing cucumbers currently.

That family by marriage was related to the actor who played Jim the learner in Sunday Too Far Away... Was a part owner of the BP Servo.
