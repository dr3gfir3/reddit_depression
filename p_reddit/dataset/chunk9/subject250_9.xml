	<TEXT> I study English in school, and have never come across the word canonically. I looked up the definitions and they tell me the "Definition of canonical

2
:  conforming to a general rule or acceptable procedure :  orthodox His proposals were generally accepted as canonical.
3
:  of or relating to a clergyman who is a canon
4
:  reduced to the canonical form a canonical matrix
canonicallyplay \-k(-)l\ adverb


What am I missing, or is the OP incorrectly using this word?  </TEXT>
