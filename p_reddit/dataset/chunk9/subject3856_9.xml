	<TEXT> I was (Still am) a huge fan of Seamus, i got into the creatures through him about half way into the first house and watched every creatures video and all of Seamus', James' and sly's videos. It was around when seamus left that the creatures fell apart for me and when cow chop came around i sadly jumped ship to cow chop, I do still go back and watch a bunch of classic creatures tho </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I prefer live action compared to series like spelunky and mario party, but i love series like dark souls and heavy rain just a tad more than live action. I think they should have at least 1 long form series going at any given time, but that is just one mans opinion </TEXT>
