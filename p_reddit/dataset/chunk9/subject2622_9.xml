	<TITLE> When making a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich, Which do you spread first? (story inside) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-10 13:36:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last week I was making a PB J sandwich and I noticed some jelly in the peanut butter. I was like "How the fuck does that happen? You always spread peanut butter first..."  So I showed my brother and he said "You spread peanut butter first? That's weird." Discussion ensued.

I base my spreading habits on two ideas. First, it's easier to prevent peanut butter from transferring to the jelly. Second, even if you happen to get peanut butter in the jelly, it doesn't matter because Jelly is supposed to be refrigerated. Whereas if you get jelly in the peanut butter, that jelly will no longer be refrigerated for as long as it remains in the peanut butter. 

Thoughts?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My brother is a shy guy. Ladies dig him because he's "cute" but he never has the courage to talk to any of them. One night he got his nose DESTROYED in a fight. It was relocated about an inch to the left. 

Due to his body's natural pain killers... and perhaps some prescription ones... He hit on every nurse that walked by. He got a few giggles with his crazy lines but was inevitably shut down by all of them. I remember his favorite opener was a stuffy nosed "Hellooo ladies!" with dual finger guns.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It get's tiring to sort, move, and deliver so much useless crap. However, I'm thankful to have decent mail volume to keep me employed.  If we weren't delivering it, most of it would still find a way to come as printed material. Whether it comes as an insert in the newspaper or an ad/offer thrown in with items you ordered online, they will always find a way. As for waste, my area has recently implemented some recycling bins in the lobbies so that P.O. box customers can recycle it on the spot and I would hope a fair portion of delivery customers are recycling what they can. I would hardly say we "contribute" to the waste.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you have some credit established already? If so, go ahead and pay cash. If you could use the positive credit history, borrow a bit. The plus side of that is that you'll still have savings and you always have the option of an early payoff.

In my experience no one cares about how much money you have. It's all about your proven ability to acquire and pay back debt. No one will lend you money until you prove you can pay it back but you can't prove you can pay it back unless someone will lend it to you.  </TEXT>
