	<TEXT> I apologize for the omission. The space available on the top is reserved for children who are allowed free range access to the cabin via climbing over the top seated passengers. The bottom space is reserved for the elderly and handicapped, since there are no bathrooms on this configuration, they are most likely not to be able to hold their bowles for the duration of the flight. So for the comfort of the other passengers they will be placed at the bottom of the stack. Some concessions must be made for customer satisfaction. The walking space between the seat stacks is reserved for cabin crew to allow enough room to properly beat unruly passengers during re-accommodations.  </TEXT>

Given those parameters each tit is 736 Liters. That comes out to 662 Kg per tit or 1324 Kg for the set. Roughly 2921lbs..just shy of hanging a mini-cooper from your chest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you plan on using the Wyvern just rip your Shift key off your keyboard. You won't need that anymore.  Slow as fuck. Flying and running on the ground. Stam is so low that the special attack (flame, lightening, poison) is unusable now. One bonus is no more "ice skating" while trying to land. And it's really easy to pick stuff up flying 3mph. I have a couple points in speed on my char maybe 115%. I fairly certain I could whip a wyver's ass in a footrace.  </TEXT>
