	<TEXT> I knew a girl (she was 23) who would make up stories to impress people. I started getting suspicious because her stories were very dramatic and didn't match up. She told one girl that her first boyfriend pretended to love her and then broke up with her right after she slept with him, and another girl that her first boyfriend died tragically in a car accident and that she found a letter afterwards of him declaring his love for her. She constantly chimed in during conversations with outrageous movie-plot stories.

Now, this young woman was very overweight and extremely unattractive. At one point she was talking about all the guys she had given blowjobs to and I blurted out "what does cum taste like?" She threw her head back and laughed, and I asked, "No really, what does it taste like?"

Then she went silent for a while, and then said "like Jello." When I pointed out Jello didn't have a taste, she then started faltering and saying she didn't remember, it was suddenly only one guy, and he was drunk (as if him being drunk were the reason SHE wouldn't remember).

I mean, I get that she probably was lonely and had social issues her whole life. There was definitely a sad aspect to it. My roommate was her friend, so one day when the two of them were walking together my roommate told her she didn't have to make up stories and to just be herself. The fat girl insisited she wasn't making up stories, they were all true, my roommate said everyone knew the stories were fake. They talked, my roommate thought everything was good after that, and then the fat girl went around saying my roommate was bullying her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When Japan invaded China, the reason they were so successful at invading a much bigger country was that the Chinese were so used to being invaded by Westerners that they no longer cared. They assumed the Japanese would treat them better than the Chinese government of the time, even, so huge cities of Chinese men would just wave white flags in the air and wait for a tiny band of Japanese soldiers to come tie them up one by one. They assumed they would get treated well and have their lives spared for being obedient. Meanwhile, the Japanese did not believe in surrender and was disgusted by this display of what they considered cowardice.

Once all the weapons of Chinese soldiers were confiscated, they would get lined up in front of a trench and get bayonetted one by one. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-04-24 21:51:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A friend of mine back in college told me that the first time he joined his university's choir, the choir director had him sing up the scales and then put him under tenor after he managed to go up to a B4 or so. He was dying in the tenor section, so he asked the choir director if he could move to bass. She tested him again, and when she saw how low he could go she said "Oh my god, why did I put you under tenor?" And moved him.

After that he took voice lessons for free from the university, and the voice teacher too said he was a tenor and that he just needed practice at the high end. He sang with her for a little bit, decided he didn't like her, and took lessons with 2 other teachers who told him he was a baritone. Last I heard, he got a new teacher who is now teaching him to sing as a bass.

How could there be that much variation from all these professionals? One of the reasons I am asking is because I have always been told I was a soprano by choir directors and voice teachers despite my low notes, but on a post I made yesterday some people were speculating I was actually more of an alto. It makes me wonder if I was miscategorized and am being trained incorrectly? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been teaching myself Ancient Greek, but I live in Southern California and there don't seem to be many resources here - no one here seems to know it, I can't sign up for classes. I did take Latin for 4 years in high school though.

I know the English translation, so working backwards I think...

Aeide is infinitive, second person singular

Thea is vocative?

Peleiadeo is genetive (of Peleus)

Axileos is nominative?

I know "menin" means Rage by process of elimination, is that the nominative?

	<TEXT> Some community where they shared the craziest stuff they could find: videos, pictures, news articles, etc. But some stuff was pretty sick, from really kinky porno to shocking violence, and so there were definitely creepy people in the group. It eventually evolved into cliques where they would viciously gang up on anyone who accidentally made a repost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the input - Think of Me is one of the songs my voice teacher is having me work on, which is why I was considering it. Since she is training me as a soprano almost all the music I work on is soprano music, although when I am singing high notes during lessons she compliments how open they are - maybe I am only tightening here because I recorded it in my car.

Maybe Don't Cry for Me Argentina would be better for me, or that Moana song </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is Think of Me a good choir audition song? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since choir audition season is approaching, I need to prepare a song for various choir auditions. I have only sung second soprano in SSAATTBB choirs, but I think I can do the other female parts too (although not sure how well I can sing a harmony, have enough trouble finding my notes as an S2).

Would Think of Me from Phantom of the Opera be a good audition song or is it too cliche? What other song is better? I have done 3 years of choir throughout my life and 4 months of voice lessons. 28/F.

This is me singing it, I fake a man voice for the guy part lol.

	<TEXT> A conversation between me and my 23-year-old roommate. She is so sweet, but so clueless.

Roommate: I am applying to an art school in the US.

Me: Cool! Which one?

Roommate: (she names some crappy college they do ads for on TV)

Me: Wait, why there?

Roommate: It's the best.

Me: Says who?

Roommate: I looked online for the best art schools and it shows up.

Me: That's an ad! No, okay, you know how you always go on DevianArt? Why not talk to your favorite artists and ask them where they went to school?

*a week later*

Roommate: I found out where to do my master's degree! I was talking to my favorite artist on DevianArt like you said, and he told me about his school!

Me: His own school? He's a teacher?

Roommate: No, he's just a student. He's 16, but he says he is going there when he graduates from high school.

Me: YOU ASKED A 16 YEAR OLD WHERE TO DO YOUR MASTER'S DEGREE? What does he know, he's 16!

My roommate then started giggling uncontrollably, like it just occurred to her she did something dumb after I said that out loud. </TEXT>
