	<TEXT> the problem is the "10/10" rating is that most people consider games that get a 5, utter pieces of shit

even though a game rated 5 should be an OK game, and everything below a 5/10 should be considered sorta bad games.

So based on this, i consider a "10/10" game some of the best ever. And there are only a couple of games like that. And none of them are from Valve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never understood the appeal

Sure, they aren't BAD games, at all. of course not. but the 2 best games ever made?

they are way too short and way too easy. I only completed them coz they were short. but i got bored half way through both. i hoped the 2nd game had more interesting stuff added, but apart from some more dialog and such, it really didn't add much.. I think the humor was the main thing that had me complete the games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very true

but games will (hopefully) start to utilize more cores in the future. Prey which released only a few days ago, runs at higher fps on Ryzen...

Both consoles run on AMD-made 8 core processors... i'd say 6-8 cores is the future - for gaming.

Of course if you dont plan on buying any newer games, an intel i5 or i7 would be (a slightly) better purchase. Though as soon as you stream or record your gameplay or something... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ran into a guy who tried to sell me a security service such as this. and i live in an apartment building with a buzzer to enter the door. 

i felt that most thieves would probably go 100 meters across the street and steal from the large houses with easy-to-enter windows/doors

I do have an insurance though, which is all i'd really need. i dont really have much of sentimental value, and that is rarely what a thief would steal anyway. Usually i assume laptops and jewelery/money.... smaller things of high "street value"

but thanks for this post. It confirms my theory :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comedy movies that want a "serious" ending to the story (like the movie click. it had so much potential in the beginning, but it just screws itself over and ends up being this drama about a sad guy who didn't live his life..)

Many comedies do this, or something similar, at least i feel that MOST comedy movies completely lose any sense of comedy at the last 20ish minutes. there are a few exceptions though, such as dumb and dumber. </TEXT>
