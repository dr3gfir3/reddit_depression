KEY POINTS:
* "Past tense" not "passed tense".
* "Or" not "nor" (since you are not using "neither").
* "None" has an "e" on the end.
* If you must use "they" to refer to an individual, don't switch to "he" twice in the next sentence.

COMMENT: 
Note that using linguistic errors in another user's post to ridicule, discredit, or question the intelligence of that user constitutes an automatic fail.

	<TEXT> In many cases - probably the ones you're noticing - the script was changed after the footage was shot to remove a line or something. The director or editor will then select a shot from behind to cover the edit. This is similar to the "noddy shot" in interviews - you get a shot of the interviewer nodding thoughtfully while the subject speaks. This is to cover edits so that you don't see the join. Interviewers will often shoot 30 seconds of noddy shots at the end of an interview session to make sure they have enough with the correct lighting, in the right room etc. in case of need in the edit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you are referring to is generally known as a "bouquet" of channels. One way of looking at it is that it actually helps maintain choice by spreading out the revenue that the bouquet generated - that one really niche channel that you like in your "entertainment package" is supported by sharing in the total revenue that would otherwise go to just the few channels that EVERYBODY wants. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's apparently more likely that we are living in a simulation than that we are not. There have been a number of theoretical and philosophical arguments around this. The most developed is probably the Simulation Hypothesis published by Nick Bostrom which lays out the argument formally as follows:

"A technologically mature "posthuman" civilization would have enormous computing power. Based on this empirical fact, the simulation argument shows that at least one of the following propositions is true:

The fraction of human-level civilizations that reach a posthuman stage is very close to zero;

The fraction of posthuman civilizations that are interested in running ancestor-simulations is very close to zero;

The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one.

If (1) is true, then we will almost certainly go extinct before reaching posthumanity. If (2) is true, then there must be a strong convergence among the courses of advanced civilizations so that virtually none contains any relatively wealthy individuals who desire to run ancestor-simulations and are free to do so. If (3) is true, then we almost certainly live in a simulation. In the dark forest of our current ignorance, it seems sensible to apportion ones credence roughly evenly between (1), (2), and (3).

Unless we are now living in a simulation, our descendants will almost certainly never run an ancestor-simulation."

(Copied from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)

There is also the fact that there is a minimum size (the Planck Constant) for things in the universe (ie things are "quantised", from which we get "quantum mechanics") - this implies that that the universe could be mapped to quantised data.

There was a paper published recently that suggests that all physical simulations have distinct asymmetries and that if we can find those asymmetric characteristics in the universe, we would have shown that the universe is a simulation. The authors suggest measuring cosmic rays to look for these asymmetries.

	<TEXT> Halo movie? You mean like Forward Unto Dawn?

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_4:_Forward_Unto_Dawn

And Ridley Scott has been threatening to adapt The Forever War for the last few years.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Forever_War

Edge of Tomorrow has powered armour and possibly lots of bug-shooting, but I think its focus is elsewhere rather than on straight military scifi.

Having said all that, Forward Unto Dawn is hardly big-budget, and The Forever War seems to be stalled. I'm not sure the time is right for the powered armour bug hunt end of the scale. Our bogeyman for this decade and the last is more insidious (TERRORISTS!) than the Red Menace paranoia of the Cold War that spawned the great military sci if novels. Instead we get class war (Elysium) and militaristic all-is-not-as-it-seems manipulation (Oblivion and Ender's Game).

And for the record, Alien is emphatically not military. The whole point is that the crew of the Nostromo are working-class joes - "truckers in space" who argue about their bonus pay and bitch about their bosses. Aliens plays with  Vietnam War movie tropes, but not Alien. </TEXT>
