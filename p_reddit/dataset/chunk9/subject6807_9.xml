	<TEXT> Not really in my opinion. It works. 

Roland the gunslinger is still the central character, but for a movie it makes sense to introduce the character and the world through Jake's eyes.

It may be a cliche choice, but the books are so weird and out there it's a solid idea for a Hollywood film.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fully understand where you're coming from and appreciate that you actually care and isn't just using this as a chance to rail against some perceived threat. People have been throwing the n word and other vile stuff around with regards to this film for a long time, so I got tired of it, but I definitely do understand long time readers who genuinely love the books.

This being a sequel/remix does mean they will likely make a *lot* of changes, but hopefully most of them will work to the film's advantage. Fingers crossed!

And MM is a terrific actor and can do a fantastic bad guy (see Killer Joe), so I hope he gets some good stuff to work with here and isn't just a generic baddie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of that seems kind of obvious to me. One movie because more movies cost more money and this isn't exactly batman or LOTR.

 And the plan is still to do more films and TV if the movie is a success. Wizard of Glass as a series is what's up next, Howard mentioned it again last week, but only if this one makes money.

 Any sort of direct adaptation would obviously not work if you want a huge audience and you wouldn't get the kind of money needed. The Gunslinger would likely be too odd as a start to a franchise... the whole series would actually be way too out there if adapted directly.

You can read the 2014 draft, might answer a few of your questions.

https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5lHQAVEce61bmtjSHJ0MklVVVE/view

There's also been interviews with King, Howard, Goldsman and Arcel where they touch on at least some of what you bring up. You will have to google, but I know at least a couple are from EW.

Hope that helps, if not fingers crossed someone involved might do an AMA so you can ask them directly.

And the spine of it would mean a constant suspenseful tone that could carry anything that might be too expositiony. Darabont is a terrific writer, so I don't see him having any trouble with those things.

It's what I would consider one of his easier books to adapt.  </TEXT>

HBO is obviously willing to gamble, but they have already thrown a lot of money at Westworld and they're still making GOT, so I presume that's why it never was in the cards. </TEXT>

I would also like to recommend an episode of the TV show Banshee, but that show isn't horror and it's only one episode that's a siege one, so kinda asking a lot to have the OP sit through four seasons for one little bit. It was a fantastic episode though and a great homage to Carpenter.  </TEXT>

And plenty of people are watching all things considered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After having binged three seasons I went online to see what people have to say here and there and it was way beyond shocking. I figured people would have emotional reactions to different storylines, but nothing had prepared me for *that*.

So it was nice that your folks' sub was a bit of a haven.

 The 100 is not about romances, it's about survival.

And death. Don't forget death, he will feel left out.

If you can handle that it's at heart a cheesy teen show, there's some really cool stuff to be found. You need to give it at least three or four episodes though and I fully understand if not everyone can be bothered with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think people overestimate how involved he was in the show. The executive producer credit doesn't seem to mean much, he didn't write anything and only directed the first episode. 

Chad Hodge was the showrunner and the Duffer Brothers had a lot more to do with the show than Shyamalan. 

I haven't seen the marketing thing material, but I imagine they played up how much of a Shyamalan show it was since no one knew who those other people were. </TEXT>
