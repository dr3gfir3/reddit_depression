	<TEXT> **Face/Overall progress**

Since that photo on the left, I got a new jacket!  And LASIK! And a haircut! 

I don't really have a "goal weight" anymore -- the one I set when I was starting out at 240lbs was ~180, since that's what it says on my driver's license (lol).  

Since hitting 180 and beyond, I think it's about refinement and maintenance.

**Body Progress**

At this point, I'm not trying to get super "huge" so much as reduce overall fat and get leaner.  To that end, I've continued to eat at a calorie deficit, while still trying to lift increasing amounts of weight.  I realize it builds muscle mass slower, but it seems to be working okay so far.

In terms of exercising, I've been doing dumbbells with a decent amount of cardio, using this Reddit regimen I found: 

https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/

I typically do Push/Pull/Leg/Cardio 4 day rotation.   Cardio is pretty like since it also functions as overall rest day -- so just some light jogging, that kind of stuff.  Luckily, I live in DC near the Washington Monument and National Mall, so there's plenty of scenic and great running paths. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First time trying out a leather jacket style, thoughts? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've thought about getting a slim fitting leather jacket, but didn't want to go all in price-wise on a high quality leather item without being sure it's a style I could pull off. 

So far now, I grabbed a faux leather piece from Zara that was around $60 and am seeing how I wear it and feel about it in the coming weeks/months.

If it turns out well, I think I'm gonna commit and get a high quality piece. 

Personally, I kinda like the fit (though I worry about it being too tight if I want to layer something heavier than a shirt under it), so if I end up wearing it a lot, need to do some research on quality leather brands that stock pieces of similar style.

Anyway, I'd love thoughts about the fit and style of the jacket, or anything else!

 The Republican presidential nominee then inserted a line into his speech, which he delivered in Phoenix: "They don't know it yet but they're going to pay for the wall." 

 "I had no choice," Trump told the Journal about the addition, but added of the Mexican president, "I liked him very much."

	<TEXT> Why not a direct equivalence?

"If HRC released her tax returns and then the release of Trumps, wouldn't that be the nail in the coffin of this argument?"

The answer is: No.

If Hillary released her speech transcripts to try to make Trump release his tax records, his campaign would just say well, why hasn't Clinton given a press conference in so long?

If Clinton then gave a press conference, his campaign would just say well, where are Clinton's complete health records or missing emails?

Point is, if the **DIRECTLY EQUIVALENT** action being taken by Clinton and not Trump isn't enough to close the argument, then nothing will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have several of those in various sizes.  They are Staub dutch ovens.  They're not cheap, but are typically less expensive than brands like Le Creuset.

Staub dutch ovens are known for a few things:

1. A black enamel interior with a slightly grittier texture.  Le Creuset ovens typically have a cream smooth enameled interior.  Some people prefer the cream because it's easier to see things cooking. Some people prefer the black because it doesn't get discolored and doesn't show scratches easily (the cream enamel will show microscratches and develop a darker shade over time).

2. A "self-basting" lid.  All this means is that the bottom of the lid has a bunch of bumps.  In theory, it's supposed to help baste the food inside by collecting steam and dripping it back down.  In practice, I haven't noticed much difference, TBH.

3. Being heavier than other enameled cast iron pots of similar volume. Some people consider this a plus, as it feels more robust in the hand.  Some people think the extra weight is unneeded and just adds to the burden of using an already heavy pot (no enameled cast iron can be called "light")

For reference, I have a Le Creseut 8qt enameled dutch oven, a Staub 6qt and an All-Clad 8qt tri-ply stockpot that also works well as a dutch oven in a pinch.  

Of the three, I probably use the Staub the most.  Not for any reason related to function--any of the three mentioned pots will be more than fine for nearly any recipe callling for a dutch oven--but because, like you said, I find Staub dutch ovens to be particularly beautiful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I last posted to this sub ~2 months ago (https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/4hs0uv/m3360_240_182_58_face_and_body_progress_with_most/).  Since then, I've stayed mostly true to a low deficit diet while I've tried to figure out where to go from here -- eg, if I should try and lean up and reduce overall body fat, or try and gain more mass.

Right now, I'm mostly doing dumbbells and body weight fitness, and I think it's helped over the past 60 days.  I only went down ~7 pounds, but my body fat has actually decreased by 5% to around 16-17% according to my (admittedly very inaccurate) Fitbit Aria scale.   

But previously I was hitting 20-22% on that same inaccurate measurement, so I think it's progress!

I think for the remainder of the year, I'm going to start focusing on gaining more mass: joining a gym, getting access to heavier weights (and barbells!), and increasing my caloric intake.  I want to keep it relatively clean, however, so it might be slow going. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a weird breakdown of normally reasonable people who can't seem to grasp that a joke can be about Watergate while also unintentionally referencing Gamergate due to the context (and medium) of the joke.

I don't know if Nintendo is a particular sore point or what. 

There's also a lot of people who seem eager to downplay the spread of GamerGate.  I don't doubt that a majority of folks haven't heard about it (even perhaps among devs).  But I think it's silly to excuse major devs/publishers from being unaware.  GamerGate was one of the biggest storms in gaming for a good year and a half, and *still* lives on in the incredible amount of flak any article about diversity or sexism in gaming gets.  It affected a great number of people, and I think its reasonable to expect a big gaming company like Nintendo to think twice before making that joke.

In summary: I think Nintendo goofed, almost certainly without intention or malice. Zoe Quinn (understandably) maybe freaked a bit, given her history and constant bombardment she gets.  Folks look looked at the full video, criticized the goof for what it was.  And then, the internet happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Correction, people know about gamergate and the harrassment, but many don't know past that. 

Then they should know enough to realize that referencing a -gate + career ruining is just not a great look for a video game right now, and will probably invite criticism.

 Even if you still insist it's a "Five Guys" reference, ask this, is there any other indication aside from that phrase? 

I'm... not?  Did you actually read my comment, or are you reading past it?

 Those five toads don't proceed to a Zoe Quinn caricature or make any kind of reference to that episode, they just play hide-and-seek and make funny comments, that's it.

Yep, you're reading past it.

 Lastly, about the -gate joke, Watergate is a bigger part of our culture than GamerGate will ever be which is why -gate will always reference Watergate.

GamerGate, in gaming, for _major devs/publishers_ is a big deal contextually.  It's not an -either-or situation.  A -gate can recall both Watergate _and_ GamerGate.  I'm arguing that its hard to believe that a major game company doesn't realize the GamerGate connection.

I've tried to make _very clear_ in my comment that I don't think Nintendo was intentionally referencing GamerGate, or that they added the joke maliciously.  But I do think that a major game company should see that association coming up.  _That_ is what I'm criticizing. That they apparently didn't make that connection.

(Though, yeah, it was a kind of a weird joke to begin with, and especially weird given that Nintendo should know about -gates in gaming.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we can all mostly agree on three things (I hope):

1. An act doesn't have to be malicious or even intentional to warrant criticism

2. Making a -gate joke in a video game in 2016 that also includes references to ruined careers and "exposing" is super tone deaf, given everything that the industry went through in 2014 and 2015.  TBH I even kinda cringed at the -gate jokes in Batman and other games, even if it was mocking Gators.

3. A major game developer/publisher (even through its localization arm) shouldn't be able to realistically claim ignorance of GamerGate, given the widespread coverage it got both in gaming press and mainstream press over the past several years.

	<TEXT>   I mean, I just don't see how it relates to gamer gate in anyway unless you just look only at the screenshots she uses and you have been up to date with gamergate which I think is asking a bit much for a localizer to keep tabs on

GamerGate was one of the biggest controversies in video gaming in 2014 and 2015, covered by a majority of mainstream media outlets, and heavily involved with overarching themes of harassment online and in video games that have gained notoriety in the last couple of years (which, itself, has been covered by outlets like Colbert and John Oliver and a fucking Law and Order: SVU episode)

I think "oh I didn't know GamerGate was a thing" doesn't fly anymore when talking about major game studios/devs.  Claiming ignorance of that entire ordeal is borderline negligence at this point for any major developer that holds itself as an ethically responsible entity, IMO.

I think, in 2016, given all that has happened in 2014 and 2015, a -gate reference in a video game (and also reference career ruining and exposing things) is _going_ to be associated with gamergate by many people.  Rightly or wrongly, that's the association some will make, and Nintendo probably should have made that connection themselves when writing that joke.

At the end of the day, the localization team (which IIRC is in-house to Nintendo, and not some arbitrarily contracted out third party entity) didn't _have_ to user a Watergate or whatever -gate joke.  And they probably shouldn't have.  It's tone deaf given the history of gaming over the past couple of years.  

I doubt it was malicious.  But it was ill-placed, especially given the history and context of gaming, and warrants criticism.   </TEXT>

But they didn't say that.  As far as the episode is concerned, Noctis gave no indication that he wasn't willing to be friendly with Prompto.  It was all in his head, going purely by the episode.

Prompto was so insecure in his body image that one off-hand remark by Noctis resulted in a year+ long training regimen where he purposefully avoided Noctis.  When he finally presented himself, Noctis didn't even remark on his weight loss.

That's not healthy behavior. Sure, the end result is laudable (for good reasons or ill, achieving and maintaining better fitness and health is commendable), but I wish the episode had Prompto arrive at his current level of fitness in a different manner.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it a little creepy that apparently Prompto worked for years in isolation without talking to Noctis in order to prepare his body, and waited until they were in high school reintroduce himself.  This is also how 50% of horror movies start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Fatshaming is when someone won't hang out with you because you are fat, and fat kids experience that every day. 

The criticism here isn't that it depicts an overweight person not having confidence, but that the episode does nothing to counteract the idea  that someone "popular", like Noctis, wouldn't be friends who someone overweight.  That's not a knock on Noctis, because as far as I can tell, this was mostly all in Prompto's head.  But the issue I have is that they never really refute Prompto's assumption. 

I realize there's kinda two ways to see this episode:

1. An inspiring tale of Prompto overcoming his weight issues, and living healthier.

2. A cautionary tale that if you want to be friends with cool, popular folk like Noctis, well, you better shape up

I just wish there was a bit more of 1 and a bit less of 2 implied.  They coudl have been childhood friends.  Instead, there was kind of a creepy undertone where Prompto didn't feel "worthy" to be Noctis' friend, and spent years preparing.  But I never got the sense from Noctis that he super cared what Prompto looked like.

	<TEXT> I posted a while back (https://www.reddit.com/r/progresspics/comments/4hs0uv/m3360_240_182_58_face_and_body_progress_with_most/), but I feel like I've made some noticeable definition gains over the past many weeks.

I've always vastly preferred working out at home than at the gym. I don't remember how I came across the /r/fitness Dumbbell P/P/L (https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/2e79y4/dumbbell_ppl_proposed_alternative_to_dumbbell/) but it seemed like a great thing to try.

I started January 15, so it's been just about 6 months since I adopted the program. I've never lifted before, and only did light cardio. But I bought an adjustable set of 5-52.5 dumbbells, and a cheap bench, and went to work.

I kept logs every session, and did a 3 day P/P/L, 1 day rest schedule.

Weight wise, I think I started around 205 in January, and I'm around 182 right now. I realize that for max gains/cuts you're supposed to do one at a time, but I just kinda did both. Watched what I eat, kept to ~1500-1700 (so a decent deficit), but made sure that I had enough energy to lift a few more pounds each week.

I didn't do any cardio, but I think I may pick that up again. I've also kinda height the limits of my dumbbells now -- on 80% of the exercises in the Dumbbell P/P/L regimen, I've hit my max adjustable weight of 52.5, and just have been doing more reps to compensate. Which isn't great. I don't super want to get a barbell + weight set for home, so maybe I'll bite the bullet and go to the gym. </TEXT>

This post is why. This post was awesome. It helps illustrate both the depth and breadth of some of the stuff that Blizzard is currently working on for Overwatch.  Like he says, some of it probably won't happen.  But that's normal.

	<TEXT> Is it possible to do something like the following in Vim?

http://i.imgur.com/j9Z3mC6.gif

I've been using Emacs full time, but I'm trying to get my Vim setup up to parity for when I've using in remote machines or when I just want to stay in the shell (I find Vim much more enjoyable in the shell than Emacs)

To explain what's going on in the gif above, I'm running a git grep search over a large codebase (I'm just using the Rails codebase as an example here).  The key thing that I really enjoy is that the search runs live as I type. That allows me to quickly try multiple variations of things, and narrow/expand my search as I need to.

I realize this might need something like Neovim's job controls (or I guess the recent Vim 7 patches that add something similar).  Has someone already tackled something like this?  A brief but intense search online didn't yield anything that I could see. </TEXT>

With such great differences among work-related values within each country, the notion that you can generalize about a countrys work culture is just plain wrong. And two, an American walking down the street in Shanghai is likely to meet many Chinese people with values closer to his or her own than to an average Chinese culture. Assuming that national cultural stereotypes apply to most individuals in a country simply does not work.

I've found this to happen a lot.  A lot of people talking about "Japanese culture" as if it was a single homogenous thing.  This study focuses on work culture, but I think it probalby applies to many other areas of culture as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But if a games journalist releases footage of themselves performing poorly, then don't expect me to think you will have complete and accurate knowledge of the game, how most game mechanics work, graphics, audio, physics, FPS, etc.

I can tell you in detail the pros, cons, mechanics, weak points, strong points, whatever else of how a particular game of StarCraft 2 went.  I can tell you in detail about the specifics of a Super Smash Brothers Melee match, and what each player was doing, and probalby why.

I'm still only average at both.

It's important to separate knowledge of a game to the mechanical execution of a game, especially when it comes to twitch games like fighters or fast moving first person shooters.

Also, most _developers_ don't have complete knowledge of game mechanics and graphics and audio and phyicss and whatever. You pick these things up gradually, and usually not in an even spread.  Similarly, a particular game journo might be incredilby knowledgable about 4X games, or maybe about CCGs or JRPGs, but be completely lacking in other genres.  That's not a failing. For a medium as wide _and_ as deep as video gaming has gotten, knowing and being good at everything is impossible.

(Tho, yeah, having a journo play a genre they are not great at is not so much unethical as it is bad strat.  But it's hardly something to get super worked up over, IMO.  If you want good gameplay, you can find them easily enough.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll defend until everyone leaves the room in annoyance that King of the Hill was one of the best animated series of the past several decades, and probably my favorite.  It started off rocky, but IMO it got consistently better, rarely falling into the trap of easy laughs or low blow jabs.  It dealt with some very real issues, and was intelligent beyond its medium. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, Japanese "yokai", also loosely related to the Chinese "yao guai", isn't really a direct analog to the Western word (and concept) of "demon" of the Christian sense.  So the reason you don't see demons play more as a loose collection of monsters is that it is an issue of translation.  If you, instead, looked for Western stories (in both mythology and fantasy fiction) about fairies, the fae, goblins, etc, you'll find a much larger morality mix.  

(Note that if you, instead, tried to find Japanese works using the word "oni" instead of "yokai", there's a simllar bias towards " evil", because "oni" is a much closer translation of "demon")

Yokai, and its Chinese relatives, are a much more general word that describes the supernatural milieu of ghosts, spirits, monsters, demons,  sprites, etc.  "Fae" or "Fairy", in the classicalnot Disneysense is the closest popular term I can think of at the moment.  "Daemon" works too, as mentioend by another poster, tho that tends to be too easily confused with the more Christian concepts of demon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I can make a suggestion: rather than a manually curated list, something that I've enjoyed from the /r/games subreddit is their weekly *"What have you been playing?"* threads:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/4g4sm9/weekly_rgames_discussion_what_have_you_been/

Above is the most recent.  

What I find *most* helpful is that names are in **bold**, so it's very easy to peruse.  There tends to be a very nice mix of hot new stuff and also oldies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of the points are interesting (such as the Tibet/China tensions), but others... I dunno.

There's also now the strange tension of a now narratively white (according to them) character who still appears to be steeped in/inspired by old school oriental mysticism. Which just feels like taking the worst part of two approaches.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I am Asian.  (Not that it should matter in this discussion, since I don't necessarily think being Asian gives all that much of a unique perspective on it)

 anyone that looks remotely "asian" (be they Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Siberian, etc) are considered pretty much interchangable, even though they lookk nothing alike and have completely different cultures.

Korea, China, Japan all have different cultures, true.  Much in the same way that the UK, the US, Frances, Germany, and many European countries have very different cultures.  (Though just like Western Europe, you'll often find some very familiar themes running through East Asian countries, mostly due to Chinese historical influence)

Appearance though?  Hell, it's a running joke for many Asians that they can't really tell where an East Asian is from.  Are you from Japan? China? Korea? Who knows!  It's relatively common in Asian cinema for a Chinese person to play a Japanese character, or for a Korean actress to play a Chinese woman.  

I *really* think the worries about normalizing out Asian cultures into a generic "Asian" type are overblown.  I mean, IMO, it's certainly overblown compared to the proposed alternative of simply not casting an Asian at all for the role.

	<TEXT> I guess I don't see how not casting an Asian _or_ a Tibetan person because of China's reaction is any less pandering than casting an Asian person instead of a Tibetan.

But I definitely get the Tibetan cultural angle, and it's not something I'd considered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking as another Asian person, I'd personally still much rather see another Asian in that role than yet another White actress. Obviously YMMV, so I definitely get the "no good choices" angle of the decision.  I just think its kind of a cop out, ultimately. </TEXT>

It's not a _requirement_, I mean Vim has been perfectly usable so far. But it has a ton of benefits. </TEXT>
