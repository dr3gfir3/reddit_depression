	<TEXT> This is a law in Australia, too. It's the biggest load of shit, you can't even defend your home or your family from a burglar without the risk of being sued, or having charges against you as well.
It happened to one of my friends' family, who own a swimming pool and hire it out to people. A woman broke in, trespassed on the property, "tried to find the light switch" and slipped on a step, breaking her arm. The family got sued, the woman got off. Apparently the judge's reasoning was "There was not enough safety reflective tape on the step to prevent accidents".
Edit: She broke in in the middle of the night, when it was completely dark. Hence the light switch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Australian and I've had "snags on the barbie," "cold ones" (beer), I've called people "mate", backed slowly away from a mad kangaroo, fed an emu (wildlife park obviously) and been scared shitless by a Tasmanian Devil in the bush whilst camping near the beach (I live in Tasmania [No this is not Africa])...
I've waited in line at a footy game (Aussie rules) for far too long for an overpriced meat pie to eat with sauce.
I've been asked to repeat things for Americans, you either can't understand me properly or just like my accent, who knows!
I've also been to the beach on Christmas day and seen Santa in board shorts!

Edit: I also call "candy" or "sweets" lollies.
HOW COULD I FORGET VEGEMITE ON TOAST? I grew up on that stuff!

I love my country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like a game we played called Murder in the Dark. Basically you get a bunch of people in one room and draw out of a hat whether you're a citizen, the murderer or the detective. You turn out all of the lights and everyone hides, and the murderer has to find and "kill" the citizens before the detective figures out who he/she is. In a pitch black room with furniture, it's pretty dangerous but still fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I eat things based on how much my body needs them. Eg, protein/meat first, vitamins and fiber from vegetables next, then carbs (potato, pasta, noodles, rice, etc.).
I eat a lot of stir-fry, and it just so happens that the saucy noodles are my favourite part, so it's win-win really. Eating protein first also helps with my satiety so I rarely overeat. </TEXT>
