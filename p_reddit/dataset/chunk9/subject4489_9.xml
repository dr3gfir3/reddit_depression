I can't believe my eyes. Sitting right before me are two distinct packages. They've finally arrived. From the outside, they appeared to be just normal cardboard boxes that looked a little torn up, but I know better. From behind me, I heard the cell door unlock and two officers walked in. Their bright uniforms reflected the sunlight of dawn breaking through a miniscule window on the far side of a room outside the cell. "Hello officers, what's up?" I asked, trying to sound non-suspicious. "We just need to check those packages," said Officer Graham(name's on uniform), while eyeing me with his dark shades. His stern look than switched to the packages on my desk. "We're just following saftey precautions and procedures to ensure that everything's fine," added Officer Billy. Billy was shorter than Graham, but had more muscularity, and a mustache. "Sure thing officers," I replied as they walked towards the desk. Billy proceeded to open the packages, and I awaited patiently. 

"Well..." Billy said, "Looks like you're into reading." He picked up a couple of books from the first package, while Graham examined other paperbacks in the second package. "Yeah..." I tried to sound believable, "I think one of my colleagues must have sent this..I guess they don't want me getting bored." "Ok than, looks like we're done here, thanks for letting us check," Billy said, as he proceeded to walk out of the cell. "No problem..." I replied, as Officer Graham eyed me suspiciously as he too, walked out of the cell. I heard the lock click into place as Billy locked it from the outside, and the two officers walked away. 

As soon as they were gone, I went straight to the packages. I pulled the books out and examined them. Only a couple had stickers on them. These were the names of the ones that had stickers: "Skating Inventory," "Darwin," "Energy   Production," "Adventure Night," and the last book was "Edison   Light." Well, you might be thinking, those are just random books, however, they're not. Did you find the hidden message? Take the first letters of each word in order that they are mentioned: S I D E P A N E L. "Side panel," I whispered aloud to myself. 

I checked the sides of the book cover, and then the box itself. In the box, there were small spaces on the inside along the sides. I slid my hand inside these spaces until I came to a miniscule button. I clicked on it. Suddenly, one of the books on the desk started vibrating. I scurried over and picked it up. The vibrating slowed. I started flipping through the pages, one by one, until the vibrating stopped. It was page 42. I flipped the page to 43, the vibrating started again, then I flipped it back to 42, and the vibrating stopped. "Looks like 42 is the page," I whispered to myself. I started reading. I included an excerpt of the page here:
___________________________________________________________________________________________

"Click, crackle. The sounds of the bushes crackling scared the old man. Walking along the woods was an adventure of the night. Hopefully, nothing will end the peaceful moonlight. The scurrying of the sounds of deat bewildered him. He was frightened, and alone. The sounds only grew louder. 

On the evening of winter, the snow freezed his warm body, as he slowly walked through the anonymous woods. The dead trees towered over him, like the sun over the sky. Peace, thats all. The old man heard the sounds grow louder, but he was too late. The shadow was behind him already.

Last, but not least, the man ran. He ran with all his might. His old legs gave away, and his face hit the cold snow. The shadow was there. Watching him. Laughing at him, as it moved closer. 

Word spread quickly around the town of the old man's death. They never found his body. It was like he had disappeared. Gone, astray, as if life was meaningless, uncherishable, and only the light shown above the winter wonderland."

___________________________________________________________________________________________

There is a hidden message in this excerpt as well. Take the first word of each paragraph: Click, On, Last, Word. The last word on the page is wonderland. I touched the word on the page. For a minute nothing happened, but then the page started to glow. A small holographic image appeared on where the words were. It was Lisa. "About time," she said, we now have your location." Then the image faded before I had time to reply. After 1 minute, I heard the sirens go off. The sounds of gunfire echoed through the cells. A quick moment later, my cell door was blasted open, and Lisa walked. "Quick!" Lisa said, "We don't have time to talk..here take this." She handed me a black bag. "It has everything you need" Lisa yelled over the gunfire. "But..." I started to say. "No time...now go!" She yelled. She blasted a hole in the wall with a seismic gadget, and told me to jump. I took one last look, and gave a thanks, before jumping.  

I landed a bit too hard on my elbow. I quickly got up and took off running. I finally reached a town and found a public restroom. I then checked the bag's contents. Fresh clothes, weapons, granola bars, tech gadgets, money, and a phone. She was right, it had everything. I washed myself up, and put on fresh clothes. I loaded the weapons, the usual, guns, knives, and I equipped it to my belt. I made sure that all the gadgets, including the phone, worked. All of these items are not the usual accessories that you normally see. These are modified, mproved, gadets that serve many purposes. They are crafted by special T.E.R.C.E.S. engineers. Anyways, after I was ready, I started off again on my mission.

Currently, I'm catching a bus to Colorado. I'm going to find A.I. That jail was a minor drawback. I don't know if A.I's good or bad, but I'm going to the scene of the accident. He's going to be there. The next update's coming real soon. Be ready. Signing off for now.

	<TEXT> Well, you're probably scrolling through these stories, and you stumbled upon this one for some reason. I congratulate you first of all for reading this, because things are about to get intense. This isn't the story that ends happily, heck, I don't even think it has an ending to all the madness that's about to happen. Anyways, you better be prepared to take in a lot of information. As one wise person said: "Hold on to your damn butts."

To start off with, I'm in jail. Great right? It's not as bad as you think it is. You get three meals a day, shelter, and roommates. The cell has a bathroom built in, and a shelf with books. But, It still gets boring here. I'm stuck with my roommate, Rockjaw, a bloodthirsty killer, notorious for mass murders. Just kidding, I got you didn't I? Rockjaw's real name is Gilbert, and he's not a killer. He's a hilarious, army captain, that is serving 3 years-sentence for kicking the ass of a higher officer. He was called Rockjaw in the army, but his closest buds call him Bert. 

Now you're probably thinking: Why the hell are you in jail for? My answer: It's a long, dang, story. Plus, I'm innocent. Well, I think it's time for a flashback I guess. 

I work for an agency called T.E.R.C.E.S. I can't tell you what it stands for, because of security reasons.(Also because I can't remember what it stands for half the time either.) If you didn't guess already, I'm a private agent, hired by this 3rd party agency to investigate many unsolvable cases. I'm not the only one who works at this company either, they have other  private intelligent officers as well. Why am I telling you all of this? Well, its good to have an audience to tell your story to, and I'm in jail anyway, so why the heck not. Anyways, I was in charge of handling a very unusual case. The file belonged to a former secret agent that basically went to the dark side. The agent worked here, and I've seen him a couple of times before. No one knew him, except for me. I only know a little bit about him from the very few times we talked. His name is Matt Pierce. However, when I was handed this file, I was told that every bit of information about him is wrong, including his name. So I guess we'll call him A.I.(Anonymous Intelligence) cause it sounds cool. 

A.I. was the most outstanding agent the company had ever had. No one ever came close to his most dangerous accomplishments. He had gone on missions that no one even dared to sign up for. He sort of turned out to be a model for everyone to follow. A.I. and I weren't friends, we were more like "acquaintances."  We occasionally talked while working out in the training room. He was a quiet, wise, person. No one knew
anything about his past. I managed to get him to talk about his family one time though. He said that he had a wife and a child that had died, but that's all he said before he changed the subject. As the days went by, A.I. had disappeared. Word had gotten out that A.I. had murdered some executive officers that were in charge of T.E.R.C.E.S., and that he had escaped. Something caused him to turn bad, murderous. A couple of days later, there were more reports of deaths, all of them people who were related to T.E.R.C.E.S. They were important officers. None of our best agents found A.I., that's because we found their lifeless bodies in random places. 

As I was examining more of A.I's file, I realized that the reason why they gave me this. I was the only one who had actually talked to him. I was the only one that knew A.I, sort of. I heard a knock at my office door, and Lisa walked in. Lisa was the agent director that was in charge of a sector group of private agents. "Well, what do you think of it? she asked, while she took a seat in one of the office chairs. "It's life or death," I replied. Lisa agreed, "We're trusting you with it because you're one of the best agents we have, are you up for the challenge?" 
"Oh, I'm up for it, I said, but first, you need to supply me with all the tech, and cash that I need, cause I am not about to die for nothing." "Of course, Lisa replied, I'll get you a check, and all the machinery that you need to assist you." "Sounds great," I answered, as Lisa walked out of the office. I thought it was going to be great, silly me, little did I know that it was going to be the exact opposite. 

I stayed well after 12 digging up what I could find about A.I. From what I searched, A.I. was a normal individual. He was an outstanding agent. There was no obvious reason for him to turn bad. There was this one tragedy though. A.I's wife and child had died in a car crash, but they  had closed that case a long time ago. I decided that I had to start somewhere, so I booked a ticket to Colorado, the state of where the crash happened.

The day before the flight, I stayed in a hotel. I figured that, since I'm going on this suicidal mission, I might as well get some enjoyment. Just the usual stuff, hot tub, getting laid, and sleep. The next morning, I was on my way to Colorado. The business class cabin was ok as always. I stared out the window as the 737 took off the runway. The soft roar of the engine made me feel drowsy. Suddenly I felt a tap on my shoulder, and I looked back. I was greeted by a man with a clean-shaved beard, sunglasses, and a dark hat. He had a soft, familiar smile, and was wearing 
a navy jacket over a buttoned black shirt. "The attendants are coming out with snacks," he said. I didn't notice this guy earlier. He sat across the seat aisle on the other side. "Thanks for the heads up," I replied, smiling. "No prob, my name's Matthew by the way," he said as he offered his hand. "Name's (taken out for purposes), nice to meet you," I said as I shook his hand. That was all the conversation we had the whole flight. 

We were about an hour into the flight when the commotion started. People started freaking out and flight attendants were trying to calm everyone down. I looked to my left. Matthew wasn't there. Where did the dude go? Maybe he was in the bathroom. Word got around that there was a bomb in the plane. I didn't need to question that rumor, because suddenly there was an explosion, that shook everyone's seat. I looked out my window. The right engine of the planes was engulfed in flames. 

"Wtf!," I muttered to myself as I made my way out of my seat. The plane started to take a nosedive. It lurched my body forward, and I went flying into the cockpit. I fractured a rib in the process. I heard it crack as I landed on my side. It freaking hurt. But that wasn't the problem, both the pilots were unconscious. They were shot. I pulled one of them off their seat and quickly scrambled into the captain's chair. I know how a plane works, because it was part of the training program. We were required to learn to fly tons of aircraft. The only problem here, was that we had lost one engine. I managed to stop the nosedive, but we were going down fast. The plane glided towards the ground until it crashed into the earth below.

Minutes later, crews were evacuating passengers. Medical doctors were treating injuries. I got my rib stitched up. Afterwards, officers checked everyone. I walked up to an officer and he scanned my head, shirt, and then my arm all the way to my right hand...beep, beep. That was the sound of the scanning machine as it towered over my hand. The police officer eyed me suspiciously and walked me over to an x-ray machine. After
the x-ray was finished, the news sent shockwaves through my body. They had a found a miniscule device on my hand that was connected to the engine of the 737. It caused it to malfunction and explode, as the timer went off on the device. "Officer...I don't have anything to do with this...." I said. "That's what they all say.." the officer replied as he put me in handcuffs. 

So here I am. In jail. I'm supposed to serve a couple of years. I couldn't even tell them that I was an agent. It would expose the whole private agent network. As I was contemplating what to do, the daily mail came. There were two letters for me. The first one was a letter from my agency, carefully concealed to look like a letter from an insurance company. I decoded the message, and it said that I was going to receive packages that are going to help me bust the hell out of here. Good news, but I will have to wait. The second letter was anonymous. All it said was: "Don't 
follow me, or the plane incident won't be the last..." There was a portrait picture of...wait for it...the dude I met on the plane: Matthew. Well, I sort of knew that was going to happen. Looks like A.I. was Matthew.

A.I's on the run and I'm going to catch him. He'll come in all disguises, anywhere, and anytime. I will be ready for him. But first, I'll have to bust out of here. Looks like the only way are through those packages. I'll have to wait until they arrive. Well, looks like that's it. This is me signing off this crappy computer that they let you use. I will keep you guys updated.
