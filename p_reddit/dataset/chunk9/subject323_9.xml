	<TEXT> Honestly, since it happened on his property, I think if he wants, the dude could intervene.

When the bear eats that deer, he's going to make a fucking mess.

I wouldn't want to deal with that mess, especially since it looks like the dude takes good care of his lawn.

He could at first ask the bear and deer to continue this somewhere else, if the bear and deer refuse to move, he should shoo them away with a broom.

If that doesn't work, then he needs to start yelling at them.

Then call the cops. Report two trespassers in his back yard. Let the cops deal with it when they show up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Liberal Arts degrees are great. 

They can help shape you as a person. This idea that the degree itself will land you a great job is nonsense. You as a person can either utilize your degree in synergy with your job goals, or you can blame your degree for your shortfalls.

Liberal Art graduates can go on to graduate school, professional schools (MBA's, Law school, etc), entrepreneurship, whatever.

I've never heard of this running joke about Liberal arts majors being hit by some dead end. It must be pissed off STEM graduates who are usually stressed out by their curriculum, and hate the fact that liberal arts graduates can land successful careers.

In fact, STEM graduates need to worry about the future, as computers in general are replacing some of their skills and expertise through automation.

In short, figure out what you want in life. If a liberal arts major will allow you to hit those goals, then go for it. </TEXT>

If the chair of the fed can have such a contribution to a financial crisis, why couldn't the president of the United States have a similar role in increasing or decreasing job growth dependant on the bills he advocates and signs?

Why do lobbyists bother lobbying government if ultimately the government and its leader, the president, have little control on economic change?

As to my question, obviously Reagan and his government (congress) had some effect, either through direct legislation, or staying out of the trend. 

I'm wondering what Reagan did or didn't do that caused the beginning of the decline in manufacturing jobs in the US.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like with Detroit missing the play offs the first time in 20 years, it's made me wonder. 

What if the Canucks followed a similar philosophy as Detroit did back in the 90s?

Instead of making a team that were Stanley Cup material, why not make a team that can consistently make the play offs every year?

It's like Gretzky said, you miss 100% of the shots you don't take. 

You can't win the Stanley Cup if you don't make the play offs. 

So in short, instead of this high octane build philosophy, why don't we go baby steps and start with a team that can consistently make the play offs?

Just a thought.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just a question for you Destiny players regarding Destiny 2. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-31 04:01:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was eagerly awaiting Destiny 1 back before it was released.

I eventually decided not to dive in and buy the game, nor did I ever have the urge to buy it since the game felt neutered from what was promised.

My question for you current/past players, wasn't the Destiny 1 game supposed to be a 10 year project, supported by constant content updates and changes?

I seem to remember Bungie talking about how this game will be something that would be malleable, and augmented depending on what the players wanted?

This would be over the course of 10 years.

So I'm wondering, in it's current state, is Destiny 1 nowhere near what Bungie promised?

Is Destiny 2 meant to be what Destiny 1 was supposed to be?

I'm just so confused, because it seems like Bungie really has no clue on what the fuck they wanted to do with Destiny 1, so how do things look for Destiny 2?

For you people who remember what Destiny 1 was supposed to be, does Destiny 2 show some promise? Is it worth it for someone like me (who was hyped by the original Destiny 1 development promises), to follow Destiny 2?

Thanks in advance for any input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is no Conservative party.

I suggest you write Trump and tell him to go to war with the republican party. If you want to fix America, you need a strong Conservative party, and right now the Republicans are lost and confused. They don't have any modicum of the idea of what conservatism is.

They can't do anything without lobbyists directing them. This is not a sign of a strong party.

The democrats are always going to be the way they are, and eventually as more minorities and SJW's start voting, the republicans are going to lose ground, especially when Republicans are in power they are too busy stripping liberties from the American people because they rather appease their lobbyists. They couldn't even repeal Obamacare, with Trump as president and them controlling both the house and senate. I didn't even agree with the current healthcare repeal and replace bill per se, but if Trump told them to pass it, they should have passed it, just for party lines and momentum sake.

We need strong conservatives in the position of power, not shills (Ryan).

And yes I'm pissed about them passing that ISP privacy law. I would expect conservatives to go back to the drawing board and make it so NO company can release and profit off my private data, including Google, Facebook, etc, without me OPT'ing IN.

But I guess that makes too much sense. Fuck this Republican Party, what a joke. 

Drain the fucking swamp, and start with this clueless Republican Party. Fucking weaklings. </TEXT>

I'm assuming PC just has higher turn over. 

The last game I played on PC from release was ESO and that was a shit show. The PS4 community for that game is still highly active. PC's community seems moderately dead compared to PS4 for ESO.

Anyways, when your accidental/negligent discharge happened, what was it like? Did it scare the shit out of you? 

Did you instantly realize you weren't expending enough due diligence when handling your gun? 

Where did the bullet get lodged (hopefully not hurting anyone)?

Did you need to report the discharge to police or your local government? What happened afterwards, did you face any fines/penalties?

Just to shed light on the matter for us people who treat their guns with utmost respect, but realize accidents can happen to the best of us. </TEXT>

Every time I went up against the law bringer he parried every single attack, and I mean side hits, over head, feigns he didn't get baited into.

He went up against my partner, same thing, parried every attack. Countered every guard break Literally every attack was surgically landed. I went up against him again on the 3rd and last round, same shit, so I said fuck this before he landed the last heavy, and quit.

I don't know if it's possible to cheat on PS4, I don't know if he was cheating though, because he wasn't baited by my heavy feigns.

I should have recorded his name, maybe I went up against the greatest law bringer on PS4 for honor. </TEXT>
