	<TEXT> **Abstract**

Different family composition and size inevitably make only-children different from non-only-children. Previous studies have focused on the differences in behaviors, such as cognitive function and personality traits, between the only-child and the non-only-child. However, there are few studies that have focused on the topic of whether different family environments influence childrens brain structural development and whether behavior differentially has its neural basis between only-child and non-only-child status. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the differences in cognition (e.g., intelligence and creativity) and personality and the anatomical structural differences of gray matter volume (GMV) using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) between only-children and non-only-children. The behavioral results revealed that only-children exhibited higher flexibility scores (a dimension of creativity) and lower agreeableness scores (a dimension of personality traits) than non-only-children. Most importantly, the GMV results revealed that there were significant differences in the GMV between only-children and non-only-children that occurred mainly in the brain regions of the supramarginal gyrus, which was positively correlated with flexibility scores; the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), which was positively correlated with agreeableness scores; and the parahippocampal gyrus. These findings may suggest that family environment (i.e., only-child vs. non-only-child), may play important roles in the development of the behavior and brain structure of individuals.

	<TEXT> This is interesting in light of research that shows that individuals who simply fantasize about a future success rather than plan for it tend to exert less effort and consequently have significantly lower rates of success (Holahan   Moos, 1986; Lengua   Sandler, 1996; Oettingen   Mayer, 2002; Ried, Dubow,   Carey, 1995). 

Also, it's sometimes the case that individuals who indulge in positive fantasies about future successes experience psychological enjoyment in the present which reduces their incentive to actively pursue the goal in the immediate future (McClelland, Koestner,   Weinberger, 1989; Oettingen   Mayer, 2002). 

I guess daydreaming could influence your creativity, but too much of it might have consequences for goal pursuit if it isn't really plan-focused. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, like this [study](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2952510) that found that liberals and conservatives showed nearly identical levels of bias - it was top of r/science about a week ago. The conversation is definitely shifting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Abstract**

A field experiment tested the effect of choosing a favorite role model on sense of fit in science among middle school girls. The girls participated in a 1-day science outreach event where they were exposed to multiple female role models. At the end of the event, participants were randomly assigned to choose and write about a favorite role model or to choose and write about their best friend. Girls in the role model choice condition experienced a significant increase in sense of fit in science, whereas girls in the control condition did not. Girls in the role model choice condition also tended to have stronger role model identification than girls in the control condition, and role model identification was correlated with sense of fit in science. Encouraging girls to actively choose and write about a favorite role model may help to maximize the impact of exposure to role models.

	<TEXT> **Abstract**

Dogmatic intolerancedefined as a tendency to reject, and consider as inferior, any ideological belief that differs from ones ownis often assumed to be more prominent at the political right than at the political left. In the present study, we make two novel contributions to this perspective. First, we show that dogmatic intolerance is stronger among left- and right-wing extremists than moderates in both the European Union (Study 1) as well as the United States (Study 2). Second, in Study 3, participants were randomly assigned to describe a strong or a weak political belief that they hold. Results revealed that compared to weak beliefs, strong beliefs elicited stronger dogmatic intolerance, which in turn was associated with willingness to protest, denial of free speech, and support for antisocial behavior. We conclude that independent of content, extreme political beliefs predict dogmatic intolerance.

	<TEXT> It wan't about missing data as u/Austion66 implied - they didn't analyze the data from those 14 Black participants because they weren't interested in intergroup perceptions (i.e., how Blacks perceive other Blacks) at that time (and didn't have a large enough n to do so anyway). Removing them from analyses effectively controls for the effect -whatever it may be. They addressed intergroup perceptions in Study 4 where they recruited equal #s of each race (Black, White) as well as gender (Male, Female). 

We conducted Study 4 as an exploratory investigation of whether the relationship between misperceptions of size and harm capability among Black and White targets would differ according to participants race. </TEXT>
