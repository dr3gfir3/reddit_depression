Nociceptive brain activity as a measure of analgesic efficacy in infants

Caroline Hartley1, Eugene P. Duff2,*, Gabrielle Green1,*, Gabriela Schmidt Mellado1, Alan Worley3, Richard Rogers4 and Rebeccah Slater1,

Science Translational Medicine  03 May 2017: Vol. 9, Issue 388, eaah6122

DOI: 10.1126/scitranslmed.aah6122

Link: http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/9/388/eaah6122

Abstract

 Pain in infants is undertreated and poorly understood, representing a major clinical problem. In part, this is due to our inability to objectively measure pain in nonverbal populations. We present and validate an electroencephalography-based measure of infant nociceptive brain activity that is evoked by acute noxious stimulation and is sensitive to analgesic modulation. This measure should be valuable both for mechanistic investigations and for testing analgesic efficacy in the infant population. </TEXT>

Food brand recognition and BMI in preschoolers. 

Appetite, 2017; 114: 329 

DOI: 10.1016/j.appet.2017.03.049

Link: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666317305159?via%3Dihub

Abstract:

 Children's food brand recognition predicts health-related outcomes such as preference for obesogenic foods and increased risk for overweight. However, it is uncertain to what degree food brand recognition acts as a proxy for other factors such as parental education and income, child vocabulary, child age, child race/ethnicity, parent healthy eating guidance, child commercial TV viewing, and child dietary intake, all of which may influence or be influenced by food brand recognition. U.S. preschoolers (N = 247, average age 56 months) were measured for BMI and completed the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test plus recognition and recall measures for a selection of U.S. food brands. Parents completed measures of healthy eating guidance, child dietary intake, child commercial TV viewing, parent education, household income, parent BMI, and child age and race/ethnicity. Controlling these variables, child food brand recognition predicted higher child BMI percentile. Further, qualitative examination of children's incorrect answers to recall items demonstrated perceptual confusion between brand mascots and other fantasy characters to which children are exposed during the preschool years, extending theory on child consumer development. </TEXT>

The Whorfian Time Warp: Representing Duration Through the Language Hourglass. 

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 2017 

DOI: 10.1037/xge0000314.supp

Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/? fa=main.doiLanding doi=10.1037/xge0000314

Abstract:

 How do humans construct their mental representations of the passage of time? The universalist account claims that abstract concepts like time are universal across humans. In contrast, the linguistic relativity hypothesis holds that speakers of different languages represent duration differently. The precise impact of language on duration representation is, however, unknown. Here, we show that language can have a powerful role in transforming humans psychophysical experience of time. Contrary to the universalist account, we found language-specific interference in a duration reproduction task, where stimulus duration conflicted with its physical growth. When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity. These patterns conform to preferred expressions of duration magnitude in these languages (Swedish: long/short time; Spanish: much/small time). Critically, Spanish-Swedish bilinguals performing the task in both languages showed different interference depending on language context. Such shifting behavior within the same individual reveals hitherto undocumented levels of flexibility in time representation. Finally, contrary to the linguistic relativity hypothesis, language interference was confined to difficult discriminations (i.e., when stimuli varied only subtly in duration and growth), and was eliminated when linguistic cues were removed from the task. These results reveal the malleable nature of human time representation as part of a highly adaptive information processing system. </TEXT>

Changes in PerceptionAction Tuning Over Long Time Scales: How Children and Adults Perceive and Act on Dynamic Affordances When Crossing Roads.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1037/xhp0000378

Link: http://psycnet.apa.org/? fa=main.doiLanding doi=10.1037/xhp0000378

Abstract:

 This investigation examined developmental change in how children perceive and act on dynamic affordances when crossing roads on foot. Six- to 14-year-olds and adults crossed roads with continuous cross-traffic in a large-screen, immersive pedestrian simulator. We observed change both in childrens gap choices and in their ability to precisely synchronize their movement with the opening of a gap. Younger children were less discriminating than older children and adults, choosing fewer large gaps and more small gaps. Interestingly, 12-year-olds gap choices were significantly more conservative than those of 6-, 8-, 10-, and 14-year-olds, and adults. Timing of entry behind the lead vehicle in the gap (a key measure of movement coordination) improved steadily with development, reaching adultlike levels by age 14. Coupled with their poorer timing of entry, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds gap choices resulted in significantly less time to spare and more collisions than 14-year-olds and adults.

Changes in PerceptionAction Tuning Over Long Time Scales: How Children and Adults Perceive and Act on Dynamic Affordances When Crossing Roads.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance, 2017;

Abstract:

 This investigation examined developmental change in how children perceive and act on dynamic affordances when crossing roads on foot. Six- to 14-year-olds and adults crossed roads with continuous cross-traffic in a large-screen, immersive pedestrian simulator. We observed change both in childrens gap choices and in their ability to precisely synchronize their movement with the opening of a gap. Younger children were less discriminating than older children and adults, choosing fewer large gaps and more small gaps. Interestingly, 12-year-olds gap choices were significantly more conservative than those of 6-, 8-, 10-, and 14-year-olds, and adults. Timing of entry behind the lead vehicle in the gap (a key measure of movement coordination) improved steadily with development, reaching adultlike levels by age 14. Coupled with their poorer timing of entry, 6-, 8-, and 10-year-olds gap choices resulted in significantly less time to spare and more collisions than 14-year-olds and adults. Time to spare did not differ between 12-year-olds, 14-year-olds, and adults, indicating that 12-year-olds more conservative gap choices compensated for their poorer timing of entry. The findings show that childrens ability to perceive and act on dynamic affordances undergoes a prolonged period of development, and that older children appear to compensate for their poorer movement timing skills by adjusting their gap decisions to match their crossing actions. Implications for the development of perceptionaction tuning and road-crossing skills are discussed.

Women with symptoms of a urinary tract infection but a negative urine culture: PCR-based quantification of Escherichia coli suggests infection in most cases. 

Clinical Microbiology and Infection, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.cmi.2017.04.004

Link: http://www.clinicalmicrobiologyandinfection.com/article/S1198-743X(17)30209-4/fulltext

Abstract:

 Objectives

 Our objective was to examine whether or not women with symptoms of a urinary tract infection but with a negative culture (20%30%) do have an infection.

 Methods

 We performed quantitative PCR (qPCR) for Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, on top of a standard culture, in urine samples from 220 women with dysuria and/or frequency and/or urgency and from 86 women without symptoms. For symptomatic women, qPCR was also carried out for four sexually transmitted agents.

 Results

 In the symptomatic group, 80.9% (178/220) of the urine cultures were positive for any uropathogen and 95.9% (211/220) were E. coli qPCR-positive. For the control group, cultures for E. coli and E. coli qPCR were positive in, respectively, 10.5% (9/86) and 11.6% (10/86). In the symptomatic group, qPCR yielded 19 positive samples for S. saprophyticus qPCR, one positive sample for Mycoplasma genitalium and one for Trichomonas vaginalis.

 Conclusions

 These findings suggest that almost all women with typical urinary complaints and a negative culture still have an infection with E. coli.

Performance of an Artificial Pancreas System for Young Children with Type 1 Diabetes. 

Diabetes Technology   Therapeutics, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1089/dia.2016.0424

Abstract

 Background: Young children 58 years old with type 1 diabetes (T1D) exhibit clear needs for improved glycemic control but may be limited in their ability to safely interact with an artificial pancreas system. Our goal was to evaluate the safety and performance of an artificial pancreas (AP) system among young children with T1D.

 Research Design and Methods: In a randomized, crossover trial, children with T1D age 58 years were enrolled to receive on separate study periods (in random order) either the UVa AP using the DiAs Control Platform software with child-resistant lock-out screens (followed as an out-patient admission) or their usual insulin pump+continuous glucose monitor (CGM) care at home. Hypoglycemic events and CGM tracings were compared between the two 68-h study periods. All analyses were adjusted for level of physical activity as tracked using Fitbit devices.

 Results: Twelve participants (median age 7 years, n=6 males) completed the trial. Compared to home care, the AP admission resulted in increased time with blood glucose (BG) 70180mg/dL (73% vs. 47%) and lower mean BG (152mg/dL vs. 190mg/dL), both P0.001 after adjustment for activity. Occurrence of hypoglycemia was similar between sessions without differences in time 70mg/dL (AP 1.1%1.1%; home 1.6%1.2%). There were no adverse events during the AP or home study periods.

 Conclusions: Use of an AP in young children was safe and resulted in improved mean BG without increased hypoglycemia. This suggests that AP use in young children is safe and improves overall diabetes control. </TEXT>
