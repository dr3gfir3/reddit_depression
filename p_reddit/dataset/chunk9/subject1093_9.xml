Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac287/do_any_of_you_actually_not_believe_in_evolution/).

Preferred sites are: [soundcloud](//soundcloud.com), [bandcamp](//bandcamp.com), [youtube](//youtube.com], [vimeo](vimeo.com), and [spotify](//spotify.com).  These work best with reddit's embedding feature.  It is *highly unlikely* that you'll be unable to find the content you're trying to submit on these sites.  Spotify should only be used as a last resort, as many users do not have access. *Please* use conventional URLs, *not mobile links.*

If this stream is an exclusive release only appearing on one specific website, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=One-time site approval!) and we will review your subimssion.  Please ensure that you have searched for the artist on each of our preferred sites before contacting us.

If this stream is a bandcamp or soundcloud link that is being embedded in the artist's home page, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=Bandcamp or Soundcloud on Artist's Website!) to request manual approval.

The correct format is:      

**Artist Name - Song Name [genre]** (optional year) Optional extra text    

Check your post now. Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre]?    

Forgetting these points are almost definitely why it was removed.    

An example of a correct title:    

     Damu the Fudgemunk - Tea Thyme [instrumental hip-hop/funk] (2010)    
     


You will need to delete this post before submitting again (click on delete above).

**If you are not posting music, please resubmit with the appropriate tag in the title:**

    {playlist} for music playlists
    {non-music audio} for audio submissions that are not music
    {non-music video} for video submissions that are not music

	<TEXT> Hello comrades! As a friendly reminder, this subreddit is a space for socialists.  If you have questions or want to debate, please consider the subs created specifically for this (/r/Socialism_101, /r/SocialismVCapitalism, /r/CapitalismVSocialism, or /r/DebateCommunism/).  You are also encouraged to use the search function to search for topics you may not be well versed in, as they may have been covered extensively before.  Acquaint yourself with the rules on the sidebar before commenting or posting. Rules are strictly enforced for non subscribers.


- Personal attacks and harassment will not be tolerated. 


- **Bigotry, ableism and hate speech will be met with immediate bans;** socialism is an intrinsically inclusive system and we believe all people are born equal and deserve equal voices in society. 

- This subreddit is not for questioning the basics of socialism.  There are numerous subreddits available for those who wish to debate or learn more about socialism


- Users are expected to at least read the discussion in a given thread before replying to it.  Obviously obtuse or asinine questions will be assumed to be trolling and will be removed and can result in a ban.

New to socialism?

- Check out the **Socialism Starter Pack** - https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/wiki/index/starterpack

Thank you!

	<TEXT> Sorry, but I had to remove your recent post on /r/kikpals because your title did not comply with our official guidelines. 

This is the proper way to format a title: *AGE [R4R]  DESCRIPTION*

Here is a TL;DR checklist of what should be in your subject:

**1. Use only M, F, T, and R for tagging gender.**

**2. Use [] around the R4R tag, so it looks like [R4R]. Don't use (), {}, or anything else.**

**3. For multiple ages or letter tags, only use /'s, so it looks like 21/21 [MF4R]. Don't use . , \\ | - : ; ~ or anything else.**

**4. Your age must be included before your [R4R].**

Finally, please make sure you read the rules on the sidebar!

Thanks! :D

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

These work best with reddit's embedding feature.  It is *highly unlikely* that you'll be unable to find the content you're trying to submit on these sites.

If this stream is a bandcamp or soundcloud link that is being embedded in the artist's home page, you can [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/listentothis subject=Bandcamp or Soundcloud on Artist's Website!) to request manual approval.

Unfortunately it has been removed because it must be a direct image link. **If your imgur submission is an imgur album with multiple images, please [message the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcrappydesign) so we can approve it manually.**

**PLEASE NOTE THAT, IF YOU USE AN APP, SUCH AS REDDIT IS FUN, TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE, YOU WILL NEED TO USE A DIFFERENT APP OR THE MOBILE WEBSITE TO UPLOAD YOUR IMAGE AND SUBMIT YOUR POST.**  Some apps, mainly Reddit Is Fun, incorrectly upload single images as albums.  You can report this issue to the developer of the app you're using (/r/redditisfun, for the biggest offender).

Otherwise, please re-submit using a direct image link (must end in jpg, gif, png, etc), thanks. [These instructions might help.](http://i.imgur.com/RjrqakK.gifv)  

Or see if one of these links works:

* http://imgur.com/a/D2xOG.jpg
* http://imgur.com/a/D2xOG.gifv

Also, if your link ends in ?1 please remove that before submitting.  


Thanks for understanding! Stay crappy. 3

Thank you for your submission. Unfortunately your account does not have enough karma to submit things to /r/videos at this time.

/r/videos requires users to have a minimum of 10 link **and** 10 comment karma. We suggest that you comment in some popular threads and make submissions to other subreddits to build up your karma and then come back.

We are sorry for any inconvenience caused, and look forward to your submissions in the future.

	<DATE> 2017-05-10 12:52:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone! This is the Accountability Thread where people can list what they need or want to accomplish today and have everyone else help keep you accountable to do them. So, in general a post will look like this:

Things I have to get done today:

~~1: Post Accountability Thread~~

If I had more to do that I had not completed I would list them and update this when these things were   complete.

Also, if I saw someone doing something that I happen to be well-educated or have some sort of expertise in I can offer support or help on the topic/task.

The thread is a versatile one, use it in a way that helps you and others stay on task!

Happy studying! </TEXT>

Your post has been removed as it violated [Rule 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_2-). Please check that your post doesn't contain the following issues:

* **Your post can't be specific to your situation or involve a story. Please make sure to depersonalize your question and remove any unnecessary context before posting it again.**

Please note - once posted, the titles cannot be edited. If your title breaks the rules, please feel free to [make a new post](/r/askreddit/submit?selftext=true) that fits within the rules.

[**When you've removed the answer or unnecessary context from the textbox, message the mods for review and reapproval**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed+under+rule+1,+please+review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac0ze/serious_i_want_to_live_like_a_nomad_for_awhile/) and ask the moderators to re-approve it.

Because your account is new (under 10 days old) **OR your account has very low comment karma**, your submission has been removed.
This action is **NOT** directed at you personally; /r/cats requires all accounts to be at least **10 days old** AND have **at least 25 comment karma** in order to create new threads.
Comment karma is **not** the same thing as link karma. If you have less than 25 comment karma, it is easy to get- simply participate in a few discussions and you'll have the amount you need in no time at all.
Questions? [Message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fcats) and let us know.

Hi there, your post has been removed for one of the following reasons: 

* [Rule 3:](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_3-) Askreddit is for open-ended discussion questions. If you've posted a question that could be answered with just yes or no, it needs to explicitly ask for more discussion like asking "What's the story" or "Why or why not?"  Also, questions with a single correct answer, that can be researched elsewhere or provide a limited scope for discussion (yes/no, DAE, polls etc.) are not appropriate.  

* [Rule 1:](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/wiki/index#wiki_-rule_1-) You must post a clear and direct question in the title. 

If you have any queries or concerns, please feel free to [contact the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FAskReddit subject=Yes/No+Related+Post+Review+Request message=My+post+was+removed,+automoderator+said+Rule+1+or+3,+please review%3a%0d%0a%0d%0ahttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ac0m9/do_you_store_things_in_your_bra/).

	<TEXT> Your submission has been automatically removed because it only has a title and little to none self text.   
When submitting a self post you should expand on the title in order to get the discussion started. For example: When submitting a question you can expand on what motivated you to ask the question, reasearch you already did and things you already know about the subject. Basically we ask from you to provide the things needed to start a good discussion. 

**Please [message the moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/history subject=I expanded my post message=I expanded my submission for your review: https://www.reddit.com/r/history/comments/6ac0ep/what_is_the_most_uneventful_year_in_modern_history/.) once you have expanded your post so we can approve it for you.**
