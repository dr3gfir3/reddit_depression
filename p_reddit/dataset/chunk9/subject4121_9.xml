	<TEXT> "Johnson's death was officially ruled a suicide by the Department of Defense. However, her father became suspicious when he saw her body in the funeral home and decided to investigate. The Army initially refused to release information, but did so under the Freedom of Information Act after Representative William Lacy Clay, Jr. raised questions about it at the congressional hearings over Pat Tillman's death.

The autopsy report and photographs revealed Johnson had a broken nose, black eye, loose teeth, burns from a corrosive chemical on her genitals, and a gunshot wound that seemed inconsistent with suicide. Several reporters have suspected that the chemical burns were to destroy DNA evidence of a rape." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was responding to why people aren't getting upset enough to protest gerrymandering. The fact there are more important issues is one of the reasons in my opinion. 
I never said it shouldn't be discussed or discredited the importance in talking about it.  I'm saying that our country is kinda fucked at the moment and there is bigger shit to protest than gerrymandering that isn't happening. So because protesting(actual protesting not gathering for a couple days then going home) isn't happening with the bigger shit it's not going to happen with gerrymandering. 
As for the lame stream media...yeah it's fucking dumb. Whether it's Fox, CNN or MSNBC, etc...it's all shit. They just push agendas and try to divide us even more than we are and unfortunately it shapes the opinions of millions if americans. Journalism is dead and it's only getting worse. 

Also, I bet you automatically making assumptions about people then making the wrong read on them has caused problems for you. I bet not a lot of people like being around you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not divisive or "sexy" enough of an issue for the lame stream media to report on. It doesn't evoke enough rage. It doesn't involve Trump or the Russians or gorillas so all the millions of mouth breathers don't hear about it since most let the tv tell them how they should think. So there is little to know buzz on the subject. 

Or maybe people just don't give a shit since America has become the public laughing stock along with the rest of the developed world's reality show. We have a lot worse issue to deal with that aren't getting protested over. Our whole system is broken and it goes a lot deeper than gerrymandering.
