	<TEXT> Sabine Hyland recently discovered several khipus in a small village. The khipu are thought to record information among the Inca from simple accounting to complex histories, but no one has been able to decipher them. Hyland believes that using a combination of colored strings and knots, 95 unique chord patterns could be produced for a logosyllabic-style writing system. Not only is the color of the string and style of knot important, but so is the fiber type and direction of the ply. This means one would need to feel the khipu as well as see the khipu. However, the khipu documented by Hyland are thought to date to the 18th century, centuries after the conquest of the Inca. This throws into question the continuity of this historic khipu to pre-Conquest khipu. The article ends with a tantalizing passage about an old woman who told Hyland that she used to read the khipu as a little girl before darting off to tend her herds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. And there is doubt as to whether people were actually sacrificed as a result of playing the ballgame. Most of the imagery alludes to the Hero Twin myth made famous in the Popol Vuh. This myth has deep roots in Mesoamerica and has appeared in art and iconography among many of its cultures. The imagery may thus be referencing this myth rather than depicting actual sacrifice. The lack of skeletal remains that can be securely attributed to both sacrifice and ballplaying further supports the idea of the referential nature of the imagery to the myth.

Edit: The ballgame is also linked symbolically to warfare and the passage of the sun. Disputes could be settled with a game rather than with physical conflict. Part of the reason the Spanish banned playing the game was because of its many layers of symbolism and deep connection to the religion of many Mesoamerican peoples.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The jungle reclaiming many areas of the New World where people once thrived. A number of factors resulted in the reclamation such as abandonment or decimation from colonialism and Old World diseases. 

Take the Maya Lowland area, for example. Towards the end of the Classic period the area once looked like Ohio with broad open fields and low hills. People were continually chopping down trees to construct their homes, construct their cities, and burn for fuel in their cooking and plaster making fires. Plaster making consumed more wood for fuel than any other activity including construction. One of the reasons Chichen Itza looks so nice compared to earlier Classic or later Postclassic cities was its use of cut and shaped stone. With so few trees in the region, the Maya opted to use less plaster on their buildings and conserve their trees for construction and cooking. Normally the facing of a building was very rough and made from cobbles or loose fitting blocks that were then covered by a thick layer of plaster and decorated into things such as masks or friezes. By the time Mayapan rose near Chichen Itza, enough of the jungle had regrown and reclaimed the land to allow the Maya to switch back to using plaster to cover their buildings. This is one of the reasons why Mayapan is sometimes described as a "smaller, shittier looking" version of Chichen Itza. The cut and shaped blocks withstand the elements better and look nicer.

The other example is the Amazon rain forest. When early Spanish explorers first went down the river, it was described as densely populated with towns and villages never leaving one's sight. With the discovery of *terra preta*, an artificially created soil that holds onto organic material and minerals better than the natural jungle soil, it was more than feasible to farm in the Amazon. Farmers today use plots of *terra preta* for their own practices because of how productive these plots can be. Combine that with a better understanding of Amazonian orchard practices in which people purposely plant and spread food producing trees in order to have secure sources throughout the year, and it is any wonder why people once doubted early Spanish accounts. Unfortunately, disease and colonialism took its toll. With the jungle environment being so aggressive in reclaiming land, these former settlements were quickly swallowed and buried. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel less bad now, thank you. 

I do need to improve my style of writing, though, so I sound like less of a pretentious douche bag. I try not to, but it always seems comes off like I'm a huge dick. I think I'm much more personable and friendly in real life when I talk about these things, but who knows? Maybe I am a dick and no one has bothered to tell me that to my face.

 BTW that's not how I had imagined the game would be played at all. For some reason I had a volleyball type game in my head where the ball wouldn't touch the ground, but this seems to be almost entirely ground based with the ball rarely getting of the ground. I really don't know how I got that idea in my head.

I seem to recall a similar thing where the ball had to stay in the air. It would make sense given the sloping nature of the lateral platforms to provide bounce for the ball when it rolls off. But then, not all lateral platforms are sloping such as Great Ballcourt at Chichen Itza or Ballcourts [1](http://i.imgur.com/kkSqNJZ.jpg) and [2](http://i.imgur.com/oiLXCRM.jpg) at Los Guachimtones, the site of my research, or the [ceramic ballcourt models from Nayarit](http://collections.lacma.org/node/253572). So I'm not sure what to think anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What really annoys me about /r/history and Reddit in general is the same repetitive comments made on a popular post. Take [this one](https://np.reddit.com/r/history/comments/65ot26/mexico_revives_3000yearold_ancient_ball_game/) on Mexicans trying to revive the Mesoamerican ballgame by having a tournament at Teotihuacan. Awesome, fun, interesting. [Except almost all the comments can be boiled down to "DAE remember Road to El Dorado?" and "Will the losers/winners be sacrificed?" ](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/52/ac/e8/52ace8179b4aeb5eca02a3d77368682d.gif)

Does no one read the article and comments before posting? It's not a long article and it addresses the latter question quite clearly. It kind of bugs me.

But I want to know if I am doing badhistory related to the topic of sacrifice and the ballgame. I have tried looking for sources that discuss skeletal remains linked to sacrifice from playing the ballgame. I haven't come across any. Do any sources exist? If so, can you please share?

If no sources exist/no remains have been recovered, is it still fair to say Mesoamericans sacrificed people for playing the ballgame? Personally, I say no. I think the art and iconography depicting this event references the mythological story about the Hero Twins made famous in the Popol Vuh. We know that this mythology is old, it is referenced in the Preclassic murals at San Bartolo. It is also not uncommon for Mesoamericans to depict themselves in the positions of gods or figures from myth in their artwork. I think it is fair to say that at this point we do not believe Mesoamericans sacrificed people for winning/losing a ballgame. This can, of course, change if new evidence is found. An I wrong in telling people this? Should I let them continue to believe that all this sacrifice was going on when it might not have?

Your input is greatly appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but it is safe to say that many groups in Mesoamerica descended or were strongly related to these two in many different ways, especially language, religion or trade.

Not at all. The only cultures you could maybe make that argument for is the Olmec and Teotihuacan. Even then, both of these cultures did not influence everyone or everyone equally. Give credit to Mesoamericans for being their own unique people able to create their own unique culture without being descended or influenced by their neighbors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  For example, I read an article once that claimed that sacrifice and cannibalism of sacrificial victims came about as a means of providing protein, which due to the lack of domesticated grazing animals, was lacking in the Mexican diet. The pomp and ceremony of sacrifice was still there, but the historian also argued that it had serious practical benefits.

Oh, Harner's old article? That has long been debunked. Harner's failed to realize that Mesoamerican food provided all the necessary proteins. Between corn, beans, squash, and the occasional deer, water fowl, snake, lizard, frog, etc Mesoamericans were not deficient in protein at all. </TEXT>

Does it? Do you have a source for this? Because I'm not aware of any recovered remains that have been linked to ballgame sacrifices. I've been looking for sources and have yet to find one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The debate lies in whether the art and iconography depicting myth or actual events. There is abundant mythology regarding the ballgame and sacrifice in Mesoamerica. And as far as i can ascertain, there is little physical evidence found in the form of skeletal remains associated with sacrificed ballplayers. It would seem that the art and iconography are depicting myth and not actual events. That can certainly change if future work recovers remains. It is also possible I missed a publication. However, if someone had made this discovery I don't understand why it is so difficult to find. </TEXT>

No. As I said in my discussion post, there is little evidence of sacrifice in response to the ballgame outside of art and iconography referencing mythology. Basically, human remains have not been recovered that can be linked to this supposed relationship. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ballgame is deeply rooted in Mesoamerican religion and belief. It is symbolic of warfare and sacrifice, the passage of the sun, and struggle of good and evil. To better convert Mesoamericans to Catholicism, the Spanish banned things that were deeply rooted in their native religion. For another example z the Spanish banned amaranth, a type of grain. It was because people like the Aztecs would make little dough figures made of amaranth flour as offerings for the gods. </TEXT>

I am unaware of any publications which have described ballgame sacrifices. I have gone hunting for publications on this topic and turned up nothing. While it is possible I could have missed the publications, I have also not come across any citations that failed to come up in my searches. 

 However, the archaeological remains of ball courts at major city sites seem to regularly depict a winner/loser outcome in which the local residents are always the winner. This likely suggests a ritualistic game with a sort of power dynamic, administered by the elites.

What kind of remains are we talking about? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm not here to have an academic debate

So I guess it is a moot point to ask you for sources on things like:

* Having a sacrificial site that is part of the game complex is material evidence of a relationship

* We have multiple, indepedent sources that all indicate it was a thing

 The degree of evidence you're demanding in this particular case is absurd

It's really not. In Mesoamerican archaeology if you want to make a claim such as this, you need multiple lines of evidence that hold up to scrutiny. This is the same level of demand one would make for claims of other forms of sacrifice or cannibalism. You need to rule out other possibilities without ruling out your explanation. Cut marks on a bone could as easily mean sacrifice as it does with cannibalism or ritual fleshing for burial. It is other lines of evidence, both a part of the remains and the context in which they were found, that help support one hypothesis over the other.

This is kind of the whole point I am trying to make. There may be iconography attached to pre-Columbian beliefs and mythology at many Mesoamerican sites. And there may even be oral history from descendant communities regarding who was killed. But without physical evidence that can establish the link between the sketal remains of sacrificial victims and ballplaying, this remains an unsupported hypothesis. Requiring that physical evidence is not demanding or absurd. It is simply the proof required to verify a hypothesis. As an unsupported hypothesis in popular culture, this has taken on its own set of information and mythology that is repeated by people such as tour guides and tourists. What art historians and archaeologists see as iconography of the Hero Twin myth repeated on friezes and murals for ballcourts, others see this and think it is proof enough that sacrifice occurred without considering other possibilities. 

Art and iconography in Mesoamerica, like any other place in the world, can be represented of ideas and beliefs rather than facts and historical events. We cannot accept art and iconography at face value as being 100% grounded in physical reality. Art and iconography is open to interpretation and is layered with symbolism and belief. This includes the depictions of ballplaying and sacrifice.

I have enjoyed debating you on this subject. I hope I have not come off as too dickish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oral myths still require physical evidence to support them. Sacrificial sites in proximity to a ballcourt is meaningless. Sacrificial sites are nearby to a lot of things. You must bridge the connection with other supporting evidence.

What we need to support the hypothesis of people being sacrificed for having played a game is skeletal evidence. We know that playing the ballgame leaves behind wear and tear on the bones of individuals. What would cement the connection is a non-fatal fracture in the skeleton in one of those locations as a result of playing the ballgame. Then we would need physical evidence of that person having been sacrificed. 

I don't even know where one would expect to even find a ballplayer sacrifice. The centers of courts normally contain ritual caches, not human remains. Perhaps if the person was buried nearby that would be your solid connection between sacrifice and ballplaying. Even if you find skeletal remains with evidence for playing the ballgame, you need to establish that they were sacrificed in response to a game. Anything else leaves out the possibility that the person sacrificed just happened to be a ballplayer.

 I'm not doxxing a friend on the internet. They work at a tier 1 research university--I'll leave it at that.

I'm asking because I want to read their publications on the topic. I want to see their argument and proof that sacrifice in response to ballplaying was a regular occurrence and not one left to iconography. It's the internet, I can't take your word on whether this person exists or not. I could equally say that I am best friends with a high profile actress and also say I do not want to dox them. I understand if you don't want to say who they are, but you can't rely on them as a source to back your argument when others cannot look up that source and verify your information. Is their PhD in Anthropology or a related field? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is not unfounded--there is a reason to believe it. 

I would say it is unfounded as there is little physical evidence that players were sacrificed for having played the game. If you are arguing that iconography means there is basis in truth for all things depicted I would like to see you defend the existence of feathered serpents, world trees, and earth monsters. 

I will concede that like the crucifixion of Christ, a single instance of sacrifice involving the ballgame may have imprinted itself on the beliefs of many peoples in Mesoamerica. That is not to say that people were regularly crucified or sacrificed as part of their respective religions. Simply the iconography was repeated to allude to a past event.

 And I've never heard that the winners or both teams were killed. I've only ever heard one version, including the one from the PhD giving me a tour of the site.

And who was the person with the PhD? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am happy to see more and more people in Mexico wanting to learn to play and actually play the Mesoamerican ballgame. I was kind of hoping the article would go into some more depth on the topic such as how a variant of the game survived in Sinaloa called Ulama. What does annoy me is the article's repetition of the myth that people were sacrificed, winners or losers, for playing the ballgame. While there is a ton of imagery and iconography in Mesoamerica related to the ballgame, with some imagery related to sacrifice, there is little physical evidence that people were ever sacrificed for winning or losing a game. Being a ballplayer carried an immense amount of prestige and status within many Mesoamerican cultures. We see this in imagery from all over. What we do not see is a lot of imagery of sacrificing ballplayers outside of a mythological context. Some ballcourts may have friezes depicting said sacrifice, but they allude to stories and myths of the past like the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh. An analog could be the depiction of Jesus on the cross. Most churches do not nail someone to a cross every Sunday as part of their normal worship. </TEXT>

Think of a bowl full of Skittles. It has an assortment of different colors that were randomly dumped in the bag at the factory. You take a handful out and set it on a table. You just took out a fraction of the possible colored Skittles to the point where you may not have any of one color like yellow. Now take that handful and divide by half. Now you have a fraction of a fraction. Continue until you are down to just one Skittle. Is that one Skittle representative of all the diversity within the bowl from where it came from? Not really.

	<TEXT> No, the Toba eruption did not cause a genetic bottleneck for humanity. We do not see the same bottleneck happen to other animals or in other humans (like Neaderthals). What this bottleneck is, is the result of a founders effect as humans spread out of Africa. You have a small group that leaves Africa and has only as much genetic diversity as the members that leave. They settle in a spot. Eventually a group of them fission off to settle in another spot further way. This group has only a fraction of the diversity of the group they fissioned from. Repeat until humans have spread across the globe. What you find in this pattern is what you should expect. The point of origin, Africa, has the most genetic diversity on the planet. The last places to be colonized by people, like the Americas, exhibits the most genetic similarity.

And as [Petraglia](http://www.nature.com/news/2007/070702/full/news070702-15.html) has discovered, tool types show a continuity before, during, and after the eruption in India. India would have been hit the hardest by ash fall. There is some debate on Petraglia's findings, but considering the founder effect and the lack of bottleneck in other species, it is likely the Toba eruption played a small role in killing any homo sapiens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since the colonial period rich Americans have hated being taxed. The whole reason for the American Rebellion was to avoid having the American colonies pay their fair share of taxes to Great Britain (without being represented and negotiating said taxes). Before the Rebellion, the colonies were paying just a fraction of what people in Britain were paying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of the the idea came from novels written in Spain shortly before and into the years of colonization. One of these novels, *Las Sergas de Esplandin*, gave California it's name. The state is named after Queen Calafia, a fictional queen who ruled over Amazonian women

Also, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Cities_of_Gold_(myth)) says this,

 In the 16th century, the Spaniards in New Spain (now Mexico) began to hear rumours of "Seven Cities of Gold" called "Cbola" located across the desert, hundreds of miles to the north. The stories may have their root in an earlier Portuguese legend about seven cities founded on the island of Antillia by a Catholic expedition in the 8th century. The later Spanish tales were largely caused by reports given by the four shipwrecked survivors of the failed Narvez expedition, which included lvar Nez Cabeza de Vaca and an African slave named Esteban Dorantes, or Estevanico. Eventually returning to New Spain, the adventurers said they had heard stories from natives about cities with great and limitless riches. However, when conquistador Francisco Vzquez de Coronado finally arrived at Cbola in 1540, he discovered that the stories were unfounded and that there were in fact no treasures as the friar had described  only adobe towns.

 While among the towns, Coronado heard an additional rumor from a native he called "the Turk" that there was a city with plenty of gold called Quivira located on the other side of the great plains. However, when at last he reached this place (variously conjectured to be in modern Kansas, Nebraska or Missouri), he found little more than straw-thatched villages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seeing as how many Caribbean communities were trading with one another, long distance coastal trading around the Yucatan peninsula, possible trade routes from northern South America to Western Mexico, and extensive coastal trading along the US and Canadian Pacific, it is certainly possible that Native Americans could have reached Europe in time. However, history and people do not follow a sequential tech tree in which one development automatically leads to another development. People are not predestined to follow the same route to get an Alpha Centauri science victory. People have agency and make choices, both beneficial and harmful choices, for themselves. Just look at people today. We continue to pollute our planet with excessive plastic waste, extensive deforestation, and burning fossil fuels to satisfy our energy demands. Despite us being aware of the harmful long term effects of our actions, we continue to do them. So if Native Americans did develop long distance sailing vessels, they may not have chosen to use them to go that far. Just as China sailed as far as East Africa without going further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone from home had shared this [blog entry](http://www.coppercountryexplorer.com/2017/04/quincy-ravine/) on Facebook about how a ravine used to traverse a large part of our town before it was filled in and built over.

What caught my eye, however, was an entry on a building that used to be on [Tezcuco (Texcoco) Street](http://www.coppercountryexplorer.com/2017/03/milwaukee-house/). Now, I knew we had a Montezuma Avenue and a Montezuma Park, but I never noticed a Tezcuco Street in town. That may be because it is only a few blocks long and there is only one road sign that actually names the street. I find it a little funny that you have these Nahuatl (or Anglicized Nahuatl) names all the way up in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. I'm really curious as to why these names were chosen way back in the early history of the area. Did some city planner happen to read a book on Mexican history and thought it would be fun to use these names? Were they chosen simply because they were exotic? Is there a treasure hidden in the area Nicolas Cage is destined to find? I don't know and I'm not sure who to ask, but I would like to find out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, slave labor was not used to construct the pyramids of Mesoamerica. However, corve labor, or unfree labor, was mostly used by Mesoamerican peoples for construction (Abrams 1994). The difference between slavery and corve labor is simple. Under slavery, a person is owned (permanently or temporarily) by another person and must do what is asked of them within the bounds of society's laws and rules. Corve labor is a form of tax in which people are required to contribute a small amount of time to the state for public or royal projects. This labor is largely restricted to certain activities like construction of pyramids. Beyond the small amount of time one needs to contribute to the state, people are largely free to do what they want (within the bounds of society's laws and rules). 

Even the largest pyramids in Mesoamerica, like the Sun Pyramid at Teotihuacan and the Great Pyramid at Cholula, were constructed using corve labor. Both of this structures, mind you, were not constructed in one single construction event. Rather, both of these pyramids are created from smaller pyramids which were simply expanded. Each expansion of the pyramid, while itself an massive undertaking, reduced the amount of laborers needed during each construction season and created less of a burden on procuring construction materials in time for building. Instead of 5,000 people all trying to work on a pyramid and have it finished before the rainy season destroys the unsealed construction fill of earth, clay, or mud bricks, you can have a few hundred people work on a construction stage over the course of several years (or several decades and centuries depending on the pyramid).

While corve labor may be used extensively by the nobility to construct their pyramids and palaces, people within Mesoamerica also constructed their own smaller pyramids and other buildings. Carballo (2012) has argued that the Aztec commoners used collective labor for their projects. Collective labor is essentially a group getting together to work on something for the betterment of the group. There is some corve labor involved, but the demand for labor is not from an individual but rather from the community. The community expects aid in their construction efforts or other activities. That means helping someone harvest their crops, improve their house, or clearing a field of trees for a new farm. In return by contributing towards the community you can expect the same level of contribution from members of your community when you need something done that you cannot do yourself. Collective labor can be used to construct smaller neighborhood pyramids of lower quality. While the quality is not as nice as pyramids commissioned by nobility, a pyramid built by a community is still something greater than any kind of pyramid an individual may try and construct on their own.

I hope this answers your question.

	<TEXT>  We have solid proof that humans were smelting copper and casting it into pre-made molds since ~8,000 BC at the latest. There's just no way that multiple independent cultures were practicing relatively advanced metallurgy, yet it took them all another 3,500 years to figure out how to make a wheel. For reference, the city of Rome was founded less than 3,000 ago.

Maybe perspective will help in understanding how rapid our advancement in technology has been. It took all of humanity 192,000 years to first begin using metals. That's 7,680 generations. Just think, stone tools are only a couple of million years old and predate Homo sapiens. It took until our species to go from stone tools to something else. That's damn impressive given how relatively new our species is compared to other animals and plants whose ancestry is much older than ours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But I will reiterate, not everyone lives near the coast and would have been affected. You cannot get all your resources from the coast. By necessity one would need to establish inland sites to take advantage of obsidian or chert outcroppings, timber, and wild foods and animals. And if the civilization was large enough, the inland sites would be significant in size. They would leave behind a ton of evidence of their activities.

Now, we obviously have not discovered everything, but based on what we have discovered there is little support for the idea of an advanced pre-Ice Age civilization. It's only supporters are people like Graham Hancock who does not do any field work of his own, only misinterprets other people's work to support his narrative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Also, the east coast of North America has a greater amount of Clovis sites found AND they are older than the west which really stirs things up. The Solutrean hypothesis looks at the possibility of Europeans traveling over a Northern Atlantic land-bridge to America
 DNA analysis is also a huge (and VERY recent) technology that scientists are using to find linkages between NA tribes and Asia. There are still plenty of holes in understanding the migration sadly but we are headed in the right direction with finds like these

Don't be so quick to jump to a European connection. There may be several pre-Clovis sites on the East Coast that date to before West Coast sites. But keep in mind, these sites are found through luck and great preservation. We are trying to look at a ten thousand piece puzzle with only a dozen puzzle pieces in place. All East Coast sites do is push back the date of paleoindian migration to account for these early sites, just as Monte Verde, dated to 18,000 BP, in Chile does. We need more puzzle pieces before we hitch our wagon to the Solutrean hypothesis, especially given that DNA and linguistics all point towards an Asian origin. </TEXT>

They do not. A point dredged up by a fishing boat on the east coast is the source for the Solutrean hypothesis. And even then, the point only has a passing resemblance to actual Solutrean points.

Keep in mind, you would not expect paleoindian toolsets to reflect Southeast Asian ones. Not only are you hunting different things, paleoindians spent several thousand years in Berengia before moving southward into the Americas. During those thousands of years, tool types can and probably did change from any contemporary tooltypes found in Eastern Siberia/Russia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You would be surprised what survives in oral history. There is a section of a book titled Skull Wars by David Hurst Thomas. He talks about a 7,400 year old oral story that survived to the 1800s when an American soldier wrote it down. I'll lift the passage which starts on page 249.

*Chief Lalek begins the Klamath story like this: "A long time ago, so long that you cannot count it the white man ran wild in the woods and my people lived in rock-built houses. In that time, long ago, before the stars fell, the spirits of the earth and the sky, the spirits of the sea and the mountains, often came and talked with my people..." Lalek then described the spirits living inside Mount Mazama and its sister mountain, Mount Shasta. The two massive peaks had openings that led to a lower world through which the spirits could pass. The Chief of the Below-World loved a Klamath chief's daughter, Loha, and demanded that she marry him. When this amorous overture was rebuked, the result did not sit well with the spirit, who threatened total destruction of the people as revenge. "Raging and thundering," the story went, "he rushed up through the opening and stood on top of his mountain," terrorizing the people below.*

*At this point, the spirit of Mount Shasta intervened as a cloud appeared over the peak of Shasta, and the two mountains engaged in a horrible combat: "Red-hot rocks as large as hills hurled through the skies. Burning ashes fell like rain. The chief of the Below-World (Mazama) spewed fire from its mouth. Like an ocean of flame it devoured the forests on the mountains and in the valleys. On and on the Curse of Fire swept until it reached the homes of the people. Fleeing in terror before it, the people found refuge in the waters of Klamath Lake."*

*The Klamaths then decided that someone should be sacrificed to calm the chaos. Two medicine men climbed Mount Mazama and jumped into the caldera: "Once more the mountains shook. This time the Chief of the Below-World was driven into his home and the top of the mountain fell upon him. When the morning sun arose, the high mountain was gone... for many years, rain fell in torrents and filled the great hole that was made when the mountain fell..."*

*Chief Lalek ended his story this way: "Now you understand why my people never visit the lake. Down through the ages we have this story. From father to son has come the warning, "look not upon the place... for it means death or everlasting sorrow."*

*Deloria emphasizes the parallels between the pre-1865 Klamath account-recorded decades before the first scientist explored Crater Lake-and the modern geological explanation, which dates only to the 1920s. In both, Mount Mazama was destroyed in a catastrophic explosion, characterized by superheated avalanches, a massive cloud of volcanic dust, the dramatic collapse of the peak into the belly of the mountain, and the formation of a new deepwater lake atop the truncated mountain.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The answer is that there may have been other settlements which used stonework, but we have not yet found these other settlements. The reason Gobekli Tepi can even be studied is that the people who built the structures purposely buried them before abandoning the site. Other contemporaneous structures within the region may not have been so fortunate. If left exposed, other people will mine the site for building material as it is easier to break up megalithic blocks for your own use than to quarry and shape new ones.

So really, it is only a matter of time and chance until we find other contemporaneous settlements to Gobekli Tepi which we hopefully illuminate our understanding of these people, much like pre-Clovis sites have done for our understanding of paleoindians and the settlement of the Americas. </TEXT>
