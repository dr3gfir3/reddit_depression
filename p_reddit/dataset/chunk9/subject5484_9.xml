	<TEXT> I learned that I said only a third of Americans have passports, then you said oh nonononono look at this yearly statistic which, when extrapolated, shows that only a third of Americans have passports.

Source: friends, family, working next to a military base in Korea.

Your "let's define" this group as the people naturalized in a given year a not, say, something intelligent like all the people who are first-generation citizens is convenient for your math magic, kind of like when I said a third of Americans have passports and you dazzled with data to confirm what I said in the first place.  And your word game about immigrants is just that.  In our country, when someone says "My grandfather was an immigrant", we all know what that means, mkay?

It's a strawman to use 100%, but, like not having universal healthcare, American employers give their employees among the stingiest amount of holidays in the West.  Oh yay, can't wait to play the "define the West" word game with you!

And as for labeling that bait, this is a thread about Americans and their grasp of geography.  Now, it's interesting that you think that universal healthcare has nothing to do with geography, but it does.  So does the number of vacation days you get per year.  But my guess is that you think geography means knowing where countries are on a map.  So, if you get a Master's degree in geography, you're really really good at finding them tricky places like Burkina Faso and Christmas Island.  

In any event, Gugu, that's more than enough time spent talking to you.  You can try to shoot down all of my points, but then all your left with is needing some other explanation for why certain Americans know jack about the world they are so readily willing to bomb.  So be my guest and come up with your own.

Or, try to argue the case that Americans do have a good grasp of geography.  Good luck with that.

Adios. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh good.  That's a lot of math to establish that only a third of Americans have passports.

And rules schmules.  Most American military get passports while they're at it.  Space A?  R R?  

And yes, if you ask who has a passport, no single group will be larger than recent immigrants.

And of course, those with the cash to hit the Caribbean for their 2 weeks off per year learn a lot more about geography than those who go to Mexico.

Fine, Caribbean or Mexico.  Then you're free to come back and wail about socialism and how our country will collapse if everyone has healthcare and support building a wall to keep out people from the places you just visited on your educational adventure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I don't know how old you are, but let's just say that when you're old enough to travel, don't linger where you find yourself an oddity.  That might be in the next town, the next city, the next state, somewhere on the other side of the country, or somewhere else in the world.

If you're still in high school or younger, don't be fooled by thinking you're alone in that boat.  Just endure.

In both cases, I wouldn't say I found a place where I belong.  Instead, I bumped into people along the way who were more in line with my thinking. You really have to get to know someone before they'll actually tell you how they really feel about things because they're often playing along with the same charade as you are and won't let on that they feel differently until they know it's safe to talk about.  No place is a monolith of people who all think the same.

Follow your interests.  If everyone around you is the same, go fly a kite.  Kites are cool.  Kite people are cool.  That's just an example.  Go camping.  Go swimming.  Do some photography.  Draw.  You can share hobbies with people while you look for your tribe.

Trade loneliness for patience.  It's totally OK to be alone, not something to feel guilty about.  But be proactive.  Get out there rather than dwell on it.

Imagine you're someone like you.  How is that someone going to find you if you're not out there to encounter? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, in my country, the USA, atrocities get approved through either Wall Street or the Politburo.

As for State Leaders, both entities do their best to promote state leader atrocities on certain dates.  We call them Congressional Votes.

Wall Street and the Politburo got a bit over-zealous recently and attempted to kill 24 million people with a Congressional Vote.

Thankfully, someone high up realized that them 24 million people wouldn't be able to pay taxes and deferred the plan until we can agree to one that kills a more fiscally prudent number of people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes, given that a passport lasts for ten years, the number issued in a given year tells us what about the total number?

Oh right, nothing.

Something like a third of Americans have passports.  If you look closer, a significant number of those who have passports do because they are military and need to deploy abroad.  The next biggest number are first-born immigrants who regularly traverse back to the countries they came from.

That leaves us with Joe Six Pack, and certain people love Joe Six Pack.  Why?  Because he's part of the 70% who haven't left the country.

And among this 70%, there is a serious percentage of people who, despite having never left the country, were hot-dog sure that universal healthcare, some scary socialist shit, was going to put America right in line with Lenin and Chairman Mao, this despite that every other developed country on the planet having universal healthcare.

They might actually believe that if they had passports and more than two weeks of vacation to travel somewhere other than Canada and Mexico. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "legal grounds" for a country to do much beyond trade are virtually non-existent.

The WTO allows countries to sue for trade violations that might give them unfair advantages in imports and exports.  That's because WTO countries agree to be under their arbitration and you're not automatically allowed into the WTO.  China was allowed in despite their numerous dubious practices with dumping and respect for copyright/trademark.

When a country signs a treaty, it is not in any way legally binding internationally.  A) It's simply a sign of their commitment to whatever treaty B) It sets up a legacy back in their country of adhering to the treaty.  For example, NAFTA is a treaty agreed under Bill Clinton, but he agreed to it with the support of congress.  There is no international rule that says the US will face legal attacks for backing out of it, but Trump doesn't have the power himself to simply dump it without the support of congress.  If he had that support and did, though, Mexico and Canada would not be able to pursue the US on legal grounds.

The only other recourse is the UN, but that's not a legal forum.  You can get countries to agree to sanctions and such.

North Korea already faces a wall of sanctions, so there's not much happening there, either.

Not that I'm for it, but there's nothing that prevents NK from further nuclear development.

The important element of this is multilateralism vs unilateralism.

South Korea, Japan, and to a slightly lesser extent Russia and China are NK's neighbors.

If YOUR neighbor had a bomb in his basement that could blow up a whole city block, would you like someone in another city half the world away deciding for you that we can safely eliminate this bomb without you being caught in the blast radius?

What if your friends (Japan and South Korea) don't really want you to come "fix" this situation that they've dealt with for decades?

Moreover, what if the other neighbors (China and Russia) have missiles pointed at you?

As someone who's lived in Korea, I was very antsy when Kim Jong Il was diagnosed with cancer.  Why?  Because he might just be like "Fuck it, let's do this."  When power transferred peacefully, that was a good thing.

Now, however, my concern isn't about North Korea.  It's about a 70-year-old man with an eggshell ego frustrated by his treatment in the  press and possibly facing prosecution going "Aw fuck it.  Let's do this."

Disclaimer:  You asked for serious, and I'me very serious about what I've written here.  It's not some lament about the election.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, personally, I did the first right as I was paying off student loans in 1997...and then my hogwan cheated me out of my severance pay.

I hated Korea.

Then, I came back with qualifications, got a much better job and the well-adjusted co-workers to go along with it.  I realized I didn't hate Korea as I initially thought.  My problem was with my employers.

Then, I went to the Middle East while still finishing my Master's.  I wasn't teaching anyone anything.  I was being paid to do crowd control.  This wasn't going to gel with my research about teacher observations.

So, I went back to my old job.  It's ALWAYS hard to be new at your old job, but I finished what I intended to accomplish and left Korea for maybe the last time in 2010.

1996-2010...The change in that time was astounding.  It went from no one really getting to travel to Koreans going everywhere and opening up to these foreign experiences.  The change was astoundingly good for such a short period of time.

What really changed far less was cowboy hagwons being corrupt and sketchy places to work, but that was all years behind me and had no impact on my own pleasant time there.

Mind you, Koreans are still probably the most intense, nationalistic group of people I've ever encountered.  They have a tenacity few can equal, and it's great when channeled in the right direction...

I'll leave it at that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Listen carefully.  You know those fancy kitchen sinks with spray washers built in?

For the price of a cup of coffee, you could get one of those added next to your bathroom toilet when you build a bathroom.

Now, this may sound weird, but have you ever cleaned your backside with one of those spray washers after a poo?  I thought it was weird at first, but it is INFINITELY more effective than rubbing your sphincter with some paper to clean it.  In fact, it is so much more effective that people where this is de rigeur absolutely despise coming to your country to study abroad and/or get better jobs if you can't properly kit out your toilets.

And pardon me for agreeing with them, but most of the G20 nations walk around with half-clean assholes.

And DO NOT, I repeat do not, come back with "Oh, so you want us to all have a bidet?"

A bidet is an excessively ridiculous addition to a bathroom akin to have a pre-toilet and a post-toilet.  

No no no.  Listen: sprayer hose!  Or, if you really want, I can accept the Japanese toilets with it all built in, BUT, that's still a bit gourmet compared to just having a friggin' hose/spray washer next to your toilet.

Even airports in these places have the hose there.  It's not too much to ask.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I see what you did there...

Unfortunately, it doesn't quite work because movies get remade all the time.

But let's work together to make this question work.

To be fair, you actually asked about "directors" redoing movies.  As often as we see remakes and reboots, a good director remaking another good director's movie is actually quite rare.

The best case of this happening IMHO was Terry Gilliam remaking Chris Marker's  amazing 1962 sci-fi short (before special effects) La Jetee as 12 Monkeys.

A bad example was Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho, which he shot faithfully scene-by-scene.

What we take away from this is, just like music, a successful cover has to "re-own" the original material.  You have to re-imagine it as something entirely new and absolutely depart from the original, which the corporate Hollywood remakes fail to do.

So, what director would I like to see "cover" a classic?

I'd like to see Christopher Nolan remake Citizen Kane.

Honorable mentions:

I'd like to see Quentin Tarantino remake The Five Deadly Venoms

I'd like to see Akira Kirosawa remake the Godfather set in the time of the Shogunate. 

And, just to really explore this topic, I'd like to see Clint Eastwood remake White Hunter Black Heart as a film about him directing one of his films. O.O

	<TEXT> I did three tours of duty teaching English in Korea and now find myself looking at opening a business that may involve a delivery truck.

I immediately thought of those fearless men and their machines who would move your whole apartment across town for 20,000 won with the side panels down on back and your own sofa/piano/turtle boat lashed and towering over the vehicle at any height that could pass under a bridge, all the while grinding the hell out of the gearcase to make it up that mountain of a hill in Haebongchon/Itaewon/Kyong Lee Don.

What escapes me is the brand and whether I can score one of those in the States.

They might have been Toyota, but I think they were Mitsubishi.

Any help with identifying and sourcing from the Land of the Morning Blue Trucks would be most appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that it's a vast cumbersome system that doesn't work over night.  My primary issue, which I see again and again, is pointing to Watergate as some kind of estimate for how long this should take.  

Watergate and this current situation are apples and oranges aside from having a president in peril.  I'd note also that there were convictions long before Nixon went down.  Unlike Liddy and Hunt, we have people who have very likely committed perjury who are still governing in key positions and serving the White House.  That doesn't even require congressional committee investigations to prosecute, and that needs to be pursued posthaste. And, if the rationale is that the GOP can block these prosecutions, then they need to be pushed so that the GOP is on record as blocking these prosecutions.

They key difference between this and Watergate is that Watergate involved White House recordings that Nixon could not destroy, and half the prolonged legal battle was Nixon's effort to prevent the release of those recordings.  Under the current circumstances, everybody knows this investigation is happening, it is far easier to try to destroy evidence, and without White House recordings it's also far easier to coordinate a defense by allowing the defendants time to strategize.

Of course, none of us know what the FBI has, not to mention that the FBI in Watergate made great efforts to help Nixon.  The point is that I find it hard to believe that the FBI needs more time to investigate anything.  When the undercover element has been blown, you don't get much more than what you have.

Which brings us to the congressional investigation.  I don't really get what they have to "investigate" or how much time they need to investigate it.  So far, what they've needed time for was Nunes to try and derail the whole process and/or create a distraction.  If they had serious issues that demanded further investigation, they could take a load off by appointing a special prosecutor.  Instead, we have Republicans who aren't terribly interested in this going forward while they pass legislation and Democrats who, while they might be the closest thing to representing my politics in DC, have a long history of timidly not rocking the boat because they want to appear centrist.

So, on one hand you may have people expecting this to play out "like a TV drama", but on the other hand, you have people saying "just be patient" when I'm not so sure patience is actually on the side of those who want this to move forward.

Generals have a common flaw of treating a new war like it was the last war.  Patience was a winning strategy in the case of Watergate, but I'm not sure at all that patience is helpful right now.

	<TEXT> I like how this has been repeated so often that it's now true.

As if there's some standard measure of time for a political corruption investigation.

Watergate lasted as long as it needed to.

The Starr investigation lasted as long as it needed to- 3 years for real estate investigations, then morphed into a completely different investigation that lasted little more than half a year.

I'm sure Bill would've loved to have played the "normal investigations last years" card and faced impeachment after his term was complete.

So, not that I know how long this will last, but the "takes years" bandwagon is basing their claim on very floopsy-flopsy reasoning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the Judiciary, by design, is meant to interpret law as it sees fit.  Whatever right-wing news source's bleating about activist judges has misled you.  Its independence is a critical aspect of the separations of power, and the Constitution empowers it to make rulings about what's constitutional and unconstitutional.  So, finger-pointing at the judicial branch of government doesn't cut the mustard, Mister.

Trump just attacked the Constitutional system of checks and balances, a system he apparently didn't know existed until around January 22nd of this year.  Comparatively, a group of highly intelligent people in the late 1700s foresaw the rise of a power-mongering turnip just like the one we have now and created the system of checks and balances specifically with this dictator-wannabe bullshit in mind.  

You wanna know what's really archaic?  It's not the Constitution.
  
It's expecting to be a monarch when you're elected president. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly.  The only reason they might appear extremely liberal is because of the paleoconservatives on the right.

This narrative of both parties becoming more extreme is a repetition of platitudes held over from some nostalgic but wholly untrue idea that the US population used to be unified before it suddenly became divided in the past decade.

Or, it's extreme if you think allowing same-sex marriage is extreme.  And if you're in that camp, you would've thought that letting black and white kids attend the same school was extreme back in another era (one of those mythical eras where everyone was unified).

Look no further than the G8 countries.  The only one that can out-conservative us is Russia, a de facto dictatorship.  You might say Japan is more conservative on certain issues, but the majority of the  G8 have political leadership that makes the US Democrat party look like middle-center if not slightly to the right.  Our liberals still wage war and carry out drone assassinations with a little more vim and vigor than our other G8 liberal parties, no?

I'll finish by saying that single-payer healthcare is neither socialist nor is it extreme.  Look at this:

https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/06/heres-a-map-of-the-countries-that-provide-universal-health-care-americas-still-not-on-it/259153/

You wouldn't think it possible, but Saudi Arabia is more progressive than the US.  And why is that?  It's because the true extremist party in America, the Republican Party, is holding our country back with outmoded thinking from the 20th century that is now long past its expiration date.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> April 2017: Best and Worst 1000 cert purchases </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-28 15:55:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not as a new player, but as someone certing multiple toons, the 1k improvements are a bit of a blur compared to my first character (and now I wonder where the hell I got the certs to blow on all of that stuff the first time around).

So I ask what things you would prioritize as worth spending 1000 or around that on and what you should really leave as last.

Sorry if this has already come up as a topic, but my searches end up with info from 2013 or 2014.

And I'll offer a few ideas just to get things started.

NOTE: I'm trying to prioritize cert purchases and not DBC

1. C4-especially for medic who is otherwise gimped on offense against vehicles, gun emplacements, etc...

2. MAX weapons- Call me crazy, but it's kinda handy to do a bio-lab with default AI/AV, but specialized is better

3. The best weapons for MBT

4.  Maxing out rep for sunderers and engy ammo packs

5.  MAX kinetic armor

6. Having all engy turrets

7. Hover specs on air vehicles

Not worth it:

1. Maneuverability chassis 

2. Certain HEAT weapons that have been nerfed

3. Any and all class slots that are taken by something you plan to use a lot across builds/scenarios.

I'm really throwing my ideas out there just to generate discussion, so if I said something idiotic, I'm open to listening to those with more experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a secret:  Be proud of yourself in the same way you are of your family.

Do you ever walk around telling people your family is better than their families?  Good.  Don't.

Here's the history of our country:  White people didn't walk around keeping that to themselves.  They inflicted it upon others, especially blacks but they truly didn't discriminate terribly in who they discriminated against.  They inflicted it upon minorities far and wide.  I'm white, and this is no secret.

Now, certain other white Americans are offended by this.  They label it "white guilt".  Are you truly meant to feel responsible or guilty for our country's undeniable racist past?  Maybe neither "responsible" nor "guilty" are the right words.  What you should feel is ashamed at what happened and not want it to ever happen again.

Is this a unique situation, and does it only apply to white people?  No.  Modern Germany is a proud example of how a people have risen above their past but not forgotten what happened.  There are numerous other places and countries who have dealt with this less admirably.   Russia (vs their own Jewish population), Turkey (vs Armenians), and Japan (vs the Chinese and Koreans) are all prominent examples of countries with issues of national shame that they have yet to put behind them.  This doesn't even start to touch on unresolved issues in the Middle East and Africa.

The key here is resolved v unresolved issues.  Freeing black slaves still left them at a profound economic disadvantage, and their full freedom would not be attained until 100 years after they were "freed" and only 50 years before now.  And, we didn't magically start affording these people their rights one day in the 1960s.  On the contrary, it was a long, deadly, and painful campaign that the Civil Rights Movement eventually won.  And here is another undeniable truth: it was a campaign against white bigots.  Citizens, companies, and government.  Our country now officially and unofficially looks back at this in shame, as we should.

Now, as we collectively look back at this horrendously bigoted era in shame, does that mean you should feel guilty for being white?  The answer is no, provided it doesn't happen again.  Germans (aside from their despicable neo-nazi contingent) are still proud Germans who have many things to be rightly proud of both before and after the Nazis.  Does that mean they are no longer ashamed of the Nazis? No.  And so it's perfectly Ok for you to have your own personal pride in your ethnicity without that conflicting with also  being ashamed of our long racist past.  It's perfectly natural to do so.

The problem occurs among those who want to paint ethnicity as a binary either/or proposition.  You're either a proud white person who  ignores the racist history and demands to be free of what they term "guilt".  There's another flavor of this where they accept the racism but insist that ethnicities cannot and should not live together, which is another silly concept right out of the Dark Ages.  Then, I guess there's just an angry set who are angry that people say anything bad about white people and have no clue about history or much of anything.

Finally, we have the Whataboutists whipping themselves into a froth because these other ethnicities assert their own ethnic pride and feel that is unfair.  It will become unfair when the other ethnicities enslave whites, tell them to drink at their own drinking fountains, and refuse to hire white people because of their skin color.

And you do have the right in our country to contest your not being hired if you think the reason is that you are white.  That's a pretty rare situation in a country where it's still far more likely to be the other way around.

To get back to your question, it's not blasphemous to be proud of being white.  Still, those who would call it blasphemy typically have a lot more baggage than just that. 

I'd love to see a white pride parade that's about...I dunno, the Simpsons, the Office, and indie rock...than about bigotry in one of its 38 flavors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Open v narrow-mindedness

My parents had their reasons for certain attitudes, but I never faced the situations they faced.

That's the only way I excuse their positions on people of different colors, faiths, and lifestyles.  I cannot accept these same excuses for me.

Mine was the first generation to attend college.  That was a difference, but they only saw it in terms of jobs.  What had really happened is that I was homophobic and untraveled at the start, and by graduation I had been to other countries and had at least one friend come out.

They sacrificed greatly for me to have experiences they will never have.

I'm grateful, but I'm far beyond trying to persuade them that these "others" do not deserve the disrespect and contempt they offer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, and this is the end of your gambit here.

Are you really in this situation or not?

If you're not in this situation, then stop this whole thing.

If you are, go talk to a lawyer.  Tell them your situation and that you have weed that was forced upon you and that you want to go to the police.

Seriously, find a public defender and tell them the situation.

Likewise, if this is a serious situation, you probably need to leave the area where you live and start anew. If you have a degree in English, move somewhere else far way and write ad copy until you find a better gig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Too often crap, but there are those moments where I:

-try something knew

-learn something new

-do something creative

-read something and finish reading it

-strategize about what to do next

-do something nice for others

-try something new

Honestly, I'm a bit of a loner.  I'm happy to do things with other people, but I'm not sure there's any good reason for anyone to be bored.

And I'm also not shy about pushing myself along with a little motivation:

FFS, imagine you were born in the Dark Ages.  Do you know about the Dark Ages and understand what they were?

For a thousand years, people tilled the soil, farming for their subsistence food and dying without modern medicine by the time they were 40.

I'm SO HAPPY I'm not living in hovel farming my next meal and hoping I make it through the winter.

Now, those people in the Dark Ages might have had all kinds of fantastic ideas about free time, but they had to spend their free time just surviving.

We have it sooooooo good.  Any waaaaaaaa about boredom should result in you being transported back through time so that you can grow some turnips and not have to worry about things like boredom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a big difference between "do" v "behave".

In terms of do, children can teach a lot of adults about almost everything.

-Run around!

-Make stuff!

-Imagine stuff!

Personally, I doodle.  I didn't really do it so much when I was a kid, but it draws focus onto to something else other than all that other stuff.  People often frame meditation as something taught to you by a guru, but honestly I think 99% of adults meditate in one way or another without calling it meditation.

And then there's behave, which I still feel the need to mention.  Adults ARE children, just older children.  I'll restrict myself to three childish behaviors that I see commonly among adults:

-Take care of me

-But I don't want to do my chores

-X is bad because I'm good and I don't like it. Period </TEXT>
