	<TEXT> This guy is completely biased. He even supports Hezbollah's killing of civilians. 

But even with that, he has is also anti-BDS, supports Israel's right to exist, and supports a two state solution, like Bernie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They don't even like the US

This is not true. The US is the biggest ally of Israel.

even though we send em shitloads of money every year.

Yeah this money is 100% used to buy weapons from the US. Is not a gift, is a loan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are saying it is propaganda? Bernie Sanders said it directly to Al Jazeera, which is very anti-Israel.

JPost is just repeating what he said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good interview. Even better considering that it is from Al Jazeera. Bernie handed it pretty good. It is great that Bernie is coming against the blatant anti-Israel agenda at the UN. Just look at the UN resolutions in 2016. [UN adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and just 3 to the rest of the word, combined. ](https://www.unwatch.org/unga-adopts-20-resolutions-israel-4-rest-world-combined/)

But Bernie should have clarified better why he is against BDS. He should have said that [BDS actually hurts the palestians more and it's completely counterproductive.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/carriesheffield/2015/02/22/boycott-israel-movement-stunts-the-palestinian-economy/#6726043d1648) 

**In 2012, Palestinian sales to Israel accounted for about 81% of Palestinian export**s and less than a percentage point of Israeli GDP. Palestinian purchases from Israel were two-thirds of total Palestinian imports (or 27% of Palestinian GDP).

Despite overheated BDS rhetoric about exploitation, last year the Palestinian Authoritys official newspaper hailed working conditions for Palestinians employed by Israelis in West Bank settlements. It also scolded Palestinians hiring other Palestinians for low wages with no benefits.

	<TEXT>  They're still Israelis who's army is in Palestine

This is nonsense. 

If you are a citizen of a country and you support another country to kill your own fellow or are even part of that group, is nothing more than treason. 

You're right it isn't terrorism 

I never said that. They are 100% terrorists. 

You're right it isn't terrorism because they don't have political reasons, they have military reasons which makes them guerrillas or resistance fighters.


This is nonsense because you can't have military reasons without political reasons. Face the facts, they are a bunch of racist terrorists.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not true.

Ultra-orthodox Jews aren't and they still get stabbed.

the far left Jews desert and they still get stabbed.

The arabs, yes because there are over a million arabs living in Israel, aren't obliged to join the army and, surprisingly, they don't get stabbed. 

This is because those terrorist does't do it for political reasons. They are just racist. The Israeli-arabs are 100% Israeli and they don't suffer from terrorist attacks.
