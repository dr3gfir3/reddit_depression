	<TEXT> Hello all, new to the sub (and ratties in general!)

I heard about these lovely little creatures online at one time and they just seemed lovely, so recently I bought two little Siamese girlies at 6 weeks old. I've had them for a week or so, they have a comfy little cage with a hammock and old tshirts, plenty of things to crawl on, and I try my best to give them some time out of the cage every day for at least 20-30 minutes (I'm still a student so sadly I'm on a very tight schedule!) 

So far, from what I've read about rattie behaviour and telltale emotional cues, they seem to be settling in really well. One of my girls, Amy, was so curious that even only a day after I got her she was already crawling up and down my arm, exploring my shoulders, and sniffing my fingers! My other girl, Maize, is a little more shy, but I've discovered her weak spot is cheek rubs - she goes into full bliss mode, no matter what shes doing :P
I have taken them both onto my bed on a few occasions to let them get used to me and my scent, and to reassure them I am not a big scary hairless monster, but a friend, and they took to that really well - they trotted around exploring my mattress, crawling under my laundry and looking like they were having a good time; they actually both fell asleep snuggled up either just next to my cheek or under some clothes, which I found adorable!

I have a concern though. While my girls do like to sniff and lick my fingers, and in Amy's case crawl up on my shoulder and sit there or wander left to right, some of their behavior really confuses me. For example, however happy they are to sniff and lick my hand, if I make even a slight sudden move, they will freeze up and jolt backwards. Even putting my hand into the cage too fast could scare them :(. Another thing that I only discovered a few days ago was that when Amy comes to mess around on my shoulders, she sometimes stops and bruxes, and since she's moving around so much and sticking her lovely little snoot in every which way I have no idea whether its stress or contentment! 
And another thing, whenever I walk into the room, they tend to just stay absolutely still where they are and not run up to the bars like I've heard happy ratties do. They do let me pet them quite a bit though and although I have never heard bruxing, they seemed not to mind.
How long will it take for these girlies to get used to me and my hooman movements? I want them to be the happiest little ratties in the world, and I'd hate to think my picking them up for one on one time or letting Amy crawl up my shoulder and then presume she wants to stay there makes them unhappy. :(

Thanks!

*PS. I can provide pictures at request, they're a lovely pair :)* </TEXT>
