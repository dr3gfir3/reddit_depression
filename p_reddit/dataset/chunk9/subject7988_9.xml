	<TEXT> "true terror is to wake up one morning and discover that your high school class is running the country". Any quote from any novel of any genre will work! I'm just looking for a relevant one to starting real life with all my friends and achieving the dreams we had of since we were all little. It is also crazy that these people I have seen do incredibly stupid things are now in important positions so that's why I choose my quote. Mainly trying to avoid "life laugh love" and the other trite quotes you hear all the time! Also what novel it is from wouls be nice to know. Thank you in advance for any of your suggestions! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is true but it seems a lot of Tesla investors don't think other companies are competing and beating Tesla at their own game. For example, Ford has sold 560,000 electric cars since it began making them in 2005. Tesla has sold 186,000 electric cars since it started in 2008. </TEXT>
