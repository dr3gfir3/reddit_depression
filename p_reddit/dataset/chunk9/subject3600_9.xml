	<TEXT> Its Christmas Eve and Im hiding under the stairs in my own home because my idiot uncle invoked the spirit of Krampus.

Oh god, another Krampus story. Yeah, yeah, I know.

But theres something stomping around the house, and Im stuck in a cabinet like Harry Potter, writing this on my phone with the brightness setting all the way down.

I dont even really know how he managed it. I mean one second it was racist politics, the next, demon-beast-goat-monster breaking down the door and everyone screaming. And I think there were some little minion kids, too, but with the way the gravy and duck were flying through the air and all broken door bits, one cant really be sure. The maniacal cackling makes me think I definitely saw evil helpers, though.

Aunt Brenda made it to the bathroom, and she was screeching about 911, cell phone in her grip, so maybe help is coming. Maybe she managed it.

Shit...Im not breathing, something is just outside the door.

In case I dont make it, learn from our mistake. Whatever you do, dont talk politics at the Christmas table this year.
