	<TITLE> Macro vba help: getting certain rows of data from a data table, into another excel sheet </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Basics: (I'll post a pic to clarify)
1) I have a large data table dealing Materials on one sheet. Each Material has several components (number varies) for each Material. Each component having data related to it (price, weight etc).

2) I'm trying to create a code that allows a user to put an 'x' or something on this Material sheet, then go to the Form sheet, and click a macro button. This then fills out the Form's appropriate spots with info from the Material sheet. 

3) Had a vlookup set up for a simpler version of this. But this one has multiple components/rows for each Material (thus one 'x' would only look for a row).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Crap I wasn't clear. So column B is like Color, Taste, Size etc. Them in column C is the values that vlookup is bringing from another sheet. I've literally typed in N/A for cells that don't have a value. 

So that's what I meant by 'hey aren't we targeting cells with a value of N/A' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool!

And since I'm trying to get rid of rows with N/A in a cell, should that be what I'm calling it in the macro? 

So that line of code saying Application.WorksheetFunction.IsNA shouldnt it read Application.WorksheetFunction.IsN/A? 

Or is NA in vba = N/A in a cell </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Viper bro thanks a bunch! Modular chunks   'libraries' for sure is a solid idea. 

One last request, how could I tweak it to actually only apply for a cetain range on said sheet. It's only one chunk of rows that needs the n/a deleting function.

Also, should the application.worksheetfunction.isNA be N/A? </TEXT>
