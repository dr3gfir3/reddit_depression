As an aside, a lot of the time when users get frustrated at our policies, it occurs when they haven't bothered to message us.  We don't catch every reference in threads, and we're actually pretty open to ideas.  As long as they're sent to us via the mechanism reddit has provided for exactly that purpose: modmail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep.  There are *many* instances in which the US and states, by [statute](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity_in_the_United_States), have waived sovereign immunity, and individual actions can be reached via the stripping doctrine.  Additionally, counties and municipalities, including administrative agencies, are not protected by the doctrine.

Further, as it's an affirmative defense whose applicability must be shown by the defendant, no attorney worth the license ever would let the doctrine serve as a reason not to add the US or a state as a defendant.  Mostly it's a concept that law students bring up when they don't understand trial practice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This also helps explain why Christianity may have flourished in authoritarian societies: you should separate yourself from the world--not only because as a typical person you're powerless to change it, but also because you shouldn't try, except by smaller, relatively nonpolitical acts such as kindness, witness, and sacrifice, which don't directly threaten the status quo at all. 

And why Christians could be persecuted when the sheer volume/nature of their beliefs proliferate, to the point where they threaten the established powers.  

And why, when demagogues of a certain flavor arise, Christians support them, because instead of offering choices, they simply demand, and notwithstanding their personal foibles (sexism/racism/greed), because who should cast the first stone?

This is the subtext of [Matthew 22:21](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A20-22 version=KJV), right?  Let the powerful do what they will--obey them, give to them, render to them--because your treasure is in heaven.

It's  powerfully nuanced interaction.  Which gives rise to good and evil, but as a Christian who believes in authority you're almost forced to think that the evil comes from an "other", and if it's not the figure of authority, it must be an evil/outside force (Satan, or maybe liberals, which must by definition be influenced by Satan).  

It certainly can't come from your capitulation, as you call that *salvation*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/02/01/how-your-parenting-style-predicts-whether-you-support-donald-trump/?utm_term=.92623f8b5206) suggests that you're considering the issue the wrong way.  I.e., it's not about rationality at all, but about one's views on authority.

It's easy to see why authoritarianism would allow a person to reconcile both positions-- sexual abstinence outside of lawful marriage and a respect for the laws governing immigration.  So to people who support specific approaches to sex and against illegal immigration, their positions aren't inconsistent at all: they respect authority.

Unfortunately, it seems, they do this even when authority doesn't deserve it, or when their approaches cause inconsistencies in other areas.  My guess is that they view the inconsistencies not as signs that the authority is wrong, but that they themselves either are weak (sinful) or simply don't understand all the intricacies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one can answer this except you.  But what I can tell you, apparently from the other side of life, is that very few can predict the paths of their lives, and the measure of a man is not whether he has made mistakes, but what he does once he has.  You will define yourself as much by what you don't do as what you will.

There is no right or wrong answer except this: in your circumstances, assuming you live to it, in 14 years you will be 14 years older, regardless of whether you stay in school.  So the real question is: in 14 years, what will you wish you had done?

If you can't answer that, certainly no one else can.

I wish you well. </TEXT>

The problem here is not Trump.  It's the GOP-controlled Congress which is enabling him by not only doing nothing to stop him, but actually adopting some of his more anti-democratic ideas. 

History will judge Trump to be a nut.  But it will judge the GOP as wrongdoers. </TEXT>

Either you believe that 61% of the U.S. is "liberal", clearly demonstrating that the right-wing isn't the dominant demographic, or it's a lot more than *this subreddit/huffpo/vox/motherjones* that's freaking out about Trump.

Or of course with no evidence whatsoever you could claim that the poll is "fake".  But that would suggest you yourself are caught up in a bias.  Sad!

	<TEXT> Given Trump's fragile ego, I wouldn't be surprised if, after enough bad news and accusations have built up, he simply resigns.  If his Presidency continues, I don't see *any* time in which he won't bring these kinds of threats upon himself.

Consider: he's wrecked his brand, exposed himself as a fraud and liar, and is the most disliked President in the history of the U.S.--all within the first 3 weeks.

If he doesn't resign, at some point the GOP is sure finally to have had enough of this incompetent demagogue.  They'll milk him for everything they can in the meantime.  But if enough hostile town halls occur, they'll start to worry that he's wrecking *their* brand.  And that'll be that.

	<TEXT> Thing is, take a look at [the first bill](http://www.vox.com/2017/2/14/14617312/trump-transparency-oil) he's signed.  It doesn't help *us*.  It helps oil companies.  Of course he'll sell it as *cutting back regulations*.  But sometimes regulation is good, particularly when it limits unfettered capitalism from harming the greater good.

But, you know, given what you've said about yourself, how you present yourself, more important to me than Trump or whoever is how you can learn to view and consider what politicians say.

Main thing, going forward, over the next 30 years or so, try to consider why politicians are telling you things, who's paying their way into office, who stands to benefit.  Not from what they say, but from what they do.  Get past the puffery and look at what's real, what's happening.  Test/question everything--particularly the things that might seem most sensible to you; try as little as possible to take fixed positions on anything.

The reality in the US is that the influence of money on campaigns has corrupted our system, and SCOTUS has disrupted every attempt, no matter how minimal, to limit it.  So we face an ever-increasing imbalance as our so-called leaders rely on us for votes but big money from multinationals to advertise to us.

Question becomes: who do they really represent?  We're stuck with bad choices.  But above all, don't let politicians lie to you.  Seek always the truth, even if it contradicts your biases (which of course means you have to become aware of them).  Politics is no time for tribalism--which is counterintuitive, because that's *exactly* when so many these days say it is time.

Cheers, kiddo.  (And I mean that affectionately, coming from the other side of life.) </TEXT>

And, of course, unlike with Russia's interference with the election, there's no evidence whatsoever that Hilary encouraged any tampering.  And it is striking that the same Congress which became so apoplectic about the email server is almost dead-silent about this issue.  

Remember, though: I couldn't care less about R/L or partisan BS.  So please don't think I'm apologizing for Hilary.  Those people *all* are using us to their advantage.  I'm just trying to see what's real and what's not.  I understand you may disagree.  More power to you. </TEXT>

And they trust opinions which confirm their own because at least they've got something to base that on--their own subjective experiences.

What's bad is the many people willing to take advantage of our fundamental desire to trust.  They use it against us for their own purposes, because they know tribalism is the quickest way to build a supportive audience.

This is the power of propaganda, the power of the demagogue.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my perspective, *none* of these people are our guys.  They're all wealthier than we are--some born to money--and not a one of them can have any idea what it's like to scrape from paycheck to paycheck, worrying about student loans, car payments, health insurance (remember--Congress gets better than we get--*for free*) or any of the many other things normal people worry about.  This isn't to say that we shouldn't support people who *show* they actually support our values.  But lip service doesn't count.

And I didn't see how Hilary, Trump, or most of the other people who were running for President did.  And I still don't see how Trump does.  

And I don't see how the majority of Congress does, because any majority that refuses to investigate what's going on with this guy is risking the health of the U.S. for its own political gain.  Which is not why they were voted into office.

I'm not anti-Trump nearly as much as I'm anti-liar, anti-hypocrite, anti-person willing to sacrifice a nation's wellbeing for inscrutable purposes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I'm at work so I don't have time to provide the sources for what I'm about to say.  Apologies in advance for that.  Also, I'm guessing that you'll disagree with pretty much everything I'm about to say.  That's okay; I'm not trying to convince you of anything; I'm just going to try to answer your question.  

I respect that you have a position, but I see no purpose in arguing about any of this, because as far as I know, neither you or I have any idea of what's actually transpired.  However, as you seem to be trying to figure out why someone might come to a conclusion which seems so opposite of yours, I'll give it a try.

Also, though, please understand that I didn't think either candidate was particularly good, and I wasn't a fan of Obama, particularly, so this is not a L/R thing for me at all.  Instead, I believe in the concept of civics as represented best by bipartisan agreement instead of attack.  Party over country is to me a disgraceful concept.  This means I've been dismayed by U.S. politics for some 30+ years.

All of that said, I have been deeply alarmed by Trump's attacks via Twitter on pretty much anyone who disagrees with him, his constant misrepresentation of facts, no matter how trivial, his obvious reversals on many of his campaign promises, including, most specifically, his appointments of numerous people connected to Wall Street when he expressly negatively characterized Hilary as being beholden to Wall Street, his perpetual attacks on the integrity of the judiciary and the very security apparatus which informs his office, his propensity to try to learn about the world from TV and not from experts, his apparent desire to leverage his position for personal gain at the expense of the Constitution, his apparently illegal appointment of Bannon onto the Security Counsel....I could go on.  

But I've yet to see anything whatsoever suggesting that Trump is behaving presidentially--that he even understands what it means.  I say this because if he did have that understanding, he would recognize that the words he says as President are more important than the words you or I might say; they have a global effect.  And a person who simply wants to destroy, without any regard for the intricacy of the world order which has been built up over decades, is, frankly, scary.  Because a lot of very smart people have developed this system, and so far it's kept us from destroying ourselves, which very much is within the realm of our capabilities.

Additionally, however, to answer your question, I've read many of the same reports I'm guessing/hoping you have, regarding the reports that Russia was involved in the campaign, the Rosneft transaction, the reports of Trump's interactions with Putin, his denials of said interactions, his comments suggesting that the U.S. is as bad as Russia, his efforts to convince Abe to accommodate Putin, the reports from Kushner's own paper suggesting that the CIA no longer wants to advise Trump as to security matters due to their concern that he has been compromised, and the suggestions that the only reason a rational person would behave the way he has is if he is being blackmailed or is in cahoots.  

Further, to me there seems to be zero-percent chance that anything Flynn said when he discussed the sanctions hadn't been approved by Trump.  He is, in his resignation, falling on his sword on behalf of his failed attempt to see to the President's agenda.

All of the above suggests to me that at the very least there are significant questions as to why Trump has presented himself the way he has with respect to Russia--and as many others have come to believe, the only rational explanation seems to be that Putin has something on him.  That's how Putin operates.

There's simply too much at stake for the health of this nation to ignore the possibility that he's been compromised by a foreign power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My question would be: why do you think you even need an opinion on this issue if you're not gay?  God will be the judge of all of us--not you or anyone else.  You get what I'm saying?  Worry about your own sins.

(Understand I'm not attacking you.)

I think we get too caught up in concerning ourselves about what others are doing; we will not be judged on others' lives, but on our own.  This was one of the primary lessons in that great story beginning at [John 8:3](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=john+8%3A3-10 version=KJV).

Too often we think we need answers to every question.  Faith is not a textbook.  

Maybe it's a function of age that I no longer think I need the answer to everything.  Or maybe it's just a recognition of my own fallibility.  But there is enough in the day simply trying to live my own life without worrying about other people's.

I've found that [the first and great commandment and the second](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+22%3A35-40 version=KJV) leave no room for anything else. </TEXT>

He's also receiving [payments from foreign governments](https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2017/01/26/trump-is-getting-payments-from-foreign-governments-we-have-no-idea-what-they-are/)--and there is strong indication that he excluded numerous Arabic countries from his ban [specifically because he has business interests in them](http://www.forbes.com/sites/datadesign/2017/02/01/mapping-president-trumps-travel-ban-vs-his-business-interests-in-muslim-countries/#7b9363b52fb0).  Further, if his involvement with Putin and Rosneft is correct, he's committed treason.  At the very least, all of that suggests conflicts of interest which may demonstrate his lack of qualification for the office.  In that regard, fascinating that he's gotten rid of most of the people who would've been experienced enough to know how to investigate him.

Nice discussion of impeachable offenses [here](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/1999/02/what_are_high_crimes_and_misdemeanors.html).

In any event, I appreciate your opinion and don't want to argue about it.  I understand you may disagree.  For the sake of the U.S., if you do, I hope you're right.  Would be interesting to see if we could revisit all of this in 3 years and see.  But like I say I wouldn't want to be right.

	<TEXT> Trump has committed enough offenses already to be impeached.  Shame on the GOP-controlled Congress for being complicit in them. </TEXT>
