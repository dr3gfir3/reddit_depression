	<TEXT> I think the big lessons are (in no specific order) 1. You need to listen to both sides of a debate before picking a side. Even when you pick a side you need to not be dogmatic. 2. Pay attention to current events and don't think you are protected from everything because you are financially secure. 3. Time doesn't care about you. It continues on whether you like it or not. 4. Death is inevitable and sometimes it takes you almost dying (or being sick)to really appreciate life. Also one thing I liked was that Mann didn't pick a side when it comes to whether you should care more about the material world or the spiritual world- you have to make your own decision.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is my favorite Fitzgerald novel. It isn't like Gatsby. It is a little like The Beautiful and Damned. It is a bildungsroman. I think reading TSOP will make you want to try The Beautiful and Damned again. I feel like Fitzgerald's novels because they are so autobiographical that you need to read them in order of publication to get a good feel for him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I am looking for some non-canon political science/political philosophy books. I know most of the main stream or canon ones (Plato, Aristotle, Huntington, etc.), but I was wondering if anyone knew any others? Thanks ahead of time    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to start reading some pre-1900's American Classics (preferably novels, but poetry and short story collections are cool too). Any Recommendations?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! It was amazing. A well written historical introduction to existentialism. I recommend you get it and take notes on the Philosophy of each person because it comes up again throughout the book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Illustrated Man by Ray Bradbury
The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury
J.D. Salinger's are great (I think they should be read once and then read again after reading all 3 story books)
The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien (not exactly a short story collection, more of a novel comprised of individual stories)
Will You Please be Quiet, Please? By Raymond Carver (he is a god of short stories)
Flannery O'Connor is good from what I hear

I would not recommend David Foster Wallace's short stories (his essays are better) 
Also would not recommend Winesburg, Ohio by Sherwood Anderson (imo they are boring)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say that you are on the right track with The Aeneid and Metamorphoses. I would also add Dante's Divine Comedy and The Bible as essential prerequisites. Maybe even Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. You need to read The Odyssey and The Iliad to understand The Aeneid. And you need to read The Aeneid and The Bible to understand The Divine Comedy. You could also just dive in. The footnotes for Paradise Lost should help explain the influences.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel you struggle man. I have ADHD as well. Reading actually calms me down and allows me to not zone out as much. But what I would say helps (besides medicine) is reading for 30 minutes and every time you think a thought that you know you are going to zone out on, write it down and get back to reading. After the 30 minutes, look up or do what is on that list for 10 minutes. Then go back to reading. It works with the ADHD instead of against it. Hope this helps </TEXT>
