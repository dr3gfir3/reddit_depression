	<TEXT> Thank you, I think the med school itself is something I can handle when I'm not constantly overwhelmed with mental health issues. When I get my brain back in order hopefully I'll do fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, I have been diagnosed with OCD and other related anxiety issues, as well as depression. I've been bad at going to my therapist for the last few months (you have to call them every time to schedule an appointment. Who thought that was a good idea when a lot of the people who are supposed to be calling have severe social anxiety?). I know I should be going back though. Gonna book myself an appointment as soon as I can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I've always been the kid who was pretty above average at all the different creative outlets but wasn't really the best at any one of them. I don't have a "thing" that I stuck to and eventually it did make me feel like I didn't have a purpose. I think slowly adding one of them back at a time would be really good for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the suggestion. Meds used to be a great option for getting through but losing my insurance recently it's been a little difficult to justify paying 200 a month when rent is still on the table :/ A part of my getting better is also getting my financial situation figured out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad that worked for you, man. I used to have a lot of hobbies- art, played four instruments, tennis. Now I really haven't been doing much of any of them. Probably should pick em back up again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a first year at johns hopkins, even more stressful since everyone around me has all their shit together and humble brags all the time. I think trying to not compare myself with other people is a really important step in getting better </TEXT>
