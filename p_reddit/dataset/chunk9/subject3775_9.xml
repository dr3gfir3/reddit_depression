	<TEXT> So the article seems to be trying to debunk the theory that aboriginal populations were responsible for the extinction of megafauna. They spend most of the time trying to date when the extinctions occurred vs when aboriginals arrived on the continent, concluding that they coexisted for 17,000 years. Yet the article contains an item which would appear to explain this, while still holding the aboriginals responsible.  

It seems that Aboriginal populations may not have been that large until much later in prehistory. Our genomic research has revealed that significant demographic changes did not occur until some 10,000 years ago. The genomic evidence suggests that for tens of thousands of years, Aboriginal populations were not that large.   

If the native population remained small, perhaps due to fairly capable predators, maybe also due to lack of effective hunting technologies, perhaps this is what allowed coexistence. Perhaps too aboriginals finally prospered and grew numerous to hunt the megafauna into extinction once they developed appropriate hunting technologies, many thousands of years after first arriving.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are books that have been written about the Nazi psyops operations in France prewar. Here's a brief mention on a page devoted to psychological warfare  

http://survinat.com/2012/04/psychological-operations-during-the-second-world/

During the fighting in the West Germans acted very quickly and quite ingenious. The psychological impact on the enemy, they used everything: favorable for itself so-cal environment, and raising slogans of the enemy, and the natural tendency of people to stay alive, to tell of their fate the family and friends (see leaflets in Fig. 36-38) .

His biggest success of German propaganda had made in 1940, during the occupation of France. In the months before the invasion of France advocates Goebbels began to actively use the so-called "black" transmitters that masqueraded as French radio. They spread all sorts of rumors were subjected to fierce criticism of the French government, sowing uncertainty and panic among the people and the military. As a result, by the time a decisive attack German troops morale of the personnel of the French Army has been so eroded that it was not able to have a serious resistance to the invaders

Much of the coverage of the "Fake News" is glossing over exactly what it means, but there are some articles describing it.  
http://www.businessinsider.com/russia-undermine-west-democracies-2016-10

Discussion of the russian troll army has kind of died down, but much of it is documented in wikipedia. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_brigades  

Anybody who has posted on reddit pointing out russian actions in moving public opinion can see that there are well organized responses and negative voting on reddit. If you don't think that impacts people's opinions, you're kidding yourself </TEXT>

The Russian manipulation of the US Election wasn't just hacking the DNC. They've been engaged in a media and viral internet campaign for years, creating the divisions and anxieties in western societies. In short, a psychological operation targeting the value norms of the US population to make election of someone like Donald Trump possible.  France is no less vulnerable. There is evidence that a similar campaign is ongoing. It is similar to the Psyops that the Nazis ran against France sapping their faith in the government and military prior to the Nazi attack.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of your commuting regions seemed arbitrarily large, incorporating several major commuting central cities in large regions whereas in other areas you have small distinct commuting zones. Examples of both.  

a) Arbitrarily large - in the /r/DataIsBeautiful rendering of your map, the area labeled Central Florida on the map linked in this post was labeled "Tampa". This appeared to incorporate extended commuting for Tampa/St Pete, Orlando, Florida Space Coast, Ocala/Gainesville, and Lake City into a single region.  There are very definitely multiple central draws in this mega region with Tampa/St Pete and Orlando being major centers. Regional centers like Ocala, Gainesville, and Lake City would all be fairly small, and one could argue combining them into a single entity. However, I have to question why you would combine all of these areas into a mega region. Clearly no one is commuting from the far edges of this region to the major centers -- e.g. nobody commutes from Lake City to Orlando or Tampa/St Pete.  Similarly, nobody commutes from the Space Coast to Lake City or Gainesville. What was your criteria for the aggregation instead segregation into multiple overlapping centers?  

A similar argument can be made for other very large regions like the New Orleans and Delta Region. Florida Panhandle commuting can be drawn to Mobile, Pensacola or military complexes further east at Fort Walton/Panama City. New Orleans has its own draw, spilling into both coastal Louisiana and Mississipi.  Jackson and Memphis are each regional commuting centers

b) Multiple Distinct - your linked map has this combined in the Columbia plateau region, but the colored map on data is beautiful actually had multiple small regions in eastern Washington state around Spokane, Yakima and the Tri-Cities Richland/Kennewick and Walla Walla. Why were they separated out when the megaregions weren't? Why have you now aggregated them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does this suggest that the humans living in North America didn't need an ice free corridor to open up for them to reach the more temperate regions further south? Recent dating of sites in Florida, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia and even down into South America suggest human presence south of the ice sheets before the ice free corridor opened up. It was estimated that the corridor needed to be open 200-300 years before there were sufficient plants and animals to allow humans to navigate the 1500 miles from the northern icesheet margin to the areas south of the form icesheet locations. This has driven the theories that early settlers of the Americas must have used boats to navigate down the coast. If they were living in the lands north of the icesheet during the glacial maximum, is it possible they had the means to make some of that journey over the ice itself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a positive feedback loop built into global warming that is entirely due to reflection/absorption of sunlight, and it is one of the largest concerns over the coming decades.   

While your comments about decreased albedo due to rock replacing melting ice are accurate, the quote statement is false. Gobal warming/climate change is being driven by the greenhouse effect from CO2, methane, and water vapor in the atmosphere. It is called "the greenhouse effect" because radiation comes in from the sun, is absorbed by various surfaces on the earth and re-radiated as infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases in the atmosphere increase the amount that is absorbed back by the atmosphere rather than being radiated into space. H2O in the atmosphere has not appreciably changed. CO2 and and methane have. There are also effects from soot particles in clouds and on snow/ice fields that increase the absorption rather than reflection (as you cite) but again, the primary effect driving the increasing temperatures is the greenhouse gases that stop the infrared radiation from leaving the planet </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So at the current time no one is really extracting commercially viable biofuel from cellulosic sources because the breakdown of cellulose is so energy intensive.   From this perspective, it is not really clear how they can make the claim that Miscanthus is 2.4 times more productive for biofuel than switchgrass, since neither one is currently viable. The great hope is that some yeasts can be bio-engineered to break down cellulose into sugars for ethanol production very efficiently. However,  if this happens, the cellulose byproducts of food crops could do double duty of producing both food and fuel --e.g., after harvesting corn, the corn stalks could be fermented into fuel. Same for wheat stalks, rice stalks, etc. Why grow a stalks only crop for fuel production when you could get food and fuel from the same crop?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To me, statements like this undercut Nixon's credibility about what he learned as Hussain's interrogator. As a field interrogator he would have been a relatively small fish in the intelligence bureaucracy. Yet, as face to face interrogator might have learned interesting things. If such an action occurred, it would have been taken far above his pay grade and knowledge. Thus, by making this claim, it suggests he has agenda and has no problem fabricating things to serve it. Sorry guy, you just trashed everything you've claimed about your one on ones with the dictator </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not exactly true, at least not according to the theories that gave rise to the belief in Dark Matter. Stars in galaxies orbit as if they're embedded like a plate inside a sphere/spheroid of mass. The planar form of visible matter is somehow linked to ordinary matter interacting at the electromagnetic and nuclear forces level when particles hit each other. The theories of dark matter postulate it is made of WIMPs, Weakly Interacting Massive Particles - the key point "weakly interacting" meaning, they don't bump into things or deflect each other when they do. The formation of visible matter into discs is dependent on the fact that they do interact when they bump into each other </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm disappointed in what appears to be mostly sensationalizing technical terminology without really explaining what the collapse of the AMOC would mean in terms of climate/weather effects. As /u/Bman409 says, much of this has actually been previously discussed. The movie "The Day After Tomorrow" was largely based on an over sensationalization of those effects. Basically, the AMOC is the effect that occurs when the Gulf Stream, with a payload of warmer, saltier water arrives in the region of Greenland and Iceland. Cold katabatic winds blowing off the Greenland icecap create a huge heat transfer from the ocean to the atmosphere, rapidly cooling the water, which then sinks into the depths due to both its temperature and salinity. The sinking cold water is the wellhead of the global deep ocean cold currents, ACOM. The heat transfer into the atmosphere is essential for the warmer-than-would-be-expected-for-the-latitude climate of Iceland, UK and much of Western Europe. The mechanics of the ACOM are dependent on the saltiness of the Gulf Stream waters. Without the elevated salinity, the cooled surface water would merely diffuse into the already cool waters present in the area. There are probably other vertical upwellings driven by the sinking waters as well that drive higher biological productivity, and therefore fisheries in the region as well. From the past few years harsh winters in North America and Western Europe driven by the destabilization of the Arctic Polar high and the increased unfrozen waters of the Arctic Ocean, it is obvious climate change can have some unforeseen and not modeled effects on weather. A lot of the concern about the ACOM is due to a sudden cooling in the climate after the last maximum glaciation was receeding and the large ice sheets in North America were melting. It is theorized that a thousand year cooling period about 11,000 years ago was caused by large amounts of glacial meltwater diluting the salinity of the Gulf Stream at the Gulf of St Lawrence and, in theory, disrupting the ACOM. Hence the concern that it will do so again. However, others have modeled the degree to which the higher latitudes are already warming due global climate warming against the loss of the ocean-atmosphere heat transfer with an ACOM disruption. The results are suggest that at most there would be a slight cooling of northern Europe until the overall global warming caught up. Thus, while an ACOM disruption may be a disaster for fisheries and may in fact increase weather swings, it is unlikely to drive a broad cooling of the climate in Europe as it did 11,000 years ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So two parts responses to your answer. Yes, to be a planet, it must have cleared its own orbit. However, this is somewhat of a evolutionary based argument that presumes a planet forming in the early solar nebula that is rife with planetesimals for it to clear. In a sense, the Moon has cleared its own orbit, the one that happens to be around the Earth. Early in its formation there were likely many different objects still in Earth orbit left over from the collision that formed the Moon in the first place. There is a theory that the earth had a 2nd moon of 100-200 km in diameter that collided with the farside of the moon some millions of years after its formation, hence the very different surface chemistry of the farside. All that said - if the Moon was ejected from the Earth's orbit by passing through a Lagrange point with some residual velocity, depending on the geometry of that passage, it would either descend to a lower orbit between Earth and Venus or rise to higher orbit between the Earth and Mars due to its own velocity being either added or subtracted from Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun. Since solar orbits are essentially empty compared to the conditions in the solar nebula from which the "orbit clearing" definition is derived, it would be in a cleared orbit albeit, one that it did not itself clear. However, anyone finding it there would be inclined to call it a planet rather than a dwarf planet since there are not a plethora of other objects that it could potentially collide with.  Regarding the time required. At the current rate of recession, it would take the Moon 39 billion years to reach the L1 Lagrange point, at 1.5 M km out toward the sun. So, yeah, the sun is going to eat us all before that would ever happen. More to the point, the Moon's rate of recession will decline to zero as it gets increasingly further from Earth and as the Earth's rotation slows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I speculated about this on AskScience sometime back, thinking that at some point the Moon would pass through one of the Lagrange points where the Earth's and Sun's gravity equal out. Assuming the Moon passed through one of these points with its own forward motion/orbital velocity, it should be ejected into solar orbit instead of remaining in orbit around the Earth. Somebody shot me down, not on the basis of solar expansion, but instead on the declining recession of the Moon. As the Moon moves out from the Earth, it is robbing the Earth of rotational energy, slowly lengthening our day. There will come a point when the Moon and the Earth are tidally locked with the Earth rotating and the same speed that the Moon orbits. At this point, the Moon stops receding from the Earth.  This has already occurred with Pluto and Charon - They're tidally locked, with each of them presenting the same face to each other as they orbit around each other. With the Earth and the Moon, this will occur before the Moon gets far enough away to break away into solar orbit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep bees and often have discussions with a friend who grew up on a kibbutz among orange groves in Israel. He also keeps bees and told how, as a preteen on the kibbutz he used to catch bees foraging for nectar, putting them into a screened hive box. After a few days of confinement in the box with sugar water, he opened the box. The captured bees, most of which probably came from completely different hives, took up residence in the box, drew comb and began collecting nectar. There was no queen, so there was no brood but after a while, the hive developed what sometimes happens in real hives, he got a laying worker. The eggs they lay always produce drones. So, these workers, isolated from their own hive and confined with a bunch of other bees bonded into a new colony and took up some of the foraging and comb production activities that a real colony with a queen would do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not in any way an expert on earthquakes or tsunamis but have seen descriptions of what has happened in cases where tsunamis have formed. These cases include very significant seabed rifting resulting from the earthquake and earthquake setting off large underwater landslides. In both these cases there is sharp disconnect between closely adjacent sections of seabed in contact with the water. For example in the case of seabed rifting, the seabed rips apart, with the different sections moving in opposite directions. [This article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/10/highereducation.research)  discusses some of the large rifts discovered off the coast of Aceh in the aftermath of the Boxing Day earthquake. Large tsunamis generated from the 1964 Alaska and more recent ones in New Guinea have been traced to [large submarine landslides](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/feb/10/highereducation.research). In those cases a similar effect occurs - close proximity of seabed that moves against the water and other seabed that doesn't. While I don't have the exact geoscience, I'd suggest the critical factor for a tsunami formation is a sharp shear in the pressure wave communicated to the water. If you just have regular seismic waves, you get a pressure wave, but with a continuous distribution of force change, which does not cause a tsunami </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was looking at the size of the yellow band across the middle of stacked graphs, then at the legend. Thought, no way solar has that much of the total energy share. Took a second to see there are two yellows, one for the solar the other for natural gas.   

It suggests to me that this chart could be improved with some color palette choices that are more intuitively associated with the energy sources:  

1) Coal - Dark Grey, same as it ever was  

2) Nuclear - Try to match the color of Cerenkov radiation color, Electric Blue,  Hex triplet, #7DF9FF

3) Natural Gas - Lighter blue, like the color of gas stove flame Blue, Hex triplet #3E65C0  

4) Hydropower - normally would say another blue, like Ocean Blue,  but think that would be too many blues too close together. Since you often see the white water gushing out of the hydroelectric dam spill ways, suggest a white #000000 might be better  

5) Petroleum - Blackest black, #FFFFFF  

6) Wind - Green, like the energy it generates and the grass that grows around the turbine ~~#7cfc00~~  
EDIT - Take back, this green, which was listed online as "grass green", looks more like prestone antifreeze. Suggest #4cbb17 Kelley Green is more appropriate. Also, realized "Other" - #9 below is generation from municipal waste incineration, a producing highly toxic waste contaminated with heavy metals. Not sure of the best indicator for toxic waste color, but prestone green fits the bill

7) Wood - Brown, like it already is  

8) Geothermal - Red hot, the color of the lava that makes it go #cf1020  

9) Other - ~~the light grey nothingness it represents~~ Municipal waste incineration. Should be coded with something indicative of toxic waste. Prestone green #7cfc00 or perhaps Magenta #ff00ff

10) Solar - The color of the Sun on a summer day, #FDB813

	<TEXT> just us chickens this far down the thread. my original point is still valid: the reddit title overstates the case. Ice sheet dynamics is still an evolving science. It seems intuitive that melting ice shelves will destabilized the glaciers penned up behind them, but at the moment, this is just a working theory. By claiming it as fact --e.g. "melting ice shelves raise sea levels" -- you're guilty of over-hype and exaggeration of the *immediate* effects. In effect, it is giving aid and  comfort to the climate change deniers because they can point to statements like yours to make the case that the effects of climate change are not an immediate problem that needs to be addressed. Overstating the immediate effects can make be used to make advocates for reducing fossil carbon emissions as alarmist "shy is falling" enthusiasts. I've no doubt that the melting of the ice shelves will eventually lead to a portion of the Totten Icefield catchment basin, but claiming the Totten Iceshelf melting will result in 11 feet of ocean rise is both provably false and undercutting the argument of its actual long term effects   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll let the National Snow and Ice Data Center educate you. Here is their [Quick Facts on Ice Shelves](https://nsidc.org/cryosphere/quickfacts/iceshelves.html). A very brief excerpt from the page:  

**Why are ice shelves important?**  

Because ice shelves already float in the ocean, *they do not contribute directly to sea level rise when they break up.* However, ice shelf collapse could contribute to sea level rise indirectly. Ice streams and glaciers constantly push on ice shelves, but the shelves eventually come up against coastal features such as islands and peninsulas, building pressure that slows their movement into the ocean. If an ice shelf collapses, the backpressure disappears. The glaciers that fed into the ice shelf speed up, flowing more quickly out to sea. Glaciers and ice sheets rest on land, so once they flow into the ocean, they contribute to sea level rise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got my units wrong meters, rather than feet, but not my point. The Totten Iceshelf is already in the water and its melting will not raise the sea level at all. The catchment basin behind the Totten Iceshelf includes other glaciers covering an area equivalent in size to California. It is only a portion of the East Antarctic Icecap, but alone has 11 feet of sea level rise potential IF it all melted. The complete melting of the entire Totten Glacier/Iceshelf catchment basis is very very unlikely. The main scientific point of the article is that the supposed stability of the East Antarctic icecap through global warming scenarios does not conform to the sea level rises from only Greenland and West Antarctica melting. At least some portion of East Antarctica will likely melt. The glaciers behind the melting Totten Iceshelf are pointed to as one likely source of additional melting/sea level rise from East Antarctic...  if the melting of the iceshelf does in fact destabilize the inland glaciers (which seems likely)... in the future. My argument with the title was the Totten Iceshelf, which is being documented as melting right now, will not in of itself raise the sea level.  </TEXT>

Thankfully, the cancer didn't kill him for another 20 years. Impressive funeral too, 2 Senators, 5 congressmen and 6 generals at his funeral and a jet formation fly over. Death doesnt get any better than that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reddit title misrepresents information in the article. The Totten Iceshelf is considered a "stopper" for a large catchment basis of multiple other inland glaciers with a combined area the size of California. IF the melting of the Totten Iceshelf destabilizes all of those glaciers;  and then  IF the entire catchment basin of glaciers  melted entirely, it would raise sea level by 11.5 meters.  

The first IF is a definitely possibility. The second IF is almost certainly not going to happen, at least not within a 1000 years. It is possibly though, that some portion of that volume will melt.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While thawing permafrost is definitely a possibility, consider too how much methane is locked into temperature sensitive methane clathrates on the continental shelves. This past fall over [500 methane bubbler sites](http://www.washington.edu/news/2015/10/14/bubble-plumes-off-washington-oregon-suggest-warmer-ocean-may-be-releasing-frozen-methane/) were discovered  located off the Oregon coast. A recent spike in methane could be due to El Nio warmed waters moving into these normally chilly seawater areas and destabilizing those deposits. Consider too that fracking often fractures the ground enough that a lot of methane leaks out of the ground rather than being captured. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Collecting Agency Has The Wrong Man! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-08 17:31:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I have a googleganger (person with the same name as myself) living the same state that I live in. This person is apparently a financial scofflaw who has defaulted on numerous personal, mortgage and home equity loans which have been turned over to collection agencies. Unable to locate him, these agencies have apparently searched for him on the internet or databases, found my name, address and phone number. I receive calls every day from collection agencies (Transworld, Ocwen,  etc). Some of them quite aggressive in their tone. Usually they demand that I tell them my social security number so they can verify my identity. First, I tell them I know who they're looking for and it isn't me. Second, I tell them that I will not give them my SSN, but they should tell me the SSN of the person they're looking for so I can either confirm or deny that it is me. I also tell them that they have illegally associated my phone number with their collection account and need to remove it. Their answer is that they will not take my phone number out of the record until I give them my SSN. I'm not going to do that for obvious reasons. Question  I have here: having put my phone number into their databases, can they impact my credit rating or even put a lien on my house through their mis-identification of me as their collection target? Is there a point where I can sue them for harassment? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So last year Lisa Randall and Matthew Reece proposed a possible link between mass extinctions on earth and the sun's periodic passage through a hypothesized "disc" of dark matter in the plane of the milky way's disc on its orbit around the galaxy. This seemed to be exactly counter to observations of stellar motion that gave rise to the discovery of dark matter in the first place --i.e. stellar motion of stars in the galaxy is consistent with the disc of the galaxy being embedded in a roughly spherical halo of dark matter. Is there any evidence that dark matter actually clusters more densely in the galactic plane than in other parts of the halo? Why didn't these two astrophysicists get laughed out of their field for this claim/theory?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> . Weve found that about one in every nine was an insult of some kind.  

Does this mean there are well known categories of insults? 
Is there an ontology of insult types? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a saying, "All maps are politically biased". Apologies for inferring intent on your data mapping when the bias is apparently included in the toolset you used. It would be very illustrative to see how the toolset deals with other disputed boundaries and occupied territories. For example how does it map out the following cases:  

1) Israel, Gaza and West Bank   

2) Turkish   Greek Cypriot governments in Cyprus (UK military base territories as well).  

3) Nagorno-Karabakh region of Armenia and Azerbaijan  

4) Pakistan, India and China occupied portions of Kashmir and Jammu  

5) Kosovo as separate country or part of Serbia?  

6) Chinese occupied Arunchal-Pradesh India. 

7) Chinese occupied  border regions in Bhutan

	<TEXT> It is a shame this discussion is about China and its imperialist ambitions in the next century as my point was about this post in Reddit. There is an agenda at work here at "normalizing" the idea that Morocco owns and has right to own Western Sahara. China is only relevant as an example of another country that in recent memory has solidified their take over of another territory with seemingly innocuous maps. What I am pointing out is there are no internationally recognized maps showing Morocco as including Western Sahara. Somebody had to go out of their way to make those maps and then populate them with data, perhaps real, perhaps faked in order to make this subtle point. The post is not about the progress of Africa. It is about getting maps of Morocco with Western Sahara annexed into the public record </TEXT>
