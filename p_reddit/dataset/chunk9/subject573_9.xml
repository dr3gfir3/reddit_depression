	<TEXT> [The New York Times reports that neither Trump nor Bannon have used the "Deep State" phrase](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/06/us/politics/deep-state-trump.html?_r=0):

Neither Mr. Trump nor Mr. Bannon has used the term deep state publicly.

Why is Politico reporting as if they had?

The Deep State Is a Figment of Steve Bannons Imagination

...

The term, which political scientists invented to refer to the networks of generals and spymasters that rule many authoritarian states around the world, has migrated from leftist critics of U.S. foreign policy to the alt-right *advisers running the White House.*  </TEXT>

The title says the "deep state" is a figment of Steve Bannon's imagination.

The example I have is actually very relevant because my example is exactly the article you posted

But, it wasn't. This paper is based on past data. It's not something you can actually create a control for and then observe over time. All you can do is compare the past data.

What I think needs to be done is the same basic query, but comparing across *all* groupings.

Also, I don't think anyone has claimed that seeing an anomaly in one group *must mean* that there is a connection. However, *if* there is a connection, you would expect to see anomalies.  </TEXT>

That's what you proposed: an experimental control where Kate would slap Dave in the face as hard as she could, to see if her computer turning on was related to a fire alarm going off.

It's in no way comparable to this study, which appears to essentially be an SQL query on an insurance database.

It's pretty obvious you believe their results and that's your prerogative.

I don't know why you think you know what I believe. I don't even trust that the numbers they reported are correct to the computations they performed (or even to what they claimed to perform). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If you look at the data, it shows that they chose patients who were diagnosed with specific disorders and determined the percentage of those patients who got vaccinated 6 months prior which is exactly what I was saying.

If you look at the methods, it describes a different selection process.

There are other ways to examine the data. This is just one way.

The reason this is so important is because it maintains all the variables.

One can't know what all the variables are, much less maintain them.

Your example doesn't work in this case, because there is no connection between slapping someone (doesn't sound like an ethical experiment to me), and turning on a computer.

In this study, the groups are linked through vaccinations. You are also talking about an (violent) intervention, where this study was completely observational. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "What" is implying that? The article calls out the Sessions issue as being different, but does draw an equivalency with McCaskill:

**Pelosi's explanation is similar to one offered by Sen. Claire McCaskill** Thursday, after she swiped at Attorney General Jeff Sessions for privately meeting with Kislyak in 2016 and failing to disclose it when asked about communications with Russians during his confirmation proceedings in January. Sessions has emphasized that meetings with ambassadors are common for lawmakers and that he met with Kislyak in his capacity as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.

**McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, tweeted that in her 10 years on the Armed Services Committee, she had received "No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever."**

**But after confronted with a pair of her own tweets from 2013 and 2015 in which she described a meeting and call with Kislyak, McCaskill walked back her comment.** </TEXT>

I don't see where it says only diagnosed patients were selected (in fact, two other conditions were selected: broken bones and open wounds). Is that the only way to get into the claims data?

If vaccinations have no impact on neuropsychiatric diagnoses, then the background vaccination rate (over the studied time periods) should be similar to any other arbitrary grouping. This study seems to show a higher incidence of vaccinations in some diagnosis groups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What they should have done is take the total number of people vaccinated in a certain time period and determine whether or not they developed the disorder.

My understanding is that is actually what they did.

The start of Methods: 

Using claims data, we compared the prior years occurrence of vaccinations...

So, first they selected the vaccination data, then the neuropsychiatric disorders data:

...with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007...

Then, control conditions were selected:

...as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds...

Various factors were then also controlled for:

 Subjects were matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality.

You said:

Age was not controlled for. They used any patient between the ages of 6-15. If they were to control for age, then they would compare the 6 year olds with the 6 year olds and the 7 year olds with the 7 year olds etc. because to control for something means that it no longer becomes a variable. 

I haven't found the actual code used to run the analysis. We can't really be sure exactly what they did, but this is my current understanding of what the paper says. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Age was controlled for, according to the claims of the article.

The study wasn't about no vaccinations at all (is that even legal?). It was about vaccinations within a 3, 6, 12 month prior time frame of a medical diagnosis.

The only way to do this sort of experiment and draw any meaningful conclusion would be to look at the total population of vaccinated people and see how many of them were diagnosed with the disorder 6 months after receiving a vaccination. This is not what they did.

According to the article, that appears to be exactly what they did, though the total population was limited to those who had claims existing in some database. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 3-, 6-, and 12-month vaccination ranges were checked.

What they should have done is taken a population of people who were vaccinated 6 months prior to determine the percentage of people who were diagnosed with the disorder and compared it to a population of people who were never vaccinated.

I think that's exactly what they did; from the Methods:

Using claims data, we compared the prior years **occurrence of vaccinations** in children and adolescents aged 615 years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds.

The comparison is on *how many kids were vaccinated (within the past 3, 6, 12 month time periods) that were in the category vs. how many kids were not vaccinated (within the past 3, 6, 12 month time periods)*.

I read the paper and they did not compare a vaccinated group and a non-vaccinated group. They compared percentage of people diagnosed with the disorder who were vaccinated 6 months prior.

I don't see a percentage of people diagnosed with a disorder anywhere, though, I don't think the data files were released. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The post you responded to linked you to the figure that shows vaccination rates. Take another look: http://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/225946/fpsyt-08-00003-HTML/image_m/fpsyt-08-00003-t001.jpg


I know this is probably hard to understand

Rule 2

but open wound percentages and broken bone percentages are not comparable to anorexia since they are completely unrelated.

Where were these percentages compared? Vaccination rates between groups was compared, is my understanding.


Who gets anorexia? Who are more likely to get broken bones? Anorexia is more prevalent in girls between the ages of 10-18 (study only goes to 15, I think, so out of their population 10-15). During this time, most people are getting lots of vaccinations as they transition from middle school to high school. So it's likely that, no matter when they got diagnosed, they had a vaccination fairly recently

6-15 were the age ranges. Gender, age, geographic area, and seasonality were controlled for:

Subjects were matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality.

Where are these people from? Different parts of the country have different lifestyles and would be more susceptible to different things. There are so many factors which play a role in each of these things that saying the percentage for one is different than the other is an incorrect because almost nothing is controlled.

See above


Doing science is not just looking at percentages. If you don't control your variables properly, your data is meaningless. Like I've said, **you have to compare people who were vaccinated to people who were not vaccinated, which they did not do**. Broken bones and open wounds are irrelevant. A properly controlled study would have been as follows:

That's the percentage. The percentage *is* the comparison. ~21% of those with anorexia had a recent vaccination. ~79% of those with anorexia did not.

A) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got OCD vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got OCD. B) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got anorexia vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got anorexia. C) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got tic disorder vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got tic disorder. D) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got ADHD vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got ADHD. E) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got depression vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got depression. F) Percentage of people who were vaccinated and got bipolar disorder vs. percentage of people were were NOT vaccinated and got bipolar disorder.

That's my understanding of what they did:

First, **the proportion of children who were exposed to vaccines in the period before the index date was compared across the case and control groups**. Next, bivariate conditional logistic regression models were estimated to determine the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with the effect of vaccine exposure on having the condition of interest. Separate models were run for the 3-, 6-, and 12-month periods preceding the index date for each diagnostic group.

Notice how I left out "broken bones" and "open wounds" because they are completely unnecessary and irrelevant.

Those are basically control groups. If vaccines have no effect on health, all arbitrary groups should be about the same. The finding is that vaccination occurred more often in some groups.

Also, you can not look at the percentage of people who got the disease and were vaccinated since almost everyone is vaccinated and that will inflate your percentages, you have to look at the people who were vaccinated and got disease. What they did is essentially like those people who say that, out of 100 heroin addicts, 99, or whatever, got vaccinated so heroin addiction is related to vaccination.

None of the percentages were close to 99%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't see how you can say that there is an increase

"Increase" may not be the most apt term, but I think it is valid based on the first sentence of the article's (in the journal, not Yale Daily News) results:

Subjects with newly diagnosed AN were *more likely than controls to have had any vaccination* in the previous 3 months [hazard ratio (HR) 1.80, 95% confidence interval 1.212.68].

If there were no link between anorexia and recent vaccinations, you would expect the anorexia group to have roughly the same vaccination rate as other groups that aren't linked to vaccinations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Bitcoin Unlimited](https://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/) sounds way better:

Every node operator or miner can currently choose their own blocksize limit by modifying their client. Bitcoin Unlimited makes the process easier by providing a configurable option for the accepted and generated blocksize via a GUI menu. Bitcoin Unlimited further provides a user-configurable failsafe setting allowing you to accept a block larger than your maximum accepted blocksize if it reaches a certain number of blocks deep in the chain.

By moving the blocksize limit from the protocol layer to the transport layer, **Bitcoin Unlimited removes the only point of central control in the Bitcoin economy - the blocksize limit - and returns it to the nodes and the miners**. An emergent consensus will thus arise based on free-market economics as the nodes/miners converge on consensus focal points, creating in the process a living, breathing entity that responds to changing real-world conditions in a free and decentralised manner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  On that topic, though, **the one thing about Bitcoin that seems really crazy to me is the idea that every transaction**, whether it's a real estate sale or a $1 wallet reorganization, **has to be kept track of forever by everyone participating in the system at the node level**. Even if bandwidth and storage were unlimited, it just seems wasteful.

Every transaction does not need to be kept track of forever. [Please see section 7 of the Bitcoin paper, "Reclaiming Disk Space"](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf):


Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before
it can be discarded to save disk space. To facilitate this without breaking the block's hash,
transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree [7][2][5], with only the root included in the block's hash.
Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree. The interior hashes do
not need to be stored.


A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = **4.2MB per year**. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
memory.
