	<TEXT> Have you considered Pilot Sport 3s? Or are you referring to all the MPS series in general? I feel as if people only know about PSS and often overlook the little brother. In my size they were one of the cheapest tyres available too. That said, the PS3 is slowly being replaced by PS4 but this might allow for some price drops if they're being phased out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, not OP here but I also was working on an Apoc 'cover' some time ago but never got around to properly finishing it because the percussion in general was pretty pathetic - it sounds pretty horrible and takes way too long to translate into sheet music since it was all made in Guitar Pro (yes I realise you're not supposed to create music in this). The last bit of progress on it was a few months ago: https://soundcloud.com/turbolag/tame-impala-apocalypse-dreams-unfinished

Just wondering if I could use your drum track as well? Will give you full credit there of course! Your cover is fantastic too, I like how it isn't just a full copy of the song which is what I was going for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've found the same thing. A lot of them were expecting for the course to be around half-half with locals and internationals, and they too are disappointed. They're mostly super nice and of course there's a few outliers - but that goes for just about any set of people. Honestly I find myself feeling a lot more comfortable around them compared to some of the typical locals (since I'm of Asian background).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep - I'm not blaming the students one bit. It's the uni who decided to take them in after "knowing" their language skills (after assessing their IELTS I presume). It puts a lot of strain on the one who is most competent at their language. I honestly believe I'd be better off working alone without them since they're more of a net drain, just because I spend so much time correcting them, and like you, I don't want my grades dragged down. I too have no idea how they pass exams; however some seem to be absolutely amazing at rote learning, major props to them since it's something I sure as hell wouldn't be able to do. I go out of my way to "teach" English to the few that really do want to learn, since I can tell they are genuinely interested in understanding more of the language here. After talking to a few of them, they claim that they're fairly displeased that they don't get to interact with many more locals, and that it's basically just like attending a uni in their own country (although this is anecdotal). 

The university basically relies on the fact that no locals will enter this course and see what's really going on - and the few that attempt it may be driven away due to the high concentrations of non-locals simly due to the fact that you will have nobody to talk to or do proper work with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 65-70% + 15-20%? Lucky. I'm about 1 in 240 at my course at Monash. It's basically assumed that everyone in the course is Chinese, and people generally assume that you can speak it too (I couldn't really look further different). Of course there's a few others mixed in, a few Malaysian and a tiny percentage Singaporean, but I'd put it at around 80% Chinese. It doesn't bother me one bit where they come from but it's rather difficult to deal with when they can't communicate and you're thrown in with them for 30%-weighted assignments. There's no doubt that a significant amount would fail English at a high school level, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if some were at, or below a primary school level. To them, as long as their IELTS score is above some threshold, they're perfectly good at English. There's a few that honestly do try though, and they all tend to flock around me since I'm apparently their personal English tutor now. That said, at least they're trying, unlike most. 

I've come across some that couldn't put a single coherent sentence together - but I managed to kick one out of my group and I honestly hope they fail him considering how horrible his language skills were. What's more pathetic however is the English level of the people working internally. I received this 'feedback' a little while ago. 

"Excellent work indeed. The student shows that he has the very strong command in using accounting and economics information to conduct the financial analysis in the fundamental level. The work is written in a very professional manner and well presented. The student also demonstrate that he put lots of efforts in predicting the firms' future performance on his own."

Wonder how many times Google Translate was used here. Just like all the work submitted to them. 

I suppose this is what happens when the unis get a tad greedy. The internationals are paying some 4.4k per subject as opposed to 1.3k for the locals so it's rather obvious what's driving it. 

Oh and by the way, this isn't even at an under-grad level... this is Masters.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hotel/Motel recommendation in the Baulkham Hills area? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey r/sydney, I'll be travelling from Melbourne by car for an Assessment Centre in the Baulkham Hills area on Wednesday morning. I've been looking for a place to stay in the nearby region but only see a few options, and I'm really trying to avoid paying over $200 for one night. I'm not overly fussed about the quality, but will need a good night's rest since it's a very late notice interview that I'm only just now preparing for.

The "Ibis budget Wentworthville" is the only apparent option in this scenario. Is there anywhere anyone can recommend otherwise? I'm willing to stay in the 10km region of the suburb. Cheers!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've bought and sold quite a few things on it, and I've never had any issues simply due to my attitude towards it. You will get a lot of messages with ridiculous low-balling (like 25% of the price), and a lot telling you their life stories and why you should give it to them for free or something. It's as simple as saying a big no to them. I usually put my price up a tiny bit to let people negotiate (as just about everyone has done), but if it sells at my asking price, so be it. Like others have said, I'm one of those people that will not hold an item. If you want it, make some time and come to get it, unless you're willing to put down a deposit. 

The next reason may be that your ads simply aren't descriptive enough. Most ads I see are extremely vague and don't say too much, so of course I will ask if it's "still available" simply because I don't trust the seller enough to actually remove an item since they can't even be bothered typing an ad. 

It's this sort of shit that drives me insane and will leave people hanging dry.

	<TEXT> That's a really neat looking GTO, love the styling on the older ones with the pop up lights over the later ones. The out of alignment fogs are bugging me though haha!

I had something *similar* happen to me but on a much lesser scale, as a kid I always loved playing GT and in 2005, GT4 was released, and eventually I was almost only driving Subaru Legacys in game for some weird reason. I was 11 years old at the time but I always had a major soft spot for them. In fact I spent many hours on the then-major-feature, Photomode, taking photos of them. I still have a few thankfully.

In 2012 when I was looking to buy my first car, after looking at quite a few other cars, I ended up having a black Gen 4 by near chance. I really forgot about having one on GT that I had driven for thousands of kilometers too. Although it's definitely not a GT-B (I wish), it's weird how I ended up with a super similar car as to what I had on GT so many years ago.

Usually, a lot of tyre brands have 4 for 3 deals or cash back offers which are both of decent value. Here's some random examples of places to look up prices:

	<TEXT> I just think for the time ('09) that it was a tad outdated, especially being a 4spd. When it was introduced in '03 with the shift mode (I think?) I'm sure it wouldn't have been bad at all. I actually think it's pretty decent for going quick in, feels nicer the quicker you go, but at low speed it's very meh IMO. No doubt it's reliable though, in that sense yes, it is definitely a good transmisison.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find the SPORT mode completely useless. If I want to go quick I'll do it myself, thank you. The sequential is good, I find myself shifting much more intuitively and smoother than what the car can manage anyway. If you're feeling really game you can kind blip the throttle (since the gear change is so slow lol) while downshifting and make it a whole lot smoother, but this is of course completely useless, just dumb fun. One problem though; the gear stick shifts the wrong way. Drives me insane! There's a reason mine's a manual.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have nearly exactly the same car but a model year earlier (I think equivalent to US model though). The main problem I'd look out for is headgaskets and oil leaks (specifically into where the sparks sit). It would be hard to check, and many mechanics won't be able to tell if there's anything wrong without opening it up or at least checking the sparks. The issues seem to be very common and most of the cars only ever suffer from the same problems, I've never heard of other major issues with them. 

Just FYI the 4EAT is pretty horrible for day to day use (IMO). The only way I drive it is using the 'sequential'. That said, it works decently well in the twisties even though it may not seem like it.
