	<TEXT>  You get 10 weeks to do a director's cut

Do you get paid based on DGA guidelines on that post-production period? What about pre-production? And if so, how many weeks you typically are employed per one feature in the scale of what you have been doing?

Little off-topic question and certainly late reply to your comment, but it's very rare to see someone on Reddit how has verifiable made films in Hollywood, so I'm just curious :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sheer arrogance of r/movies is astonishing. Here is a legend who has made films in Hollywood over 50 years, some of them most succesful in the history. He has also produced tons of films and has even owned small film studio. He knows probably everyone who is of any importance in film business and even his children are filmmakers so he has frontrow seat to observe what is it like to be young filmmaker these days. So I'd say that when tells you something about filmmaking, maybe shut up and listen.

And while he may have exaggarated little to make a point, the fact is that getting this type of mid-budget films made is getting harder and harder all the time. And it's not just Coppola saying it. Very recently both Scorsese and James Gray said almost exactly the same thing in interviews. Even people like Spielberg and Lucas have talked about the death of mid-budget cinema.

But of course r/movies redditors who have never made a single film in their life are the ones who actually know how film industry has evolved in last decades /s

	<TEXT>   I would have expect Cimino would have taken more then two years to both write and direct a film of such epic proportions.

Cimino had written first draft of Heaven's Gate (then called The Johnson County War) all the way back in 1971 but the project was shelved when it failed to attract big-name talent. Later success with The Deer Hunter changed that and Cimino was able to make any film he wanted. The actual filming took place from April 1979 to March 1980.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is Heaven's Gate really just underrated and worth seeing?

Yes, absolutely. It's the most unfairly treated film in the history of cinema in my opinion. It's film equivalent of Great American Novel.

I have avoided due to 1) it's length

The definitive version approved by Cimino is little over 3 and half hour. The version that was over 5 hours was just work print that was showed for studio executives and it was never shown in public. For some strange reason IMDB misleads public and shows that over 5 hours length as it's official length. Criterion has put out the version approved by Cimino that I suggest you look up if you want to see the film.

2) it's infamous bankruptcy of United Artists 3) awful to merely tepid reviews, particularly Roger Ebert's.

There have been books written about why Heaven's Gate flopped as badly as it did, so I'm not gonna go there in depth. It's combination of many things, none that has to do with the quality of it as a work of art. Ultimately it's film about class war between American Establishment and poor Eastern European immigrants that was released just when the country had voted Ronald Reagan to President, so it's not hard to see why it might not have tapped into the zeitgeist of that moment. 

I see that you love McCabe and Mrs. Miller so I think you definitely should watch Heaven's Gate as well. I copy here  what in some other Reddit thread about Heaven's Gate:


It's an American epic on a scale not seen before or since, or likely ever again, Heaven's Gate is an unfairly maligned masterpiece. Running a colossal 219 minutes, the film is bursting with spectacular visuals, impressive technical work, and a collection of great performances from the likes of Kris Kristofferson, Isabelle Huppert, Christopher Walken, and Jeff Bridges.

This film look absolutely stunning. Cimino makes use of light, shadows, dust, and smoke to create some of the most gorgeous shots ever put to film. Sunlight pokes through shutters, windows, and the tops of trees to cast beautiful streams of light across the frame. Clouds roll in, casting everything in shadow before moving on. Dust kicked up by horses and carriages swirls across the landscapes. Smoke billowing off trains, homes, and buildings engulf entire shots. The kinetic movement of the camera flawlessly matches the energy of the scenes it depicts. This is the West as you've never seen it before.

Depicting Johnson County War, a rarely-acknowledged tragedy of American history, Heaven's Gate is uncompromising in its portrayal of brutal violence and shameful corruption. The story is ultimately bleak, but presents the full range of human emotion throughout its run time.

Heaven's Gate is big in just about every possible way. How many extras hired, how many costumes sewn, how many horses used, how many buildings erected, how many languages spoken, how many days were spent making this film happen? Apparently enough to bankrupt United Artists, something for which this film lives in infamy. This bankrupting of the company, combined with the bleak story and the director's singular vision, resulted in the film's horrific reception. It was hacked down to two-thirds it's original length and subsequently crucified by critics. I can't imagine the film packing nearly as much power in such a shortened state. In its original, over three-hour form, however, Heaven's Gate stands tall among all epics of the cinema as the last of its kind, a neglected masterpiece gradually accumulating its due praise.


And here's what Olivier Assays wrote about Heaven's Gate on Criterion website:


I saw this one again a few weeks ago in its incredible restored directors cut. I have always admired Michael Cimino, and I loved Heavens Gate when it was releasedwith some quibbles. Now, I cant believe I could have had any quibble about this masterpiece. Its not just that it ages well; it wipes away any doubt: for some reason the passing of time (remember the only genuinely moving tagline ever? What one loves in life are things that fade.) reveals this film as the extraordinary, transcendent triumph I could not see then. And the way it finally reaches us through the echo of time only makes it more moving, heartbreaking, even.


So yes, definitely watched as soon as possible. I recommend it to everyone, but especially for someone who likes McCabe and Mrs. Miller.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't love it because of technical breakthroughs or historical importance. I love it because:

- Beautiful cinematography.

- Subtle yet powerful score by Bernard Hermann

- Amazing performances, especially by Orson Welles. And maybe the best make-up work I've ever seen. Puts all the CGI agings in recent films shame.

- Great screenplay with memorable dialogue.

- Some of the most organic non-linear storytelling I've ever seen. Only film I've seen that surpasses Kane in this regard is Once Upon a Time in America.

- And all the little touches like image of Kane's sled alone in the snow that still haunts me to this day

- And it's a film that has something to say about life. The most subversive aspect of Citizen Kane, in 1941 and now-because it is still relevant thematically and still devastating in its implications-is the dark light it throws on fame, success, wealth, and the heritage of plutocracy. 

- And most importantly, it always hits me emotionally no matter how many times I see it. I am just baffled when I see that (at least in Reddit) there seems to be this very common narrative that Citizen Kane is just cold technical showmanship that can be only appreciated as part of film history. It couldn't be farther from the truth. </TEXT>
