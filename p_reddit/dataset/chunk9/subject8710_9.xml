	<TEXT> I feel like you don't really know what you're talking about. You heard of Total War? Hell, Total War: Warhammer has sold over a million copies itself nevermind the previous titles like Attila, Shogun, Rome, etc. That's more than Age of Empires   similar to C C games. Either way, RTS is almost synonymous with Starcraft so most people getting into RTS automatically look at Starcraft which is a good thing of course but the genre needs more competition. Halo Wars 2 is a start. A blockbuster franchise like Halo pumping out a sequel to its RTS spinoff is amazing for the genre.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not very familiar with Central European / Eastern European history but I am curious how Austria-Hungary became one of the premier states in Europe among competitors like Germany, France, Russia, etc. 

This map here depicts the Austria-Hungary Empire and it is quite [huge] (http://maps.canadiangeographic.ca/outbreak-of-first-world-war-map/images/Europe_1914.jpg).

How did the empire gain to much power, wealth, land, etc.?

According to this [source] (http://autocww2.colorado.edu/~toldy4/E64ContentFiles/HistoryOfEurope/Austria-Hungary.html
). The empire stood at 670,000 sq. KM which makes it bigger than modern-day France.

Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire, too.
