	<TEXT> Yes, I am currently experiencing something similar only later in time. I am 34F and my mom just turned 69. Obese, type 2 diabetes, insulin daily, many other health problems including heart problems and metabolic syndrome. I had to take her to emergency on Tuesday as her already red and puffy legs/feet were turning black. She was sent home but it's only a matter of time before they will need to get amputated. 

It frustrates me because my father has MS, which is progressing quickly and he is now in a wheelchair. For many years he did everything as she was too weak etc. But after he fell and broke his hip, he took over doing things like groceries. Problem is she is entirely dependent on a Walker and has a very hard time standing for more than 10 minutes. So if she has to go in hospital (she was hospitalized a couple years ago with bad oozing leg thing) then my dad is screwed. Anyway I could go on forever. 

So yes I totally get it. It drives me insane. At every moment I thought she would turn herself around but she never does. I have accepted that she has chosen to slowly kill herself but it hurts to see and to have to deal with (esp because I have 2 children and work full time). 

If you ever want to chat and commiserate please pm me. It would be good to have someone to chat about it with. I wish I had some advice for you. But all I can say is prepare for the worst.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who recently bought a house and is now bemoaning all the repair costs, this was a great reminder that home ownership is really lovely compared to renting sometimes. I hated landlords needing to come in for this or that. And the stability for the kids is true too. Thanks for sharing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, not OP, but some questions. I am the mom in the scenario you described from your childhood and because of this parenting disparity and an ultra crappy relationship I think of splitting up constantly. It sounded like it was better for you to have your mom around and parents stay together. Is this correct? Any perspective or advice? I am miserable as a partner but I want to minimize any pain or drama for my children by staying together (we are happy family on the outside)  </TEXT>
