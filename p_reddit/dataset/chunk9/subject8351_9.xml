	<TEXT> Luke 10:25-37 New International Version (NIV)

**The Parable of the Good Samaritan**

25 On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. Teacher, he asked, what must I do to inherit eternal life?

26 What is written in the Law? he replied. How do you read it?

27 He answered, Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind[a]; and, Love your neighbor as yourself.[b]

28 You have answered correctly, Jesus replied. Do this and you will live.

29 But he wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, And who is my neighbor?

30 In reply Jesus said: A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, when he was attacked by robbers. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him and went away, leaving him half dead. 31 A priest happened to be going down the same road, and when he saw the man, he passed by on the other side. 32 So too, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him, passed by on the other side. 33 But a Samaritan, as he traveled, came where the man was; and when he saw him, he took pity on him. 34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he put the man on his own donkey, brought him to an inn and took care of him. 35 The next day he took out two denarii[c] and gave them to the innkeeper. Look after him, he said, and when I return, I will reimburse you for any extra expense you may have.

36 Which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?

37 The expert in the law replied, The one who had mercy on him.

Jesus told him, Go and do likewise.

 I hope to see more in the future regarding other equally important notions of religious liberty, particularly ones that impact Christian business owners and allowing them to deny service on religious grounds. 

I don't think you are a Christian. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Trump's executive order, which he will sign on Thursday to coincide with the National Day of Prayer, calls for easing of Internal Revenue Service enforcement of the so-called "Johnson Amendment," which prohibits churches from getting directly involved in political campaigns.

 While only Congress can formally do away with the law, this will pave the way for churches and other religious leaders to speak about politics and endorse candidates without worrying about losing their tax-exempt status.

 The Executive Order on Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty also aims to make it easier for employers with religious objections not to include contraception coverage in workers' health care plans, although it would be up to federal agencies to determine how that would happen </TEXT>

 McGovern also slammed the GOP for pushing a bill that would rip away health care from an estimated 24 millions of Americans while at the same time cutting taxes for some of Americas wealthiest people.

 You should be ashamed, he said. To have a health care bill that cuts Medicaid by $880 billion so you can give a tax cut to the wealthiest people in this country, you should be ashamed. </TEXT>

 The AHCA, however, is set to defund the Medicaid health program by 25 percent, or $880 billion over the next decade. The cuts will affect both traditional and expanded coverage. Under one of the less talked about provisions of the new healthcare bill, states will not have to consider whether schools are eligible for Medicaid reimbursement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  An amendment in the GOP health-care-reform bill will allow states to deny coverage for preexisting conditions, including sexual assault.

 Pre-Obamacare rape survivors who sought treatment for their injuries could be denied health care later on. Under Obamacare, preexisting conditions were guaranteed to receive coverage  among them, sexual assault. The American Health Care Act is going to change that.

 The new MacArthur-Meadows Amendment will allow states to discriminate based on medical history, reportedly without mitigating the subsequent high cost of health care for millions of Americans.

 In addition to **rape**, **postpartum depression**, **Cesarean sections**, and **surviving domestic violence** are all considered preexisting conditions. **Companies can also deny coverage for gynecological services and mammograms**.

Edit: bold the important parts </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Called the American Health Care Act, the Republican bill would repeal most Obamacare taxes, including a penalty for not buying health insurance. It would slash funding for Medicaid, the program that provides insurance for the poor, and roll back much of Medicaid's expansion.

 The latest effort comes after earlier pushes by Trump for healthcare reform collapsed twice, underscoring the difficulty of uniting the various factions of the Republican party.

 "Republicans have made Trumpcare even more dangerous and destructive than the last time they brought it to the floor," Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote to her caucus in a letter late Wednesday night. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my mind if Hilary won, would it even be possible to go after Trump? GOP would do whatever they could to keep her from doing anything. They would try again with emails and all that shit. They would not even let an investigation into Trump go as far as Pennsylvania Ave. Hell, there wouldn't be a SCOTUS now even I bet because the GOP Senate would not allow it like before.

Now that Trump "won", they can actually do an investigation into it fully without the GOP crying fowl. If the GOP tried to hinder the investigation they would be facing millions marching on Washington. The GOP can try and fuck over the American people but we have Dems fighting for us. We have more people getting into government than ever before. We have people united on many ideals: science, civil rights, obamacare, than ever before.

Yes, it sucks incredibly hard but if this gets rid of the roots choking our democracy, I am for it. Who knows, if everything is proved true there might be many more Republicans leaving office because of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is a comment I made earlier in the day.

The thing that gets me is Comey said in the last open hearing that he "used to be a registered Republican"

 "Although our politics are different  I gather you're a Republican  that correct?" Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) asked Comey in prefacing his remarks.

 Comey responded, "I have been a registered Republican for most of my adult life, not registered any longer."

	<TEXT>  There was Donald Trump, in a message filmed several years before he was elected president of the United States, declaring that the skyscraper bearing his name near the Philippine capital would be something very, very special, like nobodys seen before. Then there was his daughter Ivanka Trump, now a senior White House adviser, lavishing praise on the project as a milestone in Philippine real estate history.

 Four months into President Trumps tenure, his business relationship with a developer who is one of the Philippines richest and most powerful men has emerged as a prime example of the collision between the private interests of a businessman in the White House and his public responsibility to shape U.S. foreign policy.

 The potential conflict first came into focus shortly before Trump was elected, when the Philippines iron-fisted president, Rodrigo Duterte, named the Trump Organizations partner on the Manila real estate venture his top trade envoy. </TEXT>
