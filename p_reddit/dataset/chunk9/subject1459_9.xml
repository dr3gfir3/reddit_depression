	<TEXT>  Positive people don't ignore the negative emotions, quite the contrary. People who choose the positive reaction experience the negative emotion, but let it pass like a fart in the wind. They don't dwell on it and let it ruin their day. They simply say "shit happens and I'll be happy anyways".

Sometimes negative emotions are worth sitting down with and digesting. It's not always appropriate to just brush them off and say "shit happens." Properly managing your negative emotions can be much deeper than that.

I'm certainly not against a positive or optimistic outlook, but there's a balance too. This article is specifically referring to people who feel like they *always* have to be positive and plaster on a smile no matter what. That's the type of unhealthy avoidance / suppression of negative emotions that is being referred to in the article.

Giving yourself the time and space to digest negative emotions can paradoxically make you less negative overall. Because you understand the process of your emotions and you let them run their course, they end up having less power over you.

This is essentially what "equanimity" refers to. </TEXT>

I just finished reading [The Power of Meaning](http://amzn.to/2nDXAv3) today and it mentions a study about how senior citizens who were given a plant to take care of also reported better mental health symptoms and increased longevity.

	<TEXT> Factors that enable an effective Democratic Socialist state:

- Small population (Most of the top 10 is countries under 10 million people, compare that with the United States' 330 million. This can make a big difference when trying to organize a government bureaucracy that is functional and not corrupt. The economist Hayek's insights into the "Socialist Calculation Problem" are particularly relevant here. Population size matters. Think about the difficulty between organizing a party for 10 people vs. a party for 100 people.)

- Homogeneous (It's been shown that countries that are more homogeneous are more willing to pay higher taxes to fund social welfare program like "free education" or "free healthcare." I remember first reading about this in the book [Blue Zones](http://amzn.to/2mM2Nwl). Norway, for example, is 97% European descent and 93% Norwegian)

- High IQ (Nations with higher IQs tend to produce more wealth, have higher social trust and social cohesion, and have less corrupt governments. Check out the book [Hive Mind](http://amzn.to/2n48irE) if you'd like to learn more about the influence of IQ on a national level)

All of these factors are a big reason why the United States is hardly comparable to the top nations. It's not just a matter of difference in policy, there are real demographic factors that exist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Factors that enable an effective Democratic Socialist state:

- Small population (Most of the top 10 is countries under 10 million people, compare that with the United States' 330 million. This can make a big difference when trying to organize a government bureaucracy that is functional and not corrupt. The economist Hayek's "Calculation Problem" is particularly relevant here.)

- Homogeneous (It's been shown that countries that are more homogeneous are more willing to pay higher taxes to fund social welfare program like "free education" or "free healthcare." I remember first reading about this in the book [Blue Zones](http://amzn.to/2mM2Nwl). Norway, for example, is 97% European descent and 93% Norwegian)

- High IQ (Nations with higher IQs tend to produce more wealth, have higher social trust and social cohesion, and have less corrupt governments. Check out the book [Hive Mind](http://amzn.to/2n48irE) if you'd like to learn more about the influence of IQ on a national level) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article is just suggesting that these activities can be a good *exercise* in mindfulness, it doesn't say you have to *always* do nothing but be mindful while eating, cleaning, or showering.

For example, I often enjoy listening to music or a podcast while I eat my lunch. But it can also be nice to every now and then just eat lunch while being mindful and not distracting myself with anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is likely related to the [Hot Cold Empathy Gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy_gap):

A hot-cold empathy gap is a cognitive bias in which people underestimate the influences of visceral drives on their own attitudes, preferences, and behaviors. The crux of this idea is that human understanding is "state-dependent". </TEXT>
