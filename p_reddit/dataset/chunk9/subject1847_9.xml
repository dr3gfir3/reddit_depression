	<TEXT> I'm not planning to mill the timbers at all, hence my question.

I will cut the best straight pines I can locate and then elevate them as they dry.  The bark will be removed (or will fall off) as the log dries but I will not do any milling of the logs.

The logs are all growing on flat land.

So with that information, do you believe they will stay straight?

I'm thinking I will just cut more than needed just in case there is some bowing that occurs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.  I posted this after a futile google search on the topic.

These will be the major "ribs" of the superstructure.  The main beam will be a 18-24" log 45' long.  

I plan to locate the best pines, cut them and then elevate them while they dry.  As they dry the bark will fall off but I will do no milling of the log at all. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am building a "hobbit house" and planning to harvest pine logs from my property for the super structure beams.  Some will be as long as 45'

If I cut trees that are straight while standing and lay them out elevated from the ground for drying will the log stay straight or will it bow as it dries?

I've always assumed the twisting and bowing of dimensional lumber comes from the fact that the log was milled breaking the internal structure of the timber that holds it straight.

Anyone know or have an opinion? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Raytheon the Cleric reporting in. :)

I do plan to put ventilation in the hidden room.  My thought is that I will bury 2 4" PVC pipes and have them surface just inside the tree line.  I would put an inline fan on one as the inflow.

So given the whole house is really one large room with a loft it sounds like having windows in the loft that open as well as the front door should suffice.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.  I live in the south so no freeze to worry about.

So for the front facing logs that will be exposed to the elements (north facing) is there a preferred way to protect the wood against pests?

I intend to pour a heavy footer with a metal bracket at the base of every log to bolt to.  There should be no direct contact with earth - just wood to concrete.

So if I cut these from my property do I need to do any type of curing on the wood?  Since I will not be cutting them in anyway (just removing the bark) my understanding is that since the grain is not compromised as it would be when milled that the log should maintain it's form - i.e. if the tree is straight while standing the log will remain straight when cut.  Is that correct? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So from the model you can see that the only external above ground area is the front of the house.  The loft that sits above the front door will have windows that open.

Do you think that is sufficient?

I intend to cover the 180 degrees that will cover these beams with (hopefully) solar shingles but worst case solar panels.  I plan to use a Tesla powerwall and have the house off grid but with electric backup from a 100amp subpanel I have installed at the site.

So other than the front "A frame" beams the rest will not be exposed to the elements. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi there.  I'm in the early stages of building a "hobbit house".  I hesitate to call it that as it is not a classic "earthen" hobbit house but that's what my wife calls it so I'll go with it for now (I prefer Beaver Lodge).

Anyway, I have done the general excavation and will be putting up a /r/DIYinprogress album for feedback as I go.

But first, I need a little guidance on the logs that I will be using for the main superstructure.  

I built a 1/12 scale model.  Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/a/kXOQm

The main beam is the largest - 18-24" - 45' long.  The next two ribs on each side need to be 40' and a bit smaller diameter.   The front two (that support the main beam) and the cross beam between those two needs to be 12-16" - 30' long.  So 7 logs total.

I have straight pine on my property that I can use.  I'm just wondering about the longevity of using pine for the superstructure.  Thoughts?

I am considering using oak logs but I would have to buy those and have them shipped.  Any idea what cut unfinished logs like that run?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

I just posted a month ago on here that my last movie attended in a theatre would be the 2/3rds of Logan that I got to see before leaving because of the crappy people behind me with little kids, on their phones, and ignoring my pleas to please be quiet.

Although I LOVE Marvel movies I've just committed to myself that I will wait to see them when they come out on VOD. But I would have happily paid to $50 to see Logan (to the end) at home in peace and quiet.

They don't mention it in the article - but the accepted (bad) behavior of patrons is a big reason that people don't want to go to movies any more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really just looked at the wild grove next door - liked the height - seems to top out at about 15-20'.  

I am on a large horse farm and this is planted on the back side of a hill that I've put a viewing patio on top of.  180 degrees where I planted the bamboo backs up to one of our hay fields that is cut 3-4 times a year so just like at my neighbors I expect that side to be controlled from the cutting.

On top of the hill is where I'm guessing I will have my work - if it starts coming over the top of the hill it could undermine the patio I've put up there.

But I really like the idea of a bamboo "curtain" on the hill and don't mind the ongoing maintenance really.  Just a lot of people REALLY hating on Bamboo has me a bit concerned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow!  Thanks.  Quite the setup you have.

First - I don't know the head pressure (sounds NSFW to me :P).  Seriously I did look at it when I was determining the right pump but I don't recall because I didn't really understand it - I just looked on the chart that told me which one.  My plan has been to add additional inline pumps once everything has been running for a while.

On the biofilter I think you are talking about something I have on my 300 gallon aquarium.  Basically they are called "bioballs" and you buy them by the mesh sack.  Each sack is filled with little plastic balls with something inside (seeder bacteria maybe?).  Anyway sounds like what you are suggesting is adding an upsized version of that.  Would you put it down at the cistern (inflow) end or just in front of where the water comes out of the waterfall?

Cattails I am definitely not getting rid of.  They are something I have always wanted and I'll fight whatever battles I need for them.

The bamboo was an after thought.  I am trying to find out what type of bamboo it is - running or clumping - before I decide if I need to pull it.  Normally one or two wackos telling me that something will kill me I can ignore.  But there was quite the cacophony of "KILL BAMBOO!!!!" going on in this thread that has me worried.   </TEXT>

I just picked up a used 330 gallon plastic cistern.  They are used frequently on farms and people are always trying to get ride of them.

I cut a whole in the top with a sawzall.  Built a basket out of 2x2s and enclosed it (except for the top) with bonded wire.

Just fill the basket with barley hay, add the microfiber aquatic filter and you are good to go. </TEXT>

No one in their right mind would WANT to be a CEO.  I have been CEO at multiple companies, private and public, and have hated every moment of it.  But when you found the companies you end up in the corner office most of the time whether you like it or not.

I'm fortunate enough to have a great president that we are promoting to CEO and that is letting me slip into the background and do what I love to do - design software.  But even that will only be for a few more years at most. 

Then I can focus full time on building crazy things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well first - permits if you need them.  We don't where we live but check with your DOR.  

It would be easiest, cheapest, and best to put your pond where you have either a small creek or spring.  That wasn't an option for where I wanted to place this thus the additional expense for the deep well.

Advice for getting started?  Get started.  The problem everyone has is they "dream" about what they want to do and then keep delaying by "planning" for every as a way to procrastinate.

You want a pond, start digging.  Figure it out as you go.  At least that's my motto. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't say it's better.  I've mixed enough wet mortar in my days.  I didn't like the idea of mixing it and moving every stone to mortar it in.

So I tried this method and it worked really well.  Remember this isn't like mortaring brick.  The only objective was to get the stones "set" so they don't move when you push up against them while swimming.

Saved me a ton a time and seems to have accomplished the objective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest desire right now is to find a permanent caretaker/groundskeeper.

We helped a young man that was going down the wrong path in life get straight and I had high hopes he would reach up and snatch the opportunity but I can see he isn't going to be reliable long-term.

The problem is finding someone that a) loves manual labor b) loves working outdoors c) loves learning new things and trying new things d) is loyal and reliable.

Once I have the caretaker cabin built - it will be a cute 1,200 sq ft 2 bed / 2 bath house - I'll start seriously looking for and vetting people until I can find someone that wants to help take care of this place with me and ultimately can manage it when my wife and I are off on other adventures. </TEXT>

Honestly, she is a saint.  I have been doing crazy DIY projects since she met me and she has pretty much gotten used to living in a constant construction zone.

I do think I almost pushed her over the edge with my lake house build that I did by offering to barter a camper we had in exchange for construction labor and I found two guys from MI on craigslist and invited them to drive down, live in the trailer on the property while we built it, and then take the trailer when they left.  She thought I was crazy but those guys are now great friends.

Oh, and she wasn't really hot on the baby skunk I found and raised int he house but that's a different story.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No you are seeing it right.  The firewood is about 30-36" high so it does block things a little bit if you are sitting. 

We kind of thought it broke things up a bit.  If we want to enjoy the pond we can sit in the Adirondack chairs on the sand beach. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No.  Right at about 30k total but I included some things that I probably could allocate to other projects (like the deep well that was 5k) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome!

Any you know what most people won't do?  Go on Craigslist!  For most of my building projects I find a good portion of what I need on there *cheap*.

I just bought a boatload of Peachtree windows for a cabin I am building on our lake.  If you can be flexible with sizes and things you can find lots of materials at great prices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL.  Honestly over a drunken evening that was discussed.

That and the original crazy idea I had to make the entire long side an infinity pool overlooking the pasture.

Luckily I sobered up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my.  That was the worst DIY abortion I have ever done.

First, I bought 4'x8' sheets of plexiglass mirrors that I found on Craigslist.  They come with a protective covering that you remove after installation.

So I build the damn thing, hung the mirrors, and then removed the coating - only to find that they a) are not clear like a glass mirror - more cloudy, less crisp but more importantly b) ANY slight variation in the underlying plywood transfers to the mirror so you end up with a funhouse effect.  

It was horrible.  I enjoyed the day I tore that back down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can get the liner in any size you want custom. I just searched craigslist and found a place in FL.  Ordered it and they delivered to my door (well, yard).

I did consider not using a liner.  I did a seep test since we have deep red GA clay.  But ultimately I decided to spend the money to minimize the seep that I would have to deal with.

I would always prefer to have a ground spring or creek run-in but that just wasn't in the cards for where I wanted to build this.

Bobcat - yes I have an LS170 New Holland.  I bought it used on craigslist.  Best investment I've ever made.  You should be able to rent one for a weekend for about $200.

Protip here - find a rental place closed on Sunday.  They will generally rent you the equipment for the full weekend for a one day rental rate.  If they don't advertise it, just ask.  Equipment sitting in the yard isn't making them any money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope.  No skeeters.  Actively circulated water prevents that along with thousands of frogs, lizards, and toads. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, the fish are separated by the smaller waterfall and the pea gravel area.

End to end the pond is just under 200'.  The swim pond is 35' diameter.  The natural swim end is about 40' wide at the widest. </TEXT>
