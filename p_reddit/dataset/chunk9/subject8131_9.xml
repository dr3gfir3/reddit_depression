Father Mulcahy: How do you figure, Hawkeye?

Hawkeye: Easy, Father. Tell me, who goes to Hell?

Father Mulcahy: Sinners, I believe.

Hawkeye: Exactly. There are no innocent bystanders in Hell. War is chock full of them - little kids, cripples, old ladies. In fact, except for some of the brass, almost everybody involved is an innocent bystander.

 On February 17, Whittington made a public statement that "We all assume certain risks in whatever we do. Whatever activities we pursue and regardless of how experienced, careful and dedicated we are, accidents do and will happen."[9] After being released from the hospital, he apologized to the Vice President and his family: "My family and I are deeply sorry for all that Vice President Cheney and his family have had to go through this week."

 In March 2012, Dollar General Manager Scott Strange and Regional Loss Prevention Manager Matt Irwin were conducting what was known as a shrinkage audit to investigate any employee thefts.
 
Two employees who admitted grazing violations told Strange and Irwin that other employees also ate inventory on occasion, naming Atkins as one of those. The pair was fired per store policy. In her interview, Atkins admitted drinking the juice and confirmed she did not steal it but paid for it, albeit after the fact. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The damages were compensatory, not punitive.

 As its name implies, "compensatory" means something that compensates for something else, typically a loss of some sort.

 nbsp;
 Punitive damages are essentially used to punish the at-fault party for particularly outrageous negligence or illegal activity that resulted in harm to someone else. The rationale is that if someone has to pay a large amount of money, they may think twice before engaging in such reckless behavior again.
