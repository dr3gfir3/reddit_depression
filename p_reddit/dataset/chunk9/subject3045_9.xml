	<TEXT> The scene in Wreck-It Ralph where Ralph destroys the kart in front of Vanellope. One of the saddest things I've ever seen in a movie. I know Disney loves to pull your heartstrings...but, holy shit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering the movie has been delayed multiple times (it was supposed to get a theatrical release in March), and is now going direct to video in July, it doesn't surprise me this movie is trash. Is there a twist, by the way? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's one of those movies that's faded into complete obscurity, and you never hear a word about it. But anyway, has anyone here seen it? You can find it on YouTube, and it's a 90's movie about bullying. Despite it's cheesiness (and trust me, this movie is the very definition of cliche and cheesy), it's definitely one of the most intense movies about bullying I've seen. I was surprised at how crude and violent the movie got at times with the bullying. The whole situation with the bully felt a bit unrealistic, though. It seems like all 3 of the kids could have collectively brushed him off. They made it seem like the bully was some super powerful force of nature.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Shyamalan is known for his twists, but you're really overthinking it. There's no way he would go as far to have us think the flashbacks belong to Casey if they were really Kevin's all along. Besides, in an interview for the movie, M Night was talking about Casey in the flashbacks and said something to the effect of - "She had this traumatic experience with her uncle". Shyamalan referring to the kid in those flashbacks as a "she" clearly means those flashbacks are of Casey when she was little girl. 

As for how the Beast formed, remember Kevin works at a zoo as a janitor. The Beast originated from the animals he saw on a daily basis, hence the Beast having tough skin like a rhino and being able to run fast, climb walls, and even bend steel bars. Not to mention the way he devoured those two girls is the same way a hungry lion or tiger devours its helpless prey. The Beast has traits of several zoo animals, and Patricia also mentions this. Also, I think Dennis was the personality that formed from Kevin's abuse by his mom. Kevin's mom was a neat freak who would abuse him if things weren't clean, and that's how Dennis formed. Hence why he has OCD and wants everything super clean. </TEXT>
