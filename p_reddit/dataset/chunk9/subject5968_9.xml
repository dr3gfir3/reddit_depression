	<TEXT> There Cant Be Two People Living in This Room

Is this a help me post? My prideful side says it isnt but that guys an asshole; help me.
******

Ill get straight to it. Theres someone else in this room. 
How do I know this? I find her hair every day in places that range from meh to what the hell?, if that makes any sense. 

Ive also found her journal. 

I know, I know; narrator-finds-spooky-journal-in-room-events-begin-to-unravel-BOOM-Paranormal Activity

Its not like that, I promise. 
*****

Maybe I should start from the beginning 	

My commander moved me into this room in a rush. Yes, Im in the Army and this is a barracks room. Its meant for two people to coexist in with very little privacy; two beds, two desks, two lamps, two trash cans, two sinks, two night stands, one toilet, one shower, one door, one window.  Two closets.  Two closets that lock.  Theres the shred of privacy this room offers: a closet that locks. Cool. 

That said, Im the only one in here.  

Well, at least I thought I was. 

The day I moved in here, I inventoried the room. Inventoried is a trumped-up phrase that basically means I looked around the room to make sure it was suitable for human usage and then threw all my shit in the closet and went to bed. I think I signed for the room and everything in it, but then again I may not have. All I really know is that I sleep here. And I havent been sleeping well. 

I remember that the first morning I woke up here, I got out of bed, went to the bathroom, got in the shower, and proceeded to pull one very long, black hair out from behind my ear as I scrubbed my head. 

I have red hair. 

 I am a male. 

Males in the Army arent allowed to have hair that sheds at almost 10 inches in length. 

 Thus bringing me to the conclusion that this was a females hair. 

 I brushed the occurrence off; Im married and know the perturbation that is finding my wifes hair literally everywhere all too well. I told myself, It must have come from somewhere. Ill just deep clean the room and vacuum and get rid of all of it, even if I cant see it. 

So I did.

 Its called a G.I. Party and basically you strip the room bare of furniture and go to town on that motherfucker with a mop, scrub brush, some water, some bleach, and some carpet cleaner. Everything gets a good coating of water and bleach (maybe Pine Sol if youre really trying hard), the carpet gets scrubbed by hand, and then you rinse everything off and let it dry for a couple hours before you hit the carpet with a vacuum and then move all the furniture back in.  Boom. Clean as a whistle, right?

Obviously not. 

I woke up the next morning and got in the shower. 

There was a single, long, black hair stuck to the wall of the shower. 

I know it wasnt there before. I know. 

But there it was. 

A few nights later, I noticed that this room really gets dark. I mean, like, cant-see-your-hand-in-front-of-your-face dark. This is an odd observation, because this barracks is notorious for soldiers putting up black out curtains on their windows in light, literally, of the fact that the windows sit situated in that perfect position where the sun blinds you in the morning as it comes up, and burns you up in the evening as it sets. 

But not my room. It gets *dark* in this motherfucker. Weird, right?

Its a bit ominous to be housed in a room that seems to relish the pitch black, and Ill admit that, every so often, I wonder if theres something moving behind the black veil that envelopes this room every night. 

*Okay*, Ive thought to myself, *this rooms a bit unsettling, but youre a reasonable person, do the math. Work the problem.*

Alright, the room can be opened one of two ways: either by card key, kind of like a hotel, or by hard key, like any normal door.  Okay, Im the only one with a hard key other than the master that all the sergeants have. 

But is a sergeant coming in this room and leaving her hair in my shower, one strand at a time?

Answer: most likely not; none of the female sergeants in this company know where Im staying because Im just assigned here temporarily. Plus, thats weird and I cant see a sergeant doing that to be creepy. Theres way too many Army regulations against being a creep, anyway. 

So maybe its another regular soldier whos getting in with their access card or something; maybe someone who stayed in this room who can still get in?

Answer: The card reader is broken. I put in a request for the batteries to be changed in it but the maintenance guy said the thing is just broken and needs to be replaced. So nobodys getting in that way. 


So, thus far, my conclusions led me to a fairly solid understanding that I am one of very few people who can get through this door and that there are even fewer who would do so for some dubious reason like leaving their long, black hairs scattered about. 

Hell, I dont even think theres a black-haired member of the cadre in this company anyway. 

Yet I keep finding hair.

Sometimes it'll be in my boot. Other times, I'll find it hanging limply from the back of one of the chairs. 

I'll find the hair in a pocket of a uniform, or, more disturbingly, laying across my face when I wake up. 

Moving on.

Then comes the third observation: Something or someone pissed on my bedding, and it wasnt me. 

I woke up two mornings ago to the extremely strong and familiar scent of urine. Ive worked in EMS and around animals enough to know what piss smells like. This particular aroma was a combination of dehydrated human and very rotten, old cat. It was gross. 

The issue was that when I went to bed, my bedding didnt smell like that. 

And, on top of that, I didnt even use the bedding that night; I slept under my woobie, which any respectable Army member knows all about. I love my woobie. CIF can go fuck themselves if they think Im turning it back in when I ETS. 

But yeah, my blankets absolutely reeked of this hybrid urine stink. 

I threw them in the trash yesterday. I can deal with most gross stuff, but piss-ruined things just go in the garbage, fuck salvaging them. The smell usually never washes out anyway, so why bother?

Now, I certainly didnt piss on the bedding. And I doubt that any sergeant from this company, wearing a wig of long, black hair and carrying one very old and dehydrated cat, did either. 

So who did?

Heres my guess: Amy-Lynn did it. 

*Who the hell is Amy-Lynn?!,* you may be asking. 

Amy-Lynn left her journal in this room. 

Amy-Lynn may also have left herself in this room.

Her journal starts off innocently enough, chronicling her decision to join the military and how proud she wanted to make her family and young daughter. I honestly felt bad for opening her private notebook, but she turned out to be a pretty good and coherent writer and I sort of enjoyed reading her journey through the initial entry into the military. 

At some point, though, she started to have trouble. She fought. She had an attitude with the cadre. She got fired from leadership positions. She fought some more. She missed home. She had to write essays on the importance of discipline. She missed home some more. It got pretty rough for her, from the look of it. But that happens to everybody, in some fashion when you're just starting out; I knocked a kid out in BCT because he refused to pronounce my name correctly. Still dont know why that mattered so much to me at the time, but fuck if he was going to screw my name up anymore on purpose, you know? 

Yeah, anyway, Amy-Lynn *really* started going through some shit, though. Her notes started to ramble. Her handwriting got worse. She started journalling later and later at night (she time stamped every note). And she started forgetting words in sentences; a misplaced the, or absent, and, occurring more frequently. 

Im not sure what exactly was happening with her, but to me it seems a little bit like a mental break. Like she just couldnt process everything fast enough and stuff started to snowball on her, you know? 

Her last entry fumbled through an account of how she fought with her roommate and the other girl ended up getting switched to a different barracks room because of it. 

So Amy-Lynn ended up alone in this room, at some point, while dealing with what I believe to be a psychotic melt down. 

As far as I know, these barracks have been here for at least 10 years, and the females stopped living anywhere but the fourth floor about 3 years ago. Which means Amy-Lynn lived in this room from anywhere between 2006 to 2013. 

I sincerely hope she has not been in this room that long.

For her sake and mine. 

Mainly mine. 

Fuck this room gets dark. 

Ive got my computer brightness turned down so it doesnt burn my retinas out, but it sincerely feels like Im typing this from the inside of a black velvet box. 

And all the while I get the feeling that there are eyes on the other side of the room; watching and waiting. Watching and waiting. 

Can you help me figure this out? Anything would be appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My name is Melanie Jane Nance, today is March 22nd, 2016, and Ive waited a very long time for this.
*****

When I was growing up, I remember walking into my parents room and seeing my Dad on top of a woman. It wasnt my mom.

Dad told me to never breathe a word of what I saw to anyone. Ever. He told me that good girls love their daddies no matter what they do, and that hed always love me no matter what *I* did. I remember his eyes being so full of love when he said that. My Daddy meant so much to me, and I knew hed never hurt me. I believed him when he said hed always love me.

But I didnt love Patty. And she didnt love me either. She just loved my Daddy. And God. I heard her say Gods name a lot when they were together.

I hated Pattys face. She had this smile that, to everyone else, seemed to say, I love you, I am so glad youre in my life right now. To me, I knew it was a smile that said, I hate every inch of your existence.

One night, in high school, I snuck over to Pattys house after work at the restaurant. She was putting on makeup in her mirror; I could see her through the window.

I knocked on her front door.

She looked surprised to see me.

Melanie?, I remember her asking, as if she didnt know it was me.

I finished fixing up her face for her that night. She didnt need all that makeup anyway.

A few weeks later I met James. He was with another girl at a dinner/dance for my school. The other girl was Karen, someone who my friends were friends with, but we werent really friends. I stole James from her that night.

Karen hated me for that.

But that was okay, James and I started our lives that night. What other people thought didnt matter anymore. All that mattered was that he looked at me with those same eyes that my daddy did all those years ago. Those eyes that said, No matter what you do, Ill always love you.

Thats why, that day in the house, after Id phoned 911, thats why I knew James had come back to me.

I know it was him.

His smell gave him away. I always liked that smell. The way it would roll off him while we were tangled up in bed together. A mixture of Old Spice aftershave and lavender soap. I knew it was him when he walked in the door of that house.

When the police escorted me out, I knew I couldnt let that be the last time that I got to be his wife. That house should be mine. He should be mine.

*Mine*.

And he knows it.

Its why he always comes back.

He wont have any other choice, now that Ive fixed everything.

It was so easy. So easy to follow her to work. To wait in the parking lot, biding my time. Im very good at waiting.

She was late leaving the school building. Her pretty hair and silky dress were blowing in the cool breeze as she walked out to her car. God, I hated that happy look on her face.

*Someone should wipe that off for her*, I thought.

And then I stepped around from behind the car.

The baseball bat connected with the side of her head and she shrieked. She never saw me coming. Like I said, Im good at this.

I wiped her face off for her. My swings gradually sinking deeper and deeper into her skull. That same wet impact I remembered from the forest five years ago

She was still gurgling, I could see the air bubbles coming up through the wrecked hole that used to be her mouth.

I leaned down in close to her and whispered, *Mine*.

The bat was in two pieces in my hand. I dropped the thickest part next to her head as I walked away. Her initial scream hadnt even attracted the school security guard; he was still asleep in his car where hed been all day.

See, James is mine. Hes been mine since I laid eyes on him in high school. Through everything we went through together, even that night in the woods, hes never not been mine. Thats why he comes back to me. When we first met, I remember how he would look into my eyes and say, Forever. And I knew he meant it. He loved me for who I was. He still loves me for who I am.

Hes *my* monster.

Every time he comes back, theres less and less of him left. But I know hes still in there, somewhere inside that shell.

I know hes still mine.

*Mine*.

Oh good, theres the ambulance. I guess somebody noticed her. About time.

My name is Melanie Jane Nance and Im *very* good at waiting. March 22nd, 2016

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My name is Allen Hutchins and something weird happened on March 9th, 2016.

Well, things have been "weird" for awhile, but I guess a guy with a blown off face who looks a lot like your partner might take the cake.
*****

I should probably explain what I mean.

Jimmy- I never call him James- and I have been best friends since high school. Since before that crazy chick Melanie walked into his life and nearly fucking ended it.

I remember when he met Mel.

He'd just come off a bad breakup with this extremely gorgeous girl named Erica. When she broke it off with Jimmy as suddenly as she did, I thought I'd never see my friend smile again.

But then one night he came back from a party with a bunch of kids from another school, raving about this "incredible" girl he'd met while he was there. Her name was Melanie and you'd have thought this girl was made of fucking gold or something, the way he described her. In his mind, especially at the beginning, she could do no wrong.

The first time I actually met her, I almost gagged when I saw the way she clung to Jimmy's arm, her eyes barely ever leaving his face. To me, it was disgusting how much she adored him, but I guess to anyone else it must have been just the cutest thing they'd ever seen. I remember I had to tell her my name twice. Whatever, she never cared to get it right anyway; she was always calling me Alex. God, that was fucking annoying.

Jimmy was a hit with her family. They loved that their only daughter, the princess of the family, had found herself a boy who didn't seem like he just wanted to "hit it and quit it".

Theyre so cute! became the chorus around our hometown whenever people would see them out in public together. I just grit my teeth and grinned through it; no way was I going to bad-mouth my best friends relationship, especially not in front of them. Jimmy meant a lot to me. He still does. I mean, the guy changed my life. Well, the better way to put that is that he saved my life, and then a lot of things changed after that.

Spring Break of Sophomore year in college, we got the bright idea to go camping up in the mountains in eastern Arkansas. I had no idea what the fuck I was doing, agreeing to go on as ambitious of a trip as Jim had planned, but we were going to be having bro time and, better yet, Mel wasnt going to be coming with us. Seemed like a solid plan to me, right?

We must have hiked something like 18 miles that first day out. Jimmy, ever the adventure seeker, wanted us to push as far into the wilderness as we could. I, on the other hand, thought that every clearing we bypassed seemed like a good place to make camp and start in on the alcohol wed brought along with us.

That night seems like a blur now.

We made camp when the sun started to set and the rain moved in. We built a fire, ate some dinner, and were just popping open our first beers of the night when Jims fucking phone buzzed in his pocket.

To this day, I have no idea how there was cell signal so far out in the middle of the damn forest, but fuck me if it wasnt Melanie texting up a storm, trying to figure out why Jimmy hadnt responded to her in 4 hours. Jesus, that girl drove me up the wall. My buddy must have been a strong man to not be annoyed by her or he was just that damn good at not showing it. Either way, stronger man than I.

He put the phone away, finally, and we kicked back a couple more brews before we crawled into the tent and knocked out.

The next thing I remember is Jimmy dragging my barely-conscious ass out of the tent as the sound of rushing water issued from somewhere extremely close by.

In the night, the river had risen a good 20 feet and was in the process of washing away our campsite. My sorry ass had been so dead asleep, that had Jim not acted as quickly as he did, I damn sure would have been floating down that roaring river, probably never to be seen again.

He pulled me, still zipped up in my sleeping bag, at least 200 feet up a steep embankment.

Thanks for dragging me across all those damn rocks, dickhead, I remember ribbing him.

That was a lot closer than I thought itd be, he mumbled, staring down at the still-rising waters of the Buffalo river.

We hoofed it back to the truck and drove all night to get back to the university campus. I guess we probably got in around 12:30 or 1 in the afternoon. We were wet, muddy, and extremely tired.

So when my phone started blowing up as soon as I got it charged in my room, I was, to put it nicely, fucking pissed.

-Allen, oh my god. Melanie is such a raging bitch. I need you to calm me down-

It was my girlfriend, Elyse. Texting me with more ferocity than Id ever seen her display in my life. There must have been 20+ messages, all to the tune of: -I just watched Mel inviting some guy up to her room to watch a movie, what do you think I should do? Do you want to tell James?-

-Dude, WTF?! The third guy tonight just went in her room. I feel like such a creep spying out my peephole. But shes such a bitch. Can I have permission to beat her face in?-

It went on and on. The messages started from two hours after we left the day before and went all the way up until the time when we pulled back on campus in Jims swamp-ass truck. That bitch Melanie must have booted her last muse out when she realized Jimmy was back on campus. Things were headed downhill. Fast.

How was I supposed to let my best friend know that the girl he called the love of his life was fucking around on him with, not one, but at least three other guys?

I couldnt believe it the first time he called Mel that, actually. I always figured he was biding his time, waiting for the right moment to break it off with her. He had to have seen she was nuts, right? But I guess that was Jim, always sacrificing himself for the sake of others. Id seen it first hand not even 24 hours before.

I regret this next set of events so much that, even 5 years later, it still makes me physically sick to think about.

Not knowing what to do, or how to confront Jimmy with the truth, I did what any college kid does in a stressful situation: I fell asleep.

I woke up hours later with a bunch of annoyed texts from Elyse, and one from Jim that read:

-Hey man, Mel and I are headed back out to the campsite to try to find all the gear we lost. She said she wanted to help, guess she missed me while we were gone. Haha. Later brother, see you when we get back.-

Fuck.

If there was anyone I did NOT want to be out in the woods alone with, other than the fucking Sasquatch, it was probably Melanie.

Deep down, I had this gut feeling that tonight was going to be bad. Bad for me or for Jimmy, I wasnt sure, but this time I couldnt just fall back asleep.

I hurried down stairs, stopping to grab Elyse from her dorm despite her protests, jumped in my 4Runner, and headed back toward the campsite. It would take hours, but I knew I needed to be doing what I was doing, even if I couldnt explain that to Elyse in human language. Sometimes you just know, you know?

Im not sure how we managed it, especially in the damn dark, but eventually Elyse and I made it to Jim and Is flooded out camp ground. The water had receded during the day, leaving behind a muddy, swampy, disgusting tract of forest that was scattered with various bits of our abandoned gear.

As we got to the point where I was pretty sure we had put our tent, I thought I heard a skittering sound off in the trees, just outside the beam of my flashlight.

Allen, what the hell was that?, I heard Elyse whisper.

I pulled her in close to me, sensing that someone or something else was there with us.

SCRUNCH

I whirled around and for a split second could have sworn I saw wavy brown hair and a maroon jacket fleeing the exposure of my light.

That was when I heard the groaning.

Behind us, there was this sickening, wet, low cry of pain coming from the damp, dark woods.

It was Jimmy.

I ran to him, sloshing through inches of mud and muck, not caring anymore about the eerie feeling of being watched from a distance.

His face was almost fucking caved in.

Oh my god dude, whatd she do to you?, I remember saying as I flipped him over to keep him from fucking suffocating in the mud.

And then Elyse was by my side and we were tearing our clothes to make bandages and sloshing water into his mouth, desperately trying to keep my best friend from fucking dying in my arms.

Now it was my turn to save him.

That was the last time I think Ive been afraid in the face of death. Something about basically holding your best friends life in your hands has a tendency to shift your priorities. Things changed for me that night; I discovered that snatching people from the jaws of death was a terrifying, exhilarating experience that gave me a high more than any drug Id ever tried in my life.

I have Jimmy to thank for that realization. Like I said, the dude changed my life.

Once Jim recovered, I told him about my decision to become a Paramedic. Even in his drugged-up stupor, even with a semi-crushed face, my best friend still found the strength to smile and mumble the words, Thats awesome, brother. Youll be amazing at that.

Jim doesnt remember much from that night. He says sometimes hell have flashes of what happened, like a half-remembered dream, but hes still not sure of the details of what exactly happened out there in those lonely woods.

Nobody has seen Melanie since that night, either.

I think she finally fucking lost it and attacked my best bud out there in the dark. She knew she was going to have to face up to the fact that she was cheating at some point, and Id bet dollars to donuts she planned to leave Jimmy for dead out there once shed satisfactorily demolished his face.

Thankfully, something about that night broke Jim of his infatuation with that crazy, crazy bitch.

He doesnt talk much about her anymore. In fact, I had the honor of being Jimmys best man last year as he wed the real love of his life, Sarah.

Sarah is so beautiful, and so much the polar opposite of Melanie that I have to resist jumping up and down like a kid in a Lego store every time I see them together. She loves Jim. Shes kind, understanding, and always comforts him when he has his nightmares. Shes even learned to cope with the mental fog that Jim has sometimes suffered from ever since Melanie nearly killed him in those lonely woods almost 5 years ago.

Shes good for him, and he absolutely deserves someone like her after what he went through with Mel.

Now, about the weird stuff. As if everything Ive said so far hasnt been weird enough.

The day we got the call for Jims house, I felt my heart sink into my damn feet.

No way could he lose Sarah so abruptly like that. No way. Life is a fucking bitch, but I didnt realize how much of one it could be until that moment.

So imagine my god damn surprise when we walked into the bedroom and found some fucking random guy with his face shot off laying on the floor.

I went into Medic Mode and just started doing my job. But I couldnt help but notice the similarities between the no-face guy and my partner, Jimmy, who was kneeling at the guys feet with this look on his face like someone had hit him in the head with a brick.

No-face guy was built just like Jim. Tough upper body, scars here and there, even a half-sleeve tattoo on his arm, although it looked a bit different and of less quality than Jimmys Demon of Razgriz sleeve.

I had to shake off the eeriness of the situation and just get to work trying to save this dude. Details be damned, just do your job, right?

At some point Jim shook off that foggy look too and we were operating like we always do, our decision-making process in sync, never needing to ask for what the other person was already handing our way. Fuck, were a good team. And we did what we could for that poor guy.

As we loaded that faceless man onto our cot and hurried him to the truck, I could have sworn I saw a mess of wavy brown hair and a maroon jacket entering a police cruiser parked on the street

*Not possible. Focus, you*, I remember thinking.

Homeboy made it to the hospital, but I was there when the trauma doc called the resuscitory efforts off and pronounced the guy dead. Nothing we could do except our best. And thats what we did.

Well, shit, dispatch is giving us a call. Id better finish this up, quick.

They finally put James back to work after a week or so off. The dead guy in his house shook him up pretty bad, though he hasnt mentioned seeing Mel at all.

Maybe I imagined it? Thats probably for the best.

I need my bud to help keep me sane sometimes, so I cant have him going off the deep end, at least not before I do.

God, this job really grinds on you at times. Wed better answer this call before dispatch has us written up.

My names Allen Hutchins, and my partner, Jimmy Nance, is doing just fine on March 20th, 2016.

My name is Melanie Jane Nance, and my husband, James Edgar Nance, died on March 9th, 2011.

I have killed him every year since that day. Five times now. 

He always comes back.
*****

I guess I need to start at the beginning. 

We met in high school. He was funny, goofy, and kind of cute, even for a band nerd. But I was a band nerd too, and it felt nice to be around someone who liked the same things I did.

He didnt know he was my first boyfriend. The look on his face was so funny when he realized he was my first kiss; a mixture of shock, embarrassment, and humility that just made me like him even more. He said it meant more to him, too, knowing it was my first. He was that kind of guy.

James was my first everything: My first kiss, my first boyfriend, my first love, my first orgasm, best friend, fiancee, and eventually husband. We were married when we were 22, fresh out of college after nearly 5 years of dating and engagement. I was so ready to be his that I ignored the truth, the reality, of what he became during our Sophomore year of college. 


He had said it would be nothing. That it was just a spontaneous, fun trip to the Ozark mountains for some Spring Break camping. Just he and a friend named Alex. Theyd be gone three days, tops. 

And then, like clockwork, the Buffalo river flooded in the same area it had every spring for the past 5 years. Only a year before, a family of four was swept away in the rising flood waters after camping too close to the river bed. It was likely, the authorities said, that the family washed away as they slept, never realizing the danger creeping up on them in the night. 

I got a text from him on March 8th at around 9 at night:

I cant believe theres cell signal out here, but I wanted to let you know that were done for the day. It started raining earlier but were headed to bed now. I love you, good night.

He always told me goodnight. Even after our biggest fights, me storming away to recompose myself or him frustratedly shrugging off back to his dorm, I could always count on that good night message. 

It reassured me that he was okay and still thinking about me, even out there on his bro time trip. So I fell asleep.

I snapped awake as my phone vibrated itself off my bedside table and onto the floor.

Picking it up, I noticed a text from James:

Rain picked up during the night. Woke up with everything in the tent floating. Abandoned camp when we saw rushing water 20 feet away from us. Heading to higher ground. I love you.

It worried me that at 3 in the morning, out in the middle of nowhere, my boyfriend was abandoning a flooded campsite and moving further into the dark woods. 

I felt helpless, but he always told me about being a Boy Scout and I figured he knew what he was doing out there. 

I fell back asleep.

At 9 that morning a knock on my door woke me up. It was James. Somehow, in 5 hours, he had trudged at least 15 miles, in the rain, through the Ozark foothills, made it back to his truck, and back to our college campus, 4 hours away. 

I should have seen it then. Should have known right then that something sinister was happening. But it was 9 in the morning during Spring Break, and I hadnt had any coffee yet. 

All the rest of that morning was spent in a bliss of making out and getting hands-y in my empty dorm. 

But then, his attitude turned somber, his tone and expression aloof.

I need to go back out there. I left something, he said suddenly, his eyes clouding up like they did when he was regretting a decision. 

It was dark when we got back to where his campsite had been. We had driven all afternoon. 

He led me deep into the woods, always staying ahead of me. It almost felt like he had forgotten I was with him, but every now and then he would shoot me a worried glance, his eyes full of apprehension, darting around as if he expected someone else to be trailing after us. 

As we reached a clearing, he suddenly whirled on me, and the powerful man I always knew he could be was inexplicably forcing me to the damp forest floor. Not knowing what was happening, I half-resisted him. If this was some sexual thing, I wanted him to feel like he at least earned his prize, you know? 

But his eyes seemed dead. There was no life behind the bright grey-blue that I usually looked up into when he was on top of me. 

It scared me, and I began to fight back. Hard. 

And that was when hehissed at me.

I scrambled to my feet and tried to run. He caught my ankle as I turned and I kicked back, trying to break his grasp.

I guess I kicked harder than I thought I could, though, because as my foot hit him square in the face, I heard a sickening *CRACK* and felt a wet, damp impact. He dropped right where he knelt, a pool of blood forming around his head as he lay face down in the leaves and dirt. 

I knew he was dead. I had just killed the love of my life. And I screamed. I screamed my voice to shreds. I screamed until all that came out was a harsh, torn sound like static turned up too loud. 

Every year since then I have killed James, in one way or another, when he inevitably returns to me.

Its always the same. March 9th, a knock at the door, I open it, and there he is. 

Ive poisoned him, Ive lured him into car accidents, stabbed him, and just yesterday I brought him into our bedroom and shot him in the head. 

Sometimes I let him stay. Sometimes I finish him off immediately. 

In 2014 I kept his third version alive long enough for us to get married. We were 22 by then. The ceremony was beautiful, and I was such a happy bride. 

Nobody knew that the man standing next to me, kissing me at the altar, dancing with me at the reception, was a sham. A shell, the husk of my husband filled withsomething else. 

Nobody knew that the woman in the beautiful white dress, looking up at her groom in adoration, seemingly filled with hope for her new married life, was a murderer. 

I killed that version of him after we consummated our marriage that night, my wedding dress stinking of sex and gore as I stuffed his remains into the dumpster behind the hotel. 

Our honeymoon consisted of me drinking alone on a beach in Cozumel. I was hammered for 9 straight days. 

The truth of it is that I can always count on him coming back to me. I just come up with a different excuse for his prolonged absence every time he disappears. 

Sometimes hes working out of country. Other times hes on a dedicated night shift at the ambulance company. Sometimes I put on my best devastated wife face and claim hes run off with another woman in California. 

Yesterday there was a knock at the door. 

It was him.

I already told you that I lured him to bed. I put on my hungriest eyes for him, did my best to entice what little of his humanity he had left. 

He stalked toward me on the bed and took his normal place on top of me. His weight felt good against my hips and, just for a second, I imagined that it was really him again. I imagined that I had my love back

And then I put the gun against his temple and pulled the trigger. 

Not for the first time was I covered in my husbands blood. 

I pushed him off of me, picked up the phone, and dialed 911. 

I told the officers my husband had just committed suicide. Again, I put on the best devastated wife show in history. 

They ushered me out the back door as the EMS crew came in the front, and for a second I thought I saw

No, he never comes back that fast. 

Ill be moving out, I suppose. Its hard to hush up your husbands death when the cops and paramedics and news vans are all parked outside your house. 

Maybe in this new life, he wont find me. 

Maybe this will all be over. 

I can only hope. 

My name is Melanie Jane Nance and I killed my husband for the fifth time on March 9th, 2016.

Goodbye.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My name is James Edgar Nance and I died in Little Rock, Arkansas on the 9th of March, 2016. 

I have no idea how I am able to tell you that.

Because I am very much alive. 
*****

It happened like this:

My partner and I were sitting at the Burger King at the corner of Markham and Chenal Parkway, quietly cat-napping in the cab of our Ambulance. 

I'm an EMT-B and my partner, Allen, is a Paramedic. 

Paramedics save lives, EMT's save Paramedics. It's an old saying that I like to remind Allen of whenever he starts thinking he's an EMS God. 

Really, I just drive the truck and make sure I don't kill him while he's taking care of the patient in the box. 

So we're sitting at BK, trying to catch some extra rest, when the radio crackles to life. 

-"Unit 722, you have an incoming emergency in the area of Evergreen and Mississippi."-

Sleepily, I grabbed the radio and mumbled, "22, go ahead with that call", while straightening my seat up and buckling my seat belt.

Dispatch replied back a few moments later:

-"22, start toward the area of Evergreen and Mississippi, hold back in the area 'til I get further."-

I felt my blood start to pump a little harder; we were headed to *my* neighborhood. 

Any time Dispatch tells us to "hold back" on a call, it means there is potentially a dangerous situation still in the works of being controlled by the Little Rock Police. My EMS company has a strict policy that we do not go onto unsecured scenes if the dispatcher feels there is a risk to us, the responding crew. If someone else is hurt, why should we get hurt too? That's the logic behind the policy.

I shifted the truck into drive and pulled away from our shady napping spot and started in the direction of the call. 

Any time we hold back on a call, it usually gives us the chance to park the truck and sit somewhere for a few minutes before we're cleared to go in safely. In this instance, that pause in response would have given my partner and I to wipe some of the sleep from our eyes and be fully awake when we finally rolled up on scene. 

Unfortunately, that wasn't the case.

Dispatch radioed us again as we made the turn up Mississippi toward Evergreen:

-"722, your scene is secure. You're responding to 7502 N Street, as in November, for a 9 Echo 1. Little Rock Police on scene. Time en route, 1425."-

I jammed the accelerator of that ambulance down as far as it would go, and likely would have dug it into the pavement below us had it not been for the floorboard. 

A 9 Echo 1 is the call determinant that tells us a patient is unresponsive, pulse-less, and not breathing.

We were headed to my house. 
Where my wife and I live.

Allen was hanging on for dear life as I rounded the 90 degree corner onto N street at a cool 45 miles an hour, the G-force warning indicator under his seat screaming at me that I was on the verge of rolling our box over.

I looked square at him as we screeched to a halt in front of my house.
"You had better fucking save her or I'll beat you to death. Let's go to fucking work", I said. 
All he did was nod. That was all I needed him to do. 

We yanked our supplies out of the back and hustled to my front door. The front door of my home where the person I loved more than anything else in all of existence was currently trying to leave me, forever. 

A cop tried to stop me as I crossed my threshold, saying, "It's pretty nasty, dude. I don't know if there's much you can do."

"Get the fuck out of my way and never say anything like that to me again", I spat back in his face.

As I stepped through the front door, I thought I saw a mess of wavy brown hair and maroon hoodie leaving through the back. 

*Focus*, I thought, *she needs you*.

Another officer waved me into my own bedroom. The familiar smell of my wife's dry shampoo, her robe tossed haphazardly on the bed where I saw her drop it this morning, my wad of clothes in the corner, not really clean, not really dirty, still wearable, every detail stood out as I steeled myself for what I was about to find on the far side of our bed. 

I stopped abruptly in my tracks. 

It wasn't my wife on the floor, trying to die. Not my wife at all. 

It was me. 

The impossibility of the situation was overshadowed, somehow, by the fact that most of his (my) face was gone. 

"Looks like he shot himself", said the officer behind me, "We found the .40cal handgun next to him."

Neither Allen nor I said a word. We just went to work. 

On me. 

He, well, I, was still breathing. 

I could see the air bubbling up through the crimson blood issuing from the mess that had once been my face. A breathing patient is a live patient, and I reached for the trauma backpack, yanking out the bag-valve-mask and O2 tubing and attaching both to his face and the portable O2 on the floor next to me. Not a moment later I noticed his respiratory effort give out. 

I checked for a pulse and felt none. 

"He just coded", I vocalized loudly to Allen. 

"Put him on the monitor, put the shock pads on his chest", Allen shot back. 

I unpacked our heart monitor and connected the defibrillator pads to the charging port. Then I stuck the pads to his chest. 

His familiar anatomy momentarily distracted me; the scar on the right collar bone from a nasty hockey stick slash, the half-sleeve tattoo of the Demon of Razgriz on the left arm, the trimmed abdominal hair from when I "man-scaped" two days ago. 

It was definitely me. 

As if from a distance, I heard Allen say, "Asystole, begin CPR." 

I began doing chest compressions on myself. 

Our CPR protocols state that after 2 minutes of quality rescue breathing and chest compressions, we're allowed a brief pause to let our heart monitor re-analyze the patient for any sign of a recoverable heart rhythm. 

The mechanical, robotic voice of the monitor blared out, "Analyzing rhythm, DO NOT touch the patient. DO NOT touch the patient."

As the machine finished its work, the flat line of the leads readout began to change, its place taken by a flitting, irregular pattern that we call an "agonal rhythm". Agonal heart rhythms are a really solid indicator that someone is circling the drain but hasn't quite been flushed down the death tube yet. 

Agonal heart rhythms are also candidates for getting a big, fat ZAP from the defibrillator. 

And that's what we did. 

And we kept ZAP-ping him (me) all the way to the hospital, in an effort to keep me alive. 

Our ambulance ripped into the parking bay of the University Hospital and no sooner had we stopped than Allen and a tag-along firefighter had him out of the box, and into the Emergency Room. 

Meanwhile, I stepped out of the cab and promptly threw up my entire existence onto the sidewalk outside the ER doors. 

How was this possible?

I had entered that house, *my* house, fully prepared to snatch my darling wife back from the threshold of death, only to be presented with my own, barely-alive, severely-maimed, almost-corpse self. 

*What the FUCK is going on?!*, I screamed internally. 

I stepped into the University ER just as I saw the trauma response doctors leaving the room. They were pulling off their blue exam gloves, shaking their heads. 

"What dumb fuck shoots themselves in the head and *misses*?", I heard one say to the other. 

Allen stepped out from behind the curtain in the room. 

"They're about to call it. Nothing we could do man", he said as he walked past. 

I pulled the curtain open and stepped in just as I heard a physician say, "...time of death, 1408."

The nurses and doctors began to quietly excuse themselves from the room. I felt somebody pat my shoulder as they passed, probably as a "nice try" condolence or something. 

They had no idea. 

Allen had no idea. 

It was beginning to dawn on me that the combination of my missing face, my insistence on social privacy, and the fact that my wife never saw me walk in meant that *nobody* realized the gravity of what was really happening.

Nobody knew that I had just watched myself die. 

I wish that were the end of the strange things that have been happening. 

This is why I need your help. 

Because I died.

But I'm alive.

My name is James Edgar Nance and I am alive in Little Rock, Arkansas on the 18th of March, 2016.

	<TEXT> Alright, let's get the formalities out of the way first. 

My name is 2nd Lieutenant Sean Smith of the Minnesota Air National Guard 109th Airlift Squadron, 133rd Airlift Wing. I am a navigator on board the H and J models of the C-130 Hercules aircraft. I am a part of a crew of three commissioned and two enlisted personnel who act as Pilots, Navigator (me), Flight Engineer, and Load Master. 

My job is to correctly plot our course of travel on any given mission, provide corrections and advice on scheme of maneuvers in the case of mission alteration, and to advise the Load Master on distance, direction, and speed of the aircraft in order to facilitate the off-loading of personnel and supplies. Basically I tell the guy in the back when to open the door and get ready to shove people/things out of the airplane. 

Enough of that, though.

Our planes have low-light television feeds in order to show us what's going on outside the aircraft from various angles. We also have an on-board Forward Looking Infra-Red (FLIR) array on the nose of the aircraft. All that to say, we can see in the dark. 

For the past two nights, we have had cancelled, or, as we call them, "scrubbed", missions on account of the fact that there have been multiple sightings of unidentifiable, person-shaped objects interfering with flight line activity. 

I was on one of the cancelled aircraft. 
*****

Sitting at my station just aft of the engineer and pilot's chairs, I was startled when I heard one of the two pilots yelp and jump hard enough in his seat to whack his head against the glass panel on his side of the cockpit. 

It was nearing 2 AM so I kind of suspected he had nodded off during pre-flight and done one of those spastic, "hypnic jerk"s and scared himself awake. 

Then, Brandon, the engineer, hissed in surprise and I looked up to the cockpit window in time to see a dark, shadowy figure *run* past the nose of the aircraft. This would have been all well and good, were it not for the fact that our front windows are about 35 vertical feet off of the ground. 

There was a thud against the side of the aircraft.

Right in front of my navigator station.

Then, a long, painfully loud screeching, tearing noise swept down the right side of the aircraft. 

At this point, the pilots turned on the TV and FLIR feeds to be able to see what was going on. The aircraft commander popped his window open and poked his head out of the cabin to see what caused the noise.

Simultaneously, the TV feed picked up four shapes running straight at the nose of our aircraft, and the AC ducked his head *quickly* back inside the airplane. 

He was as white as the socks on his feet. And the guy is Hawaiian. 

I don't know what he saw, but the AC didn't talk to us the rest of the night. I mean, the lights were on, but nobody was home. 
*****

Before I go any further, I should clarify that we're not in Minnesota right now. We're in Little Rock, Arkansas, training at Jacksonville AFB, "The Home of the Combat Airlift". 

J-ville has a *really* bad reputation for having absolute shit security. There have been something like 9 unauthorized incursions onto the base in the last year and two fatal shootings at both the main entrances. 

The last guy the Security Forces zapped ran the gate at the north entrance, got out of his vehicle screaming about how Colonel Sanders and Ulysses S. Grant sent him to kill the "Black Ops Guys", produced a rifle from the trunk of the car, and was promptly acquainted with two 5.56x45mm rounds to the chest. Dead right there. 

The Security Forces commander on base made sure to put out a comminque about how thus far there had been no service member injuries or fatalities in any of these incidents and how everyone was perfectly safe, go about your business.

Tell that to the things running at my aircraft at 2 o'clock in the morning, asshole. 
*****

Okay so, at this point our AC was brain-fried. Whatever he saw just flipped the switch for him, I guess.

Our co-pilot is in the other seat trying to simultaneously deal with ATC, our ground crew, the aircraft itself, *and* the pack of what-the-fuck's flinging themselves at our aircraft. 

The engineer took control of the FLIR and TV feeds and started panning as far left and right as he could in big sweeps to try to get vis on our unwelcome guests. As he panned across for a third time, there was a big THUD against the nose and our power and lights flickered. 

Something grabbed the TV/FLIR array and began to pull. 

Something with a clearly distinguishable face. 

In the black-and-white feed, all I could see was the upper half of a face. Cracked, scaly looking skin pulled tight around a set of sunken eyes with no iris or pupils. Lifeless, white eyes. 

But it wasn't in our FLIR feed. It should have been registering as white-hot mass on our display, but FLIR was saying nothing was there. 

Both screens crackled as this thing yanked the whole array around past its horizontal limit. The feeds vanished, our power flickered again, and there was another long screech that tore down the side of the airplane. 

Then, silence. 

I was in a Herc once that got backed into by a loading truck. The truck nearly caved in a portion of the bulkhead just aft of the left wing, but the bump felt the same as if a big bird had run into the side of the plane. 

The last THUD against the side of the aircraft that night was so loud and accompanied by such an impact that I was sure it had lifted us completely off the ground on one side.  

At that point, the co-pilot called the tower and declared a ground emergency. 

Not wanting to sound like a crazy, sleep-deprived maniac, he explained that there was an issue with the landing gear and that he needed to cancel his taxi roll and return to the shed. 

The lights and power flickered again and a deep, sinister laugh echoed through the flight deck from somewhere behind us. Somewhere very close to where I was sitting. 

I was out of my seat, out the dorsal escape hatch, down the side of the plane and on the tarmac, sprinting back to the support section faster than I have ever moved *in my life*. 

Later I found out that the other four guys initiated the emergency egress procedures at nearly the same split-second as I did and were hot on my heels, getting the hell away from the aircraft as fast as humanly possible. 

The following morning, it was determined that our TV/FLIR array was totally destroyed by a force or impact that nearly ripped it from its mount and almost completely off of the airplane. 

There were gouges and dents running almost the complete length of the fuselage; long scratches and welts that looked like claw or teeth marks. 

Our wing commander wrote the incident off as damage caused by a lightning strike, even though there was no inclement weather in any part of the state that night. He praised us for acting quickly and following procedures to the letter, but reprimanded us for abandoning the aircraft so soon after declaring a ground emergency.

Whatever the case may be, I firmly believe that something diabolical found its way inside our ship that night and intended to do us harm.

That asshole Security Force commander says we're safe here. Nothing can get us. 

I beg to differ.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Broken arrow is a combat communications directive, sir. It's used when a friendly unit is overrun or goes "black" on ammunition and requires all available fire support, CAS, and QRF assets dispatched to their location coordinates. It's basically the "hey, get here or we're gonna fucking die" alert from Troops In Contact. 

Not sure what "broken arrow" you might be referring to in this instance.  </TEXT>
