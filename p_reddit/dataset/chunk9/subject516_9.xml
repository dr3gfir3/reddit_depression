	<TEXT> The two most expensive real estate markets in the US are San Francisco and Manhattan, in that order. This might be a controversial statement but "you pay for culture" is the motto for American real estate. You can buy a huge house in rural Nebraska for $30,000 but you won't have much around you beyond farmland. Conversely, you can pay $2,500 a month in Manhattan to split a small place with a few people and have the freedom to party all night, go to one of a million restaurants, see Broadway plays, etc. Also, while the rent is high in metropolitan areas, wages are usually higher to compensate. So a salaried job that makes $50,000 in Nebraska might make $80,000 in New York or LA.

(These numbers are made up but adequately reflect the American job/housing markets) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When connecting to a secure server, the server gives the device its signature to validate that it's legitimately secure. A hacker can change the "nameConstraints" part of that certificate to crash Apple's certificate parser. The crash happens because the logic that decodes that part of the cert doesn't manage its memory properly. See, for a program to find a specific place in memory, it needs a pointer to a specific address. Pointers are dangerous because they need to be properly recycled when that memory is cleared. When iOS/maOS parses the "nameConstraints" field, it creates some empty space in memory and stores the pointer to it somewhere. When the error handling code starts, it clears the memory but doesn't erase the pointer. This leads to "unexpected behavior" aka the huge potential for a crash. With some finagling with the cert, the researches said they could use the pointer and memory to execute code.

All in all, this is a pretty bad bug, security-wise. I'm not saying it will lead to a jailbreak but the fact that any https web connection could serve a malformed cert is, well, not great. </TEXT>

The second is that his supporters are hopefully going to reconsider what side they're on if collusion is proven. Even before that, though, things like the health care bill and cutting blue color worker protections will hopefully move the needle. Sure, none of them are silver bullets but it should be enough to bring the numbers of his base down.  Then again, 2017 has already been an insane ride so who knows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would agree if this were 2007 but the Republican party no longer represents standard "conservative platforms." 

Instead of focusing on fiscal responsibility, small government, and "wholesome values," the party has instead focused on racist policies, tax cuts for billionaires, cutting welfare/aid programs, big government on social issues, spending billions on a stupid wall, questioning what truly "constitutes rape," obstructionism, anti-American privacy, surveillance, pro-Russia, anti-education, etc.

Sure, Democrats also push some of those things (surveillance, especially) but my point stands. Going forward, the GOP needs to actually start converting Democrats and it'll be hard to win over a generation that has largely grown up with them as cartoon villains. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  a webkit exploit doesnt really mean much

Why do I keep seeing people parroting this nonsense? Hacking a system requires a chain of  exploits and this is the first link. With this exploit, hackers now have the ability to read and write memory and make syscalls. Thats huge. I could be mistaken, but from here, we need more exploits to be able to write to non-modifiable memory pages and full code execution to successfully get homebrew up and running. Fortunately, the Switch seems to be running an OS very similar to the 3DS which means hackers already have an idea on how it's structured.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem to have a fundamental lack of understanding of how software development works. 

Let's say 1-2 Switch took 6 months to make. That's pretty quick in regards to a start-to-finish polished game with translations and voice acting but I digress. Let's say they pay their software engineers ~$100,000 a year. So, to reach your number, they would only have had two engineers conceptualizing, designing, programming, testing, localizing, marketing, acting, filming, directing, pressing, and finally shipping. In actuality, they definitely had a team of engineers, a team of designers/creative types for art direction, voice actors, video actors, etc. 

Software products cost $$$ to make. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're making *very* wild assumptions. 

The wikileaks article said that the arsenal has been "recently compromised" by security contractors and former government hackers. If we view that assertion in a vacuum, that hardly implies that nefarious hands have the tools. Thinking critically, though, these tools were probably stolen. There's absolutely no reason to believe that the CIA's former employees stole all of the agency's malware and documentation and then forwarded it to an obviously US-hostile entity. Further, your assertion that the CIA hacked and released Podesta's emails is ridiculous. The CIA hacked Podesta, released his emails, got Trump elected, and is now waging war with him? That makes absolutely no sense. You could argue that an ex-CIA employee did it with these tools but that's a claim based on a site that pushed anti-America propaganda and has heavy ties to Russia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. If you read the court's opinion on the EO there were many reasons the order was struck down. Changing a few of them doesn't fix the order's underlying issues. In fact, WH spokesmen have been saying it's "essentially the same thing changed a little to pass the courts" is likely a death sentence because it's apparent that the law is "essentially the same thing" as what was ruled unconstitutional.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Call them every day no matter what. The phone people take a tally every day of the top three issues people call about and inform your rep. Even if they're "on the right side," they still need to know that you support X, Y, Z. Also, mention that you wont be voting for Flake if you see him opposing what you're calling about. It's the most we can do at the moment beyond protesting, joining an activist group, or becoming politicians :)


Edit: Just to add that I live in NYC and my Senators are (the very liberal) Schumer and Gillibrand but I still call every day. They need to know that we're paying attention and that we're mad </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was written three weeks ago; so much has changed since then. Since the women's march, there have been *tons* of protests across the country. There have been people overrunning town halls to make sure their representative knows their feelings. Congress has been getting hundreds of thousands of phone calls (at least*). The article maintains a tone of "yes, marching feels nice, but people are gonna have to do more than just feel" and it seems like people have.


All of this has brought out a lot of change from the Trump administration. The LGBTQ executive order hasn't arrived (yet) thanks to a *huge* public outcry. The House Republican plan to gut the Congressional Ethics Office was cancelled. The bill introduced to sell off 3.3 million acres of national park land was stopped due to protests. The immigration EO appeal was denied and "public opinion" was mentioned in the court opinion. 


From the article:
 If the anti-Trump forces are to have a chance, they have to offer a better nationalism, with diversity cohering around a central mission...

I would argue that identity politics *is* that "better nationalism." The author's perspective on identity politics seems to be that it's defined as minorities screaming over each other. From the outside in, sure, it could appear that way. For those who are actually interested in identity politics, it's different. Every minority group is fleshing out their own identity and expressing their experiences as a means to connect with other groups. In turn, they learn about others' identities and experiences. You see, identity politics isn't about dividing us; it's about bringing us together. Think of a society where other groups aren't defined by caricatures on TV or stereotypes but rather their experiences and opinions. That's the world many of us are living in today thanks to identity politics.

Finally, I'd argue that identity politics is one of the most effective platforms for change because it's inclusive. When you have white people saying they'll sign up for a "Muslim registry" because they feel for Muslims, that's a huge win. When you have white people marching against police brutality, that's a huge win. When you have straight people calling their representatives to protect LGBTQ rights, that's another huge win. Going forward, identity politics is going to be extremely important in bridging the gap between cultures. 

(With that being said, there are a lot of people who go overboard with it. Though, that could be said about anything political, imo)

*I base this off of http://5calls.org. They say they've helped make 477,000 calls and that's just one site. </TEXT>
