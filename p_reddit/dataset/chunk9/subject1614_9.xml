	<TEXT> My advice is to take as many upper division biology courses as possible and available. This will introduce you to different fields of research and along the way you may find your passion.

Of course the alternative and cheaper way is to read scientific literature on your own outside of class, but that requires some discipline. There are plenty of youtube videos that introduce fields of biology: microbiology, immunology, stem cells, genomics, cancer genetics, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My lab is looking at shifts in cellular metabolism that occur in cancer using a systems biology approach. My role in the lab is looking at gene regulation using high throughput sequencing techniques. Started out as strictly computational and now that I've advanced to candidacy I am working on generating the data in house myself. Once you've had that taste of success or progress on a project you're truly invested in then you commit to it and you want to see whats next in your research story.

I've always wanted my work to be relevant or useful for helping to save lives and that started out as doing something in the medical field like being a doctor or something. I went as far as taking the MCAT and volunteering in the emergency room. I wasn't sure if that was what I really wanted so I looked into other applications for what I was learning in my undergraduate. I applied to work in a research lab where at first I just attended lab meetings and journal clubs. I started having more fun in lab then cramming for tests or volunteering in the ER. Once i showed that I was reliable they started giving me more and more responsibilities. I initially wanted to do benchwork, but I was given an opportunity to excel in a computational analysis of ChIPSeq datasets. I wasn't particularly knowledgeable on how to proceed but i taught myself the skills and the steps to proceed and was able to come back with some answers. My P.I. was impressed with my progress that he offered to pick me up for graduate school.

In conclusion my advice for you is:
-Find and excel in the field of biology you are the most passionate about
-Applying for graduate school is like applying for a job: be able to sell yourself and your skill set. 
-Phd is a long journey, but it is made of little steps made everyday. Make sure they are meaningful
- Trying something new and know that teaching yourself new skills opens doors.

	<TEXT> Given this scenario you might want to consider how cell signaling affects cell fate and differentiation. Transcription factors themselves have to have their expression regulated so it isn't surprising that there are motifs found in the gene body. The most likely answer is that the transcription factors that bind in HOXA vs. HOXB gene regions will be responders to different signals telling the cell to develop into forelimb or hindlimb tissue. These cell fate responders can either be stimulatory, inhibitory, or something in between.
