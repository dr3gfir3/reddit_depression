	<TEXT> I had been using the free windscribe 50gb promotion for some time, just recently became a paid pro subscriber. I also use the chrome extension, you can have both the desktop and extension on, they call it double hop. A bit much, one or the other is fine. They allegedly don't keep any logs so as long as you're not the 2nd gunman you should be fine. All those convenience's of having Google knowing when and what you want at the store come at a price. What can you stomach, and who do you trust? Data mining is big business! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For fans of Google Inbox this may or may not be useful. Google Inbox is great it's intuitive and organized! If you want to add a non Google account to it unfortunately the only way I've found is through the Android Gmail app. First, add your Outlook or whatever other email provider you use, once added Gmail will ask if you want to Gmailify the other providers mail. Do it and then you will have Outlook in Google Inbox. You can then uninstall/disable Gmail and just use inbox! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Android wear watches are far superior IMO. With the Tizen (samsung os) watches you literally have to use your other hand to operate it, don't even get me started on S-Voice. As someone who works with my hands, having to take my other hand to operate a watch defeats the purpose, I might as well take out my phone! With Android wear you can use gestures and the much more reliable ok google for everything!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Search for any word you can think of (using the Google icon on Gboard)  When the search result pops up in the space vacated by the traditional keyboard, simply swipe up from the result to your text field. Yes you can also just tap the result. Being an Expanse fan I thought it was pretty cool, I think that's how it's done on another Syfy show called Incorporated. Granted I'm not throwing data from one terminal to another, but I still think it's slick. Sorry no gif I'm low tech at the moment.  </TEXT>

When your search shows up in what was the key area, instead of pressing the share button you can swipe from the result up to your text area if you wish to share your search. Best keyboard I've ever used by far. Light on resources as well! </TEXT>

Windows key +R and enter netplwiz and see if you can revert/add another administrator there. You changed your account to the built in administrator instead of adding a built in administrator. Your heiarchy and permissions are all fuck. Take your time and don't do anything to hasty, it can be remedied, just have to be patient and figure the shit out. Good luck! </TEXT>
