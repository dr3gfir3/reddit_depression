No. The Rock is not even *close* to being as big as Arnold (or Stallone) in the 80s/early 90s.
You might be too young, but as a 33 year old, I can tell you with all certainty that Arnold was bigger in the 80s/90s than any single action star is today.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jack Reacher is a good one, I just think the movies fall short of what the source material provided. Tom Cruise isn't my favorite actor, but damnit he makes a good action movie. He's not Jack Reacher though. That character is, first of all, supposed to be tall, and for that character the imposing height was one of his important traits. He's also supposed to be much darker than the Cruise movies made him.  
But yeah, I agree. Apart from Bourne, and Craig's James Bond, there haven't really been any great action characters. No, I don't think the Marvel Characters are great. In 20 years, that shit will look really hokey. Try to watch X-Men 1-3 now. It's corny.  
Neo was great, but that's as much a sci-fi character as it is an action character. If we want to bring Luke Skywalker or Harrison Ford's Rick Deckard into the mix, we're going to have to have a much wider conversation.  
As far as pure action movie characters go, I'm not seeing much these days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd have to disagree with us having more high quality movies than the past. In their heyday, those movies were as high quality as any Transporter, Fast   Furious, Mummy, X-Men, or Bourne movie. Robocop, Kickboxer, Bloodsport, 48 Hours, Conan, predator, Total Recall, Lethal Weapon, they were all good quality movies at the time. The best of our current era will stand the test of time, but most will fade. Some will stand the test of time like Terminator (1 2), Rambo, Die Hard, and Aliens, but not many. Maybe the Bourne movies, Kill Bill, Skyfall, and a few others, but not many. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think so. Action movies just aren't as big as they were back then. Arnie was as big as he was while  still competing with Stallone, Van Dam, Willis and a score of other huge action stars that were each bigger then than The Rock is now. </TEXT>

He doesn't have that one huge defining role. The Mummy and F F roles are popular, but tell me the names of his characters. Most can't. He's "The Rock," not The Terminator, Rambo, Rocky, Conan, or John Kimball.

	<TEXT> I've definitely experienced the mower scenario. Ran over one in a pretty unusual are of the yard for a nest to have been, usually they were along the tree line or back in the woods, but this one was right in the middle. I knew immediately what it was, but I'm not sure if it was the stings or the swarm I noticed first. I threw the mower all the way up to "rabbit" but the yellow jackets are faster than rabbits it turns out. I jumped off, sprinted to the house and into my bathroom, stripped off my clothes and jumped in the shower. When I came out, 3 yellow jackets were flying around in the bathroom, so I had to run out of there too.  
13 stings, and a lot of panic. Fuck yellow jackets and wasps. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. The government cannot pass any laws that would infringe on a citizens right to free speech. But organizations and the people that manage them can. Hell, if the FBI wanted to cancel a speaker at one of their events because the speaker's presence or speech might lead to riots, they could. That still wouldn't be a violation. Ann Coulter can go out anywhere that will accept her, or stand on any public area, and say whatever she wants.
