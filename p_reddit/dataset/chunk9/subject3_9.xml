	<TEXT> Your website is secured with RapidSSL certificate while accessing it with https but if people will access it without https then it gives an error like 'connection is not secure'. 

I think it happens because ssl certificate is issued on *.airnav.com or http to https redirection is not proper because RapidSSL brand supports both www and non www domain as per this [article](https://www.clickssl.net/blog/do-i-need-different-ssl-certificates-for-www-non-www-domain
) so www and non www domain name is also not an issue. </TEXT>

If you want features for which you have requirement then it becomes your pros and if not then it becomes cons. But those cons becomes pros for the people who in real need for that.

As per that EV and Standard one both has different as well as common features. But which to purchase depends on the user/website requirement.

For e-commerce, the large online business I would like to recommend EV SSL certificate because its green address bar, business identity authentication enhances user's trust. 

For the small business, startup level business standard SSL remain the best because it secures your domain at very affordable cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both are good but I would like to suggest you WooCommerce. If you want to check which remains the best for you as per your experience then you should check [WooCommerce and OpenCart features comparison](https://www.woobeginner.com/opencart-vs-woocommerce/).

Even if your are accepting cash on delivery but you should [consider ssl certificate if you will accept confidential information](https://www.clickssl.net/blog/which-ssl-should-you-buy-for-your-e-commerce-business) like password of customers because in nearer future popular browsers like [google and chrome will give waning for http pages](http://www.theverge.com/2017/1/26/14396130/http-https-insecure-connections-chrome-firefox) who are accepting confidential information. To secure only one web page of website, single domain ssl certificate is the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want to secure only one domain name and want green visual bar then you should enable EV SSL certificate. If talking about $700 price then it's too much high.

But if you want to secure multiple domain names with green visual bar then you should take [EV Multi Domain SSL certificate which price is too much low](https://www.clickssl.net/cheapest-ev-extended-validation-ssl-certificates) compared too $700.

For example,

If you take multi domain ev ssl certificate then you can secure domain names like below with green bar :
