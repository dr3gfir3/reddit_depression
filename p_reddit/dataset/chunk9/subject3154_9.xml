	<TEXT> I still have some empathy for him though, because he grew up in a harsh social environment and his father was a rapist. (I don't know, whether Michael actually knows that) It just seems like he isn't necessarily _evil_, but rather ignorant of the grave consequences some of his actions could have.

	<TEXT> **Freedom, Jonathan Franzen** 

It's my first novel by Franzen and it's pretty good so far. I like the story actually, although I can't stand most of the characters. (Which granted, is likely intentional)

**Infinite Jest, David Foster Wallace** 

Holy shit, there are so many things that make sense now on the second read. So many overlooked details and connections. IJ, to me, is an even better experience, the second time around. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, that's pretty reassuring and seems doable to me.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a non-native speaker but I consider my English (reading and listening comprehension) to be pretty good. As of right now, I'm indecisive on whether to read Faulkner's _The Sound and the Fury_ in it's original language or one of the German translations. As a reference point, the most difficult book I've read so far is _Infinite Jest_. Is it much harder than that, language and contentwise? I don't actually mind confusing/stream-of-conciousness narratives but it would be quite a problem if the language was too difficult. Have any of you tried the German translation (especially the new one)?

Edit: Stupid spelling mistakes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are so right. I'm rereading it right now and I've noticed how much I missed in the first half of the book and how many details there actually are. Just as an example: [Spoiler](#s "The flying roaches that Orin thinks about in the beginning are most likely mutated and originate from the Great Concavity, just like the feral hamsters or the giant infant. Not a chance to catch that one and many others on the first read!") I am also enjoying the original English version a lot more than the German translation (it's not bad but the original text just sounds more natural). Though that could also be, because I already know what's going on and don't have to piece together the story as much anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The (kinda) short version is: He always made fun of other people but is very thin-skinned himself. He took criticism on his sub very badly and deleted negative opinions. When people called him out on it, he got very emotional and pissy. It seemed like the popularity got to him and it turned out that his YouTube persona, which is very exaggerated, kind of corresponds to his actual behaviour, which disappointed many fans. Additionally he increasingly resorted to making videos about YouTube drama, instead of the usual rant-style videos about everyday topics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, I did understand that part. It is not a coincidence that the last thing you're supposed to read is the first chapter, so you can basically start over instantly. Anyway (!), I would recommend reading IJ to anyone, because it's a great novel on itself, too. In my opinion, it is not necessary to understand the "full meaning of the book" to enjoy it nonetheless. You can (and many have) read it once, read the first chapter again, and be done with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with this sentiment:
Wallace's challange was how do you write a modern book, make it both entertaining, and yet adhere to his avant garde instincts and yet not rely on "irony" which he saw as a dead end and the biggest problem facing his generation of writers.

but the rest is just a theory (a cool one, but nonetheless just that), right? It seems like an overinterpretation to me. If there is proof to it, please show me. I think Infinite Jest works (worked for me atleast) without all of that stuff, too. That's why I wouldn't say that you need two readings. People get intimidated by a book that can also just be read to enjoy the writing, the characters and their little stories.

	<TEXT> Sure, I'll give you that. Though it is basically consensus that you have to read the first chapter after you've finished the book (which gets clear when the order of subsidized-time-years is provided). Still there are a some things that can not be fully explained.^1 And while I generally like the ending and its circularity, I can't shake the feeling that DFW couldn't come up with a proper ending. (no writer could nicely tie all that up)

^1 it is still conjecture, what _really_ caused Hal to transform (DMZ, mold, the tape). It's not clear to me why JOI's wraith doesn't know about Orin already having the master copy. As far as I'm concerned, JOI appeared to Gately to give him a vision of them digging up his grave so that he would find the copy, otherwise I don't know why the wraith would chose to appear to Gately at all. </TEXT>

It is said to be one of his easier novels but the fact that I'm reading it in English makes up for it in terms of difficulty. I already own a copy of the German "Gravity's Rainbow" so I'm probably gonna dive into that after "Inherent Vice".

If you finish the book, you will likely feel something, whatever that may be. I think it made me more compassionate for people with drug-addiction and depression (which some of my friends have struggled with).

Edit: I have seen that you're also a Pynchon and DeLillo fan. Out of White Noise, Underworld, Gravity's Rainbow and The Corrections (If you've read it), which would you recommend the most? I'm looking for some new challenge after IJ. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> After 2 months, I've finally finished "Infinite Jest". Let's discuss! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-19 23:13:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, after it has been mentioned and recommended numerously here, I've decided to read *Infinite Jest* by David Foster Wallace. I wasn't a big reader, because most people my age read YA, John Green or Harry Potter (which is fine) but I didn't really care for that. Maybe it was not the best decision to get into adult fiction by virtue of *Infinite Jest*, but it's been worth it! I'm not a native English speaker, so I bought the German edition, which has been wonderfully translated by Ulrich Blumenbach but I decided to reread it soon with a friend of mine, in English this time. I gotta say: The first 200 pages were pretty hard. 

Not just because of the zany and scientific word choices but also because the first half of the book bombards you with characters and information you can't decipher yet. The great thing about it, in my opinion, is that most insights and connections were formed after I've finished reading a passage. Maybe it's just me though. Some passages I found to be mind-numbingly boring but those were waaaaay made up for by the hilarious and suspenseful chapters. I really enjoyed the ambiguity of the characters' motivations and I still cannot really fathom, why Avril is so uncanny to me. Of course there are her affairs but the way she talks to Hal, Orin and Mario is almost creepy. My favorite chapter is probably the one where Molly Notkins is interviewed. It is just so vivid and revealing. I didn't really mind that there isn't a real ending and I've read Aaron Swartz' take on it. 

[Ending spoilers](#s "I like the idea that Hal took DMZ (by choice or not) because you can see him going crazy in the last few chapters, which would be hard to explain just by Marijuana withdrawal. Also the first instances of unintended facial expressions are visible before the fund raising matches. I'm not that sure about his theory about how the mold made Hal uncommunicative and how James created DMZ and the Entertainment to reverse the effect. Seems a bit far-fetched. Some people have said that they find it unlikely that Hal and Gately met and while Swartz wrote that it was because they met in the hospital, it could also have been the Ennet House itself, which Hal had visited before. ")

[Ending spoilers](#s "I also enjoyed the sad but neat character arc of a Hal, who could talk but felt no emotions and couldn't even imagine showing honest interest in any topic to a Hal that can't talk to anybody (but James and maybe Lyle) but has interests in lots of fields and has opinions and emotions. (As seen in the YoG chapter) But why would JOI's wraith make Gately have a vision of him and Hal digging up his body, when he should know that the tape shouldn't be there anymore? I like to think that JOI tried to warn Gately to not go, because it would be 'too late!' anyway.")

What do you think about IJ? What's your theory about the origin of Hal's weird behaviour? Do you think DFW couldn't come up with a proper ending? What do you make of "do it to her"?




For those who are interested, here's a cool high-res wallpaper I made from the big character map, a background photo I found and Photoshop: http://imgur.com/5tNZbwi

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'll re-read Infinite Jest with a friend of mine soon. (And in English this time) Do you consider Pale Fire difficult? I would want to give the original a shot. Just as a sidebit: I didn't struggle too much with the German IJ version but I find the English one way trickier (partly due to idioms that I have to look up). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What would not be "machist"? Also most of the male characters are also over-sexualised. You can't tell me that every man looks like Lee Sin, Draven, Darius and Taric. These are also unrealistic body types. My opinion is that mostly people want to play idealised, comiclike badass characters. (Ofc the player base is mostly straight males but I don't think League is nearly as sexist as you make it out to be) Bonus: It is an *opinion* that Illaoi looks like a man and that Taliyah is ugly. You labeled them that. I'm sorry but it seems like you are desperately cherry-picking to invalidate possible counter-examples. (Like Taliyah, Illaoi, Vi) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Als ich das gerade gelesen habe dacht ich schon "Ist das Mario aus Infinite Jest?" Ich habe nicht gedacht, dass ich auf /r/de mal auf Infinite Jest stoe. Ich bin zu 4/5 durch und es ist fantastisch! Bisher konnte ich es noch niemandem erfolgreich weiterempfehlen, weil keiner meiner Freunde Lust hat die ntige Zeit zu investieren. Ich bin noch nicht ganz durch damit, aber IJ ist jetzt schon mein neues Lieblings-buch. Die deutsche bersetzung ist Klasse und hat viele Witze und Wortspiele, die so im Englischen nicht funktionieren wrden. Ich habe mich nicht ans Original getraut, aber wenn ich es spter nochmal lesen sollte, werde ich es auf jeden Fall versuchen. Dicke Empfehlung brigens! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I asked the exact same question here before I started. Here's the advice I found useful:

- Don't skip the footnotes
- Only look up words you don't know if you feel like you want to know what the word means
- Don't worry too much about the setting of the novel, it's going to be explained about a third of the way through
- Try to keep most of the characters in mind
- Most importantly: Don't worry about its reputation as a 'difficult book' and just read it! </TEXT>
