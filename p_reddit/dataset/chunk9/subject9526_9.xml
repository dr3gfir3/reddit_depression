	<TEXT> This is the annoying part - I'm doing a no fast-travel legendary playthrough. Ended up loading my last quick save and avoiding whiterun entirely haha  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Y'know, I enjoy spontaneity in Skyrim but this kind of bs really gets on my nerves, especially when playing on higher difficulty, and at the (almost stupidly early) level of 8. Like really? Level 8 bethesda? I don't even plan on starting these DLC's until mid 30's </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you this made perfect sense! I will probably just do some testing before I install a mod just to see if I like it or not in the future, and avoid disabling mods on a modded save file entirely.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This helps a lot, thank you! I understand now that uninstalling should be taken more carefully, but I do have one question:

Is there a difference between disabling a mod and uninstalling it? Should I be just as careful when I disable my mods?

 Say I wanted to play on a vanilla save file, to get achievements, and I disable all my mods. What steps should I take when i disable/enable the mods again when I switch back to my modded save file? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! I was referring to the pop-in i believe (bushes, grass, rocks, finer details on trees etc.). It was definitely much worse than my vanilla saves. I am hoping it was just a rare occurrence  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [XB1] I'm new to mods and I was wondering if anyone could answer a few questions... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I had a bad experience after installing 5 mods (Unofficial patch, Campfire, Wet and Cold, Bloody Textures, and Vivid Weathers in that load order). Initially i was really enjoying what they had to offer but i quickly found out that the draw (render) distance in my save file had taken a massive hit. It was horrendous. 

I assumed this was just a small bug, maybe a consequence of launching a save file with five new mods at once. I tried to disable my mods one at a time to find the culprit but that just ended up corrupting my modded save file entirely. 

I have reinstalled those five as well as frostfall and so far I've had no problems. But now i'm playing with a fear of another corrupted save file. I've heard of people playing with five times as many mods and having no problems whatsoever, so I am kind of pissed off that I can't have fun with a few good top rated mods. Should I be worried of another terrible render distance or corrupt save file? Is there something I can do to minimize having any problems?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is such a refreshingly well put-together video! The music almost seemed purposely juxtaposed against the hype-ness of the clips. And the perfectly placed comedic breaks (specifically Lloyd Christmas) had me on the floor. A+ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whenever this happens I tend to think that Michael actually presented us with a question he could not answer. 

Granted he has a lot of videos in which he does answer the question. I still find it very interesting to be presented with an intriguing question that may not be answerable, because it usually leads into even more intriguing side facts. </TEXT>
