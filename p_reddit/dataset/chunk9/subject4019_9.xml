	<TEXT> *Unbelievable, I gave over half my life to the Citadel, and they play a fucking trick like this? That candle can be lit, I know it, those old fat men just don't like magic, that's what it is.*

Quentyn crept down the large hall of the Citadel in the dead of night, the only thing that could be seen was the braziers and the torches hanging on the wall. He grabbed a torch as quiet as he could, and continued creeping down the hall, looking fo that door he had passed a million times. *My gods, where is this damn door?* The next thing he knew, he was standing in front of an obsidian black door. He grabbed the knob, which was cold as ice, and twisted it. As the door began open, it creaked loudly, as if it were warning the other maesters. He opened the door, held the torch in front of him, and saw it.

The room itself was pitch black, so dark, it almost looked as if it were endless. He moved the torch down, and saw the flame's reflection on the glass candle. *Gods be good, there they are.* There had to be at least a dozen in the room. He put the torch down, away from the candles, and picked up three and stuffed them in his cloak. *Since you're not using these, you wouldn't mind if I take them, would you?*

He picked up the torch and headed out of the black room. As he closed the creaky door, he could sworn he heard footsteps coming close. He quickly put the torch back in its and ran for the main hall. He was almost there when he saw the shadow of a guard standing in front of him. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [M/20] Just Another "Am I bipolar" Post </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-13 15:38:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last winter, when I was seeing someone, they diagnosed me as having major depression. And of course having depression things were grim, I was always mopping around and being sad thinking about death, etc. We all know how depression goes. Then only yesterday, almost a year later, I came to the realization that things were different. I was no longer really physically sad, maybe I got good at hiding it? So I started looking up the symptoms for bipolar (since my grandfather was at one point a heavy drinker and I've heard that substance abuse and bipolar go hand in hand.) And I have quite a lot of symptoms of bipolar II but definitely not I. It almost as if all the hopelessness and the sadness dug itself inside me and I was left with a "normal shell," so on the outside I seem relatively normal. I also noticed that I, a saver of money, started spending the money I had, not on anything dangerous, just stuff on Amazon. In fear of making this drag on to long, I'm also: restless, occasionally have insomnia, thoughts of suicide, and I speak really fast (which I heard could be a sign?) I don't know if this counts as hypomania, but I went at least 3 or 4 days without getting much sleep and felt fine (wish I had that now, tbh (got six and have a headache.)

Now, I don't know if I suffer from Bipolar II or not, but something has definitely changed from last year. Also If I may sum up my moods really quickly. It seems like I go from sort of manic to sort of depressed (but not full blown like I had last fall/winter.)

EDIT: I could really use some booze, but I'm afraid I'll start beating people up like my grandfather. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nymeria really didn't want to go to Starfall, her grandfather said it would be "good for the family" if she went. *One day your father and I will be gone, we will need alliances if our house is to continue.* She could hear the words echoing in her head, and they made her stomach knot. 

She came back to the real world, and saw the craggy Red Mountains of Dorne and in the distance she saw a keep they called Starfall. She couldn't help but think of the old legend her father told her about Starfall. *Long ago, a man tracked a shooting star and it landed where Starfall is today. He forged a sword out of that star and it's believed that that sword, is Dawn.*

"Can we speak to Lady Clara Dayne?" her escort asked.

"Who shall I say is here?" the tall guard asked

"Lady Nymeria Santagar," he said, looking up at the majestic keep.

Jacaerys tried to put up a good front, but the truth of the matter was, he was as nervous as he ever was, he just hoped Lady Allyrion didn't notice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jacaerys woke at dawn, he couldn't sleep a wink. All he thought about was living at Godsgrace. What would it be like? Would he make any friends? Surely he'd make one friend, at least, he hoped he would, for he'd be quite lonely if he didn't. After thinking about future friends, and what Godsgrace would be like, he thought about not seeing his mother or his father. He shook the thought off because he knew he'd start crying if he continued thinking about it.

It wasn't as hot as home, Jacaerys was quite glad he didn't have to put up with the blazing heat of the coast. The trotting of his horse across the field made his eyes heavy, he was asleep in minutes.

***
He awoke to the sight of Godsgrace. *Whoa, this place is huge, even bigger than Spottswood!* He couldn't believe the size of Godsgrace, and couldn't believe he'd have the privilege of living in such a place.

Moments later, guards came out to great them. Unlike Spottswood, these guards better, he couldn't think of the the word, but they just looked better to him. A tall guard came up to his escort and said "What business do you have here?"

"We have come to see Lady Delonne Allyrion. Young Jacaerys here is her new ward." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While sitting in his chambers, he couldn't help but think of the girl who sat across from her. What was her name again? Oh yes, Rana. He enjoyed her company well enough, at least, more than the other ladies his father had tried to set him up with. As looked out the window at the night sky, only one person could come to mind. Lysandra. The moon was a milky white, just like her skin. The stars, a pale yellow, just like her long locks. Everything seemed to remind him of Lysandra. *If only I could have her, just for a night.*

The window view did not satisfy him enough, so he walked down to the courtyard and sat on the edge of the fountain, looking up at the heavens. It was a dark night, and unusually cold for Dorne, he couldn't remember when it had ever been this cold. The only sound that could be heard was the trickle of the water in the fountain. 

He sat for a long time, thinking about Lady Rana and what a life with her would look like, which he found quite odd. He had never thought of a lady so much, except for Lysandra, of course.  </TEXT>

She wasn't flattering her mother in law, she truthfully couldn't believe it herself. It only seemed like a moment ago she was playing in the courtyard with her siblings and cousins. In the blink of an eye, she had grown up and married with children of her own. In another blink, she would be in Lady Druscilla's position, sewing with her daughter in law. The more she thought about the passage of time, the less she believed it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jaehaerys started out of the window of his room. *Who is that? Oh gods, not another marriage proposal.* He moved closer, almost half out the window and saw the banners of House Ladybright. *A Ladybright? Is this the best the old man could do? Let's get this over with.* 

He walked down the old spiral staircase, thinking about what this one would be like. *Maybe she'll be better* The optimist in him said, though a part of him doubted it. 

"Jaehaerys!" he heard his sister in law Lysandra yell, coming up the stairs. "Come, you have a visitor!"

"I don't want to marry the Ladybright girl," he said, stopping.

Lysandra walked back up the stairs. Jaehaerys looked into her deep purple eyes, they were absolutely beautiful, just like the rest of her. 

"Just talk to her," she said, leaning on the wall, panting.

"Is it the baby?" He asked, focusing all of his attention on her.

"No, no yet," she panted. "Go downstairs."

He walked downstairs, despite every bone in his body saying to stay with her. 

His father was standing at the base of the staircase. He looked much older now. His once dark hair was now a greyish white, and his once smooth skin was wrinkled like a raisen that sat in the sun for too long. 

"Come we have vistors," Ser Aron smiled, taking his son's arm.

As he walked out to greet the visitors, he couldn't help but look back at Lysandra. Even pregnant, she was as beautiful as ever.

	<TEXT> Yes, it still means to be, that's just Latin's standard word order, SOV. Though obviously writers broke the rule all the time. The SOV does come in handy when you have a sentence like "Gladiatores leones necavimus." The gladiators killed the lions. That sentence would be a major problem to any native Latin speaker, luckily like has a standard word order! </TEXT>

Tarquinius Superabus was the king of the Romans and Sextus Tarquinius was the wicked son of the tyrant.

The ancient Romans were always praising the virtue and high spirits of Lucretia and they were blaming Tarquinius. 

Catullus Dedicates His Poetry Book

To Cornelius, a man of great wisdom, I will give a pretty new book. Cornelius, my friend, you were always praising my books, and you are a scholarly teacher of literature. Therefore you have my new work: the fame of the book (and you fame) will be perpetual. 

EDIT: In the second sentence of the second reading, it looks like the name Cornelius is in the genitive, and that's how I originally translated it, but thinking about, I realized a genitive there sounded odd and just translated it as "Cornelius" on Reddit. I hope I didn't just go from being right to being wrong. I'm sorry it doesn't read well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today I was doing some HIIT for about 30 minutes and after my heart rate was 125 bpm. I know, not good at all. I was sweating and breathing hard like usual but after I was done (cooled down really fast btw) I started researching if what I was doing had any benefit (not weight wise but like heart health, endurance, etc) and it seems like you only get benefits from 160-180 bpm. I'd like to go that fast, but my stationary bike isn't very good and when I go to fast, the foot strap comes off. I mean today when I was at 125 bpm the strap came off and I almost broke my foot. It's a shame too, because I wasn't even tired. 

Also I'm not completely sure if it's 125, because I just took out my phone and started counting til the minute changed. For all I know it could've just changed to 7:56 a second a go or changed 30 seconds ago. At minimum I got 125 bpm. Maximum sure as hell wasn't 160-180 bpm.

Next time reckon I should just use the timer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just as short poem that I through together about twenty minutes ago, it's not that good, I know but my life's been pretty rough so I thought writing it down would help. I promise I don't suck this bad writing a novel.

Anywho, hope it's not too bad:

"What did I ever do to you?" You'd ask foolishly, knowing full well what you did.

You ruined my childhood.

Instead of loving words I got abuses thrown at me.

Instead encouragement I got a father who laughed at my weight

Instead of father who supports their child's interest, I got one who laughed at them, calling them "girly" or "stupid."

Instead of fatherly advice, I got beatings that left me black and blue

And instead of a father, I got an abuser.

So next time when you stand on my front porch asking me to take you back, prentending that you did nothing wrong

You can go to hell. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is HIIT style cardio twice a week too much or too little? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-05 00:46:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I say "HIIT style" because it isn't sprinting. Believe me, I'd like to do it that way but the right foot strap on my stationary bike comes off if I go too fast and I'm not in the mood to break my feet, so I have to control it. It's still fast (for a fat guy.) 

The reason I asked twice a week is because I'd prefer to do my cardio on shower days.

Even though I'm fat, I'm not doing this for weight loss, I'm just trying improve my overall heart health. If I happen to loss a couple of pounds in the process, that's nice too. As you can tell, I'm new to cardio.

Another question: if I stick to this plan, will I get the results I'm looking for?

EDIT: I'm M20 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if I translated everything correctly in Cicero's little paragraph "The Rarity of Friendship."

"Pauc vir vrs amcs habent, et pauc sunt dign. Amcitia vra est, praeclra, et omnia praeclra sunt rra. Mult vir stult d pecni semper cgitant, pauc d amcs, sed errant: possumus valre sine mult pecni, sed sine amciti non valmus et vta est nihil."

I got: "Few men have true friends, and few are worthy. True friendship is remarkable, and all remarkable friendships are rare. Many foolish men always think about money, few about friends. but they err: we are able to be well without much money, but without friendship we are not well and life is nothing."

I don't see any problems with it, but I by no means a great Latinist. That's why I came to you guys! xD </TEXT>
