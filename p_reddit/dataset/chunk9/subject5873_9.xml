	<TEXT> In his state he would do anything, so yes that would fit. If it were my story I would keep everything you have the same but insert a gruesome and wrath-filled Tarentino styled torture of the other driver and act like it was no big deal. Then kill himself after to meet up with his mom. 

Or maybe his mom is actually not dead but in a coma and he is so stricken with grief that it seems like she is dead. He kills himself and at that moment she rises up from the hospital bed. 

Orrrrrr twist it so that *he is the driver that killed her* but we don't find out until the end after he blames others around him and alienates himself into oblivion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bright red and blue lights pulsed on and off through my blinds, diluted slightly by my drapes, and startled me out of a deep sleep. I glanced at my phone  3:29AM. With a groan and a sigh I rolled over and proper myself up enough to peek out the window. I already knew what was going on but I had to be sure. Yup, another break-in. The fourth one this week! Police officers were spread out on the lawn talking amongst themselves and the family who lived there. Others canvassed the surrounding area and more still were searching the home for clues they wouldnt find. 

Over the past three months our city has been hit hard with a wave of burglaries of historical proportions. Every single day I see something else on the news about the Fingerless Bandits and every day it is the same story  no evidence was found, nothing has been recovered, authorities are stumped. The only leads they have are that they break in at night and only break into homes without security systems, which is why my wife has been hounding me to call up a company and have one installed. Groaning inwardly this time I know what Ill hear all day long because of another neighbor getting hit up. 

Ive put it off so far for several reasons, one being that we really dont have anything to take. Most of our furniture are used hand-me-downs from friends or family, our TV is old and only 720P resolution and weighs far more than seems possible. Money is another concern. Alarm systems arent cheap and we really dont have the room in our budget for another monthly bill. But me, being the thrifty and practical guy that I am, was able to get some window stickers and a lawn sign from a neighbor so that people *think* we have a system. It works with Beware of Dog signs doesnt it? 

After watching for a few more moments I settled back into my warm sheets and drifted into a dreamless sleep for what seemed like only a few minutes when my alarm buzzed and beeped me back to reality. I begrudgingly went about my day: drive to work, grab a donut at Nancys desk, type furiously for eight hours, eat somewhere along the way, and drive home. Sure enough my wife was glued to the local news and bombarded me as soon as I walked in the door.

You know those signs wont last forever. They watch the neighborhood and follow the install trucks. Theyll know we dont have a system!

My eyes would have rolled right out of my head if I hadnt closed them. Hunnie, I told you we cant afford a system and you need to stop being paranoid. I bent to untie my shoes before stepping off of the rubber mat.

It isnt just about stuff getting stolen! It is about our safety, my safety! You are gone all the time at work and here I am all by myself looking after our daughter without any protection! She ran forward and sobbed heavily into my chest. Hazel, our daughter, poked her head out from her nursery and did her best impression of walking over to us to tug on our legs. Wrong?

I let her get it all out before lifting her chin up and wiping the tears away and kissing her. I promise it will be okay. You just have to trust me. I bent down and scooped up my little girl, giving her a reassuring hug. Nothing is wrong Hazelnut. Show daddy your sign? 

Let me back up here for a minute. My wife grew up in the deaf community because her parents are deaf so her first language was actually American Sign Language, or ASL. With second languages being important these days we decided our daughter should know sign language as well. I know a little but Ive never had the time to devote to it like I should so my daughter probably knows more than I do. Every day I come home and she shows me all of the signs she knows and the animal sounds and the colors and just about anything else she thinks is worth mentioning. Kids are cute. 

------------

For a second night in a row I was disturbed from sleep  this time by a feeling. It is amazing how our body works, dead asleep but yet our senses still detecting everything around us, snapping into action when necessary by way of coursing adrenaline. I could heart my heartbeat in my ears and feel it against my ribs while easing my body soundlessly out of my bed. I pushed my feet into my slippers and grabbed the solid-core pipe from under the bed. A few silent steps later brought me into the living room, and then the nursery.

She was fussing quite a bit in her crib and most likely what woke me up. To be on the safe side I made the rounds through the other few rooms before returning to my daughter to see what she needed. It turns out chugging a sippie cup of milk right before bed isnt the best plan of action for a fourteen month old to take  her diaper was HUGE.

Careful not to wake her up too much I gently laid her down on the changing table and set to work getting her comfortable again. You know how you do something so often that you dont really think about it? Your eyes are working but you arent taking any information in, your hands move but you dont remember where they went or what they did. I was in that kind of zone when my eyes finally recognized my daughter signing something. It was a sign I had only seen before once so at first I thought she was just wiggling her arms (she is a very active kid) but when she did it over and over I knew but I had no idea how she had learned it  *imposter*.

I was going to ask my wife in the morning but I noticed Hazels eyes staring at the window behind me, unwavering. I turned to follow her gaze and caught someone moving quickly away from the window. She started crying and although I did everything I could I couldnt get her settled back down. My wife came in after a bit and took over so I could get some sleep. I didnt tell her about the incident because I didnt want to scare her but I knew I would have to do something about it. I cant having him come around anymore, especially since Hazel knows that I am an Imposter. Maybe a security system would be good after all. But what to do with her?

	<TITLE> You must Die in order to Live </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Have you ever wondered what it feels like to die? Is it painful when your body lets go of its last stores of energy? Are you aware that you are dying or do you think it will pass? Maybe you are one of the many that have thought it great to never be *able* to die. Like a superhero. Saving beautiful women from horrible men and little children from burning houses. Oh yes, that would be nice.

Now lets imagine you are walking up some stairs. The damned elevator is broken again and you have to trudge up five flights to get to your office building. Step up, step up, step up. After two flights you are a little winded perhaps, maybe you take your phone out and check e-mails to save time. That is when your foot catches the stop of a riser and for a split second you panic. Your heart races, your blood flowing fiercely through your body which causes your body temperature rises significantly and you break out into a sweat. In the next moment your foot finds the step and your panic recedes although you feel a little sheepish and hope no one witnessed the miscue. A few stairs later and your face is no longer flushed with the excess blood, your heart has returned to a normal rhythm, and all is right with the world. You may tread a little more carefully for the next minute or so, maybe even putting your phone back into your pocket or purse, and you forget about that moment in time.

These are all normal responses for a normal human being. Your body senses danger, your balance is thrown off and your mind knows the great distance you could fall should you go backwards. All normal. But what if I told you that **everything** caused your body to react that way. Every properly executed step. Every change in the winds direction. Every noise your ears perceive and every flash of color taken in by your retinas. What if your body could not differential between normal interactions with the world around you and emergency situations? I suppose, then, you would be me. 

My mother told me once that all I ever did was cry for the first few years of life. She couldnt understand it, the doctors couldnt understand it. Pain, the doctors told her. He is always in pain. There was nothing they could do because they couldnt find the cause. The only indication they had was my heart  it constantly revved up like I was in pain and then stopped very briefly before resuming a normal beat. She had raised four children already and knew exactly what each needed based on their cry, except for mine. It didnt take long for her to stop taking me places and pretty soon I was left alone in a dark room with the door closed and a primitive baby monitor keeping me company. 

I was small and weak, physically and mentally. Going outside for even a moment was enough to send me into shock. But I survived. I kept on going. As I grew up and my capacity for communication increased I was able to relate more of what I was going through with my mother and doctors. Unfortunately it was far too late for any real help or hope. The debt of constant hospital visits and specialists crippled my mother. My father only lasted a few weeks before giving up and leaving us. I told my mom to stop looking for a cure and focus on my brothers and sister, and thankfully she did.

I spent the next fifteen years by myself for the most part, except for those my laptop connected me to. School was out of the question so I enrolled in online learning that was an at-your-own-pace style. It was hard considering just touching the mouse or clacking on the keyboard sent my heart racing and stopping suddenly, mind crashing into mental walls of anguish and blinding light overtaking all of my senses. It is hard to describe but it was as if I tasted more than I could handle, heard more than I could process, smell so much I became clogged, felt every molecule colliding with my body, see so clearly the spectrum of visible light separated for me for a split second. It was so overwhelming every time. But I kept going. I survived. The episodes slowly grew worse, longer, harder to handle. I had to do something but I no longer had doctor visits or specialists calling the house or coming by to see if they could figure things out. I was on my own armed with the internet and a determination to prevail. 

Fast forward to today as I speak this aloud for my computer to transcribe. I have my answer, my cure. Death. As you are probably aware there is some very taboo stuff on the internet and as a person who literally spends his every waking moment online I have stumbled across a lot of it. I began studying death more deeply some time ago and it intrigued me. Something about it seemed so familiar but I wasnt sure why. I studied what death was, how people died, what religions thought about it, what people with near-death experiences describe. It slowly became clear to me that I was dying. With every touch, sound, blink of an eye I died. And came back. Again and again and again. Eventually my heart wont be able to take the constant trauma and I will die for good unless I can find enough *helpers*.

As I said I found a cure, but it isnt an easy one to obtain and I happened upon it by accident. Yesterday I was determined to make another attempt at outside for research and to see the world. This would make my fourth visit that I can remember to the world outside of my home. Wearing special sunglasses that block out almost all of the light and noise-cancelling headphones I took it very slow, my powerchair cruising at the slowest speed. I had died twelve times by the time I made it to the end of my driveway. Glancing up ever so slightly to one side and the next I made sure the road was clear and began the slow crossing. As I crossed the yellow line in the middle of the road I heard the loudest sound Id ever witnessed, dying for twentieth time. When I came back to myself I could feel the heat of the car crash a ways down the road, hear the screams of those inside the car and those running to help. I died nine more times trying to get away as fast as I could before the car exploded. 

Seven people died that day because of me. Four in the car and three who attempted to rescue them from the car before it blew. I could feel the blast on my neck as I powered away at a brisk 3 miles per hour. But I didnt die. Not that time. In fact I made it all the way back inside my home before I succumbed to another instance of my malady, caused by the high-pitched sirens of emergency vehicles arriving on the scene. 

I was filled with fear, filled with hope. It was time to [experiment..](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5px61m/helpers/)

Yes, your mom dying is *sad* but we weren't there and you didn't take us there to live it. It needs a lot more to be a successful nosleep story but first make it scary.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The City of Etzanoa </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:40:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some of you, especially if you live in the Midwest, know about Etzanoa. For those that dont Ill give a brief account of the city and its people. Several hundred years ago the Native Americans rules this continent. For the most part they were tribal and nomadic with free reign to move about as the seasons dictated. However, there were exceptions to this with large, permanent settlements such as Cahokia and Etzanoa supporting upwards of 20,000 people.

As history and legend have it Juan de Onate and seventy soldiers discovered a sprawling settlement of Wichita Indians poised between two rivers. When the Indians saw the Spaniards they fled and left their city. Once inside Onate explored the city and the size of the city alone unnerved them so much that they turned and retreated only to find a rival tribe coming in behind them. Onate stated that the rival tribe was surprised at their presence, indicating that they were actually there to attack Etzanoa. The Spaniards hunkered down and fired cannonballs out into the surrounding area hoping to scare off the warriors, which they eventually did. 

Why is this relevant, you might be asking yourself? For the past two years I have been working on site in Arkansas City, Kansas with a small team of student archeologists and Donald Blankeslee at the head. During that time we have uncovered undeniable evidence of the once-thought impossible city. What you will find in the news is that Blankeslee has confirmed the tale of Onate and his battle near a massive city. Cannonballs have been recovered, tons of flint objects, pottery, tools, and remains of building structures including a fully operational water shrine. 

Some of that is true, but mostly misinformation. Yes, the city existed, yes the Spanish were there, and yes we found a shrine. That is where the similarities stop. What we actually found was five times the size! Twenty five miles of Indian metropolis stretching as far as you can see in all directions. They completely dominated the area between the rivers and the surrounding hills in a manner never seen before. What I found to be the most surprising is that we found no walls, no battlements, no defense systems whatsoever. It was as if they had nothing to fear at all.

In the exact center of the city is a beautiful and ornate shrine designed with incredible skill and intricacy. At what would have been the highest point in the city stood six columns, four at each corner most likely supporting an open roof to allow the sun and moonlight to pierce through, and two smaller columns spaced four feet apart adorned with massive chains. The floor resembled a pyramid, sloping gently away from the center and opening to four aqueducts at the edge of the platform on which the columns stood. These aqueducts branched over and over as they moved down and spread to a trough that circled the shrine at its base. If you are having trouble visualizing it I could sketch something quickly but Im not an artist so it probably wont help.

The aqueducts were fashioned out of gold and each side of the shrine had its own design. It was clear this was not just a water shrine but one of sacrifice and service to a god or multiple gods. The sun god, moon god, harvest god? After weeks of studying the sides of the shrine I realized each one was a symbol and therefore must have meaning. We poured over every text and book we could get our hands on and finally found what each of the symbols means. Blood. Protection. Monster. Annual. It reminded me of the movie King Kong where they sacrifice someone to the giant gorilla in exchange for peace or for general worship.

Along the base of the shrine we also found several mounds which ended up being hundreds of skulls. In total we counted over one thousand individual skulls. What was interesting and horrifying was the condition of the skulls  they were all completely intact without blemish or any sign of damage and they were all from children. I truly believe these skulls are the remains of each sacrifice, which means if it truly was only a once per year ritual that these people lived here over one thousand years giving up their children to appease the gods. 

That really got me to thinking. Why would the Wichita turn and flee from a few Spanish if they were so numerous? They clearly ruled the land and feared nothing so even a few cannons should not have stopped them from decimating Onate and his men. And why would a rival tribe sent only a few hundred men to attack Etzanoa in the first place? Something was not adding up and I wanted to figure it out. As more and more of the ruins were uncovered we started to see a pattern in the homes and other buildings  it resembled Pompeii! Whole families huddled together arms locked across shoulders to protect the young which crouched inside. Each and every skeleton was missing the head.

It was a bone-chilling sight as we went from room to room finding only headless corpses all in the same position. I couldnt help but feel like I was being watched, but more than that, being judged, as I passed from hut to hut. I didnt stay down there long. A fear kept bubbling inside of me that I couldnt shake and after about fifteen huts I quickly made my way back to the surface and fresh air. Before the fear drove me out of that valley of death I did notice one other thing in each home  the symbol for Monster. 

Small, precise, and painstakingly burned into each of the main entryways was the symbol. Protection? Maybe. Reverence? Possibly. But maybe something even worse than that. A mark, made by the monster itself as it passed through each home. You see, I think that their protection ran out. Maybe they had no more children to sacrifice but that seems unlikely due to the size of the place. 

Want to know what I think? I think the Spanish interrupted the ceremony and angered the Monster/god to such an extent that it ravaged the land and all those in its path. I think Onate fled at the first sign of trouble and ran into a tribe on their way to the ritual and while they battled it out in order to flee the entire city of Etzanoa suffered the wrath of their once-protector  the Wendigo. 

That is why youll never hear about any of these details being found. I dont know if Blankeslee is being silenced or if he is working for someone in order to keep it silent. I want to know what else they uncover but I dont want to go back there, I dont feel safe. Almost as if it is still nearby, watching and waiting for the next ritual.

	<TITLE> Anisometropia </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:38:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Three quarters of American adults use some type of corrective eyewear. Can you believe that? I can because I have worn glasses my entire life. Granted it was eye-patches as a baby but glasses from as long as I can remember. Optometrists tell you all kinds of statistics during the exams and I have been to hundreds so my head is full of useless knowledge about eyes. How they work, common issues, you name it. 

I have the unfortunate fate of falling into a particularly rare issue, or rather, block of issues that culminated into two incredibly useless eyes. I was born with extreme anisometropia and aniseikonia which resulted in astigmatism and amblyopia. What that means is that one eye is incredibly near-sighted while the other is incredibly far-sighted. Usually eyes will work together but mine fight each other causing my brain to pick one image over the other. After almost two decades my brain has finally figured out how to use one eye or the other without fighting as much so depending on what I am looking at the depth of that object determines which eye snaps into focus. This means that one eye is constantly rolling around doing nothing until its turn to focus.

Sometimes surgery will correct it but the five that I have had so far havent done too much. They kept me from going blind, sure, but not much else. Doctors have tried everything but they are at the edge of technology and unless another breakthrough occurs me and my eyes are out of luck. I tell you all of this because I think I see things others do not. I can hear the jokes now so save them. *The practically blind guy sees things we cant? Pshhh* Trust me when I say you dont want to see the things I see. 

I am not certain whether or not I have always seen them and not noticed or if this is something new, a side-effect of the latest surgery maybe. All my life I have had incredible peripheral vision  the one benefit of having endlessly wandering eyes. Even though they are not entirely focused on it I do pick up on things off to the sides that others would not normally see and then can turn to focus my eyes on them. They has saved me many a time from the vicious bullies throughout my school years trying to sneak up behind me. You can probably imagine the endless torment I have received with literal googley-eyes-syndrome as my wonderful contemporaries like to call me. But now the one positive factor I have had about all of this is betraying me. 

During one of the latest run-ins with a group of jerks I thought I saw a slap coming from the left side so I threw a hand up and flinched away to the right, directly into the slap that actually came from that side. My head rang and my cheek was instantly streaked with tears (I have over-active tear ducts as well) and my ears were filled with harsh, barking laughter from all around me. I guess the psychic is losing his touch! HAHAHAHAHA! Crying from one little slap? Baby bitch! Normally I would stand up for myself, even fight back at times, but not today. My mind was trying to grasp what I had thought I had seen to the left. It was a fast moving blur. What was it? I looked around past the ring of future societal rejects in a vain attempt to track down what could have caused it. 

Pushing past them I stayed vigilant on my way to class hoping to see it again. I am not sure why I was so obsessed with the blur but something about it nagged at me, agitated me. I tried to pay attention all through anatomy class (it was actually my favorite subject) but I kept getting distracted by flitting images at the edge of my periphery. Normally I wouldnt be bothered by this, I am used to it after all, but today it was different. They were different. 

How can I describe it? Have you even been poked in the eye and your vision is blurry? You can make out shapes and colors and maybe because you are familiar with your surroundings you even know what it is you are looking at despite the blur and tears obscuring your view. That is what these were like except everything around them was clear. Like oil in water, they only disturbed the space they took up and nothing more. And, just like oil in water, they didnt belong. I was sure of that more than I was sure of anything else. 

------------------

That was three weeks ago. 

I havent gone out much because it has become much worse. I see them more and more, yet I dont see them. No matter how fast I turn, no matter how much I anticipate their movements I cant catch them. But I think they are getting closer  a horrible ink blot moving sinuously through the air. They seem to take up more of my periphery whereas before it was just a flicker in the far corner. How they are closer yet impossible to see I still dont know. 

Something else, something new, I can see them at night. Even in the deepest recesses of shadow they undulate and defy my vision. They are a different kind of darkness, darker than the absence of light? How?

I sit here in bed with my phone as dim as possible in order to perform tests. As I type this out they draw nearer. When I raise the brightness to the maximum they draw nearer. The only thing I can do is turn to look. Then, and only then, do they vanish. But what if the next time I turn they dont?

I gave my eyes a rest and I can see them still, clearer, closer, taking up more of my field of view. What do they want? I used to get respite when I turned my head. Now I push them closer to the center. 

Eyes closed. Dont look, dont stare. 

LOOK! Open your eyes! 

They are in my eyes. Insideeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

-------------

I can see your future - You dont have much time. If you start to see them dont look, dont acknowledge them. It might give you more time.

	<TITLE> I Hate Saturdays </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:36:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A shrill beeping startled me into consciousness and I blinked against the harsh overhead lights. A horrible chemical taste filled my mouth and as I brought my hands up to rub at my puffy eyes they quickly halted and pain shot up my arms. Cold metal dug mercilessly into my wrists, catching my full attention and snapping me immediately out of the post-sleep stupor. It must be Saturday again.

My wife shuffled over to the oven and pressed a few buttons, ending the beeping and letting out a wave of heat as she reached inside and pulled out a dish. My stomach gurgled and turned at the smell and the thought of what was about to happen once again. How did I let her get me again? I needed to stop letting my guard down.

"Time for dinner, hunnie!" Her chipper voice and gently swaying hips made it all the worse. How could she?!

A full plate was placed in front of me, assaulting my eyes and nose with the horrible stench and repulsive sight of what was about to be forced into my body. "Please don't" I pleaded, "I wasn't raised like you.... I can't eat that shit!"

I fought hard against the handcuffs but my arms were crossed and cuffed individually to the chair. My feet were constrained in a similar manner but to the table legs which were strong and sturdy. I had managed to break free the first night but there was no escaping this. My legs were stretched out in front of me so that I could not get purchase to stand and my arms tight behind me. I tried rolling to the side but only lost skin on my ankles and quickly came back to the center of my prison. 

A loving smile never left her face as she sliced through the viscera before me and soon had a perfect fork-full, moving steadily toward me. I clenched my jaw and pressed my tongue as hard as I could against the backs of my teeth in an attempt to keep it out. I could feel it rubbing against my thin-set lips.

"Open up or we will do this the hard way."

I took one look at the fork, then stole a glance her way. I knew she wasn't bluffing but I couldn't willingly open my mouth. She sighed and set the fork down, reaching for the harness she made that fit into my nose and around my neck. I threw my head back and forth and tried to snap at her hands but eventually, she had it around my head and the plugs pushed up into my nostrils.

A small amount of oxygen made it past the plastic and cloth but not enough. Soon my lungs were burning and I chanced a small breath through pressed teeth. Her hand was swift, slapping at my Adam's apple and I gagged, gasping for air. The fork found its way inside before I could blink and my stomach turned once again. 

Just being on my tongue sent tears streaming down my cheeks and my gag reflex increased to a code red. The little piece slid around on my tongue no matter how still I tried to be. The texture of it alone was enough to loosen the snot in my nose and it began to run down and around the plugs. Soon my beard was full of snot and salty tears.

"You have nine more pieces to go so you better hurry up. You know it is better when it is warm."

I stared at her with hatred, wishing innumerable evil upon her and bit down into the horrible filth she forced into my palette. Revulsion coursed through me and I shivered, goosebumps covering my entire body. My butthole puckered and fresh tears followed the salty paths to my chin. I could feel the juices sliding down my throat and the stringy meat coated my teeth. Two quick bites to mash it up as best as I could before tilting my head back and forcing it down. It spread its tendrils of pulp out as it slid down into my stomach. I highly doubted it would stay there long. Another piece made its way toward me on the fork and I let out a sob. 

"Please, I just can't. Don't make me do this. If you loved me-"

I was cut off when the fork jammed into my mouth and into my tongue. I pulled back instinctively from the pain and bit down accidently into the piece. The juices exploded in all directions and I choked once, twice, and the first piece came back up along with whatever she had drugged me with.

She tsked, cleaned it up, and pressed another piece toward me once more. 

I really fucking hate squash.

My eyes snapped open and my adrenaline immediately tripled. I fumbled with the sheets as I tried to untangle my sweaty legs from the cotton prison and bounded down the hallway to the security panel. I punched in the four digit code and a womans friendly voice greeted me several seconds later.

This is Watchful Skies operator 212, we received a motion detection alarm. Is everything okay in your home?

It was only a few steps from bedroom to hall but I was out of breath. I am not sure yet. Will you please stay on the line while I check the home?

Certainly sir.

Our home is on the smaller side but like all ranch-style homes it has a lot of windows. I reached for the bat I keep behind the closet door and slowly walked through each moon-lit room. I checked each window and door carefully for signs of forced exit or damage and each closet and hiding place. With each room my heart rate increased slightly, knowing that would be the room I found someone.

When I made a full circle of the home I let out a long breath and tried to regain my composure. I put the bat back in its place and informed the woman all was clear. She asked for the verbal clear code and I gave it to her and re-armed the system. I wiped the few beads of sweat off of my brow before heading into the bedroom.

My wife sat huddled in bed with eyes as big as Ive ever seen. Its okay, sweetheart. Just a false alarm. 

But, but why would it alarm at all? Are you sure you checked everywhere? Nothing is missing?

I crawled into bed and put my arms around her tightly and scratched her back. Yes everything is fine. Electronics are silly like that sometimes, you know? At least we know it works! I flashed my best grin and kept scratching until she drifted back into sleep.

-------------------

We both woke up a bit groggy from the midnight interruption but a large mug of coffee quickly remedied the slowness of step and glazed expressions. I tore the rubber band off of the paper and handed her all but the sports section. After a few poorly written stories about our awful teams and two pieces of peanut butter toast I got up and got ready for work.

Any news in the paper this morning, dear?

Nope, she replied with a grin.

See, nothing to be worried about. Lets get to work shall we?

I offered her my arm and walked down to the basement. We slipped on our lap coats and rubber galoshes and I keyed in the code. The large metal door swung in silently and I stepped through first. Just as I suspected one of our children had tried to escape again. I walked over to the cage our first born was in and inspected the damage. A few bent bars here and there but nothing I couldnt fix.

See? I asked my wife, I told you this was a good idea. *Why do we need to electrify the cages* you asked. *Why do we need a security system? What if they get suspicious?* She is a little hellion and needs to be taught a lesson. I directed my voice to our daughter and smacked her hard across the face. You try escaping again and a little zap will be the least of your worries.

	<TITLE> Never fully dismiss your Fears - 2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-21 15:32:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 

I am writing this from my mother-in-laws house, trying to recall everything I can over the past few days. Fear doesnt know age.

-------------------

When you watch a scary movie you are jumpy, nervous, on the edge the entire time because *you know* something is going to happen. It wouldnt be a scary movie if nothing did after all. Once the movie is over you slowly come down from the edge but you are wary, apprehensive. Strange sounds set your heart into overdrive and your imagination goes wild. When a lightbulb fizzles out or a door closes by itself that fear flares back up for a moment. That is how my family and I felt for the first few days back in our home.

Lights were left on all night in the hallway and kitchen, the vent fan in the bathroom turned on to mask the sounds of the night, and the bed was pulled away from the walls. When nothing happened that first night a wave of reassurance washed over us and we began to behave more normally again. The house was filled with the soft, tinkling laughter of our daughter and her silly antics removed any lingering fear or worry. 

It was good to be home. It is so easy to take for granted the things you have until they are taken from you. I found myself working harder at my job, more productive, so that I could get home sooner and spend time with my wife and daughter. I am pretty sure she knows the sound of my car now because when I open up the front door she is already moving toward it with an expectant grin. Those bright, blue eyes filled with the innocence and joy of a child lumbering toward me with each disjointed step. 

Every day she seems to learn something new. Just last week she has said four new words, signed two more, and began walking. But my favorite of all is hide and seek. Babies love peek-a-boo which is just a stationary version of hide and seek so it makes sense that they love the mobile game as well. She will crawl around behind her toy house and peek her head through the windows until I catch her gaze, then duck down and giggle. 

My wife and I bought her a nylon tent with tunnels that connect to each side for her birthday and set it up in her nursery this week. She loves it! We bought a little campfire set with the logs and fire and smores and hotdogs to roast and a little lantern to hang at the top. This is her new favorite place to play hide and seek. So many places to hide and crawl around, her own little maze. 

Every evening when I get home my girls give me a big hug and kiss, my daughters little arms grip around my neck and she says dada nonstop for the next half hour. I set my things down and crawl around after her while she hides and giggles and screams in delight. Ill pop my head through a tunnel and reach my arms around the other side to tickle her chubby thighs. Suddenly I am on the other side reaching through the front flaps. Then my huge body worms down another tunnel and I take all of the space up inside of the tent while she escapes down another tunnel toward freedom. Round and round we go until I am tired and dinner is ready. 

You would think with all of this play time she would get worn down by the end of the day and zonk out on her mommies belly after a good nursing but she is a ball of boundless energy. What used to be quiet time for my wife and I has been pushed from 7:30 to 8:30 and now this week past 9:00 PM. We still turned out all of the lights at 8:00 except for the reading lamp and let the night lights illuminate the rest of the home.

After dinner I was down on the floor reading her favorite books to her while she went back and forth between building a tower out of blocks and knocking it down. I finished the fourth or fifth book and clapped my hands as is custom at the end of a kids book and she took off for the nursey. I sighed and looked at my wife with a smile as my little girl waddled off for me to follow. On all fours, I growled my big scary daddy growl and slinked along the floor.

I smell a little baby, yes. I moved forward slowly, sniffing around the corner and peeked my head into the dimly lit room.

She sat at the edge of the tent with one hand on the flap looking over her shoulder to make sure I was following. Her eyes lit up and she lunged forward into the tent, knees sliding noisily along the nylon fabric. I waited until she stopped moving before proceeding to the tunnel she occupied, pushing my hand down to poke her in back. I was rewarded with a little squeal and the swish swish swish of her chubby legs motoring forward to the center of the tent. I gave my best lion roar and pocked my head through the flaps. She jumped backward and tugged on my hair before moving to another exit. 

I circled, growling softly, pushing my hands in this spot and that spot to see if she would grab back like she sometimes does. Tiny little razor sharp teeth clamped down on my finger and I pulled back quickly. 

Dang it! No biting, sweetie. She has been teething non-stop for over a month and chews on everything. It is a work in progress. I poked my head into the tent to pull her out but was met with her little feet churning away quickly to the end of a tunnel.

I wanted to get a hold of her quickly before the biting left her young mind so I leapt over the tent and reached into the tunnel she was in. I gently grabbed hold of her shoulders and her teeth immediately sank into my thumb. Only this time she didnt let go. I pulled her out to give her bottom a pat but was greeted with a furious swipe across my face. Razor sharp nails dug deeply into my skin and drew blood and tears. My vision was blurred but I could make out *something* resembling my daughter. The eyes were dark, dim, deeply set in anger and hatred. It was her sweet little face cast over with a horrible evil sneer. I gasped and out of the corner of my eye could see my daughter worm her way out of another tunnel, looking up at me with wide eyes. 

I tried to blink away the blood and tears but whatever this thing was squirmed out of my grip and sank its horrible teeth into my calf. I could feel the muscle separating inch by inch. Howling in pain I swiped out for it only to retreat back into the tunnel. My wife came running in as I was scooping up my daughter and limping forward to the door. Her eyes took in the damage to my face, the confused fear coated our daughter, and realization set in. She took our daughter and ran to the car.

Closing the door on her heels I turned slowly just in time to see the thing spring forward, nails glinting in the dim glow of the night light. I barely had time to raise an arm up before it crashed into me with surprising force and I staggered down to one knee. My leg throbbed all the way up to my knee, hot searing cuts opened on my arm where I had taken its charge. Blood continued to trickle into my eyes blurring my vision and I flung my arm out in a wide arc to try and slam into my tormentor. 

I felt the back of my hand connect with its leg and saw it fling sideways off balance. I lunged forward and landed directly on top of it. Bones cracked and a high-pitched screech sent cracks across the mirror and windows. I clutched at my ears but gasped when a talon started to burrow into my chest. Reaching under me and rolling sideways I held it at arms length and battered it into the solid wood drawing table. Another series of cracks, probably ribs this time. Between rapid blinks I could see pure hatred mixed with pain in the mimics face. 

Adrenaline coursed through me and powered my arms into action. I bent and twisted and squeezed and tore at the horror in front of me. Blind rage overtook me. Invading my home, tormenting my family, scaring my child. My hands did not leave much left when I was done. With my one good eye I watched the life slip from the terrible thing and once it did I broke down. My body wracked with sobs and somewhere deep inside I knew I would never be the same.

Then a slow, maniacal chuckle echoed through the house.

Fears never go away, they just get suppressed. And they get stronger.

	<TITLE> Never fully dismiss your Fears - 1 </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I used to have a habit of sleeping with an arm or a leg hanging off of the side of the bed. For whatever reason it was comfortable to me. Then I watched Childs Play. The little psycho doll hiding under beds and slashing peoples tendons. I was probably eight or nine when I first watched it and my habit came to an abrupt end.

For years I was fearful of something hiding under my bed poised to attack the moment I swung my legs over the edge or dangled a hand down. So I began jumping out of bed. I was not afraid to be in bed and go to sleep and I was not afraid to grab my toys out from under the bed or even play under the bed IF I was already on the floor. The unknown, the hidden, out of my sight lines - that is what scared me. 

As do most childhood fears like being afraid of the dark or the deep end of the pool I grew out of my need to jump off the bed and my habit of arm or leg dangling off the side of the bed slowly took hold once again. I dont know whether it is the fact that as we age we become more rational or become bigger and stronger and more capable. Every so often the movie would pop up on TV late at night, usually around October and November, and I think about my silly fear and chuckle. But without fail that very first morning I would hesitate slightly before getting out of bed. Just for a brief flicker that fear would rush to the front of my mind and I would need to push it back. 

The last time that happened was probably a decade and a half ago, maybe even longer, because I cant remember the last time I hesitated. Until this morning. 

I am 31 now, married and have a child of my own. I would like to say that I run my household but I dont. My little girl does. Every drawer has a special lock on it. Every corner has rubber coatings. Baby gates dominate the landscape. And my king sized bed lies unceremoniously on the floor. No box frame, no box springs, just a low profile mattress covered in pillows and sheets. Why, you might ask? So that our sweet little girl wont fall off. 

Now you may be asking yourself why any of this matters to the story at hand. Remember how as I child I would be afraid of things under my bed? This morning I awoke with a start. Heart racing, feet and palms sweating, and blood dripping from my outstretched arm. Thin, deep cuts ran the length of my forearm. The cuts began at the point where my arm extended off of the edge of the bed. 

It is hard to be afraid of something under your bed when it is lying flat on the floor with your body weight pressing it down but at that moment I was terrified. My eyes flicked around the dim room trying to see the culprit. When nothing jumped out at me as obvious and all hiding places appeared empty I slowly made my way out of bed, trying not to let any more of my blood further saturate the sheets and attended to my wounds in the bathroom.

After a lot of gauze and athletic tape my arm was bandaged up so I began searching around the house for anything out of place, missing, uncharacteristic. After finding nothing I tried to calm my nerves and settle down. I tried the logic approach - The alarm was still on, nothing set it off, what did this to my arm?

I went in to wake up my wife and explain to her what happened when I saw a glint of metal coming from the grate next to our bed. Sprinting the last few steps I pushed the bedside table out of the way and ripped the vent right off of the wall. A few drops of blood on the back of the vent cover were all I could find but I swear I saw something inside of there! 

My wife woke up startled from all of the noise and saw my bandaged arm and torn up wall. Her first words were along the lines of what the hell are you doing? but she was cut off when a low, soft chuckle made its way out of the vent and into our ears.

---------------

UPDATE:

First I want to thank you all for the amazing suggestions given in the comments. I never would have thought of most of them to try. Honestly I was too afraid to do much thinking at all other than to get out. 

I wasnt able to get any chlorine gas but I did hook up my car via a very long hose. I went through the house and closed every vent except for one and dropped the hose down into it. Once the car was running I ran around the house pouring salt around each vent to try to further force whatever this thing is to stay inside and suffer the fumes. 

Once that was done I set our motion sensors on the highest setting and armed the house. They should pick up any movement the size of a bunny or larger. I opened up the app to my security system and watched for any motion notifications while I circled the house, making sure nothing escaped from a vent or window or hole in the ground. Who knows, right? 

I ran my car for a full gas tank worth just to be sure and then let the house air out while I walked to the closest gas station with my spare tank. I watched my security notifications all day, all night, and all through the next day as well without a single alarm. I figured the house was probably cleared out by then and safe for me to walk around in. There was still a funny smell in the air but I opened up all of the vents and turned the attic fan on and opened up all of the windows. None of the salt was disturbed so I know it didnt make it out of a vent. 

Thank you so much for the great ideas, guys! We are going to wait one more day to really clear out the air and then move back in. My wife is looking forward to sleeping in our bed once again and so am I.

	<TEXT> He was not a good person. Not a good husband or father, not a good neighbor or teacher. English class, I believe.

He was, however, an excellent task master. What good are children if not for labor? He had many.

His house was sparkling and spotless. Martha Stewart would be proud. The lawn immaculate, rivaling the cities botanical gardens. Had you been unfortunate enough to be his neighbor you would see his children work their fingers to the bone day in and day out. 
They could not play. They could not frolic. They could not eat until the chores were done. 

I never heard them talk, let alone laugh. But I heard him.

Bite the bullet, girl. You dilly dally now youll miss supper.

Dont you dare cut corners, boy. A man is only as good as the job he does.

Looks like you finished by the skin of your teeth today!

What are you waiting for? The early bird gets the worm!

My wife told me not to interfere. She told me to let the police handle things. I couldnt do that.

------------

I strapped him tightly to a sturdy chair in my basement and slapped his face to wake him up. I forced the mouth widener into his thin-lipped maw. No pain, no gain. My eyes must have twinkled when I uttered those four words because fear dripped out of his in the form of tears. 

Using a scalpel I slowly peeled the gums away from his teeth one by one. 

I am not sure what exactly constitutes a corner on a human being so I did my best. His shoulders gushed from the deep gashes and his feet pumped blood out of the stumps where toes used to be. 

As the color in his skin slowly faded I placed a bullet in between his red teeth. Time to call it a day, neighbor. I placed a punch on the back of the bullet casing and mashed into it with a hammer. 

I hated English.

	<TEXT> Time is a powerful thing. It dictates how we value activities and what we warrant good enough. You can waste time or be efficient with your time however you can never get time back. It is ever-flowing and only on one direction.


The pleasantly voiced woman turns her body forty five degrees and gestures with her outstretched arm to the gentleman behind her. 


With that being said what would you do if you had no perception of time? Would you live your life any differently? Would you waste time on video games or books or social media? Would you focus on one hobby and perfect it? Would you simply go crazy?


She cocks her head slightly and smiles to the group.


That is what we aim to find out. So far Ian has been living within this confined apartment-style cell for twelve years and four months. We supply everything he needs and asks for barring items such as a clock or calendar. Some of you might have noticed the clock hanging on the wall. Does it look somewhat strange to you?


A hand goes up slowly, nervously.


Yes, what do you notice about the clock?


The young boy timidly responds. It only has a second hand.


Correct! Ian is not the first volunteer for this project. Steve did not last very long, unfortunately. Six weeks if I remember correctly. He made an innumerable amount of comments during his time in the cell about needing to know. Before we placed Ian into his new home we installed a clock with only the second hand in an attempt to understand just how much information we need about time in order to function. Does anyone else notice something different about the clock?


Its too fast, blurted out another child. 


Well done! Yes, we have sped up the second-hand twice now, each an increment of one eighth of a second. It was believed that if done in small enough increments that Ian would not notice and therefore use his time that much more effectively. So far the hypothesis has been correct.

A brief pause, then, Any questions?

	<TEXT> On your left you will see ten complete strangers living in a room. They will remain together in the room for one week or until only one person is left. Inside of the room is one chair, one bed, and one book. Typically there will be one homosexual, one criminal, one hippie, and one corporate executive among the ten people. Of course we have done studies were each individual was of the same job type, sexual preference, religion, and so on, however the results seldom vary. On average a group lasts thirty one hours. Interesting side note  when we put ten cult leaders together in the room they lasted longer than any other group at eighty seven hours.

As you can see this particular group is entering the eleventh hour and already groups have formed. Ah, subject 10 has begun fighting with subject 8 over the book. Lets see what happens, shall we? This is the third fight over the book already between these two. It could get ugly this time. Oh my, subject 10 broke a leg off of the chair and is waving it at subject 8. You may want to look away, the rage in her eyes is  ok yes she drove the chair leg into his neck. 

You would think that knowing they were being watched would change their behavior but it doesnt. We just hate each other so much, dont we? Now if youll step this way and look to your right

	<TEXT> My name is Aaron and I work for a call center. It is a ridiculously boring job but it pays the bills and I know what I am getting into each day, you know? Very scheduled, very compartmental, very accommodating of my OCD tendencies. The company that I take calls for is pretty famous for their bad infomercials and sketchy product but yet we get hundreds of calls a day wanting to schedule a free consultation. 

Those are the calls I usually get. Take their information, fill a spot on the calendar, next call. The reason I am posting here today is because a few nights ago I received a call Id never taken before and pray I never take again. At first I thought maybe it was a prank (we get those a lot, too) but pretty soon I realized this man was serious and I freaked out. Below is the transcription of that call.

03/02/2017 - 7:14PM

*Operator* - Good evening, thank you for choosing [REMOVED]. You are speaking with Aaron, are you ready to change your life?

*Caller* - Please help me!

*Operator* - I like your enthusiasm, sir. May I have your first and last name, please?

*Caller* - [REMOVED]

*Operator* - Great, thank you so much for calling us [REMOVED]. I have a few simple questions I must ask in order to speed up the consultation process. The entire process will only take a few moments. Would that be ok?

*Caller* - You dont understand, I already have your product. I need HELP! 

*Operator* - I am afraid I dont understand [REMOVED], why are you calling the consultation line if you already have our product?

*Caller* - This was the only number I could find. Look, I really need help. I doubted you, the product, whatever. I cant get it to stop!

*Operator* - Sir, get what to stop?

*Caller* - My hair! It keeps growing! 

*Operator* - I am sorry [REMOVED] but isnt that what our product is designed for? I am failing to see the issue. Are you afraid to get it cut at a barber shop? I can assure you, sir, that no one will know you used our product.

*Caller* - LOOK! IT IS GROWING SO FAST I CAN LITERALLY WATCH IT GROW! I NEED HELP! WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?

*Operator* - Sir, please try to remain calm. I am going to put you on a brief hold while I contact my manager.

-Hold music-

[I called my manager over and explained the call, telling her that I thought it was a prank call at first but the terror in the guys voice sounded so real. She patched into the call and took over. I just sat there in stunned silence while I listened to the exchange.]

*Operator* - Good evening, this is Julia, the telecomm manager. Would you please explain the situation very calmly, sir?

*Caller* - OH MY GOD.. OK ok ok umm. So a few weeks ago I called and had a consultation. The product came and I was excited to try it out because I had a blind date in a few days. I admit I had my hesitations about the legitimacy of your claim so I applied a little more product than the directions stated and no..

*Operator* - I am sorry to cut you off sir but did you say that you did not follow the instructions in the packaging?

*Caller* - Oh God is it going to stop? Uh, yea that I didnt really read them carefully. Shit. loud buzzing- I just scooped out a bunch and rubbed it in and took a few vitamins.

*Operator* - Sir, put the clippers down and listen to me carefully. Think hard now. How much of the product did you apply to your scalp? How much of the jar is left?

*Caller* - There is none left. I used about half last night and the rest of it this morning. grunts and the sounds of a struggle come across the line-

*Operator* - I have one last question. Did you use any of the specially formulated shampoo and conditioner?

*Caller* - Uh yea I did this morning when I took a shower.

*Operator* - Ok I need you to listen closely. DO NOT use any more product. Pills, shampoo, condition, nothing. Understand me?

*Caller* - Yea ok.

*Operator* - Good. DO NOT under any circumstances cut your hair, trim your hair, run a comb or brush through your hair. Not even your fingers. All of these activities promote hair growth and that is the last thing we want right now. Am I making myself clear?

*Caller* - Yes but you are really scaring me. What is going on? 

*Operator* - One last thing, sir. DO NOT fall asleep. Once your hair stops growing you will need to wait two full days and then you will be able to cut it like normal. We will check on your in the morning for the next three days for updates.

*Caller* - Uh yea ok, uh bye.

---------------------------

Because I was the one to take the call I had to check up on him each morning. The first morning he answered and thanked me for checking in. He sounded incredibly tired and scared. So far it hadnt stopped growing. The next morning he didnt answer so I tried back two more times, at thirty minute intervals. 

After the third call going to voicemail I called the police to head over and check on him. They found him on his sofa where he had fallen asleep. His hair had grown so long and thick that it had suffocated him. They found over ten feet of hair in his airways. 

Because of this incident we now sell our product in daily capsules and have warning labels on every part of our packaging. We also have a special protocol designed for calls such as these. I beg you, regardless of the product, no matter how harmless or innocuous it may seem, always follow directions.

	<TITLE> Never buy a mattress off of Craigslist - 3 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 

My wife went from chains to cuffs within minutes. We were stuffed into the back of a squad car and the sirens started up. Twenty minutes later we were on the outskirts of town at a park on the river that no one ever goes to due to the smell. The office opened the door and let us out. He led us about a hundred yards away from the car and told us to face the river on our knees. My wife was balling her eyes out, pleading for our lives. 

*I aint gonna kill ya, just need to look like it, alright? Now shut up and listen.*

So we did. Turns out this cop was new to the area, two weeks to be exact, and noticed a lot of weird, off-the-record stuff going on. When he was transferred he was told to take some drug that is exploding out on the streets so he faked it. He didnt know what it was but he figured it was some kind of weird mind crap because the Chief would give people orders no one should ever accept but no one asked any questions. They just did whatever he said. Anyway the police have been keeping this human trafficking stuff hush-hush because it is how they are testing the drug or getting it out on the streets or something. The cop was told to take us out here and pop us since I was causing all this trouble talking about kidnapping and stuff online, bringing unnecessary attention to Downtown. The last thing he tells us is that this will hurt our ears and to fall down and never come back to the city.

**BANG BANG BANG BANG**

I flopped forward like a dying fish and laid face-down on loose gravel and mud. I heard a thud and hoped my wife had done the same. I whispered softly to lie still until we could no longer hear the car. A few minutes passed before I ventured to flip over and found a small key nearby. The key unlocked the cuffs holding my wrists together and I leaned over to undo my wifes. She was trembling on the cold ground and I pulled her into my arms. 

*Its going to be OK, now. Youre safe with me now, babe.*

She stared back at me with eyes that had seen far too much. I am not sure how long we sat there staring or how long we cried, but eventually she broke the silence.

*They took her. Our baby. They took her.*

*Who? Where did they take her, hunnie?*

She started to cry again but it didnt last long. She was spent. It would be the last time we cried until this whole thing was over. She explained what had happened and how Brian and the receptionist used the storage facility to move people and drugs. They lured people up there with all kinds of Craigslist ads, sometimes to steal the person, sometimes to spread the drug. She said the mattresses would be filled with the vials and sent out all over the city. Some of the people they stole were given the drug, some were sold off and some were used as slave labor. She wasnt harmed or abused in any way, just treated harshly but she didnt know what happened to our little girl. I promised her Id find our daughter and bring her back and we would get out of this forsaken city.

It isnt easy leaving Downtown if you are in a position like us  no money, nowhere to go. But I knew our lives depended on it. 

---------------------

I still had all of my gear in the car and since I had parked it off the beaten path I hoped it was still there. Obviously I couldnt contact the police for help and I didnt have many friends to begin with, let alone trust now that all of this had happened, so I was on my own. I told my wife Id be back as soon as I could with the car and Id take her to the next city over and get her into a motel while I figured things out. 

It took me a few hours to make it back to my car but I was in luck because not only was my car still there but it hadnt been broken into yet or thrown up on blocks to steal the tires and rims so all my gear was still in it and it ran. My wife was sitting in the same place I left her, throwing rocks into the slow-moving river. I went as far as I could go before filling up the gas tank. While I was there I pulled out the limit for cash on the card and gave it to my wife for food and clothes and then drove another half a tank of gas away before pulling into a pretty nice looking motel. It was one of those extended-stay places with a little kitchen and living room and a nice hot breakfast each morning. The nice thing about being dead is that no one can come after you when you dont pay your credit card bill. 

We made love that night like it was our honeymoon, or like it was the last time wed ever see each other. I am not sure if there is a difference, honestly. That morning, full from a nice breakfast, I went to a pawn shop and picked up a heavy-duty Taser and a decent rifle. It wasnt as nice as the one that was taken from me at the factory but it would do. I made my way back to the hotel, pulled out whatever money I could from the ATM and then we headed the opposite direction. I didnt know for sure but in case we were followed or my credit cards were tracked I didnt want to take any chances. I only used cash from that point on and went about four hours in the other direction to a different extended stay motel. This one was just as clean as the last and I thought it would make due until I could find our daughter. My wife promised she would stay indoors as much as possible and only use cash when she needed food. We tested out the bed before I left. 

I made a new e-mail and kept checking Craigslist all day to see if I could find any ads like the ones they used so I can try and meet up with someone for information. I responded to a few but so far nothing back from them. I waited until late into the night before putting a few more cameras around the storage facility. Since the cops were a part of this whole thing I figured they wouldnt shut down operations. Once everything was set up I retired to my car to watch footage and browse the Deep Web for anything about infants. I couldnt imagine what they would want a child for and I was somewhat thankful for that. Trying to imagine all the things that could be happening would bring any father to his knees. 

----------------------

I must have passed out because I woke up to warm sunlight on my face and my laptop and phone clutched tightly in my hands. Both were dead. Fortunately I had a car charger for my phone so I was able to get that going again but I didnt have anything for the laptop. I must have left it at the house. Without the footage I could only hope to get lucky with a hit on some of those ads. 

Not too far from where I was parked was an amazing smelling food truck so I went over and grabbed something to eat  breakfast burritos with homemade salsa. So good. Halfway through the bulging tortilla I got a buzz  someone responded to my ad inquiry. This one was for a single-sized mattress. I was guessing that maybe the size of the mattress was code for something, maybe age. After several more e-mails and much convincing I was able to get the meeting place to a local Wal-Mart parking lot. With the Taser in my pocket I waited for the van to pull up.

Have you ever used a Taser before? It is so satisfying. When the gentleman was showing me the mattress I jabbed the Taser right into his crotch and let it rip. The look on his face was priceless. After a bit of interrogation in the spacious cargo area of the van he gave me enough information to believe my little girl was alive and unharmed. My main concerns was whether or not she was given the drug or if she would have eaten at all during our time apart. She is a pretty sensitive girl and a picky eater. Apparently they dont usually take kids but if they do they raise them and sell them as child brides at an early age.

*You are going to go to wherever my daughter is and you are going to bring her back to me. If you dont Ill find you, your family, everyone you ever cared about, understand?*

I took my new friends wallet as insurance. At least I would have his address if anything went south. I could have guessed where we were going. After a few minutes he parked the van up front at the receptionist office and went into a side door. Peeking through the windshield from the back of the van I could make out a few kids faces and hear shrill cries for mommy. My gut was wrenching around  I couldnt leave them. 

As promised my daughter came out in this bastards arms and he opened up the back of the van. The look on her face when she saw me was magical. She squirmed and leapt out of his arms and crawled over to me faster than Id ever seen. 

*How many kids are in there?*

*Um, like five, man I dont know. Please, I got your daughter.*

*Who is here right now? Who is watching them kids?*

*Just the new receptionist, man. Come on, man, I did what you asked.*

*Bring them all out.* I finished my finish with a crackle of the Taser. *Bring them out and then we are done, ok?*

He did as I asked, although it took an agonizingly long time. At first I thought he screwed me and was about to hop out of the van when the door opened and a range of kids came out, all old enough to walk. The new receptionist was yelling at the guy but he just slammed the door on her and opened up the van. The kids piled in with me and my daughter and we were off. About three blocks down I told the guy to get out.

I drove off into the heart of Downtown to the news station headquarters. I knew the police wouldnt help me but maybe if I dropped a bunch of grimy, starved kids at a news desk claiming they were kidnapped Id get a little attention. Of course they thought I was crazy but the state of the kids gave them enough pause to look into some things. I didnt wait around, but I felt like I at least gave the kids some chance, some hope. I trashed the van (they did horrible things with it!) and buckled my little girl into her car seat. 

----------------------

I am posting this from a Starbucks in a hopefully far-enough-away location to never be bothered again. I watch the news to see if anything came of those kids but nothing, yet. Ive tried contacting other agencies to look into the police there but maybe this is the best way, posting here. Maybe with enough attention it can create some change.

My daughter has gained back most of the weight she lost and doesnt seem to be affected at all by the ordeal. Only time will tell. Jobs are hard to come by but we are making ends meet. All we wanted was a nice mattress but my family is safe, that is all that really matters. Sometimes you just have to be happy with what you have.

So like I said in my first post I unblocked Brians number and tried to get in touch with him again but it said it was disconnected. Of course I gave the number to the police to try and track but I have yet to hear any news from them, which is incredibly discouraging. They say you only have 48 hours to find a missing person and I am approaching that number very quickly. I cant I just cant lose my family. My wife is the sweetest, most loving and wonderful mother to our beautiful, vibrant daughter. I remember when she was born and  sorry. I have been thinking a lot about that night. I guess it is the only thing pushing me on. *I have to find my family!*

One of the comments mentioned checking my car for a tracking device. Dont know why I didnt think of it before so I went out last night before I went to work and after a few minutes of checking I did find something under the rear bumper, on my exhaust pipe. I dont know if it is a tracking device or what but I turned it in to the police on my way to work. Why didnt they think to check my car? Anyway I didnt really feel like working much. I was distracted and exhausted. My boss told me to take a few nights off, paid, to clear my head. I couldnt believe it, not because it is out of the ordinary but he is just a hardass most of the time I didnt think he had a soft spot on him. I took full advantage of it by heading back up to the storage site to see if I could find anything. 

Like I mentioned in my first post I work two jobs, one being warehouse stocking overnight and during the day I work for a home security company called Vivint installing and servicing home systems. One of the neat things we offer is a camera that you can access from anywhere in the world and watch a live stream. Most people use it as a nanny cam or to see what their pets do while they are gone but I had a great idea. Id set one up on the roof and then I could watch it from my work laptop to see if anyone is moving mattresses around. If I could get a visual on the guy we could catch him! So I headed up to the site and climbed up the backside of one of the buildings that had the humidity controlled units.

According to the receptionist they only have 24 of these units and since they are selling a ton of mattresses I figured that is a unit they would need to have. There were cameras all over the place so I couldnt get a perfect angle or see the whole row of units but I was able to place it in such a way that I could see about two thirds of them. Not ideal but better than nothing. The camera is tiny so I wasnt worried about anyone finding it and I know it can run for over 6 months on a fresh battery. 

Since I dont have anywhere to sleep at home I decided Id just recline the seat in my car and try to snooze a little while keeping an eye on the footage. Now I know a lot of you are probably thinking There is no way Brian is ever coming back to that place. And while I agree with you, what else can I do? I have to have hope, to believe they are still alive and unhurt. It is the only thing keeping me going. I am sure you can understand that. 

I must have actually fallen asleep because a train horn startled me and I jerked up, knocking the laptop off of my lap. The train was moving pretty slowly, even slower than most around here and there was a van and a few cars waiting at the crossing. It took a moment to remember where I was and rub the sleep out of my eyes. It was 3AM. I rewound the footage in triple speed to see if anyone had shown up during the hour and a half that I was laying there and only twenty minutes before a 15-passenger van showed up just inside the frame of the camera. It was hard to tell but I am pretty sure it was the receptionist that was there the day we came to buy the mattress. Two guys were hauling mattresses out of the back of the van and into one of the units. I started to get excited. I had him. I found him! Then I got sick to my stomach. From inside of the unit came five women, most of them older but one was pretty young. I couldnt see their faces because of the distance from the camera but I could see that they were chained together and gagged with something. One of the guys gave something to the receptionist lady, most likely money, and they piled into the van and drove off. 

Wait, I thought, didnt I just see a van? I looked up and the train was gone, the cars that were waiting now far off in the distance. I turned on my car and took off after the fading tail-lights, praying Id be able to catch up and hope they hadnt already turned off somewhere. I grabbed my phone and called the police, telling them everything that transpired and where I was/direction I was heading. They told me to pull over and to stop following but screw that - I floored it even more and tried to close the distance. 

Pretty soon I heard sirens from several different directions but I had lost sight of the van, or maybe never had sight of it. When I finally caught up to the taillights I was chasing they belonged to a Corolla or something. About that time my phone went off. It was the police, they had found the van! I drove my way over, only a few blocks east of where I was, hoping for good news. 

When I got there they had two men in cuffs in the back of a squad car which left soon after. Five women were laying on gurneys being tended to by medical staff, but none were my wife or daughter. I was relieved, happy, thankful that they were safe, but also devastated. Where was my family? After interrogation or whatever of the men and the women that were saved it was determined that they would have been sold as slaves  human trafficking. The police are still looking for my family, of course, but they arent acting very positive about the whole thing. 

I just left my day job because my boss caught me still watching footage of the unit and told me to just go home. I know it sounds stupid but what else can I do? I cant eat or sleep or even think without feeling the need to vomit. My family, slaves. Sold to some freak that will do God knows what to them? My eleven month old daughter. So beautiful, so innocent. Daddy is going to find you!

----------------

**UPDATE**

So far no one has come back to that unit other than police. I watched them drag everything out, sick to my stomach. I watched their cars drive off full of evidence. Everyone seems to have vanished that was connected to this aside from the two guys that were arrested. They havent given up any information from what the station is telling me. I dont know why but I started to browse Craigslist again to see if any new ads were put up similar to the one I had responded to. I didnt find anything but I did remember a few stories Id heard about the Deep Web/Dark Web and how human trafficking goes down on those sites. 

I dove head first into that awful area of cyberspace trying to find anything that could help me find my family. The things I found only made me that much sicker and more worried about my family. Who could do such things to fellow human beings? I know we are in a sick, confused world but oh  I will just stop there. I dont want to upset anyone by the things I saw. After an hour of searching I was about to give up when I found something hosted by BMK. I had seen it before and passed it by but looking at it again jogged my memory. The only reason it stood out to me at all is because of the CL ad. Brian had called himself the Mattress King. It is a pretty standard claim, to be fair, but I didnt think I could pass up an opportunity even if it wasnt him. 

I responded to it with an old e-mail I hadnt used since probably high school and got a response almost immediately. $5000 cash for a female. $4000 for a male. Discounts for age. An address to meet at and a time.

When I plugged the address in I was surprised to see how close it was to the storage facility. One of your comments was right, they kept operations close. Obviously I dont have the cash but I have a gun. What mid-westerner doesnt? I am on my way right now. I dont want to be late.

----------

**FINAL UPDATE**

So as I said I like being early and I figured my old pal Brian would be late to this arrangement. I got there an hour ahead of time to scope out the place and find a good spot to take him out. 

I found a nice loft where I could overlook the big, open factory floor. I parked my car a ways away at a thrift store parking lot and walked to it with a guitar case - hiding my .22. I guessed they would probably have a few people out front waiting for me to come in and Brian inside with the lineup of women. Fortunately I guessed correctly. 

A total of six armed people showed up, four taking position somewhere outside. Brian and the receptionist stood inside with twenty women. My heart skipped a beat when I saw my wife among them. I almost cried out right then and there but I stifled it in time. 

I took careful aim and busted Brian's knee with the first shot. I'm assuming he went into shock because he dropped and laid there moaning for the entirety of my visit. My next shot took out the receptionist as she ran. 

The girls started screaming right away, obviously not knowing what was going on. A guy from outside came in but I was already back outside on my way down. I have never been happier than right then about my grandad forcing me to go hunting every year and "earn my dinner". It was paying off! It was then that I called the police. 

I waited until sirens were nearing before I shot the next two guards in the leg. Suffer for your sins. I made my way inside and used one of the guards handguns to finish Brian and the other guy with him after I let him see my face. I don't think my wife even noticed me until I put my hand on her face. 

I'm not sure where the last one ran off to but he didn't bother us as I unlocked the women and hugged my wife. *Where's my baby? Is she ok?*

She just shook her head. We cried, oblivious to the police filtering in.

	<TITLE> Never buy a mattress from Craigslist - 1 </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My wife and I have had the same mattress since we have been married. It is lumpy, dips horribly in the middle, and isnt large enough now that our daughter sleeps on it with us. I know, thats dangerous and not recommended at all. But when you go six straight months without more than an hour of sleep at a time you eventually cave in. With that being said I am always on the look-out for a good deal on a king size mattress and yesterday I found one. $125 for a *new set*, and not a cheap one either. Incredible, right? I thought so too so I called the guy up and asked if it was still available (you know how sometimes they advertise something really cheap because it doesnt exist). To my surprise it was so I set up for my wife and daughter to go out and take a look at 5PM. I would have rather just gone myself instead of dragging my cranky daughter all the way into Downtown but my wife is pretty particular about the firmness of the mattress so I had to make sure it was comfortable for her. 

Brian, the guy selling the mattress, said to call when we were on our way so he would know when to meet us at the storage site. I called but it went to voicemail so I left one and also texted him to let him know we are on our way. The whole drive there my wife and I are chatting happily about how great it will be to finally have a new mattress and have our own space in the bed once again. My daughter likes to sleep at a bit of a diagonal so that her hands are touching mommies shoulder and her feet are touching my leg. It is very sweet and cute but also incredibly uncomfortable because I have to sleep on the knifes edge of the bed in order to not crush anyone (dads out there I am sure you can relate). Fortunately the traffic isnt too bad yet so we make it right on time. I HATE being late to appointments. It is just so unprofessional and inconsiderate, you know?

I get out of the car and unstrap my daughter so that she can enjoy the cool breeze and point to all the new things she sees while we wait for Brian to arrive. After about fifteen minutes I walk into the office of the storage facility and ask to see if Brian maybe works there or if the receptionist knows anything about him. She told me that he works for a home staging company for when people try to sell their homes. That is why we can buy the mattress so cheap! It is unpackaged and set up so they cant resell it in a store. She assured me he was a great guy and was probably just running late due to traffic. I was glad I talked to her because I was still having a few doubts about why the mattress was such a good deal but his line of work made a lot of sense. My daughter and I walked around some more, singing songs and feeling the brick wall of the building and the nylon threads of the American flag swaying in the breeze. She is a very happy, sweet girl and loves to feel new things so I didnt notice how much time had passed until my wife popped out of the car and asked what was going on. Forty minutes had passed! This guy was ridiculously late. I handed off my daughter so that I could call him up and see what the deal was. 

*This is Brian.*

*Yea, hi, this is Steven. We had a 5PM meeting to look at a mattress. Where are you at, bud?*

*Oh yea ok I am thirty minutes away, Ill be there soon.*

Now as you know I hate being late. I also hate when others are late. *Seriously? It is 5:35PM and we agreed to 5PM, Brian. Dont bother, we are leaving.*

*I told you to call me when you were leaving so that I knew you were coming, this is the first time you are calling me so now I am coming.*

WHAT?!

*Look, Brian. I called you when we left our house and I left you a voicemail. I texted you to let you know we were on the highway. We agreed to 5PM and you stood us up. I dragged my daughter and wife out here for no reason and now we have to fight traffic to get back home. Thank you for wasting our time.*

I hung up before he could get another word in. I was furious. Who sets a time to meet but then doesnt show up until the person calls? Clearly this guy wasnt a real businessman. He called me right back but I ignored it. We needed dinner and showers, we had routines to follow or this baby was going to be up all night. He texted me right after trying to justify his reasoning, telling me I was foolish for not wanting to wait around to save so much money on a $1000 mattress. Obviously this guy didnt have kids. I added his number to my spam list so that I wouldnt get any more calls or texts from him and apologized to my wife for wasting our evening. I work two jobs to make enough for the bills and we dont have much time together as a family. I feel like a bit of a failure but my wife always reassures me, thanking me for working so hard. Still, I cant shake the sadness I feel when I come home late and barely get to spend any time with them so I was extra frustrated with Brian for wasting one of my only free evenings.

Of course traffic was awful heading back out of downtown and there were two car accidents because why not add insult to injury? My daughter was starting to get fussy so I was singing all her favorite songs and making silly faces to keep her occupied. It took over an hour to get home but once we hit the driveway everything was forgotten and we all smiled. Home at last! We went through our normal routine of dinner and bath time and instead of turning on the television I just played with my daughter until she was ready for bed. It was a nice change of pace. I cant believe how big she is getting! 

------------------------

The alarm went off far too early for my liking but I got up and did my best to crawl out of the dip in the bed without arousing anyone else. Got dressed, packed a lunch, ate a quick breakfast and I was off to work. The day was pretty uneventful which was nice because I couldnt keep my eyes open easily. Normally I get a few calls from my wife during the day and at least one picture showing our daughter doing something silly or new but I didnt get any of that today. I knew they had a few plans to go to the petting zoo and story time at the library so I didnt think much of it although I did miss my daily picture. Wednesday is always a special day because it food pantry day (at first we were just embarrassed but we try to make the best of it by guessing what dessert they will give us)! The generosity of people in our area is so amazing. They donate all organic foods, even organic meat. I usually make it home before my wife is done at the pantry so I tidy up the house and get ready to go out and grab all of the bags full of food. 

I kicked off my work boots and put my lunch bag away, cleaning up a few dishes in the sink and washing down my daughters high-chair tray. As I headed into the bedroom to change into more comfortable clothes I stopped dead in my tracks. There, in place of our small, lumpy bed was the king sized mattress on a simple bedframe. It even had sheets on it, nice ones. A few tears gathered at eat eye because I realized why my wife never called me today. She was busy surprising me with a new bed! She must have found Brians ad on Craigslist and went up to meet him on her own while I was at work. What a wonderful woman she is! On the bed was a small, white card. I rushed over to it, flopping onto the bed and taking the card in my hand to read.

Dear Steven,

I hope you like the mattress. Dont worry about payment, I already took what I needed.


-Brian

What the hell?! I sprang up off of the bed and went to my phone, calling my wife. No answer. No problem, she is probably wrapping up at the food pantry or driving home. She never answers when she is driving. 

I waited fifteen more minutes before calling again. She is never this late from coming home. 4:15 at the latest and it was already 4:30. I called again, straight to voicemail. I tried not to panic, tried to let my imagination run wild but I couldnt help it. Was she in an accident? Is she stuck in traffic? Please answer! After another twenty minutes and no response from her I drove over to the food pantry and found the managing volunteer just before they closed up for the night. 

*Hey Terry, was my wife here today?*

*Oh, hi Steven, no she never came today. I was a bit surprised myself but I thought maybe you finally found a better job and didnt need to come anymore.*

I drove home much faster than the law or safety would dictate praying that her car would be in the driveway, but it wasn't. I tried calling one more time with no luck. Sprinting around the house I searched for anything strange or missing. That is when I noticed the picture frame on our nightstand. The picture was torn down one side, leaving just me.

Tears started flowing down my face, coating my phone as I dialed 911.

We ran. We stumbled. We ran some more. Blindly, without regard for direction or purpose. My lungs burned, my legs wobbly, and my face covered with sweat from sprinting up several flights of steps and across many yards of empty hallways. That was when I realized I never once heard someone chasing. I reached a hand out to Lauren to steady her and after a second to catch our breath I led her to my most secret hiding place. It was an unmarked room that only three people could open. We hunkered down and regained our composures and our breath. I hadn't run like that since high school! 

Fortunately I keep snacks in my hiding places so that I don't need to bring them around. Much less suspicious that way, you see. Anyway, I reached up to the back of the top shelf and brought down a box of frosted mini wheat and a box of Ritz Bitz crackers. We ate as silently as we could, to nervous to enjoy the sustenance. 

After a while we chanced a few whispers:

*What do we do?*

*Gotta wait. Listen for any pursuit or search party*

*Maybe security will think it was just a vandal. Maybe no one saw our faces*

*Do you know who even called out back there? I didn't recognize the voice*

*No I haven't even worked here a week yet..*

*What was that? Shhhhh*

--------

We practically broke our necks craning our ears toward the door in hopes of knowing what might be just outside. No other sounds were heard. Hours passed by but nothing seemed to be happening out side of our hiding spot. Lauren needed to pee and the bathroom was literally across the hall. She cracked the door, waited. Cracked a little more, waited. All clear. She darted across into the bathroom to relieve the building pressure in her bladder, a pressure I was starting to feel as well. 

My head snapped up and dizziness overtook me for a moment. Shit, did I fall asleep? How long? SHIT, WHERE IS LAUREN? Maybe I just dozed for a moment and she will be coming right back. I waited, counting seconds in my head. Five minutes passed. Ten.

The door screams as I open it. God, you are a loud bastard! I peek my head out and look both ways like a little kid crossing the street. I step out. Cross the hall to the bathroom door. Crack it open. *Lauren?* No answer. I step in and check all the stalls. It's empty. They got her. At this point I just stopped caring and ran out and down the hall toward the basement. If she was alive she'd be there. Maybe I still had time. 

Rounding the last corner of another completely empty hall I skidded to a halt. Hundreds of employees gathered in a circle, filing the entire warehouse and spilling out of the entrance and into the hallway. No one turned around and I stepped back behind the corner. There was a fire escape of the far side of the warehouse I could get to from outside and maybe see what was going on invisibly. Making my way out into the cold and around the hospital made me realize just how exhausted I was. It had been over a day since I had slept. Finally I got to the door and badged it open, pulling it open just enough to get my lean frame in. For once I was thankful for the fire code of two separate doors. The inner door had a window so I could see in without needing to open it. 

They had her. Standing on the door, hands chained together in front of her. I couldn't hear what they were saying but the president took a key out that matched a key being held by the HR director. The keys were attached to a chain hanging down almost to the ground from her hands and pressed into the holes in the door. A pale light emitted from the crease around the door as it slowly dropped down into the floor with Lauren chained to it. I could see her mouth split as wide as it could go and her entire body straining against the chains as she screamed. Still, she descended. The pale light moved and sloshed like water in a jacuzzi. Oh God they are going to drown her!

I watched in horror as her eyes slid past the edge of the floor. Then the top of her head. The light showed water just below her head. Then two facilties workers brought a metal cover over and set it onto the hole in the floor, sealing off the light. 

My mind raced but in all the wrong directions. What could I do. There were police in there. I couldn't call 911. I had to get her out and fast. Making my way back to my hideout, I sat and sobbed. It all flooded out. I couldn't help it. My body heaved and shuddered. Again, I fell asleep. 

When I awoke Lauren was staring down at me, a smile on her beautiful face. *Hi Shane*

-CRACK-

She must have hit me hard because when my mind regained it's abilities I was chained and surrounded by my coworkers. She called me Shane. I'm not Shane! The keys went in. I slowly descended into a frigid liquid. She knew my real name. Why? Why?! The lid was placed over my head. All light was sealed off. 

I'm not sure how long I was in there. And I'm not sure what I was babbling about this whole time to you all about. 

My name ***IS*** Shane.

	<TEXT> 
Today something new happened, something I only now realize I've seen just once before. A body was carted, covered and zipped up in a silver bag, down the basement hallway past my workshop and into the morgue. I say it was new because up until right now as I type this out I  thought it was. But I'll get back to that. 

Moments after the faceless body bag was pushed slowly into a huge steel room I've never been in and hope to never be in I saw my first new face since working here. She was stunning, breathtaking even. I fulfilled every clich in that moment. My heart raced, my mouth hung open, and I'm pretty sure I had a semi. Her eyes mirrored every color that she passed. Her posture perfect yet not aggressive. Petite. And lips like Angelina Jolie. Describing her fills me with shame knowing I paid so much attention yet can barely stammer out a few ugly words. 

She stopped, held out her hand. *"Hi, I'm Lauren."*

*"Nice to meet --"*   ***"SHANE! This bed isn't fixing itself."***

*"Thanks boss. Thanks. I'll be right there. So yeah, nice to meet you."*

I must have looked like a kicked puppy because he apologized once I stepped into the workshop and closed the door. 

Lauren worked in food services, taking patients orders and delivering the food. I saw her often because I went from room to room fixing things and she went room to room filing bellies and lightening dark rooms with her eyes and smile. We talked a bit and something magical happened. She used my real name. I wasn't Shane to her. Do you know what it feels like to hear your name for the first time? It's impossible to describe but I took every chance to talk to her, just to hear her say it. We actually have a lot in common. Dancing, sports, same strange obsession with eating hot peppers. And by the end of the day exchanged numbers, planning on going out to dance tonight. If that goes well I hope to ask her over on Sunday to watch the game. 

During one of our three hundred conversations (I know, I know, pathetic) I drummed up the courage to ask her about the person she replaced. She didn't know much, except that her name was Lauren also. 

God, it felt so good to hear my name. I could listen to her say it for hours. Anyway, back to the body bag. This morning I thought it was the first time I'd seen one and just attributed it to a great hospital staff and modern medicine. But now I remember seeing a body rolled past me once before but I didn't realize what was happening at the time. It was my first day at work. Now that I think about it, it was the same two people pushing the body down the hallway. Weird.

Oh yeah, Lauren is calling! Gotta go get ready. 

She said my name again when I answered. I think I'm in love. 


We danced to a few songs, drinks in hand, never spilling a drop, smiling and grinding a bit. A weird song neither of us knew came on next so we took the opportunity to get some water and talk some more. 

"How come everyone at work calls you Shane?"

Her question caught me off guard, not because it was a difficult question to answer (or maybe it was) but because I never thought anyone would ask it. And everything came flooding out of my mouth. I told her about the employee I replaced and his name somehow passing on to me, about how much I hated it, about the door I found and the two dead bodies I'd seen. About them coming on first days and how she was the first new employee I'd seen in five months. My mind finally caught up with my mouth and I firmly placed my hand over it. 

*"I'm sorry, I talk fast when I'm nervous"*, I mumbled. 

*"You know what I think? I think we need to get into the morgue and look at that body."*

*"What, when?"* I asked. 

*"Tonight."*

That last word caused my drink to reverse course, spewing from the sides of my mouth. 

She laughed a melodious laugh, tossed a few napkins at me and got up, shaking her cute butt to the beat of the newest song. Sheepishly, I cleaned the corners of my mouth and bounced up behind her in an attempt to get close once again... and close we got. A few songs later and she suggested we head back to my place to plan our break-in. 

I'm writing this from my bed, her hair tickling my arm. It was some plan. 

-------------

**UPDATE:**

I am exhausted and scared. After a short nap Lauren and I got dressed for work, only we were going in seven hours early. Her plan was simple and flawless, or so I thought after a few drinks and an orgasm. A word to the wise, never trust your brain after sex. Anyway, the hospital is usually a ghost town after about 5PM in the basement because that is where all of the maintenance, facilities, cleaning type of workers have their offices and of course that is where the morgue. 

We came in through a door that doesn't need badge access but isn't a main entrance either so as not to be spotted and crept down to the basement. I had been here before at this time answering an on-call from the ICU department and it didn't seem creepy or frightening then but it certainly did now. The quiet was tangible, pressing against me with each step. Coincidentally the door that I found and the morgue are in the same large warehouse so I took Lauren over to it and showed her. 

Squatting down to get a good look with her I noticed the door was slightly damp and one of the plugs was missing from the two central holes that a handle probably fits into. While she ran her fingers over the door's seam I searched the immediate area for the plug, praying it wasn't me who lost it when I first discovered the door. I almost let out a whoop when I found it and pushed it back into it's home but when I did some liquid forced its way up and out of the hole. There was no noticeable scent to it, or strange feel or texture. It seemed to just be water. I guess the strangest thing about it was that ONLY the door was damp, not even a tiny portion of the surrounding floor. 

Instead of wasting too much time with a door I couldn't open we made our way over to the huge steel door that lead into the morgue. As I have said before, I have a lot of master keys and a few master codes to keypad doors. Fortunately one of them was the right one and after a few tries I was able to get the door open. We stepped inside of a small, chilly chamber just big enough for four people. In the center was a sleek steel table about eight feet long. On the left and right of the entrance were matching steel work tables, covered in gleaming surgical tools. 

Drills. Saws. Hundreds of scalpels of all shapes and sizes. Steel bowls and bins. Forceps. An industrial sink with huge over-head handles like in a restaurant. 

On the far wall was what we came in here for. Four steel doors with bodies behind them. 

I took a deep breath, shivered a bit from the cold air entering my lungs, and stepped across the room. One hand on the handle and one hand gripping Lauren, I pulled. Empty.

We locked eyes for a second, relief on both of our faces. I am not sure what we thought we would find in the first one but apparently both of our imaginations were running wild. I gripped the next one and pulled. Empty. The third, empty. The fourth, not empty. 

SHIT.

Another deep breath and I grabbed the sliding tray with both hands. It slide out easily on well maintained rollers and so did the Taco Bell we had on the way to the hospital. Staring up at us was Lauren. The old Lauren. The one that was replaced.

I couldn't breath, I couldn't think. I slammed the tray back in, shutting the door. Shit, vomit everywhere. Never eat Taco Bell. Never never. I leaped two steps over to one of the sinks and grabbed the over-head handle. The water stream was powerful and freezing cold. It blasted the vomit toward the drain underneath the center table easily and after a few seconds the floor looked brand new. 

*"Hello?"*

We ran.

Sorry about the delay. I was out of state at my brothers wedding. So. Much. Fun! I never realized I enjoyed dancing so much. I don't think I have ever been to a club or really ever danced at a wedding or party, either. Definitely going out this weekend to keep the party alive. During the reception I was talking to a few buddies and they were excited about the Super Bowl and how big their party was going to be, yada yada. That was when I realized that I had never thrown one myself. Or even been to one. Weird. I was in a pretty good mood heading back in to work until I clocked in and had my first "hello" from a co-worker. God, I hate that name so much. Shane. Shane. At least the time-clock knows what my name really is.

As I cruised around the hospital from repair request to the next my mind wandered back to that door I had found and I started to plan how I could get a fair amount of alone time with it to investigate. A few of our machines make a permanent home down in the basement but as long as we own them they need to be maintained so I decided I'd volunteer to take the lot of them on and get them calibrated for the year. All I needed was some tools and our calibration system to take down to them and I can work on them all day. My boss agreed quickly, probably because he doesn't want to do it, and so the next day I gathered up what I needed and headed down.

Once in the basement I laid out all of my calibration equipment and tools in a neat row and positioned all of the equipment that needed to be worked on around me in a circle, one so that I could access each one rather easily and two so that I could be mostly blocked from all views while I messed with the door that I placed strategically inside with me. I was about halfway through the first machine when I took a break to check out the real reason I was down there. Grabbing my mini Maglite and soft bristled brush I went to work trying to find a real seam or gap that I could wiggle a screwdriver into. As I worked it became increasingly more obvious that this was not supposed to be found. I'll do my best to describe my findings now.

The door is 16 inches by 16 inches perfectly square and 1/4th of an inch lower than the floor around it. It is perfectly level and has two small holes drilled into the middle nine inches apart. I couldn't see the holes before because they were filled in with some type of soft putty insert that matches the color of the floor, like a temporary plug. The holes are only an inch or so deep from what I can tell with the Maglite. The outer seam is also filled with that putty but more like caulking in this case and the seam is only 1/8th of an inch thick. This door is designed well! So well that it pushes my curiosity further and further into skepticism and fear. I have read enough r/nosleep and SCP articles to know when I am in too deep but somehow I am driven forward. Call it blind stupidity.

I could probably have finished up all of the equipment down there in one day but I knew that I needed to find the handle that lifted up that door so I took my time instead and split it up into two days. When I came in the next day an idea came to me. Maybe I could make my own handle. We have a huge parts room that rivals any hardware store. Surely I could cobble together something that fit the threads and be able to lift it up so I went and grabbed a few different sized bolts and washers to see what I could fabricate.

All of the first batch were too big but on the next visit I hit pay dirt with an eye-hook screw. Using an old power cable I threaded through both of the eye-hooks I had my handle. Giving it a tug was futile, however. Even getting into a deep squat and using my entire body I couldn't even feel the door give one bit. The cord snapped, I lost my balance and tumbled back into the equipment I had circled around, making a massive crash. Several people ran to the noise and fortunately I had enough time to get my eye-hooks out before anyone noticed.

*"Are you OK, Shane?! What happened?"*

Holding back a low growl I responded with a lame "I tripped" excuse and went back to work on one of the pieces of equipment.

*"Oh Shane, always being so clumsy! Do you remember the time Shane.."* Everyone walked out shaking their head and laughing and sharing stories of my clumsiness. The only problem is that I had never done any of the things that they talked about. Not a single one.

----------

UPDATE:

The episode today at work really freaked me out. I tried to distract myself by driving around, going into some stores but nothing could take my mind off of it so I went home and made some calls. First I called the hospital that Shane took a new job at to see if I could speak to him. The guy I spoke to said there weren't any Shane's working in Biomed. I asked a few questions, maybe he is in maintenance or something but still no Shane. With shaking hands I called a few more hospitals in search of Shane, then more, then all in the entire metro. No one had a Shane.

For some reason I called the first hospital back and asked to speak to the hiring manager this time. What he told me made my blood go cold. Yes, they hired Shane, but he never showed up to work.

I hopped onto Facebook next in hopes of finding a recent post by Shane and alleviate my fears. Shane hasn't made a post or picture or status for YEARS! Looking back thru his history he stopped posting a few months after joining my hospital. What is even more disturbing is that his only friends are coworkers. He used to have friends but must have removed them all. His last post had comments from other people, family it looks like based on last name, and a few school buddies. All of them appeared worried about something.

It didn't take long to dig thru his old posts because of the rarity of them so I started looking at my coworkers pages. After a few people I noticed a trend and after several hours of checking I have condoned that every single person that I work with is ONLY friends with coworkers. Not a single extra friend out of every person I could find. God, just typing that out makes me sick and cold inside.

Anyway, while I was out I decided to finally get a new TV so I picked up a 60 inch 4K Samsung for my football party this Sunday. I'm going to have everyone over for each game our team is still in the playoffs. I'd keep blabbing on but I'm off to go dancing. I'll update my progress with the door tomorrow.

	<TEXT> 
My name is not Shane.

I just wanted to clarify that right now. Four months ago I began my career as a Biomedical Technician at a local hospital. It wasn't the best paying job and it was not as close as my last job to home but it was a start. Getting a foot in the door is the hardest part from what I understand. Anyway, my co-worker was really nice and the rest of the staff at the hospital seemed kind enough. Always waving and smiling. And never learning my name.

I attributed it to being new at first but even people I saw every day never remembered it. They could remember the once-a-week contractor just fine, but me? Nope.

Normally this wouldn't bother me because I have a hard time remembering peoples names as well and I have been known to say the wrong name from time to time. It started to bother me, however, when I had every single name memorized and NO ONE had mine. Petty? Maybe. But try it for a few months and tell me it doesn't get ridiculously annoying and belittling. What was even more strange is that everyone called me the same wrong name....

Shane.

After a month I was "let loose" from the training label and started to move a little more freely around the hospital instead of having to follow my co-worker around like a lost puppy. A part of our job is to do repairs on all of the equipment so I have the master code to all keypad locks and a few keys that will open basically any door in the hospital. In my down-time I'd wander around and explore, opening up random closets in search for lost equipment and to better understand the layout of the hospital (and to find a great hideout when I wanted to just sit and watch YouTube videos).

A few months of poking around and I had peeked into just about every room I could find but one day as I was looking thru some old equipment in the basement storage for a missing ECG machine I found a door. There was no key, no keypad, no lock, virtually no seams either. And it was on the floor. Once I cleared the clutter away I squatted down to inspect it.

Was it a drain? No, that didn't make any sense. Was it access to a sub-basement? Shouldn't even be one, all of our plumbing is here and our boilers are outside.

Just as I started to run my fingers along the very faint crease my body cringes from the sound I hate most.

"Shane? Shaaaaaaneee."

"Ya over here, and it's NOT Shane. Did you find the ECG?"

"Sure did, let's test it to make sure it still works."

Days went by but I couldn't get that strange "door" out of my head so I let myself into our records room that has all of the blueprints and schematics for the hospital hoping to find an answer. None. Not one damn mention of anything being underneath the basement storage. No electrical. No plumbing. Nothing. Undeterred, I make it a point to keep digging when I have time. I even made a daily alarm on my phone.

The next day during lunch my co-worker and I were talking about football and how we couldn't wait for the season to start. Our team was going to be very good this year, you know. Apparently the guy that I replaced was a huge football fan. Tailgated every Sunday, had huge parties for the Superbowl, that kind of thing. I had never heard anyone talk about him before so I asked what happened. It seemed like a sour subject because my co-worker just mumbled a bit about him not giving any notice and taking another job downtown at the school hospital. [Oddly enough I had applied for the same job but after making it to the final three candidates I was knocked out. Lack of experience, they said.]

"Sorry he skipped out on you like that. What was his name?"

"Shane."

	<TITLE> Room 13 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-20 20:44:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some hospitals are superstitious and some are not. Some have a room 13 or a room 666 or a floor 13 if they are large enough and others skip right past those numbers as if they hold the very power of hell in their plastic placards. Mine falls into the superstitious category, maybe to an unhealthy degree. Our rooms are numbered based on the floor so first floor are all 100 rooms while second floor are 200 rooms and so on which is pretty standard. None of the floors have a room 13. 

I work in the Emergency Department as a security guard. Why is a security guard necessary? Because we admit mentally unhealthy and unstable patients on a daily basis I am there to ensure they do not hurt themselves or the staff treating them. On occasion I have to deal with an irate patient due to wait times or someone screaming about a bill but those dont happen too often. 

As a large and imposing man I am not easily frightened and I am not particularly superstitious. Everything has a reason, everything can be explained. Maybe that nave way of thinking stemmed from the little education I received, small town upbringing, or my parents being such practical, no-fuss people living in a black and white world. No matter the reason behind it, it was sorely incorrect. 

With that being said I should probably get to the reason I am even writing this out in the first place. Something happened last night during my shift that I simply cant explain and has shaken me to the core. The shift started out in standard fashion and I settled in quickly with a huge coffee and the funnies to browse through. We only had one of three mental health rooms occupied, suicide watch, so not bad at all. I dont think in the seven years I had worked here that we ever received anyone overnight. Peak hours were first thing in the morning and right after work lets out. That is when the guys in business suits and nice cars think their life is awful and try slamming into something at highway speeds or jump off of a bridge into rush hour traffic. 

I was half a page in and already chuckling when I heard a soft voice whispering. Glancing up I see the young teen pressed against the small safety-glass window murmuring wide-eyed. I couldnt make out what she was saying but her eyes got my attention right away and I nudged the nurse dozing off next to me. Her eyes were completely red. I dont mean bloodshot from being tired or a burst vessel. I am talking no pupil, no whites - nothing but a dark unwavering red staring back at me. 

The nurse jumped up and I followed, opening the room and making sure she didnt find something to hurt herself with. The rooms are bare except for the bed they sleep on and those are specially designed but things have happened in the past. The patient turned to us as we walked in and continued to whisper the same phrase over and over again: *He is in room 13.* The nurse tried talking to her without much effect but she did get her back to her bed to take vitals and allowed us to check her eyes. I stood two steps back as a precaution but she just sat there on the edge of the bed staring at me with her unblinking red eyes whispering.

When the nurse was satisfied with her readings and found no obvious reason for the eye condition we stepped outside of the room and discussed what we saw with the charge nurse and a doctor. I went back in with the doctor as he looked her over and did his best to ask some questions but got nothing out of her except *He is in room 13.* I am not sure but from what I heard in the discussion she shouldnt be having such a sudden change and no one really had an answer to why or how her eyes took on the red color. I did my best not to interject but no one seemed to be asking the question that was on my mind.

Umm, pardon me, but why is she saying someone is in room 13?

The doctor and nurse stared at me for a moment before both shrugged it off. She is not in her right state of mind. Probably just something she saw in a movie. As far as I know she doesnt realize we have no room 13.

With that they went down the hall discussing treatment options and further testing. I sat for a moment just staring at the room. I knew I couldnt leave  she must be supervised. I knew we didnt have a room 13. Yet something pulled at me, twisting and digging its way inside past the barriers of reasoning and stubbornness. My eyes flicked from left to right and back, searching for anyone who could be around to take my place or witness me leave my post. No one in sight, an eerie calm hanging over a normally loud and busy department, I stood and took a step to my right when a bloody hand smacked hard into the window of her room. 

I charged the room and threw the door open praying she was still alive but I found her sitting cross-legged on the floor with her head down as blood seeped into the gown between her thighs. She looked up at me, her face twisted in agony and defeat. Marks began forming on her arms and legs as if an imaginary belt lashed out repeatedly striking her exposed skin. I screamed into my mini-cell for the nurse and doctor ASAP and tried to get anything out of her as to what she did. I couldnt find anything resembling a weapon on her person or in the room. A few moments passed but two nurses rushed in with the doctor and quickly assessed her for injuries.

I took the moment to slip out and power-walked down the hall to room 14 but to my shock a man sat quietly in room 13, a room we never before had. As I stared dumbly at him he noticed I had approached and asked when someone would be taking a look at him. He had a broken nose and deep scratches up and down his arms. I informed him a nurse would be by soon and went to track one down. When I stated there was a man in room 13 that needed attention he didnt bat an eye but jaunted on down and popped into the room. I couldnt wrap my mind around what was going on so I went back to my post and check on the girl. 

She was gone. No blood, not even the handprint on the window. I checked the log to see if someone had checked her out for transport to another facility I noticed that she had already been checked out several hours before my shift had even started. Not just checked out but deceased. Questions were exploding out of my mouth faster than my tongue could keep up but just as the nurse was about to look up the man from room 13 sprinted past, IV pole bouncing along behind him and two nurses chasing. My instincts and training kicked in and I took off after him and apprehended him against the wall before he could hit the exit button that opened the double doors. 

The staff had found blood under his nails while treating his wounds and ran some tests. It matched the girl. Once in custody they found other traces of her on him from what I am told. I think they are searching his home now for clues, hoping to crack other unsolved cases from the past. The rest of my shift blurred by  I even had to be reminded to leave when the dayshift guard came in to relieve me. I walked down the hallway to the locker room to get changed and stopped when I came to room 12. Then 14. When I turned back to look again at the placard on the wall in front of room 12 I saw who I think was the girl, a faint glimmer or silhouette, accompanied by an even fainter *Thank you*.

I think that what little I knew of this world just got a lot smaller.

	<TEXT> I won't pretend to fully understand the motives behind this article but I can relate in my own way. Forgiveness is not something that needs to be asked but rather something that midday be given of your own accord. I wish everyone would sincerely ask for forgiveness because if they did it would mean they are actively seeking to change their behavior. 

Another wish of mine is that everyone didn't treat life like there is always a tomorrow to make it right. You never know when your time comes to an end so please don't wait. This goes for all things, whether it be a hobby you want to try, an emotion you must express, whatever. Stop waiting. 

I'm probably way off base but those are the things the article made me think of. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To answer you question measures already have been taken. The length of stories in a series were increased to 1000 words including the original post. 

If you believe other measures should be taken that are enforceable by the mods message them. 

The issue you are having with supposed quality is across the board, not just series posts. But that is the beauty of NoSleep. Hacks like me and amateur writers are able to express themselves in a public forum. 

I suggest you sit back, relax, and enjoy the good ones as they come along. If you see plot holes in an otherwise great story pm the author and let them know. That way next time they can be cognizant of such things and give a better product. 

Have a great night.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The City of Etzanoa </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-19 20:42:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some of you, especially if you live in the Midwest, know about Etzanoa. For those that dont Ill give a brief account of the city and its people. Several hundred years ago the Native Americans rules this continent. For the most part they were tribal and nomadic with free reign to move about as the seasons dictated. However, there were exceptions to this with large, permanent settlements such as Cahokia and Etzanoa supporting upwards of 20,000 people.

As history and legend have it Juan de Onate and seventy soldiers discovered a sprawling settlement of Wichita Indians poised between two rivers. When the Indians saw the Spaniards they fled and left their city. Once inside Onate explored the city and the size of the city alone unnerved them so much that they turned and retreated only to find a rival tribe coming in behind them. Onate stated that the rival tribe was surprised at their presence, indicating that they were actually there to attack Etzanoa. The Spaniards hunkered down and fired cannonballs out into the surrounding area hoping to scare off the warriors, which they eventually did. 

Why is this relevant, you might be asking yourself? For the past two years I have been working on site in Arkansas City, Kansas with a small team of student archeologists and Donald Blankeslee at the head. During that time we have uncovered undeniable evidence of the once-thought impossible city. What you will find in the news is that Blankeslee has confirmed the tale of Onate and his battle near a massive city. Cannonballs have been recovered, tons of flint objects, pottery, tools, and remains of building structures including a fully operational water shrine. 

Some of that is true, but mostly misinformation. Yes, the city existed, yes the Spanish were there, and yes we found a shrine. That is where the similarities stop. What we actually found was five times the size! Twenty five miles of Indian metropolis stretching as far as you can see in all directions. They completely dominated the area between the rivers and the surrounding hills in a manner never seen before. What I found to be the most surprising is that we found no walls, no battlements, no defense systems whatsoever. It was as if they had nothing to fear at all.

In the exact center of the city is a beautiful and ornate shrine designed with incredible skill and intricacy. At what would have been the highest point in the city stood six columns, four at each corner most likely supporting an open roof to allow the sun and moonlight to pierce through, and two smaller columns spaced four feet apart adorned with massive chains. The floor resembled a pyramid, sloping gently away from the center and opening to four aqueducts at the edge of the platform on which the columns stood. These aqueducts branched over and over as they moved down and spread to a trough that circled the shrine at its base. If you are having trouble visualizing it I could sketch something quickly but Im not an artist so it probably wont help.

The aqueducts were fashioned out of gold and each side of the shrine had its own design. It was clear this was not just a water shrine but one of sacrifice and service to a god or multiple gods. The sun god, moon god, harvest god? After weeks of studying the sides of the shrine I realized each one was a symbol and therefore must have meaning. We poured over every text and book we could get our hands on and finally found what each of the symbols means. Blood. Protection. Monster. Annual. It reminded me of the movie King Kong where they sacrifice someone to the giant gorilla in exchange for peace or for general worship.

Along the base of the shrine we also found several mounds which ended up being hundreds of skulls. In total we counted over one thousand individual skulls. What was interesting and horrifying was the condition of the skulls  they were all completely intact without blemish or any sign of damage and they were all from children. I truly believe these skulls are the remains of each sacrifice, which means if it truly was only a once per year ritual that these people lived here over one thousand years giving up their children to appease the gods. 

That really got me to thinking. Why would the Wichita turn and flee from a few Spanish if they were so numerous? They clearly ruled the land and feared nothing so even a few cannons should not have stopped them from decimating Onate and his men. And why would a rival tribe sent only a few hundred men to attack Etzanoa in the first place? Something was not adding up and I wanted to figure it out. As more and more of the ruins were uncovered we started to see a pattern in the homes and other buildings  it resembled Pompeii! Whole families huddled together arms locked across shoulders to protect the young which crouched inside. Each and every skeleton was missing the head.

It was a bone-chilling sight as we went from room to room finding only headless corpses all in the same position. I couldnt help but feel like I was being watched, but more than that, being judged, as I passed from hut to hut. I didnt stay down there long. A fear kept bubbling inside of me that I couldnt shake and after about fifteen huts I quickly made my way back to the surface and fresh air. Before the fear drove me out of that valley of death I did notice one other thing in each home  the symbol for Monster. 

Small, precise, and painstakingly burned into each of the main entryways was the symbol. Protection? Maybe. Reverence? Possibly. But maybe something even worse than that. A mark, made by the monster itself as it passed through each home. You see, I think that their protection ran out. Maybe they had no more children to sacrifice but that seems unlikely due to the size of the place. 

Want to know what I think? I think the Spanish interrupted the ceremony and angered the Monster/god to such an extent that it ravaged the land and all those in its path. I think Onate fled at the first sign of trouble and ran into a tribe on their way to the ritual and while they battled it out in order to flee the entire city of Etzanoa suffered the wrath of their once-protector  the Wendigo. 

That is why youll never hear about any of these details being found. I dont know if Blankeslee is being silenced or if he is working for someone in order to keep it silent. I want to know what else they uncover but I dont want to go back there, I dont feel safe. Almost as if it is still nearby, watching and waiting for the next ritual.

	<TITLE> Anisometropia </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-18 20:26:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Three quarters of American adults use some type of corrective eyewear. Can you believe that? I can because I have worn glasses my entire life. Granted it was eye-patches as a baby but glasses from as long as I can remember. Optometrists tell you all kinds of statistics during the exams and I have been to hundreds so my head is full of useless knowledge about eyes. How they work, common issues, you name it. 

I have the unfortunate fate of falling into a particularly rare issue, or rather, block of issues that culminated into two incredibly useless eyes. I was born with extreme anisometropia and aniseikonia which resulted in astigmatism and amblyopia. What that means is that one eye is incredibly near-sighted while the other is incredibly far-sighted. Usually eyes will work together but mine fight each other causing my brain to pick one image over the other. After almost two decades my brain has finally figured out how to use one eye or the other without fighting as much so depending on what I am looking at the depth of that object determines which eye snaps into focus. This means that one eye is constantly rolling around doing nothing until its turn to focus.

Sometimes surgery will correct it but the five that I have had so far havent done too much. They kept me from going blind, sure, but not much else. Doctors have tried everything but they are at the edge of technology and unless another breakthrough occurs me and my eyes are out of luck. I tell you all of this because I think I see things others do not. I can hear the jokes now so save them. *The practically blind guy sees things we cant? Pshhh* Trust me when I say you dont want to see the things I see. 

I am not certain whether or not I have always seen them and not noticed or if this is something new, a side-effect of the latest surgery maybe. All my life I have had incredible peripheral vision  the one benefit of having endlessly wandering eyes. Even though they are not entirely focused on it I do pick up on things off to the sides that others would not normally see and then can turn to focus my eyes on them. They has saved me many a time from the vicious bullies throughout my school years trying to sneak up behind me. You can probably imagine the endless torment I have received with literal googley-eyes-syndrome as my wonderful contemporaries like to call me. But now the one positive factor I have had about all of this is betraying me. 

During one of the latest run-ins with a group of jerks I thought I saw a slap coming from the left side so I threw a hand up and flinched away to the right, directly into the slap that actually came from that side. My head rang and my cheek was instantly streaked with tears (I have over-active tear ducts as well) and my ears were filled with harsh, barking laughter from all around me. I guess the psychic is losing his touch! HAHAHAHAHA! Crying from one little slap? Baby bitch! Normally I would stand up for myself, even fight back at times, but not today. My mind was trying to grasp what I had thought I had seen to the left. It was a fast moving blur. What was it? I looked around past the ring of future societal rejects in a vain attempt to track down what could have caused it. 

Pushing past them I stayed vigilant on my way to class hoping to see it again. I am not sure why I was so obsessed with the blur but something about it nagged at me, agitated me. I tried to pay attention all through anatomy class (it was actually my favorite subject) but I kept getting distracted by flitting images at the edge of my periphery. Normally I wouldnt be bothered by this, I am used to it after all, but today it was different. They were different. 

How can I describe it? Have you even been poked in the eye and your vision is blurry? You can make out shapes and colors and maybe because you are familiar with your surroundings you even know what it is you are looking at despite the blur and tears obscuring your view. That is what these were like except everything around them was clear. Like oil in water, they only disturbed the space they took up and nothing more. And, just like oil in water, they didnt belong. I was sure of that more than I was sure of anything else. 

------------------

That was three weeks ago. 

I havent gone out much because it has become much worse. I see them more and more, yet I dont see them. No matter how fast I turn, no matter how much I anticipate their movements I cant catch them. But I think they are getting closer  a horrible ink blot moving sinuously through the air. They seem to take up more of my periphery whereas before it was just a flicker in the far corner. How they are closer yet impossible to see I still dont know. 

Something else, something new, I can see them at night. Even in the deepest recesses of shadow they undulate and defy my vision. They are a different kind of darkness, darker than the absence of light? How?

I sit here in bed with my phone as dim as possible in order to perform tests. As I type this out they draw nearer. When I raise the brightness to the maximum they draw nearer. The only thing I can do is turn to look. Then, and only then, do they vanish. But what if the next time I turn they dont?

I gave my eyes a rest and I can see them still, clearer, closer, taking up more of my field of view. What do they want? I used to get respite when I turned my head. Now I push them closer to the center. 

Eyes closed. Dont look, dont stare. 

LOOK! Open your eyes! 

They are in my eyes. Insideeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.

-------------

I can see your future - You dont have much time. If you start to see them dont look, dont acknowledge them. It might give you more time.

	<TEXT> As for the first question just put a series tag on it and link the first hell post as "related". The context will be enough to know it is the same universe. 

And to answer the second - I liked it. It is good. However I think it is too watered down. Spice it up so that it doesn't blend in with the other dental stories. If I'm being honest I was never scared and I guessed the general issue right away. 

Maybe cut away to the doctors perspective out in the amazon when she first discovered such an issue. The entire tribe was suffering and the scene was gruesome. Describe in detail how the bodies were littered with millions of centipedes and you only found a few still alive to know what had happened. 

Maybe it is only a certain kind of fruit that we need to be wary of or a brand of toothpaste has a weird chemical in it that brings them out of dormancy.  </TEXT>
