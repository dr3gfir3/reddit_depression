	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Currently I have a FireTV that runs Kodi with libraries pulled from the emby server. In Kodi I run a program called PseudoTVLive where I've setup channels according to activity. Say I just want background noise while I'm doing something else, I've got a channel that has about a dozen shows that don't require attention (ie the simpsons, archer, futurama, etc.) and PTL will randomly play an episode from the list of TV shows selected and will continue to do so consecutively. 

Is there a way to emulate this natively on emby alone? It'd be nice to be able to do something like this when I'm just connecting remotely to my server. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Completely new to this but I figured it'd be a fun learning process. 

So I've got a decent little workstation at work and I thought it'd be nice to take some baby-steps into BTC, let the machine mine or something while I'm not here. It's Win8, i5-3.5ghz, 32GB, GTX970. Should I try out hardware mining? Is it better to join a pool? I don't have enough space for HDD mining unless invest in some new disk space. 

I've got a wallet setup, searching around the web, seems like tutorials are pushing their own software that would help them out more than it'd help me, so where should I start? </TEXT>

I can get tasker to recognize the sender using %evtprm2 and I've figured out that %evtprm6 is the message (or I assume it is since %evtprm() will show 6 as msg) but if I use %evtprm6 it only shows as "msg" not the actual message. I've tried %evtprm1-9 and nothing has worked.

Searching for this only brings up old threads, thought someone here could help me out - thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some linen closets have this smell, it's an amazing, indescribable smell (kind of like how you know what fresh-crisp cash smells like but there's no way to describe it) - not of detergent or anything, it's just this ridiculously satisfying scent. Impossible to explain but very rarely do linen closets have it. The original house I grew up in had it and I've only run into one other closet that had it. I wish I knew what it was or how to achieve it. </TEXT>

I haven't really been up to date with flashlights in a while, was wondering if there's something better out there or should I just go ahead and order a replacement.

Thanks ahead for any suggestions! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My pan has been like this for a while and I've just gotten around to posting it. I've been using it as is for the last six months. /u/adventux may be onto something about me having it too hot. I remember accidentally having the CI on high-heat one time and this may have caused it, it usually doesn't go beyond med-high.

Is this safe to use though? Will the cracks go away though usage (hoping the seasoning would fill it in over time)? Or am I SOL and should start the CI all over? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> looking for a (video) podcast app for android that supports custom importing and different playback speeds. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-07 21:08:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So on my LG G4 I've got PocketCasts for all of my audio content, I absolutely love the app but a large part of my podcast consumption are videos played on my iPad, in which I use iCatcher. 

PocketCasts doesn't really play well with importing your own files whether it be on iOS or android. My iPad is starting to get a little dated and I was thinking of moving away from iOS and getting an android tablet but I can't seem to find a good podcast app that will not only download video podcasts but will also let me import my own media and assign them to different custom podcasts. This is important because different podcasts play at different speeds. 

I import videos daily to my iPad and assign them to different playing speeds, iCatcher does this pretty fantastically but back-to-back playback has been really buggy for me since the last few iOS updates.

Anyone have any app suggestions that has this functionality? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 507xxx bootlooped one week ago today, it was about 5mo beyond mfg warranty, called LG anyways. a bit of info and they let me send my phone one in, they covered shipping both ways and the repair.

same outside, my slightly cracked glass screen protector was still on the front except there was a piece of tape over the front; back had the same SN and IMEI. i tracked my shipping to their facilities and they sent my "repaired" phone the same day they got it. overall it took seven days, everything seems to be good.

i wonder if they just swap out the boards as soon as they receive them. </TEXT>
