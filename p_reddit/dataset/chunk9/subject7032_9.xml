	<TEXT> *"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

That's what I heard from beside me at 2 AM. 

"What did you say?" I asked my husband. He didn't answer. Good, then it wasn't important. I had to use the bathroom anyway, but nestled under a down-comforter with our tabby cat Meeps snuggled between us made me seriously consider my options. Wet the bed? Too sticky. Excavate myself from the pile of blankets and face the cold hard bathroom tiles? Please no. Hold it in and develop a weak bladder? 

Eh, we were all going to get old and fall apart someday anyway. I had no intention of getting out of that bed for anything short of a nuclear strike. Just when I started flirting with the other side of consciousness though, I heard it again: 

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

"Wake up Jordan. You're having a bad dream." I sat up and shook my husband's shoulder. He grunted and half-halfheartedly pushed my hand away. That should do the trick. But as long as I was up... 

I uprooted Meeps and climbed out of bed. He gave me that "how dare you, peasant" expression that all cats have mastered without parallel. I was half-way to the bathroom and wondering if I could teach myself to piss while sleepwalking when - 

*"Run away, or -"* 

I stopped and rubbed my eyes. That wasn't my husbands voice. It wasn't coming from my bed at all. That was unmistakably from inside my closet. Don't get me wrong, I'm a strong independent woman. I kill my own spiders and everything, but there's no decent minded person anywhere who could hear that without screaming bloody murder. 

It wasn't really a scream - more of a "what the thunder-flicking-fuck was that?" - but it was loud enough to get Jordan on his feet in a second. It was so cute how protective he was of me. My father never approved of him because Jordan had cocaine trouble as a teenager, but to me he had always been the perfect man. 

"What's going on? Are you alright?" Jordan asked. 

"There's someone here," I replied with the same wide-eyed sincerity a four year old might muster. 

"Honey come back to bed. There isn't anyone-"

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."* 

"There!" I said. "It's coming from the closet." 

"I didn't hear anything."

"Check it for me? Please? Pleeeeease?" I gave him my best impersonation of a desperate puppy. He sighed and headed for the door.   

"Don't! I changed my mind!" I said. "There's a murderer inside!" 

"I wouldn't worry," he replied. "It's probably just my laptop randomly unpausing a video or something. Besides, if it was a murderer, he'd just kill us in our sleep." 

"Real reassuring. Thanks." 

Jordan opened the door, but his body was blocking my view. I hopped around on my toes to peer over his shoulder. 

My Doll - my Angel Doll, the one I'd had since I was a baby - was lying on the ground. I rushed to pick her up, reverently cradling her and completely forgetting about the monster for a moment. She wasn't really an Angel, just a Raggedy-Ann Doll with little cloth wings sewn onto her back. But she was mine, in the same way as my hair was brown or my skin was fair; she was part of me. 

"Well there's nothing in here, so I'm going back to bed," Jordan said, slumping off across the floor. 

"What do you think knocked her off the shelf though?" I asked. "And look! Her stomach is all ripped open." 

"I'll call a doctor in the morning. Goodnight." He was already consumed by the indistinguishable blanket blob. 

I sat there on the floor holding my Doll. We were inseparable when I was a kid. This doll had endured everything, including a part time gig as a bulldog's chew-toy and the lead investigator of a vacuum's inside. She had been ripped, stained, shredded, and impaled a dozen odd times, and Dad had always been able to fix her for me before. Of course, now that he was gone I would have to learn to fix it myself, but that was okay. When I have a kid of my own, they'll probably need me to fix it for them too. 

I gently poked the leaking fluff back into the Doll's chest cavity and - 

"Shit snacks". Something stung my finger prompting its quick passage to my mouth. Was something in there? I opened the Doll a little further, careful not to lose any of the stuffing, and pulled out a tightly folded sheet of paper. I recognized the handwriting immediately.

**Dear Amelie**

It was the same handwriting with the same loopy "D" I had seen every year on my birthday card. Every year except this one anyway. I sat cross-legged on the floor and Meeps wiggled her way into my lap while I read my father's secret letter. 

---

**Dear Amelie**

The telling of an adventure becomes an adventure in itself. Fantasies will unburden your spirit from the constraints of reality, and horror is as thrilling for the author as it is for the reader.  

But my story is not so easily told. Every time I try to bleed my memories free, I am frozen with helpless shame and guilt. The events of my youth have haunted me throughout my life, and I fear I will not go quietly into death until I have found peace in their recounting. 

I hope you will forgive me for inscribing my story in verse. It is the only way I know how to distance myself from the pain and turn the tragedy of my life into something beautiful. I hope before the end of your days you too will find a way to burn your darkness with such brilliant fire as to illuminate the way for others. 

Forever yours,  
-Dad

It should be said, right at the start,  
all happy families are the same.  
For joys are shared in equal parts,     
though misery is unique in blame.  
It comes in many varied forms,  
but you will know it when its seen.     
When the perfect mask is torn,   
and sundered at the seams.   

So it was when I was young,  
a son first and child after.  
Playing with father was endless fun;  
and every shared moment laughter.  
I learned how to view the world  
from astride my fathers knee.  
And when the night left me curled,   
his stories would bring sleep.  

But life is heavier for some than others,  
and it pressed hard upon this man.  
A war waged between him and my mother -  
he stopped trying and simply ran.  
I was left to wondering,  
where my father went at night.    
Then home late with blundering,    
too much drink had made him fight.     

One night the drink brought a rage  
that I had never seen before.  
The beatings could not be assuaged,    
so out I fled through kitchen door.  
I wandered the streets very late,  
hiding from that awful noise,  
not knowing it was my fate,  
to find salvation in a toy.  

Tossed upon garbage and refuse,  
the broken Doll of an Angel lay.   
It was worn-deep from over use,    
but I still took her home to play.   
When the violence was lit by booze,   
I held it to keep my fears at bay.   
Then finally when there came a truce,  
I would thank her when I prayed.  

The quiet never lasted, nor the peace,       
and I kept the doll close beside.   
Once I was too bruised to sleep,  
and waited instead to finally die.  
Instead the Doll began to speak,  
telling me that I was safe.  
That even when the world was bleak,   
I must trust the Doll with faith.  

The Doll offered more than reality,  
and proved my great escape.  
It would sing tales of fantasy:  
of villains, heroes and their capes.   
Beasts and monsters with their fangs,     
of highway men and roaming gangs,   
who were locked up tight with a clang,  
prevailing justice when she sang.  

Since then we never parted ways,  
where I went, the Doll followed after.     
She sat beside me when I played,    
or sheltered me in the attic rafters.  
The doll peaked from my bag at school,    
(the other children laughed, I know).  
But I didnt mind the jeering fools  
who didn't know how to take a blow.  

I wish my mother had a Doll    
to take away her pain -   
to free her back against the wall,  
and cease the falling of the cane.  
I offered the Angel Doll to her,  
but she insisted that I keep.   
Saying it was too late to deter,  
the wounds which cut too deep.   

One night her screaming wouldn't end,    
and I offered up a solemn plea:  
That even this hurt would mend,  
I begged the Angel answer me.  
No comfort now like in the past,  
the Doll offered this foresight:   
"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."   

---

I stopped reading. I was so tired, I had completely forgotten about what made me get out of bed in the first place. I stared at the coarse face with its black sewn on buttons and flame of red hair. It was just a Doll - the same Doll it had always been. 

"Jordan?" My voice was timid. I shouldn't wake him up again. It was stupid to think -

"Yeah?" 

"Do you trust me?" 

"Of course, honey. What are you still doing up?" 

"I want to get out of the house. Now." 

The pile of blankets slouched aside and he sat up to stare at me. He looked at the letter in my hands, then nodded. He put on his robe and handed me mine, and we walked out the front door in silence. 

"Where are we going?" 

"Away," I said. "Can you drive?" 

It was like he could sense when something was important to me. He smiled and nodded. We didn't need words. I hopped into the passenger seat and flipped on the reading light to finish the letter while he drove. 

---

"Run away," she said at last.   
"Or you will die tonight."   

I grew angry and yelled louder,    
but no other sound came out her.    
I flung her from my window seat,   
out of the house, into the street.   
Telling her she was no good,  
if the Angel no longer could   
speak and tell me calming tales   
drowning out the fighting wails.  

Mother was in pain, a bestial yelp -  
through the thin walled home.  
I couldn't face my fear and help -  
I couldn't bear the sound alone.   
I ran until I was out of breath,  
far away from here.  
I didnt care if I met my death,   
I willed to disappear. 

Snow and bitter winds cut in  
probing through my jacket thin.  
I leaned against a tree to rest,   
yet dared not chance to sleep in less   
I would waken to find myself  
alone in the world with no one else,  
or waken not, stiff frozen skin  
a tribute to what might have been.   

I wish I hadn't thrown the Doll away   
when I needed her the most.  
It wasn't her fault she had to say  
that death was flying close.  
The morning found my mother dead,  
as the Doll that I once found.  
Forsaken and thrown on garbage bed;    
a trash heap burial mound.  

For many years, a lost Raggedy-Ann,  
my Doll must have searched the Earth.   
Until she found not a boy, but a man,  
and his lady who was giving birth.  
I had run so far from life,  
that I had found a life anew.  
The Doll gazed upon my beautiful wife,   
and the child who now grew.   
 
The Angel Doll lay down softly,  
knowing her part had been played.   
The boy was gone, and though missed awfully,    
times direction could not be swayed.  
I found her there, against hospital door,  
still and quiet as the dead.   
I scooped her up and to her swore   
to fix her tattered threads.  

By my word, she was cured  
of the ills this world had shown.   
My baby girl brought in the world   
was gifted with a Doll newly sewn.  
I will never make the mistakes   
that drove my mother to her grave.  
And the Doll will never lie awake  
to take away your pain.  
   
---

I was in tears by the time I finished. Dad would have been 58 on the first of May. Jordan kept giving me these nervous glances, but he was respectful and didn't pry. 

"How much further, you think?" is all he asked. "There's a motel up ahead. Want to spend the night there?" 

These weren't pretty tears. They were big, snotty, sloppy tears. I was too choked up to answer, but he pulled into the parking lot anyway. He understood me so well, it was like he was made for me. 

---

I held the Doll while I fell asleep in the motel. I knew I owed Jordan big for this. I felt so stupid for dragging us out here, but the letter and my cry had been cathartic and I was so tired that I felt oddly at peace. It was the best I'd felt since the funeral. And who knows, maybe some freak tornado will hit the house and I'll know some part of Dad really is still out there watching over -

*"Run away, or you will die tonight."*

It came from the Doll: a small voice like a child who was afraid of being caught. 

"I already did run away." I felt too guilty to wake Jordan up again after all this, so I whispered the reply.

*"Not far enough. He's still with you,"* she replied. I couldn't see the Doll's mouth moving or anything, but there was nothing else which could have been talking to me. I looked over at Jordan's harmless, sleeping body. Was I really going to trust a phantom voice over my husband who I've known and loved for years? 

But it wasn't just any voice. Somehow it was my father trying to reach me, and him I would trust till the ends of the Earth. I took the Doll and my phone and quietly slipped out the door. I wasn't going to leave him stranded, so I took an UBER back home. While we were driving, I wrote him a long text message thanking him for being so understanding and apologizing for my behavior. I told him how much he meant to me, and that all of this was just because I was having such a hard time with Dad's passing. He was so kind that he probably wouldn't have even needed it, but it felt good to tell him anyway. 

I hope Jordan got the chance to read it before he died. The next time I woke, it was to the hammering of police on my front door. They informed me that my husband was found dead in his hotel room with three bullet holes in his chest. Future investigations revealed the coke habit wasn't as ancient history as I thought. He owed a lot of money to the wrong people, and they followed our car to the motel. If it wasn't for the Doll, I'd be dead too. 

I still think Dad was wrong about Jordan though. I don't regret a minute of our time together. And Dad was wrong about another thing too - the Angel Doll was going to have to lie awake with me for a long time before she can [take away the pain](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog)

	<TEXT> I'm going to tell you a secret that I don't tell anyone. I'm a US veteran of the war in Afghanistan. I was stationed in the Uruzgan province when Taliban militants attacked our coalition base. I stood next to a man I knew since training when a RPG-17 rocket hit the three story building behind and buried us both alive, and I held the flag they sent home to his mother after I crawled out. I've tortured a man for information, threatened a child to coerce his parents to cooperate, and of the seven people I know I've killed, only five were fighting back.  

But that isn't the secret, because I was just following orders. The secret is that when I'm lying awake at night thinking about all the things done to me - all the things *I've done* - I'm not not traumatized by it all. The secret is I can't sleep because I miss it. 

Adrenaline, fear, excitement - it's all the same thing. I've been addicted to it for as long as I can remember. While other kids were riding skateboards around the neighborhood cul-de-sac, you'd find me grinding along the railings of a rooftop. They threw water balloons, I threw rocks. They learned to drive, I organized street races with my brother. By the time I graduated high-school, I already had a juvie record for fighting. The cop sat me down with an army recruitment officer, and they told me my life had only two possible outcomes left.   

"You're going to either keep playing at these stupid stunts until you get locked up for life, or you're going to man up and become somebody."

I told them I had changed, and the officer decided my past mistakes wouldn't disqualify me from enlisting. He was wrong for believing me - I just thought shooting guns sounded like a hell-of-a lot more fun than sitting behind bars. He was right that I would make a damn good soldier though. Sure it wasn't all excitement, but my life had a purpose and I could finally put my natural affinity to good use. For the first time in my life, I was courageous instead of stupid; a hero instead of a freak. 

I didn't come home in a body bag like I had expected, but the wheelchair I got was even worse. The bullet between the 2nd and 3rd lumbar bones is still lodged in my spine, and that was it for me. I didn't know if I would ever get out of that chair, but even if I could, my days of living on the edge were over. 

*And I hated it.* 

I hated the army for kicking me out (I would have crawled back into battle if they let me). I hated my brother for the pity he gave me, I hated the boring town I was stuck in, and more than anything, I hated myself for not having anything left to live for. I wheel out to the end of my driveway every month to get the disability check they mail me, but besides that I just sit at home and watch movies. 

War movies. *Horror movies*. Anything that could make me forget, even for a moment, that the most excitement I was ever going to get was checkup time when the nurse leaned over my chair to measure my stagnant pulse. My brother tried to get me to go out with him more, but I couldn't stand being dragged away from my movies. I wish I could be *inside them* and never come out. That's when he came up with an idea for a compromise: 

"How about you and me go down to the new Virtual Reality Arcade?" he asked. "They've even got some immersive horror ones that are so real you'll piss yourself." 

"Sounds like my everyday life," I replied. 

---

I ended up going just to shut him up, and the place was actually a lot cooler than I expected. The arcade was divided into personal pods that looked kinda like spaceships. The assistant was a geeky Japanese dude and spoke with a weird inflection which kept swinging back and forth. He probably spent his spare time making fan-made anime dubs or some nonsense. He helped me get setup with the headset and headphones, and made sure the wheelchair didn't get tangled up in any of the wires.

As you might have guessed from my introduction, not much impresses me. But holy shit, this technology has come a long way since the blurry 3D movies I saw as a kid. I found myself confronted with a menu hanging in the air which looked real enough to touch. I selected the horror genre, and then a few more options came up. 

**Select your difficulty. Are you a:**  
-    
**Grandmother with a heart condition.**      
**Kid with something to prove.**    
**SWAT team looking for practice.**     
**A lost soul seeking forgiveness from GOD.**  

That last one didn't really sound like a degree of fear to me, but they were organized in ascending difficulty so I selected that. Any hope of a thrill immediately disappeared as a fat cartoon Devil with a pitchfork ran across my field of vision. 

"I can see you!" he said, waving his pitchfork at me. "Can you see you?"

"No, because I'm not a stupid cartoon. You sure this game is for adults?" I spoke aloud. 

"Just wait and see," the Japanese guy said. It was weird hearing him talk when I couldn't see him. I think he was still speaking, but the words were drowned out by the game music which started playing. It sounded like the bad haunted houses they try and push off on kids: full of rubber spiders, cobwebs, and jars of "intestines" which are just spaghetti and meat-sauce. 

My viewpoint was walking along a dark road at night which led to a trapdoor in the ground like a cellar. The cartoon Devil popped up again, and I physically prepared myself for death-by-cringing. I get that my brother felt as helpless as I did, and I know he is just trying his best which is still more than can be said for me. I guess it wouldn't hurt to at least *pretend* to have fun. 

"Through me is the space between you and the Divine; infinite and eternal, inseparable and simultaneous," the Devil said, his voice completely different than his last utterance. The words popped with a confusing static noise. It was almost as though instead of hearing the words, I heard every imaginable sound *except* the words, and my brain filled in the missing space just like it does with white lettering on black paper.  

"Are you scared yet?" I faintly heard my brother's voice through the headset. I shrugged and gave a thumbs up. The trapdoor opened, and I *lurched* in my chair and something hurt in my back as the viewpoint suddenly dropped into the Earth. It felt impressively real, almost like I was on a roller-coaster which plunged into the darkness. I heard my brother laugh at my reaction. I figure that's enough satisfaction for him. No more looking startled, or I'll never hear the end of it. 

I could faintly see phosphorescent mushrooms and rocks lighting the deplorable descent. I was continuing to accelerate as I fell, and I even felt wind blowing in my face. They must have a fan or something to make it seem more real. The Devil was tagging along with me, but he kept glitching and lagging and getting left behind, only to suddenly reappear in front once more. Then I felt a blast of hot air on my face, and I closed my eyes. Whelp, guess this was it folks. I must be in Hell. 

I opened my eyes and squinted against the brilliant light. I always imagined Hell being darker. Was this Hell-fire? My eyes started to adjust, and I could see the sun reflecting sharply off the wide sandy slopes of... of where? Afghanistan? 

Someone was talking behind me in Dari, the most common language used there. I couldn't understand it, but I could tell the person was afraid. I turned my chair to shift the viewpoint until I saw an old man kneeling in the dirt before two US soldiers who had their backs to me. One of them was holding a picture of an teenage Afghani boy. 

"Do you know who this is? Have you seen him?" the first soldier asked. 

"Is this your idea of a joke, bro?" I spoke aloud. 

"Your brother went to use the bathroom," the Japanese guy said faintly. 

"What kind of game is this?" I asked, but his reply was drowned out by the VR soldiers. 

The old man kept pressing his face against the dirt and shaking his head. One of the soldiers dragged him to his feet and shoved the photo in his face. 

"You know who this is, don't you? Why are you trying to protect him? Do you know what he's done?" 

This wasn't funny to me. I started to take off the headset, but the cartoon Devil appeared in the corner. 

"I can see you!" he said in the silly voice. "Can you see you?" Everything was playing so smoothly it could have been real, except for the Devil which kept lagging and glitching. He was little more than a jumping mass of mis-colored pixels. 

One of the soldiers kicked the man on the ground. As he pivoted his body, I caught a glimpse of my own face under the helmet. Suddenly I remembered who the old man was. Abdul-Baser was a Qalandar or mystic who was suspected of sheltering Taliban operatives in his house. I didn't need to watch to know what happened next. 

I took my headset off and handed it to the Japanese guy. "Did my brother put you up to this?" I asked him. 

"I can see you," the assistant replied. He handed the headset back to me, but I pushed it away.  

"No duh, Sherlock. How did you get this footage?" 

"Can you see you?" he asked. His face froze for a second while he spoke, twisted half-way between words. There were a couple of empty pixels obscuring his mouth, but I could tell he was smiling when he handed me back the headset. I touched his hand - warm and real. Well, I don't know what was going on, but this certainly captured my attention better than any movie. I slowly took the headset from him, and the assistant nodded and smiled while I put it back over my eyes. 

"Hahahaha," the cartoon Devil laughed in a good-natured way. "I played a trick on you: once for what you've done." 

*Flash* I was beating Abdul-Baser inside a holding cell.  
*Flash* I was back in the desert next to the cartoon Devil. I saw it for less than a second, like a single frame inserted into a movie. 

"Yeah, you tricked me alright," I answered. "But you didn't scare me. You think I don't remember everything I saw? I wasn't scared then, and I'm not scared now." 

The scene suddenly dissolved and I was falling through the Earth again. I seemed to be going deeper this time, because the tunnel was lit by flowing veins of lava now instead of mushrooms. I sat calmly in my chair, actually looking forward to what came next. I don't know if I was drugged, or having a stroke, or if the Devil really was trying to teach me a lesson, but I was excited to see just how far the rabbit-hole went. 

This time it was pitch black when I stopped. *Crashed* would be a better word though, because I *felt* it. It was like my whole body had slammed into a wall. This trick could make me feel things? Could something here beat me? Or *torture* me? For a second I actually did start to get scared, but then I reached out with my hands and felt carpet beneath my fingers. That's right, I was still in the VR arcade. I had just fallen out of my chair somehow. Still wearing the headset and seeing nothing but the blackness I landed in, I pulled myself hand-over-hand and crawled back into my wheelchair. 

"I can see you," the static-y absence of words said. "Can you see you?" The Devil rose in front of me, but his appearance had changed as much from that cartoon Devil as his voice had. The shape was dark, but it wasn't just like the lights were off. Ordinary dark is the absence of light, but the presence before me was the *impossibility* of it. In that moment before him, I couldn't even remember what it was like to see, but I could still *sense* his form through the emotional weight it carried. 

*His horns were as sharp as being stabbed by the love of your life after you sacrificed everything to bring her joy.*   


*His face was the burden of holding your dying father in your arms while both of you knew you could have saved him if only you'd tried harder.*    


*His body was the shape of a long life spent in quiet desperation after all living matter had wasted away and you alone remained to dwell upon your regret.*   

"Twice for who you are," the presence said. 

He reached out to touch me, but I couldn't let him. Somehow I felt I would become like him, an unreal embodiment of misery and pain, if the presence of his being were to overlap with my own. It wasn't fear that made me rip off the headset - fear is something consciously recognized in the brain. My terror was something much deeper and primitive, the sort of thing which stirred my ancient ancestors into action to prolong their own purposeless existences in the face of some greater dread of the unknown. 

I tore off my headset and headphones and threw them into the assistant's face. My brother wasn't there, but I wasn't going to wait for him. I sprinted out of the building, bursting out into the bright clear light of my familiar hometown. Boring? How could anything be boring about this place which brought me into this world and formed me into who I am. I ran as fast and hard as I could, taking in deep lungfuls of clean air which filled my body with hope and jubilation. I had my whole life ahead of me, and nothing I had done or been could ever change that. I couldn't remember the last time I felt this good. Hell, I couldn't even remember the last time I walked outside -

And it hit me. I couldn't remember the last time I walked, because I couldn't walk. I slowed down and looked at my legs pumping the concrete beneath me. I could *feel* the blood roaring in my veins and the pressure of my feet on the ground. But I could also see that one leg lagged slightly behind the other even when I stood still, and that it was filled with dead blurry pixels. I walked the rest of the way home, just enjoying how good it felt to move and trying not to look at my glitching legs. 

"Three times for what you will do," said the voice which wasn't a voice. My brother was waiting for me in my home, although every instinct within me *screamed* with the common recognition that it wasn't my real brother. 

"Oh but I can't trick you, can I?" his mouth moved, but it was the silly cartoon Devil's voice which came out. "You're not scared of anything." 

I reached up to my face, but the headset wasn't on anymore. I turned around and started walking upstairs as quickly as I could. My heart was pounding in my chest like a caged animal trying to escape. My brother-who-wasn't-my-brother followed me up to my room.  

"You think you're so strong, don't you? That you don't need anybody. But you know what? But there's no-one else here, so you can tell me the truth." 

The singsong cartoon voice was grating on my nerves. Wherever I was, I wasn't in control. There was no point in trying to outrun something in my own mind. I turned around to face him. 

"I'm not afraid of you or your tricks. What do I have to do to get out of here?" I asked. My voice didn't even shake. I balled my hands into fists, and they were firm and ready.

"Are you sure you want out?" he asked, but it was back in my brothers voice. "Your legs work in here, but they won't out there." 

"I don't care, I want out," I said. 

"Why? Unless you really are afraid." He smiled, and it froze in a glitch. The face was so warped I could barely recognize him. I couldn't stand to look - I wanted to wipe that smile off. If he wasn't going to be reasoned with, then I would have to do things my own way. 

"I'm not afraid!" I shouted. I grabbed him by the front of his shirt and punched him straight across the face. "You're the one who is trapped in here with me!" 

"Then what do you feel?" he asked.

The face felt solid and I could feel the bones of his jaw moving from the impact. The instant I hit him however, his face was replaced with Abdul-Baser. The old man started to pull a handgun from behind his back, but I punched him again, almost breaking my hand against his cheekbone. The face changed again, and this time I was looking into my own eyes. That was it - that was the way out. He was reeling from my blows, and I snatched the handgun from his limp grasp. 

"That's not going to do anything to me -"

"You're right, it won't," I interrupted, my mind racing with the possibilities, "because you're just pretending to be me. It *will* however, work on me." 

I put the gun in my mouth and pulled the trigger. He jumped at me faster - faster than humanly possible - and knocked my hand aside. The gun went off with a deafening ring, and he fell to the ground in a heap. 

"My turn," I said. I put the gun in my mouth, pleased to find that my hand still wasn't shaking, and pulled the trigger.

*"I can see you. Can you see you?"* 

I opened my eyes in the hospital. A doctor was leaning over me, shining a light in my mouth. My head hurt like Hell. I tried to nod, but a searing pain engulfed my awareness and I froze up - almost like a glitch. 

My father was sitting beside my bed. He wouldn't say a word until after the doctor left, but eventually he told me what happened. I had entered some kind of fit at the VR arcade and fell out of my chair, probably caused by the bullet shifting in my spine. My brother took me home and stayed with me to make sure I was okay, but I pulled a gun and tried to kill myself. He managed to stop me, but the gun went off and hit him. I shot myself after that, but the bullet went straight through my jaw and missed my brain. 

I want to go back to my old life - Hell I want to go all the way back to day one and do it all again, but I'd settle for just a day. 

I used to think I had nothing left to hope for. I used to think I wasn't afraid of anything. Now I know I was wrong about both, and that they're both the same thing: 

The static sneer, half-contempt, half-agony, glitching on my [father's face](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).

Update edit: Everything seems real, but I keep seeing glitches. I can't tell whether this is real and the visual anomalies are a result of my fit, or whether I'm still trapped in the virtual world. 

If it IS real though, then I've killed my brother. If it isn't, then I might be trapped here forever. I don't even know which I'm more afraid of.
