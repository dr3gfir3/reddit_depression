	<TEXT> A condition is only considered a disorder if it causes stress, emotional discomfort, or other mental anguish, and only if the pain is *not* inflicted by societal expectations and differing from social norms. 

So at its most basic level, gender dysphoria is the mental stress of not belonging in one's own body. 

Transgenderism is simply another state of being, which is separated from dysphoria. Being trans would not be mentally painful were it not for society's alienation and stigmatization, so it is not a disorder.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The sanctions we put on Russia after they annexed Crimea are what pissed Putin off and inspired him to interfere. They weren't meant to stop having our propaganda. They kept Putin from making a ton of money with Exxon. That and Hillary's comments about the Russian elections being unfair. 

The sanctions Obama put in place (and expulsion of diplomats) more recently were in retaliation to the hacking, yeah, but that happened after the election was already over.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Dems need to quit running policy wonks (Al Gore, John Kerry, Hillary Clinton) that talk at people rather than too people.

I'm going to have to disagree. While the charisma aspect of running for office is important, Gore, Kerry, and Hillary were all among the best of the best in regarding legislative know-how. I think we'd be doing ourselves a massive disservice by passing on the best minds in the arena in favor of personableness. 

My point is this: we should always vote for the most qualified, prepared candidate whose views match ours best. The fact that Americans don't is, imo, a result of poor education and rampant anti-intellectualism, both of which Democrats want to fix. 

The Dems have a tendency to come across as caring more about identity politics and globalization rather than things like the opiod epidemic, rural poverty, etc. 

The opiod epidemic and rural poverty *are* identity politics, though. They just don't happen to be one of the identities upon which Democrats generally focus. We've definitely got to work on that, I couldn't agree more. However, pretending that Dems haven't tried to address these issues is ridiculous. Dems want to improve education in rural communities and create jobs in clean energy, which would alleviate much of the poverty in rural areas, and expand healthcare, which would help addicts get the help they need and recover.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I understand that we've done dubious things in the past, but it's not particularly productive for the US or any other country to self-flagellate right now. 

Is it awful that our operatives have tampered with elections in sovereign nations? Absolutely. But what are we supposed to do about it? Whataboutism is not going to stop the propaganda operation that is *currently in progress* and is targeting one (more likely two, I'm sure the Kremlin is working against Merkel as well) of our most important allies. It needs to be stopped *now*, and bringing up America's transgressions only serves to dismiss Russia's active measures. Bringing this stuff up is quite literally a Russian propaganda technique, and it has been since the Cold War.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here. Although one thing that stuck with me was the time my best friend (now deceased) and I were changing into our PJs for a sleepover and she saw me topless. I was super shy and got embarrassed, but then she said, "dude, don't be. You've got great nipples." Then she went into a little rant about her own nipples being too dark and blah blah blah. 

It was strange and kinda awkward, but hearing that from a girl who I thought was crazy gorgeous has made me hate my breasts a little less.

	<TEXT> It's a sociological theory. In the first sentence of the Wikipedia article, it says 

Toxic masculinityis a critique of the way feminists claim society has createdmento be dominant, aggressive (sexually and otherwise), and unemotional, both collectively and as individuals.

*Society* at large perpetuates toxic masculinity and hegemonic masculinity, and the blame does not lie with any demographic nor person.

Have you ever been mugged, with a gun, not knowing if your life would end? Yea different than rape. 

I know it kinda ruins that lovely straw man you were building, but they only point I made was that rape is at least as life threatening and traumatic as being robbed.  You're they only person who brought up litigation. 

Interesting that you chose to frame my account of the event that left me physically and emotionally destroyed as an excuse to dismiss the entire discussion, though. You may want to do some introspection on that.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever been pinned down by a person twice your size and forcibly entered? Trust me, if you're being crushed under a man who's got a solid 150lbs of muscle on you and is capable of holding you down anyway while he repeatedly impales your chafing, non-consenting flesh with an unlubricated penis, you fear for your fucking life. 

Never mind that some victims are assaulted at gun- or knifepoint. 

Of course they're different situations. They're different situations *by definition.* Being mugged and beaten up can be incredibly traumatic. While I've never been mugged, I've been violently raped. I got the beating, the threats, **and** had I had to lie in a puddle of my own tears and spit for God-knows-how-long because my body was no longer my own. 

This happened nearly two years ago now, and the one time since then I trusted anyone enough to give sex a shot, it triggered a severe panic attack. 

But, yeah, totally the same as a mugging. Ugh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Des Moines is one of my favorite cities. My grandparents have a house in West Des Moines, which is admittedly the nicer section, that they are renting to my aunt. If I'd lived there, I'd have gone to high school with Shawn Johnson, the Olympic gymnast, and been able to train with her coach. But, c'est la vie. 

The people are so nice and very liberal in the city. Visiting my aunt and uncle in Sioux City, King's district, is like traveling to a dimension full of shittier people. 

Iowa City, Ames, Indianola, and Des Moines, basically any city with a university, are awesome and progressive. What little towns there are that're still thriving are kinda backwards, but the people are nice in that Midwest way, which I love.
