Is 900 in the slums because you're looking to live downtown in a HCOL city?

	<TEXT> It was a slash to the glove. Goes uncalled in literally every hockey game. This one just happened to be devastating. If there was no injury there wouldn't even be a thread. You're upset with the result not the act. Every single nhl rostered player has made a slash exactly like this, and they just didn't happen to lop off a finger. It wasn't exceptionally hard compared to typical slashes. Pretty ordinary. Probably caught right where there's no padding though and that's what happens. Nhl should punish glove slashes more consistently if anything, this goes to show what can happen </TEXT>
