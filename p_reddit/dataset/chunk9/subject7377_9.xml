	<TITLE> Tip: unscrew or change your fridge's light bulb to LED </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-04 18:45:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Perhaps this suggestion has already been suggested but here are the reasons why you want to do this:

* The vast majority of fridges more than 5 years old (ie. most) shipped with incandescent interior lightbulbs for lighting
* Incandescent lightbulbs are the least energy-efficient form of modern lighting common meaning they transform a large amount of the energy that they consume into heat (infra-red)
* Simply unscrewing the light-bulb will save you money in three important ways:

1. reducing the over-all energy that your fridge consumes solely from the lighting the bulb
2. reducing the the over-all energy that you fridge consumes by having to refrigerate the heat produced by the bulb
3. reducing the spoilage rate of food (esp. the top shelf, closest to the bulb)

We will see all of these benefits from changing to an higher-efficiency (and lower heat producing LED) bulb variant but just not to the same degree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically you register your bluetooth device (in my case the Pebble Time) within the smartlock security settings of the phone. From that point forward as long as they are in contact with each other you don't have to do a screen unlock pattern or code on your phone. If they lost contact with each other you do.

That way if someone steals my phone they also have to take my watch for easy access. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I can provide a 1 month update on the Zenphone 2. Picked one up to take traveling and 3 weeks into the trip the digitizer has gone intermittently flakey so words are frequently misspelled, icon presses don't always register the first time (and often not the third time), and if I test a finger on the screen the app will jump around (eg. maps). I've been an Asus fan for almost a decade, including all motherboards for servers, owned the first two transformers, several eeePCs, and several Zenbooks and I'm not that impressed with this phone. Plus they loaded it to the hilt with crappy unremovable (w/o rooting) bloatware.

	<TEXT> Those aren't the routes you want to ride anyway. That's a common mistake made by people first switching from their car to a bicycle - they take the same route they would drive.

There are routes favoured by bicycles because they are safer - mostly fewer cars, wider shoulders and more other cyclists on them.  Google Maps is pretty good about showing these routes. You can also get good insight into them from [Strava's Global Heatmap](http://labs.strava.com/heatmap/#14/-123.09813/49.28487/blue/bike).

True that if you use Tor to reach the VPN then you are leaving an IP that isn't yours but you are still authenticating to use the VPN.

You can try setting up tor  vpn  tor but your latency is probably going to make it unusable. </TEXT>

In my experience that ones that provide the best "suction" onto your face will be optimal. Everyone's face is different which is why it's kind of useless to ask for recommendations for specific manufacturers. Speedo Vanquisher were totally hopeless for me however they obviously work for others in here! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best way to update the BIOS is to use unetbootln and create a FreeDOS boot disk (USB) and then copy the class file to it. Then boot into FreeDOS and run the flasher.

Or you can do it from Windows if you still have that around.

You're welcome for the help! </TEXT>
