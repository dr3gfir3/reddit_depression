	<TEXT> i find the launch mode only power output solution amusing because i would never use it. its a pain to get done correctly and quickly. only to sub a bit of time at the drag strip? from what i had seen logging my cars performance, max output only shows up around 60mph, so highway passing speed. cant activate launch mode unless your at a stop. so the car got nurfed in all driving scenarios other than the drag strip. maybe they are still holding out hope that somone, someday might hit the magical 10.9 we were sold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> owners were logging 480-512kw last year. after the 8.0 update someone was kicked down to under ~450kw in max battery mode. so... not a p90d. he raised a stink and found out launch mode, max battery and WOT counters limiting performance. which tesla removed, only to shift that max output into launch mode. later learned not to protect some mechanical piece like and axle or something but because the battery cells were being damaged. case in point my car which needed a new pack in under 1 year without frequent use of max batt or launch mode. just normal ludicrous mode acceleration so about 460kw. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> first off, dashcams often have a crap lens or a dirty lens. so that footage does not mean anything. as u/EducationalPorpoises pointed out, most other cameras will clip and not bloom out the sun. lastly only reason i have had AP1 act up when driving into the sun is when the angle of incidence is so that the asphalt is reflecting the sun thus making the lane markers hard to read. </TEXT>
