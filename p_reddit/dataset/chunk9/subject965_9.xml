Normaly when a screen goes black is either a software issue.. But that's not the case here.

	<TEXT> I have asus mg278q and it's amazing what freesync does. 
If you have a 480 I suggest getting a 1080p monitor with 144hz. 
Or 1440p if you are planning to get Vega. 
Trust me. Freesync is amazing  </TEXT>
