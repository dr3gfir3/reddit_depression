	<TEXT> [Refuted by snopes.](http://www.snopes.com/syrian-war-victims-are-being-recycled-and-al-quds-hospital-was-never-bombed/) The name of the journalist is Eva Bartlett.  She's a pro-Assad journalist and was speaking in that video at a pro-Syrian government event.  She is also a contributor at RT, a news site funded by the Russian government. She makes a number of mistakes including her claim of Al Quds Hospital never being bombed. She also misleadingly states that Assad won democratically. The 2014 Syrian election was only held in areas under government control. Rebel-held areas as well as Kurdish areas and others were deprived of the vote. 88.7% of the people able to vote in 2014 voted for Assad. The second-place finisher was a puppet opposition that fell apart right after the election.  Nearly half a million people have already died, and millions have migrated. These are facts.

	<TEXT> There is also a huge media war going on where Syrian-state TV and Russian media will act like these atrocities aren't even happening.  If you watch the news about the war on Russia TV, it's like you're seeing a completely different war than what's shown on almost all other international stations.


Unfortunately our conversations on reddit about the Syrian war have become really watered-down. *"But they are terrorists! and they have Al-Qaeda on their side!"* The rebel forces have various armed-groups on their side, and saying that they are "terrorists" is meaningless here, because anyone who fights against the Syrian state can be considered a terrorist by definition.  For many of the rebels, this is their first time participating in a war. </TEXT>

 The assault took place on Monday morning as the victim, 45, was heading to work on the subway, CBS New York reported. The suspect followed her off the train and shoved her down the stairs, police said.
 
 Sources told CBS New York the suspect allegedly called the victim a terrorist and said she shouldnt be working in the city. She was wearing a Muslim head covering at the time of the assault, and was treated at a Manhattan hospital for ankle and knee injuries. 
 
 Authorities say a good Samaritan intervened, and police are looking for the man who committed the crime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I meant that it's not realistic to have Muslims who are fully engaged in such a weekly program.  Imagine if it was just 1 full $50 day course with a scholar.  You are more likely to attract Muslims who are more engaged, more interested, more involved with the course and with each other. Spending time with such a gathering has much benefit, and you get much more out of it than just going over some material that you could get from reading class notes or watching a video.  If you can do this in your local area with a local scholar, even better.

	<TEXT> If you can get a group of passionate Muslims to learn together and teach each other for a significant amount of time, than that's great. I just don't see it as something practical.  We even have for example, a weekly group-watch of Yasir Qadhi's Seerah series on r/Islam. It started out with plenty of people interested to try this, but it's slowed down quite quickly, because most people were just able to follow  along. It's not that Muslims on this sub aren't interested in learning, it's that we have our own schedule and watching a video series wouldn't make it that much of a priority, especially when we could be doing other things more beneficial.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In reality, I've found there to be Muslims wanting to improve themselves and increase their knowledge in every community I've lived in.

I don't disagree with this. But to have a setup similar to a free intensive class on your own, and have online videos in replace of a teachers; i think it would be hard to have everyone organized that way and i don't think you would get  the same atmosphere. I mean, i'm interested in learning but i would be much less interested if you don't have a knowledgeable teacher to teach the course.  I've participated in several Islamic classes and programs, some of which were free. And i think i benefited most from the classes/programs that were the most expensive and most structured. And i found students who were more passionate to learn in those classes.


But like i said, i can't speak for this program. Never been to it. But i really don't see the cost of a class as a reason why one shouldn't attend (unless one doesn't have the money). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly we have a large number of Muslims who think Islamic teachers and scholars don't deserve money for teaching or that they should get the bare minimum. They rely on money just like everyone else. Institutions also need money to provide their resources, accommodate students and provide new programs that other people can benefit from.  Now we have so many mosques that rely on fundraisers and desperate pleas, because people don't want to pay for anything non-secular.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't speak for this intensive program, but i was in some other similar (but shorter) programs which i was really grateful for and i believe i benefited immensely from those types of programs. I watch many lectures online too, but getting involved in these programs is nothing like watching YouTube videos.  You get so much more from sitting with knowledgeable Muslims and scholars.

  Get together with fellow Muslims in your community and have a group watch + discussion and food every Friday evening. Make it a potluck. Invest in your local community, build those bonds of real brotherhood and sisterhood.

You do this and you'll likely get a lot of Muslims who aren't interested or be temporarily involved. The type of atmosphere that you're looking for (ambitious Muslims eager to learn and share ilm) would actually be in those types of programs. </TEXT>

Be careful, it almost sounds like you're falling into progressivism here. 

 Contemporary times should be taken into account when making rulings of course.

Of course. Every context should be taken into account with rulings. And you can't simply apply the letter of the law without understanding the spirit of the law. But that doesn't make us more evolved for being in a different situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Ruqyah sessions can go for no charge up to 1000 per session. Let me tell you there are a lot of Muslims willing to part with their money if they feel jinns, sihr and other things are involved in their lives.

How many Imams have you honestly seen making even close to that much money doing Ruqyah? This is not something most Imams would do or be able to make enough from.

 As for conferences organisers pay for accommodation, travel and small expenses for those who participate. It's very lucrative especially imams who are scholars as they can fly abroad to give talks.

Again, this is not something doable for the most Imams. It usually works for a few well-known Muslim speakers, and even then they get criticized for "making money from Islam". If we need someone to spend 30-40 hours a week in the masjid, provide 10-20 hours a week of counseling, and on top of that be constantly on-call for marriages, funerals, and other emergencies, then a pay structure should be built to reflect that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is also a lot of side work they do ruqyah, private tuition, weekend trips to conferences, home visits, involvement in madrasa.

None of which are lucrative enough, and the Muslims who do those, still get criticized for "making money from Islam".

 Some imams get no salary, others rely on donations.

Which is a big problem.
