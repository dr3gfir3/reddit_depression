	<TEXT> It worked. I'm sure there were far less random killings back when hanging people for their crime was routine. If it's blatantly obvious, speedy trial and hanging. This cozy jail system they get to live in forever isn't punishment. He doesn't deserve to live at all. And he can be an example nobody would forget instead of just disappearing and nobody fully understanding or knowing if he is actually suffering and paying the consequences. This generation is too lenient and "open minded" about shit and everyone should be "free and fair and treated with respect and love" and that's why people are dying at the hands of really fucked up people. Because they know they can get away with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He needs to be hanged and made an example of. I don't know why we stopped public hangings. People are dense and need graphic reminders that when you do shit like this, it is not okay and your life should be far worse than being taken care of in a prison system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm type 2 and this was definitely me before Medication. Never have had a mania phase but felt good, usually situational, then depressed for no reason. Anxious like I was waiting for the next thing to happen. Emotional about things I'm not typically emotional about. Lost interest in a lot of hobbies and slept more often. Medication has saved my life, but it does sound like you have type two. Not sure what else it could be. Take their diagnosis, try their treatment, and see if your life improves. It can't hurt to try. If nothing ever changes, then seek other opinions. The first and hardest step to this is to trust your doctor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like he may be bipolar himself if you aren't doing anything to trigger his outrage. An unhealthy environment will make anyone go a little crazy and be more aggressive and defensive and sensitive than usual. I was the same way living with my parents. When I moved out away from their negativity I felt so much better, but I actually am bipolar. The meds are just chilling you out, they would do that to anyone. They don't only work with bipolar people. You need out, and safety, and therapy to help you realize it isn't your fault and it's okay to be alone to recover. </TEXT>
