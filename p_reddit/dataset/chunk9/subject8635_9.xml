	<TEXT> The court case came quickly.  I had a court appointed lawyer but he was basically useless.  He tried to make me tell him what I did, but I didnt do anything, so there was nothing to confess to.  They soon called Leah to the witness stand.  She was smiling  her usual loving smile.  I dont think I was the only one that was even a little bit unnerved.

Miss Greer - The DA, Magda Niem, said.  The district attorney was building a case against me.  Her star witness?  Leah King, the little bitch that put me here.

King.  Im not his daughter. Leah said coldly.  She gave me a look that told me she wished I was dead, or worse.

All right, Miss King, Niem said, irately, Why did you insist on being a witness?

Because I know what hes going to say to prove his supposed innocence, Said Leah, and she had her smile on again.  It was a smile that said she was going to devour me alive, And Im honestly happy hes behind bars.  He has made my life a living fucking hell for the last ten years.  Sorry for the language.

Thats bullshit and you know it! I shot back.  Niem raised an eyebrow, as did Leah, though the expressions differed.  Niem looked slightly curious, while Leah looked somewhat amused.

Mr Greer, be quiet, or I will hold you in contempt. The judge said, bored.  I bowed my head.  O hadnt been granted bail at the bail hearing  go figure. Even if I did get bail, who would pay it?  My wife was nigh comatose and mu daughter hated me.

Hes well, hes been an abusive fu - fella for a while. She caught her swear word, Hes been hitting me and my mother, and I thought it was weird when Spot died.  Daddy always seemed to love Spot more than anything  than me or mum  and, I dunno, hes been annoyed with her lately.  And then he killed her and he said it was me.

What do you mean exactly by abusive?  Niem asked.  I raised an eyebrow.  I wanted to know too.  Leah held out her wrists.

Daddy grabbed my wrists when he was mad at me.  Once my wrist broke, and he just laughed at me.  I didnt even get to go to the doctor until the next day.

That that had happened, but it was an accident!  She was eighteen at the time, and we were playing.  No, not the kind of playing your thinking about  playing tag with her niece and nephew.  And of course I played too.  I managed to tag Leah, but I got hold of her wrist and it broke.

Is there evidence of this? The judge asked.  The DA nodded.

Yes, sir.  There are eyewitness accounts and x-rays of Miss Kings broken hand after the incident.  I also asked her to get a recent x-ray, which has been examined by a professional, who agrees that the wrist was broken approximately five years ago.  Niem said it all very smoothly.  My attorney let his head fall onto his arms.  He didnt like this case.

Nor did I.

Where was my wife?

Why was Leah doing this?

I did not deserve this!

The x-rays were handed over and examined by the doctor in the court.  He confirmed it.  

Is that all, Miss King? The judge asked. 

For now. Leah said, and she was allowed to return to her seat.

. . .

Life was well, life was weird.  The judge ended up giving me a fine and community service.  He said that my daughter vouched for me, taking back her claims of abuse.  The jury didnt understand why it was happening.  The lawyers didnt understand.  

I had to go back to court for the charge of murder against my wife, but I was granted bail, a surprisingly low amount, and told to be back in a month.  Meanwhile I was not allowed to contact my wife, or I would be back in jail.  I was under investigation, but my life was thrown on its head.

I had to go to my house.  My big empty house, that I had worked for all of my life.  A house that I had bought with my wife after she and I had fought our way through years of embarrassment and prejudice to buy.

And it was empty.  Leahs laughter wasnt there, nor was the sound of the TV shows she always watched.  Mary and the sound of her shuffling feet wasnt there, her laughter, her strange sense of humour wasnt there

Spot wasnt there to cuddle me  she was killed.  Boy was nowhere to be seen.  Probably taken by Leah, probably killed by her too.

Why did they let me go?  Why was I not in jail after all the footage I saw?  Why wasnt I being raped in the ass by some fucker in a prison cell?  I wouldve put myself there if I was the judge.  I wouldve thrown away the key.

More importantly  why was Leah so strange?  She kept changing her mind.  

Daddy, Her voice said, a sing-song voice  her playful voice.  I looked around, she was there, in the doorway.

Leah. I said, keeping my voice level.  She came closer, wearing a pair of jeans and a tight shirt that really left nothing to the imagination.

Stop it. She said sharply, and I pulled my eyes away from her chest.  Hatred burned in her eyes.

Why are you here?

Oh, I just came to tell you how I did it. She smiled, sitting down opposite me.  Youre going to jail, daddy.

But you took your claims back?  I said, confused.  She pursed her lips thoughtfully. 

Thats doesnt mean a fucking thing. She said.  They let you go to see what you would do.  And on this night, daddy, you attacked me.

Leah, I would never-

Never? She said, lifting an eyebrow.  She showed her phone to me, a video was playing on it.  It was an intimate scene, with me pounding into her.  She was tied up, blindfolded

This didnt happen!  I said, and she smiled again, putting her phone in her pocket.  

I know. She said softly, Just like you didnt kill Spot.  Just like you didnt poison mum.  Just like I wasnt here, but yet I was.

Leah, what are you?

You fucking hate the fact that I am such a smart bitch, dont you?  I know you do.  But you never thought I was smart enough to do anything about you and our playtime.  I couldnt anything at the time.  Now?  Oh, now I can do so much more.  Im a motherfucking genius, daddy.  Im going to get away with everything. With killing mum, with Spot, with getting everything you own.

Your mum isnt dead, she is-

She died an hour ago. Leah interrupted me.  The way she said it made me shiver.  She said it coldly, and she looked me in the eyes while she said it.   Better yet, you killed her.

I did not!

No shit, She laughed, But the video shows otherwise.

She didnt show me the video this time.

Why? I asked, my heart breaking, Why your mother?

She let it happen. Leah shrugged, And she just let it go on.  For years.  For ten fucking years, daddy, and she never stopped it.  She never even tried!  But now She laughed again, rather evilly, Now I can do whatever I want.  And you get to go to jail, knowing my mother thought that you killed her.

She got up.  I tried to stand too, but I couldnt.

I drugged you again, just like last time.  You really should know better than the Coke, dad.  She giggled. And how did I do it? She tapped on her phone, and an exact replica of her appeared next to her.  Meet Leah 2.

It was it was a hologram.

And Peter 2.  She conjured another me too.  I saw myself for first time in a long time.  I was huge.  I had a beer belly, showing exactly why I needed to wear a four-extra-large pair of pants.

Youll be stuck for a few hours more.  Youll look awful, I guess, because youll have pissed yourself by then.  She walked to the doorway.  Goodbye, daddy.

I was fucked.

	<TEXT> I understand why you are all mad at me.  I dont blame you.  But honestly, I dont think I deserved this.  I didnt deserve what Leah did.  


I dont think I did.


When the numbness finally wore off, I heaved my massive body from the chair and went to bed.  I didnt know what else to do.  I felt empty.  I felt as though my world had ended.  And little did I know that it did.

The police came knocking on my door.  Correction: they hammered against the door, and when I didnt answer, they broke it down.  There were no barks, there were no running feet telling me that my daughter was going to open the door or defend me.

Mr Greer!  Mr Greer!  They called, and I groggily stood up.  I trudged through the hallway, glaring at whoever had barged in.  I expected it to be Marys brother  it sounded like him  but two people in blue uniforms greeted me.  A man slapped handcuffs on me.  I was too groggy to answer or register what was going on.

Peter Joseph Greer, you are under arrest for the murder of your wife, Mrs Mary Greer.  You have the right to remain silent  They read me my rights and soon I was hauled into their car.
Soon I was sitting across two police officers.  One was a pudgy woman with bushy red hair, and the other was a tall, young man with glasses.  Neither of them looked like they would be able to run after a criminal if it was needed.  I wasnt one to judge, because there was no way that I would even make a run around the block.

Mr Greer, Said the woman, What can you tell us of your wife and her current condition?

I dont know, I said, I went to sleep, and when I woke up my wife wasnt in bed with me.  Wed had an argument the night before, and I found her in the guestroom.  She didnt wake up  that was when I called the ambulance.

And you assumed she committed suicide? The woman didnt sound convinced.

There was a partially empty pill bottle next to her.  Yes, I assumed she tried to commit suicide. I said, rolling my eyes childishly.

The tox screen said that it wasnt all that was in her system?  He went on to list every single thing shed had in her stomach.  Anti-depressants, anti-anxiety medicine, Coke, sleeping pills, and more, read from a document shed had on hand.

And, according to the doctors report, the medicine was yours.

Im not on anti-depressants, I said quickly.  The woman paused, glancing at me.

According to your doctor, you have been on these pills for almost four years.

I started.  It was possible, I just drank the pills that Mary gave me every morning and night.  

But how do you come by the idea that I tried to murder my wife?

She told us that. The woman said.

Shes awake?  Both relieved and startled.  I loved my wife, I did, and I didnt know why they wouldnt call me to tell me.  Unless, of course, I was made to be the murderer.

Debatably, and she claims she didnt take the pills.  She drank some Coke and went to bed.  The last thing she saw was you bending over her.  The man spoke this time.

SO now Im a murderer? I asked.

The video footage is pretty damning.  Said the woman.  I started again.  Video footage?  We we didnt have cameras in our house.  Well, not security cameras.

They continued to question to me about it.  Spots death came up, my spying on Leahs internet use came up  I didnt know what I did was called spying.  I thought I was just checking up on my kid!

Sir, you installed a trojan on her computer.  Everything she did was sent to you. The man said.  I didnt bother to remember their names. 

I stuttered.  What was a trojan?

And, according to your daughter, this isnt the first act of violence against her mother.

Of course, Leah was in this too.  There was no way she wouldnt be involved in this.  This was all her doing.  That conniving little bitch!  So, this was what she meant when she said it wasnt over.

I didnt respond.  The two officers soon realised that I wasnt going to speak, and put me in a cell.  I had one call, and they advised me to call a lawyer.

I didnt call anyone.  Maybe later.  I was trying to figure out what was going on.  Yes, I did do things to my stepdaughter that could be considered immoral, but I didnt try to kill my wife.  I dont know why Mary would think that.  It wasnt as if she had tried to stop the thing with Leah.

These things apparently travelled through families.  My mother did it to me.  Marys father did it to her.  I did it to Leah  and she was probably going to do it with her children.  I didnt know anything about her fathers side of the family, but I heard her fathers brother was a bastard.

I didnt understand any of this.  What was going on?

. . .

New footage came to light.  I saw it this time.  I saw myself stand over Mary, forcing pills down her throat as she slept.  She didnt try to fight back.  Her eyes were open, though, and terror was evident on her face.  She must have been paralysed, like I was.

Next the camera was outside my house.  I was kicking my dog, kicking her mercilessly, and I could see her yowling.  I kicked her until she couldnt get up.  And then I took out a knife.  I slid it across her throat, and my dog died.

Next the camera showed me running into the house.  An hour later I came out again  I was wearing the same clothes as Id done when I supposedly killed Spot.  The video showed me shake my stepdaughter, yelling at her, and I saw her wrestle an arm loose and she punched me in the face.  I fell down, out cold.

The footage showed me do all those horrible things.  But I hadnt tried to murder my wife, and I didnt kill my dog.  Why would I?

What was going on?
