	<TEXT> No. The name comes from the fact that it is a long event. It would typically consist of 75 to 125 miles of mostly off road riding. Riders were supposed to arrive at a checkpoint on a specified minute and were penalized for arriving early or late. Some sections might be easy and make it easy for the rider to go too fast and some sections might be difficult and make it hard for the rider to go fast enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the link. I assumed the blog was going by something they saw in the photo and you could point that out for me.

If I could look at the Taurus then I would just check the VIN plate. I know VINs weren't around in 1916 but I assumed that since they owned the vehicle there was a title/registration that identified the year.

Seems unlikely but it is possible that the date refers to something else other than the year of the car.

Anyway, thanks again for the information. </TEXT>

How can you tell the hood is unpainted aluminum? It looks the same as the rest of the car except the doors to me.

Can you tell me why they said the one in the blog *looks* to be an *early* 1916?

What about the date on the door? Have you dismissed that? </TEXT>

Also, at the time of the photo the car is over 20 years old. Isn't it possible the lights were replaced with the earlier type? After all it does say spawned in 1916 on the door. </TEXT>

A color negative or transparency film of that era probably had a resolution of about 50 lp/mm. Assuming a 40% loss through a good lens that would yield a digital equivalent of 1524 ppi. A 36mm x 24mm, 35mm frame would be a digital equivalent to a 2160 x 1440 pixel image. You would probably scan the image at least twice that resolution to preserve detail though.

	<TEXT> Yes, wikipedia says 16.5 million. Not significantly different. Leno is an enthusiast. Maybe a knowledgeable enthusiast but he is not an expert. The two lower estimates don't specify worldwide but the UK link says 600 in the UK and 100,000 worldwide. Just because the kid is young doesn't make him wrong.  I don't know what the age of the guy on the video has to do with it anyway. I am not young either but if I see at least three sources, four counting the young guy in the video, say that there are 100,000 or less surviving Model T's, I would go with that. Your point stands just as well without an exaggerated number of surviving cars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yup.

Let's just call it around 1960. </TEXT>
