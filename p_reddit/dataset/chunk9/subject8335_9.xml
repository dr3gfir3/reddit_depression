	<TEXT> What you'd like to see for Jessa is what I'd like to see too. She was a total wanderer before moving to NYC - a move which seemed to have been prompted by her (false) pregnancy. It was Hannah who convinced her to stay in I guess S2, to make it work in NY. I think it would be interesting to see her move to some very obscure place to start over. I don't really like Jessa, and don't think the writers will take it this way, but it'd be good to see her get out of that shitshow of a thing with Adam and have a fresh start. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This episode was killer. Honestly, it's shocking to me how few people are on this sub. This show is brilliant, and the range of the core cast is stellar.

Like Hector's character 1st season, I suspect Cabral is going to make me empathise intensely with Isaac completely in spite of myself.

Interesting to me how the writers are taking their time drawing the connections between all the different characters. The other 2 seasons most of the connections were laid on the table quite explicitly, quite quick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The majority of a woman's weight, unless she is **straddling** a bench, will be on her buttocks with a small portion on her labia. This picture would only be accurate if a woman was planted squarely on her hole. Here's an experiment (if you're female). Sitting on a normal kind of chair with your legs out in front of you at a 90 degree angle, slide a finger up your vagina. You will notice it goes in at angle, right? Not straight up? That's because you're not planted puss-flat on a chair. You're sitting *mostly* on your ass, not your vag. 
Such an imprint would be possible on a bike seat, but not a chair or bench, unless you are really built differently than the average woman.

In almost all yoga postures, it's most helpful to inhale when you're moving into a posture that expands/opens the chest or ribcage (e.g., cow) and exhale when you're constricting/closing the chest (e.g., cat).

	<TEXT> If being with someone with the same religious/spiritual beliefs as him is important to him, he likely would have brought it up already, especially if you've been dating for a significant amount of time. If you feel like you're misleading him somehow, or that he's gotten the impression that you are also a Christian, it would be good to discuss with him sooner rather than later. 

Also, if you really feel compelled to share with him, you should. A relationship will ultimately be quite weak if you can't be open with each other about your beliefs. This doesn't mean being aggressive or "attacking" his beliefs (you can say *I believe x* without that becoming *You are wrong and everything you believe is wrong*). Ultimately, though, if he's "weirded out" or feels attacked simply by you sharing what you believe, it is likely not the healthiest relationship for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is so much great advice here so instead of rehashing that, I'll point out some thoughts I had reading your post.

Often, the things we hate most about people, and groups of people, are things that we are afraid to confront within ourselves. So when you say things like this:
 I view them as physically inferior, the destroyers and stealers of culture and generally unoriginal 

I wonder, do you consider yourself physically inferior? Unoriginal? Destructive? The destruction you hate so much as perpetrated by whites is not so dissimilar to the destruction (emotional or otherwise) caused by the rage you may on occasion feel. It is a vicious cycle of anger, the desire for power and validation, all to support and strengthen the ego. This happens on the global, local, and personal level, cyclically. 

You have likely been using anger as a coping mechanism against the institutional injustices -- real and tragic ones, no question -- against your "people" and minorities as a whole. But we are all one. Was not the violence of Native American tribes committed against one another as vile, as murderous, as unnecessary - albeit on a smaller scale - as the violence perpetrated from one larger society against another?

You say "My people are still slaves" - fair enough. On a literal level slavery existed before even written history, and persists today on a literal level. "Brown" people are chattel slaves under ISIL, thousands of "brown" and "white" women and children also sold as slaves. Hundreds of thousands of "black" children are enslaved as child soldiers throughout much of a continent. Almost a million people are enslaved ("blacks" by "blacks") in Niger. Upwards of 200,000 "east asian" people in North Korea are subject to hard slave labour and torture in massive prison camps. It is not only one particular race of people who have destroyed, conquered, or enslaved others. And from a personal angle, we are all slaves to our desires, to our aversions, which Buddhists seek to liberate themselves from. 

Some study of history and current events can help you to be more aware of injustices perpetrated by many cultures, and this awareness may serve you on your path away from your racist leanings. We must also learn to accept the past as the past. Some of my ancestors (quite "white") were gassed by the Nazis; further back other ancestors of mine were enslaved by Italians. Literally nothing I or my family does will change that fact. To progress spiritually we *must* accept these facts, and then look to confront the problems within *ourselves* - our own ego's need to solidify itself, to feel powerful and safe. Through seeking to understand each other you will find that we are not so easily divided into race, that we all have the same fears and desires within us, that we are none of us truly so different. </TEXT>

As a side note, I would have died to see a couple of Kirk/Lulu spawn, a mix of them both.
Truthfully, the revival could have done with a couple of new, well-drawn, engaging characters. Our closest thing to new characters was Paul, the musical cast, and a 1-second reference to Michel's husband. I think that would have involved too much forethought and, well, actual writing though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are you uncomfortable with her saying these things to you?
What is the worst possible outcome (for you) of a continued relationship?

These are very good questions that I don't know how to answer. On a very basic level, certain key elements of our friendship just disintegrate when we get into interactions like that, so it's like I'm suddenly confronted with someone who is not my friend. In those moments (and now, in reflecting) I feel that I can no longer trust her, I don't enjoy her company, and I feel guarded and restricted, all signs of a flailing friendship. Part of the discomfort, too, I guess, comes from my own ego, and how it is continually threatened when she sends me messages like the ones she's been sending (both figuratively and literally). I'm not desperate to support my own ego, mind you, but the negative energy that has arisen with all of that is something I don't want in my life.

The worst possible outcome.. again, I don't know. Because of this I just truly don't enjoy spending time with her, and also just feel very uncomfortable around her. Who chooses to spend time with people whose company they don't enjoy?

I think I've realised, literally whilst typing this reply, how much I've already made the decision as it were. Maybe this is an opportunity to learn about myself, as you suggested, but I also think this is a relationship on its way out.

The tree analogy is super apt. I love it.

Thanks for your thoughts. You've been very insightful. </TEXT>

 If you are not craving validation, then dis-respect (and respect) means nothing to you.

I understand this sentiment, but at the same point it is extremely difficult when someone is saying something akin to *hey, you know that thing that is at the core of your being and the most important part of your life? It's terrible and you need to change it*. I'm not sure how a relationship can work with that kind of energy. </TEXT>

It's great to have confidence like what you've expressed, but becoming a truly great teacher takes lots of time and experience. Try to keep your expectations high but also realistic!

Good luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's really cool to hear about your priest. We became close colleagues as we work at the same place. We just naturally had a great rapport with each other, enjoyed each other's company and conversation, and seemed to be on the same wavelength with a lot of different things - mind you, she was much more moderate in her beliefs then. There was just a great platonic chemistry we had with each other. We've also been strong support systems to one another in various things, and that's drawn us closer to. We've felt like sisters to one another, albeit sisters who don't exactly have that much in common on paper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the challenging bit here is that evangelical Christians feel like if they don't proseltize then they're letting you down as a friend by not "saving your soul."

From a purely philosophical perspective, trying to prevent a friend's soul from burning in eternal fire is in a weird way both noble and understandable. If someone is about to be hit by a bus, you try to save them. Just because they say "There's no bus! I'm fine!" you are behaving unethically in just shrugging and saying "welp, guess they'll just have to wait and see." So this aspect of evangelising I understand from that angle and a small part of me is grateful and touched... but I still can't actually tolerate it anymore on a personal level.

	<TEXT> I really like the way you've outlined this.

I've been taught to stick to one mantra for meditation specifically, and to never change it. I tentatively recommend that to others, too, and have found that aspect of my meditation practise to have been very helpful in helping me to focus and easily enter into that type of communion. That said, I chant and occasionally pray to many deities, though I have always found the energy and intention in kirtan vs meditation to be quite different. When chanting, I have found it, in intention and practise, much more akin to prayer with meditative characteristics. </TEXT>

 I think this might be her way of reaching out to you for help.

This is all really insightful. I hadn't thought of it this way. Thank you.

	<TEXT> The hairiness you mention is pretty real! I do view my own personal yoga practise as a religious kind of practise, though I'm fully aware that most modern yogis can divorce the religious/spiritual roots of it and focus solely on the physical activity. When you live and study at a place like the Ashram I lived at, the practises (meditation, chanting, pranayama, yoga asanas, etc.) all becomes kind of one thing. So when I lived there I had a some religious experiences, some of which I told her about - in hindsight, probably ill-advisedly. Now she, perhaps rightly, conflates the practise of yoga and Hinduism, based on what I've told her about my own experiences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Has she been through a recent trauma?

Sort of. She's married to a man that she is thinking of divorcing, and is in love with another man who is ill with some unspecified illness, which she is convinced is cancer and that he will die in a few months. This has taken a very strong toll on her emotionally, and she's struggling **a lot** with the thought of him dying, and her own moral conflict over having an affair with him (which has since ended).

	<TEXT>  Have you explained to her that she is just pushing you away, that you are not going to change your spiritual path?

I have tried to, but it may not have been with that kind of wording. I have tried to avoid telling her things like she's pushed me away, as I don't want to place blame and wanted to keep the focus more on what *I* need, if you know what I mean. I've perhaps not been direct enough in expressing how I'm not going to change my path, as I have said (and believe) that Christ was a divine figure, and she has interpreted that as an "in", or a sign I'm open to re-converting. I may have to be more direct. </TEXT>

She would react the same way I have, though likely aggressively and more dramatically.

	<TEXT> Im hoping for a little bit of insight and/or advice on a tricky situation Im in right now.

As background: For the past ~8 years, I have devoted a lot of energy into the study and practise of Buddhism, Hinduism, meditation, and yoga. Spiritually, my beliefs are a bit of a combination of Hinduism and Buddhism, and my core spiritual practise is classical hatha yoga and Vipassana meditation. I lived at a yoga Ashram for a year, and have served/studied at various Vipassana meditation centres. This has been a huge part of my life in recent years.

A very good friend of mine is a devout Christian, of the fundamentalist variety. Like me, she came to her spiritual beliefs later in life, several years ago. We used to discuss religion and spirituality but eventually it became too awkward as we disagreed on so many points. Last spring she also expressed grave concern for my soul, how she thinks through yoga and meditating Im opening myself up to demonic influence and since then I have tried to avoid those conversations with her since then.

Of late, she started sending me lots of articles and videos discussing various aspects of Christianity, including some texts attempting to show how science has proven Christianity to be the one true religion.. stuff like that. I asked her to please not send me those things anymore, and was happy and satisfied with my current beliefs and practises.

Her response was a little aggressive, and she began expressing how dangerous and evil the practise of yoga and meditation is, how Hinduism is a delusion created by Satan, etc. I told her I was very uncomfortable with her saying these kinds of things, and that though I am happy to be friends with someone with differing beliefs, I would have to step away from a relationship with someone who continued to disrespect my beliefs/practises in that kind of way. She said she would need time to think about that. I asked if we could talk about it more and she said shed need weeks to really think about it.

Am I being too hasty in reacting this kind of way? Should a yogi or serious meditator tolerate/accept continued proselytizing and the like? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so. I've been teaching for almost 10 years, and subbed for a full year at the start. A sub does NOT disregard a teacher's lesson plan without an EXTREMELY good reason. Because some of the students had read the novel whose film they were going to watch does NOT qualify. You tread carefully, especially as a new sub - even moreso with an explicit story. Yes, teachers veer off the curriculum, but it's the classroom teacher who makes those calls, framing such diversions how they see fit, not some sub the 2nd day on the job. If I were that classroom teacher, I would be livid. u/portland_princess is on point. </TEXT>
