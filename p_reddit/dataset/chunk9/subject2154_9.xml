	<TEXT> There's been a number of articles lately that mention him.  Here is one from the 10th.

[April 10th LJS](http://journalstar.com/sports/huskers/football/red-report-armstrong-says-teammates-were-his-backbone-after-iowa/article_f51af83c-1dce-5556-8ff1-26df31ef21a4.html):

The return to full strength won't be as quick for De'Mornay Pierson-El (fractured left leg), but Williams is encouraged on that front, too.

He expects Pierson-El to be back in the summer. "It won't be, like, August," the coach said. "It's how hard you would think it would be, it's tough. But you just keep on working. He's not going to feel good about it. But he understands it's a process. And in situations like that, you get small victories from feeling a little stronger every day."

  There was also one recently that said he should take a redshirt and sit the year:

[Athlon Sports Article](http://athlonsports.com/college-football/nebraskas-demornay-pierson-els-best-option-different-red-shirt-2016#sthash.n6Es4CNh.gbpl st_refDomain=www.facebook.com st_refQuery=/)

  If you search the LJS or OWH site for "De'Mornay Pierson-El" there are a few others articles.  Hopefully this gets you what you were looking/hoping for.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only just discovered this amazing artist a year and a half ago.   As I am originally from Illinois, it was pretty funny (to me) that it was the Illinoise album that I first came across and got me hooked.  When I heard a few tracks I said, why am I only just discovering this now!?  I only have Illinoise on vinyl (gift from my thoughtful wife probably so I'd stop playing it in the car all the time) but I want to get the others as well.  Thanks for sharing more details on the albums and more back story on him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would suggest, perhaps, that you approach this in another way.  Instead of "forcing" you could instead encourage folks to volunteer.  For example, one of my former employers would donate $150 to a charity of my choice if I volunteered at least 10 hours per quarter.  This had to be tracked but it did encourage me to find ways to volunteer when I otherwise may not have.  I also then got to donate $600 a year to a local charity so it was a definitely a win-win.

Also, one of my former clients, a children's dental office, took a totally different approach.  Each year, they close their office for a week and spend that time in a village in Central or South America, doing free dental work for children.  The doctor would take care of all the expenses and paid the staff as she normally would, but they got to spend a week "volunteering" so to speak.  It was not only a wonderful, charitable act, but it was a great way for the staff to bond.

There is a whole volunteering subreddit that could offer other suggestions as well, I imagine.  Best of luck to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will get buried but my very first job was when I was 14.  It is common for kids in the midwest to get jobs [detassling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detasseling).  I am the oldest kid in the family and was very naive.  My parents dropped me off where the bus was to pick us up.  I had a small cooler with my lunch and water.  Im standing there, all doey eyed, not sure what to expect.  Then here comes this jacked up blue ford pickup, tearing through the parking lot.  The truck roars to a stop, then backs up...into a light pole.  The door rips open and out pops the most fouled mouth woman I've ever met to this day.  *WHAT THE FUCK! GOD DAMN MOTHER FUCKER!*  She then looks over at us like fresh meat.  She is what they call, a straw boss.  Someone who has done this for a number of years and is deemed worthy of having a leadership role.  *ANY OF YOU LITTLE FUCKERS FUCK WITH ME TODAY AND I'LL FIRE YOUR ASSES!*  So yeah, I was fucking scared.  I thought this was a job for kids, not the Marines.  

Anyways, they shuffle us onto an old yellow school bus and haul us out to a corn field where we were trained by this same lovely screaming mess pull these tassels out of the top of corn stalks.  I just didn't get it at first, which frustrated the foul mouthed beast, so she fired me.  I was there maybe two hours, fired.  I was told to go sit on the bus.  I made the long trip back where I met several other young-lings who also pissed her off one way or the other.  All fired.  I climb into the bus (boiling mid-July temperature mind you) to then find that my cooler (lunch, water, snack) had been raided by the other straw bosses.  All my food and water gone.  The same with most of the kids.  As I sat there the rest of the day, sweating my ass off, no food or drink, I watched as more and more kids made their way back.  She fired 11 kids in total that day.  I heard later she fired 8 more the next day and was then terminated herself.  

It worked out for the best.  I got a job a few days later walking beans (pulling weeds in bean fields) for a local farmer.  I got paid a bit more, the work was less grueling and the farmers wife made the best home cooked lunches for us.  I'll never forget how kind and nice they were. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to be ambigious for a reason so I apologize for some generalizations.  My wife is friends with a teacher here in Lincoln.  She said that the Superintendent had visited their school recently and school expansion was discussed to some extent.  Specifically, due to the population boom on the NW side of town, Arnold is already over capacity (just opened 7 years ago) and they considering a number of approaches to address the boom including building an additional grade school out there.  They could be considering doing what some schools in larger cities have done, where that they split grade school into two halves, k-2 in one school and then 3-5 in another.  Maybe this is what mr guitarist means, i.e., they are considering some different ways to address the student population growth but nothing has been officially proposed, so to speak.  I certainly could have heard wrong but that's the word through the grape vine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw this comment and just wanted to take a moment and say thank you.  I've never seen or read your comic but there are countless "comic families" (as I like to call us) that need/want more of these types of titles.  My wife and I take our three kids to "cons" and we spend most of our time talking to independent writers/artists, especially those produce great works that we can share with our kids.  It is a family hobby and we actively seek out new books to read with our kids.

Second, thank you for doing something you enjoy and are passionate about.  That is sometimes hard to do so great job!  

I've liked your facebook page, hope to hear more about your work and maybe we will see you at a show down the road. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can appreciate the frustration.  Our youngest of 3 is five years old and these sort of battles will come up from time to time.  All grandparents are different and typically there is a change in parenting styles between your first child and your second or third, for example.  At least there was for my wife and I and many of our friends.  And the grandparents are at that point already plus, they forget the trouble and mayhem it can cause when they don't adhere to reasonable guidelines for food, bedtime and so forth.  It's the ole, we did "X" when we were parents and you survived.  Uggg, I hate that saying.  Anyways, the bottom line is they get to have all the fun and then you have to deal with the fallout.

I quite literally have the best father-in-law one could ever dream of.  He is amazing.  However, when our oldest, my son, was going to spend the weekend with him a few years ago, we warned and begged him not to fill him with fast food and ice cream.  My son has to have a well balanced diet or he will get sick and constipated.  He thought we were being a little over dramatic and didn't heed our warnings.  After a day which included three fast food visits and candy from a parade, he ended up with a kid who had a stomach ache all night long and through the entire next day.  It ruined their fun weekend and he felt terrible about it.  I guess he had to go through all of that before he remembered that parents sometimes know best.

Grandparents get wrapped up in creating moments and memories and they forget how hard it is at times when they don't have to deal with the after effects.  All you can do is be honest and say, I know you want to stay up late and have fun, but it will take me two weeks to get them back on schedule and that one night of fun will create two weeks of agony for me.  I'd appreciate if you can help me out by doing x, y and z.  Or, I know its fun to give them sweets but I've already been struggling to get them to eat their normal food, now it could be even harder.  If you can help me on this, I would appreciate it!

At the end of the day.  They are the grandparents and you want them to create those great memories but there's no harm in explaining why you don't want to do certain things.  I have even had to tell my Dad, I'm sorry you disagree with me on this but if my doctor says we should do this, I think I am going to side with her this one time (eye roll).

Just don't be over dramatic b/c they won't hear the message.  Just be honest and fair and things will probably work out fine.  If they don't...well...welcome to parenthood where everyone else knows better than you... :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great question.  Although I read some comics as a kid, I just couldn't afford them so now, as an adult, I am finally able to enjoy them.  It is pretty overwhelming to walk into a comic store and know where to start, and I even have this very question about Vision on my list.  What I have been doing is going to my local comic book store and saying, I am interested in such and such, where is a good place to start or what are some great reads with that character.  They usually give me a handful of recommendations and then I work my way through the list.  My wife and kids have even gotten into it too.  She spends more now than I ever have.

BTW, thanks to everyone who have made suggestions here, I will check them out as well.  You all rock! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree.  One of my favorite moments from the Justice League Unlimited series is when Superman fights Dark Seid and he talks about how he can finally let loose.

Superman:  "That man (Batman) won't quit as long as he can still draw a breath. None of my teammates will. Me? I've got a different problem. I feel like I live in a world made of cardboard. Always taking constant care not to break something. To break someone. Never allowing myself to lose control, even for a moment, or someone could die."
[Darkseid tries to attack, but Superman knocks him back]
Superman: "But you can take it, can't ya, big man? What we have here is a rare opportunity for me to cut loose, and show you just how powerful I really am!"

I think they missed a really interesting opportunity.  At the end of the day, and I am probably in the minority, but I wish they would have gone along those lines with the character.  There are a million ways to tell a story and this is their way, what ya gonna do?  shrug </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They did something along these lines with their DC Showcase animated films.  It had Jonah Hex, The Spectre, Green Arrow, etc.  I loved them and thought they should stick a live action one in front of any future films.  Sort of like how Pixar/Disney does it, where you will typically see a short animated movie before the main attraction.  

I'd like to see them focus on characters you'd never likely see in a regular film.  I think it would be an amazing opportunity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   I'd probably have to say it was when I saw "Brad" at the Ranch Bowl in Omaha back in the late 90s.  I had been a huge fan for years and was incredibly excited to see them.  I had no idea what to expect.
  Myself and 4 other friends drove up there from Lincoln.  When we got to the show, we were shocked to only find about 5 other people there.  Funny thing was, they were there from Minneapolis (I think) to see the opening band and never heard of Brad before.  :)

  Just before Brad played, my buddy and I waited outside their bus and when Stone stepped out, we visited with him briefly, thanking him for all the years of great music.  He signed some green river and mother love bone stuff for my friend before dashing in for the show.  

  He and his band mates then treated us to probably the best show I've ever seen.  Since there were literally 5 of us there to see one of my favorite bands, it was like it was our own personal show.  One of my favorite moments was when the rest of the band took a smoke break, Shawn Smith played Benny and the Jets.  It was surreal.

  After the show, we drove down the street to Perkins for some food and to take a moment for it all to soak in.  We were dumbstruck with the experience we just had.  

  While waiting for our food we look up and here comes their tour bus...parking right outside.  Then, in strolls Stone Gossard and Shawn Smith and place some orders to go.  My friend and I got up the courage to go over and visit with them.

 We then sat and talked with them in the lobby of Perkins for about 15 minutes about god knows what b/c we were so star struck.  It was an incredible night and I'm so thankful I got the opportunity to say thanks to one of my favorite musicians and that I got to share that with some very close friends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One kid decommited and you said the honey moon stage was over.  A bit dramatic wouldnt you say?  And I'm not seeing anyone else (on here at least) share this opinion.  Looking on Huskermax, people seem pretty excited but I guess if we have fans that are already throwing in the towel, then that's pretty shitty.

Another kid chose Rutgers and you took that as a strike against Riley.  He was from New Jersey.

I just said I think he did a great job given the circumstances, provided data to substantiate that and said I think he will be a successful recruiter based on history and other coaches opinion.

You are welcome to your opinion obviously but if you are going to toss it on Reddit, you should expect it to be scrutinized. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wisconsin, although they went through a change too, hired a coach who was there before as a coordinator.  They had a handful of decommits and last I looked, were behind us in ranking.

I'm sure there is a site that has coach change/recruiting rank listed but I dont have the time to find or make one.  I do know we are one of the top ranked classes who have gone through this change.  

Mike Reilly was considered, by PAC 12 coaches, to be far and above the best evaluater of talent in that conference.  He is going to be successful but we can't blow a gasket when a teenager changes his mind.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever read.  

Sykes misled everyone, including his HS coach who was handling his recruiting, what more do you want Riley to do when a kid says he's coming and even yesterday afternoon said he was all N.  Ask him to pinky swear?

And who chooses Rutgers over Nebraska?  How about a kid from New Jersey who said, now my family can watch me play every weekend.  Jesus H Christ.  

Riley beat Harbaugh on 2 out of 3.  The two that decommited before Sykes were already rumored to be on the fence before Pelini even left.  Hell Bussey just flipped AGAIN.  

Typically when there is a coach change, there is a hellava lot more turmoil.  He's kept the class intact, brought in some real gems and is doing better than a vast majority of the schools that had a coaching change.  Michigan, who most people feel had one of the best hires, is currently sitting at 55th in the recruiting rankings per 247.  We are at 30th, based on average star ranking [LINK](http://247sports.com/Season/2015-Football/CompositeTeamRankings).  Rivals has us at 33 and Michigan at 67 [LINK](http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaa/football/recruiting/teamrank/2015/all/all).  Those numbers could change, but I think he did an amazing job given the situation.  

Plus he is already working on the next two classes.  He offered a kid for the 2017 class.  He is even going to have someone on staff that is dedicated to recruiting walk-ons.  I think he is going to surprise a lot of folks.  And if I'm wrong, I'm wrong.  I'm certainly not going to throw a public temper tantrum.

	<TEXT> that is a bit of an outrageous statement.  I paid for a game that had a specified release timeline and nothing has been delivered.  The former community manager got admin rights to this subreddit then started banning people who asked legit questions which in turn made a lot of folks around here (like me) very angry and frustrated.

I gave Sauropod Studio money on July 29th, 2012 for a game for which the beta was to be delivered several months later.   This is now 2015 and I'd hardly call what we have today an alpha.  It's at best a tech demo.  So yeah, I am a bit peeved but look, like I've said a 1000000000 times on here and even to the Devs, we all make mistakes.  What has pissed me off is how they have handled every single one of those.  They treat the community poorly unless you kiss ass, the LACK of any substantial info/updates and the general 'meh' attitude.  I don't give two shits if they don't like it.  I am not a mindless ass-kisser.  I want to know what the fuck they are doing.  They said "we will give you a product if you give us money".  I held up my end of the bargain nearly 31 months ago.  And you can't call a flurry of "updates" through the month of December (to increase the total # of updates) anything resembling communication, but its certainly a start.

  You can feel free to defend these folks to the end of time, but dont you dare call me a baby b/c I paid for something and I'm asking for them to actually produce it.  Do you want to send me some money?  I'll give you what they gave me, a big turd of nothing but I won't waste 31 months producing it.  Next day delivery guaranteed, just give me 15 minutes to get it into a box.

  If their Kick Starter ad said, "Hey, we are Sauropod Studios...um we don't know a frigging thing about game development and will treat you like shit once we have your money" then I wouldn't have invested.  Instead, it looked promising and I'd much rather give money to a small dev to make a great little game then to buy BattleField 7, expansion pack 14.  Every other game I've backed has had delays, but they've always communicated, apologized and explained, but in the mean time we've had something to play.  They treated us right, like the investors we are, and understood the importance of a strong community behind you.

  I hope these chaps turn things around but this once a month "reddit shamming" by some Sauropod Studio white knight is getting old.  We have a right to be frustrated.

	<TEXT> That's interesting as when they were released it did not support this.  When I read this comment I thought it, well my tv has does support HDMI 1.4 (I believe off the top of my head) and so I started digging, I am unable to find anything on the Google site that says it is supported and an article from Anantech, back when this product was released, clearly states it does not.

*In fact, the Chromecasts form factor is already a popular one for Android-powered HDMI dongles and Miracast sinks, as well as a variety of other small appliances. Ive confirmed with Google that MHL-HDMI is not in fact supported by the Chromecast, meaning it cant be powered by a TV that includes the spec (which can deliver up to 500 mA at 5 V),*

[LINK](http://www.anandtech.com/show/7186/google-chromecast-review-an-awesome-35-hdmi-dongle)

  [This](https://support.google.com/chromecast/answer/3212934?hl=en ref_topic=3058948) Chromecast "setup" page doesn't mention it either.

  Please dont take this as me saying you are wrong, more...is there a new revision or can you point me to something that say it works.  I could just be wrong about my TV, just havent given it much thought as I just plug it into the USB port.  Just interested in reading more about it but maybe my Google-fu sucks balls today.

-edited to add some info I found but then found another post that debunked it so I removed it.  I'll wait to hear a response from someone. </TEXT>
