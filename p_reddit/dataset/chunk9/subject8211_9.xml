	<TEXT> God forbid the director of the fun for an entire group of people have to put in work to be good at it.  
God forbid he becomes uncomfortable when made aware of a mistake he made.

Being a good DM requires EFFORT. You can get away with less, but the game will suffer. Prospective DMs don't need to be coddled lest they give up, they don't need their precious feelings protected.

The only thing I agree with is that the article shouldn't be taken as an absolute truth. It does come off as a bit "one-true-way"-ist. There are other styles that work, but for the type of game he is looking to create(immersion-heavy), this is really all the correct advice. </TEXT>

As kingpin said, *"[people want to] do as little as they can possibly get away with [...]"*. Most players primary motivations are having fun and relaxing. Getting into character exceptionally rarely factors into that.

On a related note, the one example, the poster child of what a LG paladin should be, that I've encountered recently, is Dresden Files' Michael Carpenter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think of a few actors and create conflicts. I find it's amazing how quickly details start to emerge once you have some kind of conflict in play.

Like maybe the church and the local merchant's guild. Say the guild bought a highly sought after property right from under the churches nose. Maybe they wanted to build a temple or it was sacred ground. Maybe now undead have been sighted around that area. And maybe the church refuses to help until they are given that land back. Cuz even holy people can be petty like that. But the merchant guild refuses to yield.

There you go... a couple actors, a conflict forcing both sides to interact and you've got a compelling story.

Another option is to come up with random unrelated details, then ask why and how those details came to be the way they are. </TEXT>

**THE** Demogorgon.

It's a demon lord. It's *THE* demon lord. The prince of demons. Only Graz'zt could even give him a run for his money. I'd say L30. Minimum.  
Engaging him on a battlefield not of his choosing, without tons of backup and minions would be doing the Prince of Demons a terrible disservice.


Random note: The old dragon magazines published the Demonomicon of Iggwilv. The articles were pretty great. Demogorgon is in #357. He was CR33 there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **It is the only type of balance that IS important.**

The more unbalanced the party, the harder your job as a DM. So it isn't strictly critical, but it does make the DM's job exponentially more difficult for creating situations in which everyone is having fun. It is possible for that difficulty to *rise into the impossible*.

***
*However party balance isn't what anyone, including OP is talking about ITT.* You're all talking about world balance and that is much less of a problem. The DM can always adjust the world to suit a balanced party. It only becomes difficult when adjusting for one part of the party makes things worse for another. Hence the importance of inter-party balance. A party of fighters is one of the easiest parties to work with because, being the same, their capabilities are by definition balanced. </TEXT>

I'd have to say classic fantasy and pin-up art. The likes of Vallejo, Frazetta, Bell, Caldwell, Eggleton, and well... many others.

	<TEXT> It's kind of a pet peeve of mine how many worlds end up human dominant just because it's the lazy, automatic assumption or because the DM is uncomfortable with a more monstrous world. It's the reason why I had to create one of my own.

Super happy you're trying to change that. Good ideas too. Though I wouldn't go so far as to call elves "completely different creatures". One definition of a single species we have IRL is if the creatures can mate with each other.

One option is that people can think, and are able to pay heed, venerate or even worship the forest. Have you heard of genuis loci? Maybe the forests have some form of rudimentary intelligence.  
Besides, the chief cause of death among animals is predation or accidents, not death of old age. Circle of life kind of thing. Maybe your animals are long-lived too, but don't get the chance. I mean what do you think sustains the monstrous ecology of a D D world?

Maybe there are even ancient specimens that have attained sentience and hold the wisdom of the ages and act as protectors of the forest and its denizens.

Real world mythologies are of great help in WB - a) you already know they resonate with people(they've survived through the ages); b) there are a vast number of obscure and incredibly interesting ideas(especially as it relates to a western culture). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well... I'm in a similar situation.

Party ended up choosing the archipelago "caribbean" region to start in and going for the pirate theme. They want guns. I had considered guns, but it's one of only a couple of pieces of outstanding content I hadn't fleshed out the rules for... What are the chances(100%, I'm sure some of you would say).

In any case, there is a big difference between medieval weapons and modern firearms. Do not base your impressions of guns on the latter. Medieval guns were scarcely more than a large single-shot boomstick that barely did anything more than produce lots of smoke.

The reason firearms took over is because of ease of use. There's a saying - if you want to train a longbowman, start with his father. The ability of simple peasants to be marginally effective with a gun is what gave rise to firearms in the middle ages. A trained longbowman is substantially more lethal than a peasant with a gun. But peasants are a dime a dozen.

D D has magic. Against which medieval-technology guns are pitiful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Second that. Grey elves get +Int and +Dex so you can easily go Weapon Finesse and still consistently deal craploads of damage with your maneuvers. A level of psion is generally not a bad idea as you can get a psicrystal for more +Conc and a bunch of neat powers that synergize well with you such as Inertial Armor, Force screen, Synchronicity or Entangling Ectoplasm.  
With the DMs permission you can even potentially combine the psycrystal and the blade guide in some form. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a very satisfying moment once...
We were on our way to investigate some demonic activity. Got ambushed. By two big scary demons. The rest of the party was barely holding their weight against one of them(one PC got knocked down). I kept the other one busy. He was apparently very friendly. All he wanted to do was hug me. I got dragged down to hell. Thankfully we had a powerful artifact that granted a few lives. I got resurrected, a short while later we raided the sort-of-beachhead demons were trying to establish. Guess who was there? My old friend. Let out a beastly roar and charged. Luck smiled on me and I promptly mopped the floor with him. Like literally filleted him.  Single-handedly annihilating something that was capable of challenging the entire party alone was neato. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know how the quality of the villain often reflects the quality of the movie? It's the same in D D, the quality the player is reflected in his evil characters.

That's because playing a great villain draws so much from the skillset that makes one a great player/actor, that even small oversights or shortcomings are brought to light. A vanishingly small number of people possess that skill, both among actors and among D D players. Many, many more just like the idea of playing an evil character without the necessary expertise. Movies have casting directors... DMs rarely take on that role. Hence the proliferation of the murderhobo evil PC(not even cartoon villain, as *even they* still tend to follow some basic set of rules). </TEXT>
