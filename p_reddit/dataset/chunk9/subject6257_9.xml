	<TEXT> How would goku's new form (the one in the opening) work with kaioken? Would he able to use kaioken? I mean like would that new form use god Ki? (If he uses god ki, god ki = Ki control and a calm mind) so will he be able to use it?

Will Vegeta reach that form too? They always leave vegeta behind ;-; </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think i read somewhere that the author wants to only have 6 seasons (anime wise)...so it's probably going to be rushed, but if the author doesn't want that i hope they'll make season 4, 5 and 6 24 episodes per season (if it's really true that he wants 3 more seasons, total 6 seasons, yeah the we just have to cross our fingers lol for 24 episodes per season)

Also borN's adaption was shitty, they should've never did the last 3 episodes as anime original but whatever lol. </TEXT>

Probably my favorite of all the manga's/anime i read/watched (i mean like i've read/watched ALOT i mean ALOT of series...People maybe be thinking danmachi is a typical story like a copy of SAO and other series but it isn't..it's very unique imo. </TEXT>
