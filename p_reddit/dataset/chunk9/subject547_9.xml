	<TEXT> Alot of people watch it with subtitles so they can understand better when they throw in storyline. Remember rick saying that they're stupid right? I think that the zigerions arent cometent and did it because they're bad at their job?
Yea it was because the zigerions are incompetent and don't know much about earth. Remember the simulation having sloppy details </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Somehow accidentaly jerry and purposly rick. They explain this throughout the episode. How many times have you watched it? Have you read the subtitles the first time?
Sorry i'm in a little rush, i didnt answer. They wanted the concentrated dark matter formula, that's how rick blew them up. He faked the recipe for it and it made them all die and he was like. Yeah jerry. They were sooo smart back there </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure that "compromised" does NOT mean broken. If this is the case, in which it is. The portal gun was still in rick's presence on gazorazorp thus resulting in it needing to be fixed, not taken by the council of ricks like in the premire. Only rick is the supreeme being and deserves the rigjt and benifet of the doubt to use such a device. So they only want it broken or confiscated if a simpleton has it. Like bob your friend with absolute average capabilities </TEXT>

defense just stay in the room unless you hear thump thump thump unless the obj is going down.
Do this untill you figuire out exactly what you're doing and only play casual untill you really memorized the maps and camera locations(espesially on the outside of the map). 

Have fun and don't forget that it's a team game that is much harder on your own, so try playimg with a full team and then when you're comfortable, go into ranked with that team. </TEXT>
