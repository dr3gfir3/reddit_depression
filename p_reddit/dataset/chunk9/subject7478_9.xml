	<TEXT> Some of you have probably noticed some of the unique covers I have been doing. I know they aren't to everyone's taste, but I have been having fun with them and am trying to improve as I go.

I want to do something a little more ambitious with my next video. I'd like to do a rundown/Mashup of Saturday morning cartoons, and I am wondering what you guys would like to see. 

Hopefully I can take some suggestions and combine it with some of my own and put out something that is fast moving and fun! </TEXT>
