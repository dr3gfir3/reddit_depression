	<TEXT> Here is a map: http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/

The scale is pretty coarse, however you can see that 1m wouldn't do a lot, in an average sense, however it would make a huge difference to damage during storm surges or high winds. 

Most/all properties would be high enough, however a lot of roads would probably need to be raised or redirected - otherwise they would be inundated by tidal flooding.

At 20m sea level rise I will have a waterfront property :). I guess my home site is future proofed.  </TEXT>
