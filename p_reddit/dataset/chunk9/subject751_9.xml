	<TEXT> What if Jasper is referring to the diamond as a symbol of status? Like a badge or title: "What you did to your (badge/title)." Maybe she doffed it in favor of something she wasn't supposed to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I kind of imagine that Rose chose not to be Pink Diamond anymore, since she believed in the importance of life and individuality.

e.g. "to reshape yourself" is a disgrace; "what you did to my diamond."

What Rose did to Pink diamond was destroy her, but more in a figurative sense. </TEXT>
