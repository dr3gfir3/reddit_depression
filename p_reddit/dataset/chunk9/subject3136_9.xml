	<TEXT> I appreciate your reply but I'm a little confused. Cervical cancer is not an STI. It is cancer. And yes he did follow through. He gave her the house we lived in, which is paid off, continued to pay all of her bills despite not having settled anything in court, etc. she did not have a job, and so he continued to provide for her. As for him confiding in me, no. I was 16, why would he share his marriage troubles with me? But I also wasn't stupid and could see what was going on.  </TEXT>
