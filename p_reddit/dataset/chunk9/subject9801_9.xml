	<TITLE> The narrative many TBMs embrace is that many of Joseph Smith's polygamous marriages were sexless. I call bullshit. Brigham Young and JS both took dozens of wives, some mere teenagers. Brigham Young had children with many of his wives. If BY was banging all his wives, JS likely was, too. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Brigham Young and Joseph Smith were both leaders in the early church, and both practiced polygamy. 

A lot of TBM's will attempt to rationalize Smith's polygamy and his marriage to 14 year old girls by attempting to argue that Joseph smith didn't have sex with all his wives, and certainly not the teenage ones. 

Problem being? Brigham Young [fathered children](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Brigham_Young's_wives) with many of his plural wives, **even the teenage ones.** See Clarissa Caroline Decker. 

If Joseph smith and Brigham Young were both receiving revelation from god, and were both practicing plural marriage, why the hell would Brigham get to have sex with his wives and Joseph not? 

My message to the church and members: Quit with the mental gymnastics and just admit that Joseph banged all his wives. These attempts at denial are truly pathetic.  </TEXT>

They believe that humans are awful and that religion provides the only solution to that vile human nature..... yet they are surprised when sick fucks end up next to them in the church pew on Sunday?

Christians believe in the rapture, and that Jesus is going to return for all his people.

How is it that millions of people around the world, even in different religions and cultures, are convinced that men who lived thousands and thousands of years ago are going to return and save us all?

	<TEXT> In 1850, you could marry 40 women and black people couldn't get baptized. All because of who the prophet was and what time period it was.

Now, with different prophets and apostles and 150 years later, black people are welcomed and marriage is solely one man and one woman (according to the church).

What changed? It seems that those beliefs are relative to who the prophet is and what time period it is, not absolute because "God."

Any time a TBM tells me that the church rejects moral relativism I absolutely fucking face palm. 

Members and church leaders can say all they want that "God doesn't change his mind," but the history of Mormon beliefs PROVE that either 1. God changes his mind a lot, or 2. the Mormon Prophet and his apostles aren't truly led by an unchanging, infallible God... they are just making decisions based on what they think is best, or based on their own preconceived notions of how things should be.

	<TITLE> I am baffled when Christians ask me how atheists can have morals without religion. Their entire religion is based on the premise that a mere belief in God and repentance exonerates rape, murder, etc. and allows the wicked into Heaven, yet the moral code of an atheist is somehow more flawed? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-21 15:05:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Time and time again, I have been asked by my friends who have faith what prevents an atheist from committing various offenses from rape to murder to thievery if they do not have a moral code grounded in a belief in a higher power, eternal life, the punishment of hell, etc. 

Logically, if you turn the tables, it is actually the theist (in this particular case the Christian) who has very little stopping them from committing various offenses.

For example, according to the Christian, you can murder, rape, pillage, steal, commit genocide.... but if you ask sweet baby Jesus to come into your little bitty heart and save you, all your evil sins are wiped away and you will live in forever happiness in Heaven. 

Yet the atheists are somehow more likely to rape and pillage because they *don't* believe that they can be magically forgiven and exonerated for any terrible act? Please.


**EDIT:** I understand this point of view is espoused by various belief systems, not just Christianity. I also understand that not all Christians think that atheists cannot possibly be moral. Where I live, I don't encounter many Hindus or Muslims, so evangelicals in particular tend to get my goat more than others.
