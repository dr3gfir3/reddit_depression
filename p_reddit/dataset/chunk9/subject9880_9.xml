	<TEXT> I would have connected this series to Slough, but the mushrooms are acting in wildly differing ways from person to person. Whereas in Slough, all of the villagers seemed to act pretty similarly. and even then, there are differences in what is happening to the people, in Slough didn't they have a a giant pain orgy? Or that might have been the butterfly one xD

	<TEXT> This is so weird, you're a murderer but you refer to it as a profession. But you aren't a hit man.

You want to save the girl, in order to kill her. 

You want to remove murder enablers, but you are a murderer.

You hang out with other murderers, to get info but you can't trust them and they are somehow worse people than you. If you can't trust them, why would they give you any good info? 

You're super smart at noticing cops, details etc. But you make odd, seemingly silly choices like walking around with a missing girls dog, sitting near undercover cops while talking about murder and then drawing attention by threatening your 'mate'.

It's like you can't decide where you want this tale to go. </TEXT>
