	<TEXT> One of my favorite segments whenever a stand-up hosts is the monologue, since otherwise they are usually a:

1. Musical monologue
2. Interrupted by the cast who are doing impressions of the host/characters they've played before
3. Q A by the cast in the audience

They haven't been bad this season, though. The only monologues I don't remember at all are Emily Blunt's and Benedict Cumberbatch's. 

Anyway, it's refreshing to have a host just be themselves and entertain the audience for several minutes.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think he's famous enough to get the chance to host in a character-actor-JK- Simmons kind of way. I mention March specifically because he has CHIPS comes out in late March and he'd have something to promote. Plus, it'd be nice to have someone of Mexican-descent do an impression of Mexico's president Enrique Pena Nieto since he has become under fire for meeting with Trump (Armisen could probably do it too though.) 

He did criticize SNL for letting Trump host awhile back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Master of None parody where he plays Bobby Jindal**

Leslie as Denise. Melissa as Rachel. Pete/Alex/Mikey as Arnold.

**Good Morning Miami!**

**Millennial Concert Promoters**

Two millennials (Pete and Aziz), in desperate search for work, go around promoting the musical acts for Trump's inauguration. 

**Allied parody**
Beck plays a Bond type of spy and Cecily plays a Bond girl, where they mist rendezvous in order to share information. They meet up at a club where Aziz is doing standup. Aziz decides to do crowd work and picks the two of them, constantly interrupting them.

	<TEXT> It got Best Picture because:

Room: Too small to win

Bridge of Spies: Nomination was more of a sign of respect to Spielberg and Hanks

Brooklyn: Not enough love in other categories

The Martian: No way was a sci-fi movie going to win

Mad Max: Fury Road: Amazing film, but it was more of a technical marvel in their eyes.

The Revenant: Too violent and polarizing. Inarritu had also recently won for Birdman.

The Big Short: Too comedic

Hence, Spotlight. But I agree. I'm not a big fan of the movie and it bored the hell out of me at many points.   </TEXT>
