	<TEXT>  These have nothing to do with the theory of evolution, other than people being aware humans have similar forms to primates.

Creatures turning into other creatures is a form of evolution - OP was asking about precursors, not literally Darwin's exact theory.

Also there is no Genesis Rabbah 23:9 (at least in the standard editions).

It's a typo, should be 23:6. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you have limited resources, the theory is that you devote them to the bottom of the hierarchy, when you have more, you distribute them throughout and up the hierarchy.

This I can agree with. It's subtly different than what OP was asking, which seemed to imply a distinct divide between the classes' donations, when in fact, the rich donate to everything, and it's their money that keeps all charitable organizations afloat. The lower and middle classes' donations are peanuts in comparison. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even back in the day people noticed the resemblance being humans and monkeys and sought to explain it.

The Talmud (Berachot 59b) says: If you see a monkey you make the blessing He who changed the creations. The commentators ask: what change was made to creation pertaining to monkeys? The Kabbalist Rabbi Meshulam answers that in the time of the great flood G-d punished some of the people and turned them to monkeys (and elephants). So that is why monkeys look like people because they were once people! This also explains the superior intelligence that monkeys (and Elephants) have over the rest of the animal kingdom.

The Midrash Rabbah (Genesis 23, 9) says: Four things changed in the times of Enosh:   one, the mountains became rocky, two, the deceased began to rot, three, peoples faces became similar to those of apes, and four, people became susceptible to demons.
In Sanhedrin (109a) it says about the generation of the Tower of Babel one third of the people wanted to wage war against G-d and He turned them into monkeys,

	<TEXT> but I suspect more people associate Daati Le'umi than Chardal with the phrase "Religious Zionist".

Could be. I often have opinions that nobody else shares.

Over Pesach I heard a speech that mentioned that ROY gave a heter to give away Gaza but once he saw that it didn't accomplish what they said it would accomplish, he rescinded the heter. So that's also why I don't think I'm an RZ. Because in the end, rabbis don't know any better about politics than anybody else. Give a heter, don't give a heter, it just doesn't matter. Reality will do what it wants regardless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No worries!

Before Chardal was a thing, Dati Leumi = "religious Zionist." I have DL cousins and they're largely what Americans would consider MO. But then Chardal got big and co-opted their ideas and made them much more extreme, which I don't agree with at all. 

This describes my opinion fairly well:

It should be noted that the term "mamlachti" also refers to many more moderate religious Zionists, who are willing to accept the "will of the Jewish people" as a consideration when it comes to many other issues such as the secular nature of society. This latter group predates the Chardal movement by decades, and is identified much more with the mainstream Religious Zionist movement than with the Chardal.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chardal#Internal_divisions

So the idea is that even though I ascribe religious meaning to the founding and existence of the State, I believe the government should largely be secular and democratic; a theocratic government would be horrific. I also don't believe that the State is leading to Moshiach coming. Quite the opposite, I'm worried that time is a flat circle and right now it's 2.5 minutes to midnight. So even though technically my views would mostly fit in with DL's, I now associate the concept of RZ with Chardalim. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Are the prayers valid if you don't go use this structure and just use your own?

For most people, no. The rabbis wrote these prayers because they determined that most people would not be able to compose acceptable prayers on their own. If someone was a great writer and spent as much time composing their prayers as the rabbis did, then maybe their version would be acceptable. 

But this is just for the three timebound prayers mentioned. A person can always pray at other times using their own words. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I consider myself a Zionist who is religious and not a Religious Zionist. I say Hallel without a bracha and don't attach religious meaning to settlements. 

For those of us who are not young enough to remember a world before the State of Israel existed, I don't think we can comprehend how world-changing it was for most Jews, and how absolutely incredible that after 2,000 years our prayers finally looked like they were being answered. So how could it be anything but the atchalta d'geula?

And for a while it really seemed like it was happening, but in the past 20+ years things have been going downhill. So what does it mean in terms of Moshiach? I don't know. And I don't know how anybody can claim to know. 

So especially at this point I don't see how being RZ benefits the State of Israel. 

ETA: If you were brought up black hat, it might be hard for you to get but it's really all right to have political opinions that are just opinions and don't have any particular religious aspect to them. </TEXT>
