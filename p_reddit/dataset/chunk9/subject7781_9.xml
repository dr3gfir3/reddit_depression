	<TEXT> No they wouldn't. The filibuster isn't a constitutional rule, but rather the consequence of a rule and tradition created by the Senate (the Senate is authorized under the Constitution to create its own rules, and eliminating the filibuster wouldn't change that). In fact, the way the GOP would kill the filibuster is by invoking the so-called nuclear option again  *i.e.*, raising a point of order saying that the Constitution only requires a simple majority to pass ordinary legislation in the Senate, and imposing a *de facto* supermajority requirement via the rule requiring 60 votes to end debate is unconstitutional. 

This argument isn't necessarily even wrong, just incredibly hypocritical after Republicans filibustered practically everything they could when Obama and Dems had unified control in the 111th Congress.       </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems like the alleged perpetrator, Mitchell W. Adkins, may have mental health issues (self-reported depression 
supposedly stemming from other students not wanting to associate with him based on how he acted and the things he said around campus). But according to the article, during the attack Adkins asked people their party affiliation and let the Republicans go. If that's true, that makes this an explicit act of political violence.

Also per the article, he posted a [screed/manifesto concerning alleged discrimination he suffered because of his conservative views](https://www.buzzfeed.com/madkins19/discrimination-of-conservatives-in-liberal-arts-1ynfg?utm_term=.mmrK75a4Q3#.fdPM56W4wQ).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Horrifying. But at least [this guy](https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2017-04/28/15/asset/buzzfeed-prod-fastlane-03/sub-buzz-28499-1493408754-9.jpg?downsize=715:* output-format=auto output-quality=auto) didn't have a gun, and the people are likely to survive:

The suspect, who once wrote a BuzzFeed post about conservatives being discriminated against on liberal campuses, reportedly asked students about their political affiliations as he attacked them.


A former student of Kentucky's Transylvania University was arrested Friday after he allegedly stormed a campus caf with a machete and a bag of knives, quizzed students on their political affiliations, and injured two women.

**Mitchell W. Adkins** allegedly entered the cafe on the Lexington campus shortly before 9 a.m. local time before threatening patrons and employees, the Lexington Police Department said in a statement.

Two women suffered non-life-threatening injuries. One was taken to a hospital, while the other was treated and released at the scene.

Witnesses told local media the suspect shouted "The day of reckoning is here!" as he began his attack.

"He asked the first girl if she was a Democrat or a Republican. She said Republican. He said okay, then asked some other girl," Michael Soder told Lex 18. "By that time, some of my friends were running out and yelling for us to leave, and I tried to stay behind to see if  I mean I didn't know what to do, I wanted to help, but I knew I should get out of there."

"He asked somebody what their political affiliation was, they said Republican, and the guy said, 'You are safe,'" campus newspaper editor-in-chief Tristan Reynolds told the Lexington Herald-Leader. "And then I realized what was going on and started getting people out.

...

In 2015, after BuzzFeed staffer and Transylvania alum Tracy Clayton wrote a viral post detailing her experiences with racism at the university, Adkins wrote a post on this website as a community contributor. 

In the post, "[Discrimination of Conservatives in Liberal Arts](https://www.buzzfeed.com/madkins19/discrimination-of-conservatives-in-liberal-arts-1ynfg?utm_term=.wsMdaG2vE#.lcaJk6Gy7)," Adkins wrote of making "several enemies" because he is a "proud Republican."

"It's amazing to me that when I listen to someone's political opinion and then give my own, I'm the one who's lashed out at for being a 'racist' or 'bigot,' some even go as far as saying 'bane of society' or 'fascist Nazi,'" he wrote.

Adkins discussed losing friends because of his opinions on gay marriage and Caitlyn Jenner, and detailed his unhappiness with the student newspaper urging students not to wear racially insensitive costumes for Halloween.

"I am proud of who I am, but this school has shown me that it's not okay to be a Republican anymore," he concluded. "All of these people who are all about non-discrimination and against bullies and all for equality, are more than happy to turn around and scream at someone for being different, kick him to the ground, and leave him there. I am not the bigot at this school, it is those who go back on their beliefs in order to encourage them."

In a postscript, Adkins said he had later dropped out of college.

"The constant bullying and lack of friends drove me to an overdose, a trip to the hospital, and two trips to a mental hospital," he wrote. "The constant thought of knowing I'd never fit in was too much for me to bear."


On his Facebook page, where he first shared his BuzzFeed post, Adkins has written and shared a number of posts about his support for President Trump, his views on gun control, and his views on attacks committed by Muslims. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Here's the link the the full story](http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article146957349.html) in the News   Observer linked in this article. 

[Here's the bill itself](http://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/2017/Bills/House/PDF/H330v2.pdf), and the excerpt of the relevant provision:


 1-539.13 Immunity from civil liability for certain automobile drivers.

(a) A person driving an automobile who is exercising due care and injures another  person who is participating in a protest or demonstration and is blocking traffic in a public street or highway is immune from civil liability for the injury.

(b) A person shall not be immune from civil liability if the actions leading to the injury were willful or wanton.

(c) Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply if the injured person participating in a protest or demonstration was doing so with a valid permit allowing persons to protest or demonstrate on the public street or highway where the injury occurred.


As I read it, subsection (a) immunizes drivers who are exercising "due care" from civil liability. 

I'm not a North Carolina lawyer, but I don't see how this represents an actual change from common law negligence. Maybe it sets up an affirmative defense of statutory immunity that can be invoked at an earlier stage of the case?

Generally speaking, if you fail to exercise due care while driving and injure someone, you can be held liable for negligence. What due care requires in a particular situation is obviously fact-specific and contextual. If you have a protester unexpectedly hop in front of you are, you are driving in normal traffic, and you try to stop but simply don't have time to do so, you almost certainly wouldn't be held liable even without this change in the law. That's different than the degree of care you might be required to exercise at a cross walk in a school zone while kids are present.

On the other hand, even with this change, if you don't even try to stop for the protester and you had time to try, you aren't exercising due care could be held liable. 

This law might simply encourage people--knowing that this immunity exists--to exercise less care than they otherwise would. But if they do that consciously, there's a decent argument that it's really recklessness not mere negligence. So the statutory immunity wouldn't protect them. 

There's also one potential ambiguity that I see. Subsection (b) says that someone isn't immune where they cause the injury through "willful or wanton" actions. So someone intentionally or recklessly running over a protester wouldn't have immunity. But that same subsection doesn't expressly say that someone who negligently runs a protester over (*i.e.*, failing to exercise due care but not quite being wanton/reckless--which requires an element of conscious disregard of risk) would also not be immune. 

This doesn't imply that they *would* be immune. But it invites litigation should that scenario ever come up. 

The bottom line is that this is a stupid and unnecessary law. There may be a basis to challenge it as unconstitutional under the First Amendment, or some other ground, for unfairly singling out just protesters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [They're joined at the hip now](https://cmgajcpolitics.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/trumphandel.jpg) (put this image right into the attack ads). They foolishly decided to make this a referendum on Trump. Let's give them their wish:


Karen Handel is in the middle of what Republicans see as a must-win race for Congress. And at a fundraiser on her behalf on Friday, President Donald Trump made sure she knew it.

At the closed-door event at the Capitol City Club, Trump turned toward Handel with a smile and quipped youd better win, according to five attendees of the event. She responded that he need not worry about that.

...

Trump sent a barrage of tweets and recorded a robo-call last week urging Republicans to vote against Ossoff in the special election.

But he went a step further on Friday with glowing praise for Handel at a nationally-televised speech and a new attack on Ossoff at a National Rifle Association meeting in Atlanta. He followed that up with a private fundraiser for Handel afterwards.

Handel has embraced Trump right back. Although she did not run as a pro-Trump loyalist, she has increasingly relied on his support since her No. 2 finish in last weeks vote.

...

It was nice seeing Karen embrace Trump, said Phillips, who took the picture above. I think thats going to pay dividends for her. If Trump voters dont turn out in June, thats not good for us.

	<TEXT> This is an important discussion.

Those sound like fairly centrist policy preferencesexcept single-payer, which is more progressive (at least here in the US). What strikes me is that I don't have any massive irreconcilable policy disagreements with you (from what I can tell so far at least).  Yet, voting for Trump never even crossed my mind (I voted for Sanders, then Clinton). Also, interestingly, there are planks in the [2016 Democratic Platform](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/papers_pdf/117717.pdf) on the issues of individual and corporate tax reform, controlling healthcare costs and implementing fixes to the ACA, infrastructure as well as cyber security:



For example, on Infrastructure and Cybersecurity, the Democratic Platform proposes:

 *Building 21st Century Infrastructure*

If we are serious about reversing the decline of the middle class, we need major federal investments to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and put millions of Americans back to work in decent paying jobs in both the public and private sectors. The climate emergency and the need to expand the middle class demand that we make the most ambitious investment in American infrastructure since President Eisenhower created the interstate highway system. We will put Americans to work updating and expanding our roads, bridges, public transit, airports, and passenger and freight rail lines. We will build 21st century energy and water systems, modernize our schools, and continue to support the expansion of high-speed broadband networks. We will protect communities from the impact of climate change and help them to mitigate its effects by investing in green and resilient infrastructure. We will address the backlog of deferred maintenance in our four key public land management agencies. And we will protect public health and safety by modernizing drinking and wastewater systems. These investments will create secure, good-paying middle-class jobs today and will substantially increase demand for American-made steel and other products manufactured in the United States. And by boosting economic growth in a fair and equitable way, and strengthening our long-term competitiveness, these investments will create many more jobs in the years to come. 

Democrats will also create an independent, national infrastructure bank that will support critical infrastructure improvements. This bank will provide loans and other financial assistance for investments in energy, water, broadband, transportation, and multi-modal infrastructure projects.

Democrats will continue to support the interest tax exemption on municipal bonds and will work to establish a permanent version of Build America Bonds as an additional tool to encourage infrastructure investment by state and local governments.

Furthermore, Democrats will fight to ensure resources and programs are adequately targeted to
provide economic development, job training, and critical infrastructure investment in areas of the
greatest need. 

For comparison, here are Clinton and Trump's positions on Infrastructure (I had to pull Trump's positions off the the interner archive because [he's taken the page down](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/an-americas-infrastructure-first-plan)).


[Clinton on Infrastructure](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2015/11/30/clinton-infrastructure-plan-builds-tomorrows-economy-today/)

[Trump on Infrastructure](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108080815/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/an-americas-infrastructure-first-plan)


------

*Cybersecurity and Online Privacy*

Democrats will protect our industry, infrastructure, and government from cyberattacks. We will strengthen our cybersecurity, seek to establish global norms in cyberspace, and impose consequences on those who violate the rules. We will do this while protecting the privacy and civil liberties of the American people. We will also ensure a coherent strategy across federal agencies by building on the Obama Administrations Cybersecurity National Action Plan, especially the empowerment of a federal Chief Information Security Officer, the modernization of federal information technology, and upgrades to government-wide cybersecurity.

Democrats reject the false choice between privacy interests and keeping Americans safe. We need liberty and security, and each makes the other possible. We will protect the privacy and civil liberties of the American peoplestanding firm against the type of warrantless surveillance of American citizens that flourished during the Bush Administration. We support recent reforms to government bulk data collection programs so the government is not collecting and holding millions of files on innocent Americans.

We will support a national commission on digital security and encryption to bring together technology and public safety communities to address the needs of law enforcement, protect the privacy of Americans, assess how innovation might point to new policy approaches, and advance our larger national security and global competitiveness interests.


[Clinton on Technology   Innovation](https://www.hillaryclinton.com/briefing/factsheets/2016/06/27/hillary-clintons-initiative-on-technology-innovation/) (contains planks on government and private cybersecurity).


[Trump on Cybersecurity](http://web.archive.org/web/20161108080605/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/policies/cyber-security) (also from Internet archive)

(Some of the other issues are too long to include here--just look at the table of contents). 

--------

I find it fascinating that we could see the election so differently despite these apparent potential areas of agreement. I'm trying to zero in on the reasons for why this is the case, rather than trying to criticize or lecture you for why you voted as you did (which you've said you regret). So I hope you don't take the questions below the wrong way. In order to avoid a situation where I'm basically interrogating you, I'll also share [*my own answers in square brackets*].

I followed the campaign closely and didn't really see anything to indicate that Trump favored any of the policies that you do or had  concrete substantive plans to address them. That;s maybe because we've one talked about these issues very generally and would actually disagree about specifics (for all I know, you might favor lower rates on the top tax brackets, for example). Trump's sales pitch always struck me as more personality, style, and culture-driven rather than based on policy. Either it appealed to you or you found it incredibly off-putting. For me it was the latter. Also, I thought there were lots of red flags that convinced me think he'd be disastrous even before he took officelike his divisive rhetoric, constant fabrications and disregard for facts, shady business history, and complete lack of preparation for the debates. 

**Did you see any of these things as red flags?**

**What made you trust or at least prefer Trump to Clinton?**

**Did you ever hear about Clinton's issue positions during the campaign?**

**What's your party affiliation?**

 [*I'm registered as a Democrat*]

**Did you want a change from Obama after 8 years?**

 [*I wanted continuity for Obama's policies and less Republican obstructionism, but I'm always open to genuine compromise where both sides give and gain something*]

**Do you generally approve of how Obama did as President?**

 [*I do, strongly*]

**What region of the country do you live in?**

[*I'm on the West CoastLA, specifically*]

**What generation do you belong to?**

 [*I'm on the border between Millennial and Gen X*]      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So President Donald Trump has discovered that being president is a hard job  harder even than being a reality TV star and real estate brand-builder.

...

This particular revelation may be shocking but it shouldn't be surprising. This is the man whoasserted before taking officethat "I could actually run my business and run government at the same time." And while he may have abandoned his "previous life" to some degree, he's still executive producer of "Celebrity Apprentice" (a role that byone estimateis paying him millions of dollars even now) and spends many a weekend golfing at Mar-a-Lago.

But more broadly, Trump's admission that presidenting is hard is just the latest in a long line of indications that Trump was yugely, massively unprepared for the office he sought last year. I don't think it's a stretch to say that he was more unprepared than anyone elected to the office before.

It's not simply a question of hisvarious flip-flopssince coming into office, but the sheer number of nontrivial issues on which he's admitted to having been oblivious.

Consider the litany of things that were apparently astonishing to the new president which would come as a surprise to no one who has paid more than a passing amount of attention to national and international affairs (or, having decided to run for president, started trying to get up to speed)..



[*See article for list of items*including NAFTA, NATO, Korean Peninsula politics, Healthcare, Trade in EU*]

...

...[T]his guy is president. That's kind of a big deal. And even the best-prepared new presidents have big learning curves on the job, making Trump's kind of mind-boggling. That would be concerning in and of itself, but then layer on the fact that he has largely surrounded himself with political neophytes at the most senior levels of his administration  like his daughter and her husband  and it sets up a dangerous and unpredictable situation.

	<TEXT> GOP Senate gains are *not* a foregone conclusion despite the [highly unfavorable map](http://cdn.images2.rollcall.com/image/236cbdabf6ca9fc064f8372837707da7/author/2016/11/16213416/SenateLandscape2018.jpg). In the 1970 midterm, there were only 8 GOP seats up for re-election, compared to 25 Democratic seats. Next year is about the same, with 9 R / 25 D (2 I) seats up. 13 of the Dems in 1970 midterm were in Nixon states, versus 10 Dems in Trump states in 2018. Also, Nixon was much more popular than Trump is currently, at 58% approval. So it was in theory a significantly more favorable midterm environment for the GOP. Nevertheless,  Republicans only netted 2 seats in the Senate and lost 12 in the House. 

Looking at the current political environment and extrapolating, that seems like a best case scenario for Trump (barring some sort of terrorist attack).

Senate races are correlated with each other, not random and independent. In +9 D (or more) environment with Trump's approval in the mid-to-high 30s, Trump state incumbent Dems are probably safe. Cruz's seat in TX might even become competitive. It could also encourage [Corker to retire](http://www.wbir.com/mb/news/politics/sen-bob-corker-not-yet-ready-to-say-whether-he-will-run-for-third-term/432097887?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRreVptVTVZell6WXpGayIsInQiOiI0RjUybm1QSkhYOWFZOFppT1N2amp4THIxcDNtM3Rva3h1ZGVOSzFWK3NBYWM1Q1BnTjV5OG9oOGRTcFZqM1dydER3YXdsRUp1OVJwM0VLMDg3d3V1SjJlMUEwM2dhQkJobm5IQTM1TDI4MnREUytIdUZXcGtKM01pUHg2SjZoZiJ9) (he has not confirmed he's running when asked) or [Collins to run for governor of ME](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/11/politics/collins-maine-governor-run/).

Retaking the Senate will likely require a 1994- or 2010-level wave. That's difficult, but not impossible. Especially if the Trump-Russia investigations start publicly turning up fire.

Not a Republican myself, and oppose the Orange One from the left for different reasons. Still good shit:


Donald Trumps presidency is nearly 100 days old, and it feels more like 1,000.

**Watching him preside over theUnited Statesfor 100 days is akin to dealing with a newborn baby for three months. The late nights, unpredictability, the constant need for attention, the cryingits an eerie parallel.** More importantly, if Trumps first three months and change in office are an indicator of whats to come, it provides a measure of satisfaction to those of us who warned this would happen.

TheNever Trump Republicanswere united by a pledge never to support his candidacyone that was based on his behavior, his past, and our deep fears about that he would do if ever occupied the Oval Office. Those fears are now playing out.

	<TEXT> The State Department plans to cut 2,300 U.S. diplomats and civil servants -- about 9 percent of the Americans in its workforce worldwide -- as Secretary of State Rex Tillerson presses ahead with his task of slashing the agencys budget, according to people familiar with the matter.

The majority of the job cuts, about 1,700, will come through attrition, while the remaining 600 will be done via buyouts, according to the people, who asked not to be identified because the decision hasnt been publicly announced. William Inglee, a former Lockheed Martin Corp. official and policy adviser in Congress, was hired to help oversee the budget cuts and briefed senior managers on the plan Wednesday, the people said.

...

Current and former diplomats fear that the cuts will bite into the work of the State Department and undermine the voice of the U.S. overseas.

**Simply Mindless**

Just cutting without deciding what change you want to make is simply mindless, said Stephen Sestanovich, a professor at Columbia Universitys School of International and Public Affairs who served as U.S. ambassador-at-large for the former Soviet Union.

A new administration is right to look at what Cabinet departments do, but does it want the United States to do less in the world  and if so, exactly what? he added. Those are the questions that need to be answered before you make big cuts at State.

The planned jobs cuts come as the State Department is preparing a major reorganization of its work and mission. The rethinking is part of a process of asking if the State Department is set up to meet the needs of the next two decades after 16 years focused on counterterrorism following the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to R.C. Hammond, Tillersons communications adviser.

	<TEXT> I think it was only 8 GOP seats up in 1970 (rather than 10) and 13 of the Dems up for re-election were in Nixon states (compared to 10 Dems in Trump states in 2018). Also, Nixon was at 58% approval. So it was in theory an even more unfavorable environment. Nevertheless, the GOP only netted 2 seats in the Senate and lost 12 in the House. 

Looking at the current political environment and extrapolating, that seems like a best case scenario for Trump (barring some sort of terrorist attack).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed here. But the key issue is the scope of what's related. That will likely be litigated, and the law may evolve.

The question is whether there can be wholesale withholding of federal assistance for state law enforcement unless states agree to enforce federal immigration law. 

The first ACA case, [*NFIB v. Sebelius*, 132 S. Ct. 2566 (2012)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11973730494168859869 q=nfib+v+sebelius hl=en as_sdt=2006), which I cited above, seems on point here. 

SCOTUS ruled that states couldn't be compelled to adopt expanded Medicaid through the threat of withholding existing Medicaid funds:

Congress may use its spending power to create incentives for States to act in accordance with federal policies. But when "pressure turns into compulsion," ibid., the legislation runs contrary to our system of federalism. "[T]he Constitution simply does not give Congress the authority to require the States to regulate." New York, 505 U.S., at 178, 112 S.Ct. 2408. That is true whether Congress directly commands a State to regulate or indirectly coerces a State to adopt a federal regulatory system as its own.

Permitting the Federal Government to force the States to implement a federal program would threaten the political accountability key to our federal system. "[W]here the Federal Government directs the States to regulate, it may be state officials who will bear the brunt of public disapproval, while the federal officials who devised the regulatory program may remain insulated from the electoral ramifications of their decision." Id., at 169, 112 S.Ct. 2408. Spending Clause programs do not pose this danger when a State has a legitimate choice whether to accept the federal conditions in exchange for federal 2603*2603 funds. In such a situation, state officials can fairly be held politically accountable for choosing to accept or refuse the federal offer. But when the State has no choice, the Federal Government can achieve its objectives without accountability, just as in New York and Printz. Indeed, this danger is heightened when Congress acts under the Spending Clause, because Congress can use that power to implement federal policy it could not impose directly under its enumerated powers.

One other possible distinction is that immigration implicates a federal regulatory power, not just the spending clause, though I'm not sure that alone is dispositive.

 I've not yet examined the order to see how the Judge arrived at his decision to grant the stay.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hows about we ditch this stupid concept that our constitution applies to people differently based on your address within the USA and just accept that all of it, the parts we all like and don't like... apply to everyone

That notion isn't challenged by this decision. 

States can't deny federal constitutional rights. They can't enact legislation that contravenes federal law in an area of enumerated federal power like immigration. But States, per current SCOTUS precedent, also cannot be compelled to affirmatively enforce federal law using their own resources, whether directly, or through the threat of withholding federal resources to which they're entitled.   

Here, the issue is whether states can be compelled to enforce federal immigration law against their will using their own state-level resources, and whether they can be forced to engage in costly cooperation (paid out of state coffers) with federal enforcement. 

There's no denial of a federal constitutional or statutory right by a State. That's the distinction between, say, Kim Davis refusing to marry gays (a federal constitutional right under the 14th amendment). 

The law may well change in this area, but what sanctuary cities are doing leverages existing precedent on federalism created by judicial conservatives.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not accurate. 

The federal government does indeed have plenary power over immigration, and states can't make their own policy that contradicts federal policy in this area. For example, states can't change the eligibility criteria for federal benefits, or admit people to U.S. citizenship. 

At the same time, states *do* in fact have the right to not have their resources commandeered against their will, directly or through coercive withholding of federal funds, to enforce federal law. 

That's SCOTUS precedent laid down by the conservative push to revive federalism. *See*, *e.g.*, *Printz v. US*, and *NFIB v. Sebellius*.

	<TEXT> Well, it supposes Flynn's ability to tell a tale that holds him solely responsible for any misconduct, and doesn't contradict the other evidence and testimony that's likely to come out. Flynn would also have to be willing to make the sacrifice. His reputation would be even more tarnished than it is now. And, as I noted in the post (in the slightly different context of *refusing to testify*):

Trump would need to depend on Flynn's loyalty and willingness to go to jail indefinitely to cover for him. Yet, Trump threw him overboard at the first sign of adversity and has been distancing himself ever since. Not very loyalty-inspiring.

In taking the blame, Flynn's calculus would be a bit different. Suppose Flynn attempts to portray himself as the sole wrongdoer, but his testimony is proven false. That's perjury, as well as obstruction of justice--and, [as a retired military officer still receiving pay](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/war_stories/2006/04/could_rumsfeld_courtmartial_the_retired_generals.html), it could potentially even subject him to military discipline. None of these things would be covered by the original pardon for the underlying misconduct. Trump would need to pardon Flynn again for the testimony-related offenses. Besides the heavy political cost of doing this, it too could be construed as, among other things, obstruction of justice, subornation of perjury, witness tampering, or bribery of Flynn by Trump. And if the false testimony were material to the ongoing investigation of Trump (it likely would be, or else why would he go to the trouble) that would be the ballgame as well. 

This is a very fine needle to thread. Especially without knowing what the FBI has and coordinating with the White House in advance (something which is surely being closely watched). How does Flynn know that Trump will actually pardon him for the perjury? For Flynn to be absolutely sure, Trump would basically have to preemptively pardon the perjury in advance of Flynn's testimony. But since pardons are public acts, that would give away that Flynn was about to lie for Trump. 

Suppose that Trump were somehow able to give Flynn credible assurance that he would pardon him if and only if Flynn's perjury were discovered and he were actually tried and convicted of perjury. What would that assurance look like? Trump has no inherent credibility. He's a pathological liar who will throw anyone under the bus to save himself. What guarantee would Flynn have that Trump's calculus wouldn't change down the line, or even that Trump would still be in power when the moment for the perjury pardon came? To make this deal work, Trump would have to give Flynn even more leverage over him than Flynn already has based on whatever damaging information he may know. Flynn would always be able to blackmail Trump, even if this arrangement could be coordinated and pulled off. It's simply too clever by half. 

If Flynn actually does have the goods on Trump, he's much better off persuading the FBI or Congress to give him immunity--which is evidently what his lawyer has counseled him and attempted to do.

	<TEXT> Self- serving hypocrisy on full display:

States rights have long been a rallying cry for conservatives. The Trump administration cited its respect for the states in rescinding Obama administration guidance treating discrimination against transgender students as sex discrimination. Attorney General Jeff Sessions invoked the same principle in questioning federal consent decrees designed to ensure constitutional policing in cities such as Chicago and Baltimore. And when the Supreme Court relied on states rights to gut the Voting Rights Act, then-Sen. Sessions applauded the decision, calling it good news ... for the South. In earlier periods, states rights arguments were advanced to resist desegregation and federal legislation protecting workers and consumers.

But the Trump administration doesnt consistently respect the states, and nowhere is that more true than in its attack on sanctuary cities, in which it claims that states and cities choosing not to help enforce federal immigration law should be denied federal funding. On Tuesday, a federal court in San Francisco invoked the very federalist principles that President Trump and Sessions celebrate to rule unconstitutional Trumps executive order denying funding to sanctuary cities, one of the signature initiatives of Trumps first 100 days. The nationwide injunction, issued by U.S. District Judge William H. Orrick, ruled that Trump violated the rights of state and local governments to make decisions about the deployment of their own resources. The Constitution, the court ruled, mandates that state and local governments be left to make their own judgments about what best serves the safety of their people. Like lawsuits by the states of Washington and Hawaii challenging Trumps anti-Muslim travel ban, the case demonstrates the value of our federalist system when one party controls the levers of federal power.

...

Cities and states have the right to so choose because the 10th Amendment to the Constitution, which preserves state authority, bars the federal government from compelling states to enforce or administer federal laws. The Supreme Court has explained that states must have the ability to make autonomous decisions about deploying their resources, so the federal government cannot commandeer their cooperation in carrying out a federal program. Thats a principle conservatives have long championed. But now that they control Congress and the White House, they are less eager to honor its dictates, especially when they protect progressive cities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Beyond the problems /u/Atheose_Writing noted, pardons can have some counterintuitive consequences:

People can invoke the 5th Amendment and refuse to testify because they cannot be compelled to incriminate themselves. Just like with immunity, however, a pardon eliminates the risk of criminal liability from the testimony. Thus, once pardoned, someone can no longer refuse to testify on this basis. Continuing to do so would subject Flynn to civil or criminal contempt of court. As Kim Davis learned, federal courts don't fuck around with that. You can be thrown in jail until and if you comply with the court order. So Flynn may end up spending some time behind bars after allalbeit in jail, not prison, and not as punishment, but instead to compel compliance. Trump can't use the pardon power again to interfere with ongoing contempt. 

If the strategy is to shield Flynn so he won't testify, Trump would need to depend on Flynn's loyalty and willingness to go to jail indefinitely to cover for him. Yet, Trump threw him overboard at the first sign of adversity and has been distancing himself ever since. Not very loyalty-inspiring. Once the pardon is given, unless Trump is willing to go full Putin and start ordering hits in the streets, he has no leverage over Flynn.

Also, even though the pardon would be given full effect, it bears noting that pardoning Flynn to obstruct Congressional and FBI investigations is likely impeachable in itself, regardless of what Flynn says or doesn't saysimply because he is a key subject or target of a broader ongoing investigation that implicates the Trump Regime. But if Flynn ultimately *does* testify and says something highly damaging, then Trump's improper motive for the pardon would be pretty conclusively established. 

And that's the ball game.               </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thoughtful piece that's worth a read:

**In a signature theme of its first 100 days, the Trump administration, encouraged by conservative media outlets, has launched an assault on civil servants the likes of which should have gone out of style in the McCarthy era.** Attacks on their credibility, motivations, future employment, and basic missions have become standard fare for White House press briefings and initiatives. In doing so, the administration and its backers may be crippling their legacy from the start by casting away the experts and implementers who not only make the executive agenda real but provide critical services for ordinary Americans. But in a move that should trouble all regardless of political affiliation, they also run the risk of undermining fundamental democratic principles of American governance.

...

**Pushing away civil servants who are perceived to disagree with the party in power also sets up the U.S. electoral system as winner-takes-all contest more closely resembling a third-world dictatorship than the United States (other Trump tendencies, such as placing immediate family members in senior posts, make this comparison all the more apt)**. While historically a new administration replaces senior policymakers with its own ideological allies, the bureaucracy itself has remained apolitical. This allows for each party  and specifically the party not in power at any given time  to feel at least somewhat assured that critical national security decisions will be informed by something other than pure politics, i.e., that the individuals in power will not take steps which first and foremost serve their continued reign and personal interests as opposed to the larger interests of the nation. **When this assumption is challenged, the stakes of a presidential election and electoral politics in general become astronomically higher, and can create the underlying conditions for violent conflict or even civil war. When political entities view victory as the only means of survival and see their rivals success as a guarantee of their own political demise, the gloves of civility come off in ways that could make the tactics of 2016 seem benign.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Elections don't have to be free and fair for Democrats to return to power. In fact, we know already that they *won't be*, given gerrymandering, voter suppression, etc. But if there's a regular pattern in American politics, it's the midterm backlash (and the 8-year aversion to continuing with the same party in power). At a certain point, unless there's outright election fraud/rigging--which there's been no significant evidence of so far--the backlash can overcome the tilted playing field. See the 2006 midterm. 

It's extraordinarily difficult to steal an election that isn't close. 

Policy choices have actual consequences in the medium to long term. The Trump Regime's ineptitude and ideologically-driven choices will adversely affect people's lives. Enough of those people will, in turn, react to the adverse effects by blaming the party in power and voting against them. Sure, we can expect more interference from Russia in 2018. But reality still exerts some influence. </TEXT>

Democracy is about more than just the formal rules. We also have  important norms and traditions--*i.e.*, the uncodified informal rules--that shape people's expectations and undergird the legitimacy of the system.  

If a relatively small partisan majority decided to nuke the legislative filibuster, and then used this momentary period of unforseen majoritarian dominance to opportunistically ram through radical structural changes to the federal judiciary (which they didn't campaign on, [but arguably can still implement](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/67r9mv/trump_says_he_may_break_up_appeals_court_that/dgsuld0/)) that wouldn't necessarily violate the Constitution. But it would eviscerate the norms of democratic behavior and shatter all precedent.

	<TEXT> For federal courts, especially those inferior to the Supreme Court, you actually want [Title 28 of the U.S. Code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28). 

Like all federal statutes, this can be changed by an ordinary act of Congress. 

There are all sorts of subtle and not so subtle ways to fuck with the these courts if Congress and the President were so inclined. For instance, they could place significant additional limits on the statutory provisions granting subject matter jurisdiction to federal courts--such as federal question jurisdiction ([28 U.S. Code  1331](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1331)), or you could restrict appellate jurisdiction ([28 U.S. Code  1291](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1291)).  Alternatively, they could mess with provisions related to the creation and composition of [district](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/132) and [circuit](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/43) courts, or authorizing and instituting procedures for [appellate panels](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/46). They could also define "regular active service" to mean something different than it currently does, effectively imposing term limits on judges so that Trump can get more appointments and reduce the influence of prior Presidents. 

Given the vagueness of Article III, the possibilities are limited mostly by tradition and norms of what would be considered improper. But keep in mind that radical changes would likely face significant push-back from civil society.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This likely can't be done through reconciliation since the legislation has to pertain to the budget *and* be deficit neutral. 

But they could just invoke the nuclear option to [nuke the legislative filibuster itself](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/67r9mv/trump_says_he_may_break_up_appeals_court_that/dgso8nw/). 

Once they do this, they can pass anything they want with a 50%+1 majority. They don't have to invoke the nuclear option every time. So they wouldn't be wasting a silver bullet. They'd be using it on the very thing it would be used against anyway, and then proceeding under the new rule going forward. 

Of course, when Democrats get back in power, they'll be operating under the new precedents Republicans have created, and can simply reverse the GOP changes to the judiciary. They could also, for instance, increase the size of the Supreme Court (which isn't defined in the Constitution) as part of a broader reform to permit it to take more cases (*e.g.*, putting in place a panel / *en banc* system) and/or impose term limits for being active justices without stripping any justices of their lifetime tenure as members of the court (though this could potentially require a Constitutional Amendment).

The legislative filibuster is an anti-democratic institution in a Senate that is already wildly disproportional to begin with. Historically, it has been used far more often to obstruct progress than to preserve it. 

It sucks that this is potentially happening *precisely* under the Orange One, rather than a more reasonable Republican President. But even so, if Republicans abolish filibusters for momentary political gains, they will regret it sooner rather than later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Under Senate rules, it takes 67 votes to change a Senate rule that's in force. 

But it only takes a bare majority to affirm a point of order that a particular Senate rule requiring a supermajority for something not specifically defined as such in the Constitution (such as treaty approval, constitutional amendments initiated by Congress, or veto overrides) is unconstitutional. The effect of this is to substitute the 50%+1 requirement in place of the former supermajority rule.

So the legislative filibuster could be nuked this way. As could the rule providing that rule changes require 2/3rds majorities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (continued) [**2 of 2**] 

 [**Issue 2**] While some members of the supreme court were hypocritical and self - serving, at what point can a single state tie up the election? If, in 2020, Florida is red through Ann's through, and the dems win the presidency with Florida as the swing state, how long can Florida delay? Can they push back inauguration? How many legal challenges are permitted? At what point can, or should, the scotus say, "Enough is enough." ?

There are limits specified under federal statutes. And, whatever the limit is, it probably doesn't help that the SCOTUS wasted a significant amount of time available for the recount and made it impossible under the most artificial of the potential deadlines.

Justice Ginsbergs dissent is on point:

Even if there were an equal protection violation, I would agree with Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, and Justice Breyer that the Court's concern about the December 12 date, ante, at 110-111, is misplaced. **Time is short in part because of the Court's entry of a stay on December 9, several hours after an able circuit judge in Leon County had begun to superintend the recount process. More fundamentally, the Court's reluctance to let the recount go forwarddespite its suggestion that "[t]he search for intent can be confined by specific rules designed to ensure uniform treatment," ante, at 106ultimately turns on its own judgment about the practical realities of implementing a recount, not the judgment of those much closer to the process.**

**Equally important, as Justice Breyer explains, post, at 155 (dissenting opinion), the December 12 date for bringing Florida's electoral votes into 3 U. S. C.  5's safe harbor lacks the significance the Court assigns it. Were that date to pass, Florida would still be entitled to deliver electoral votes Congress must count unless both Houses find that the votes "ha[d] not been . .. regularly given." 3 U. S. C.  15.** The statute identifies other significant dates. See, e. g.,  7 (specifying December 18 as the date electors "shall meet and give their votes");  12 (specifying "the fourth Wednesday in December"this year, December 27as the date on which Congress, **if it has not received a State's electoral votes, shall request the state secretary of state to send a certified return immediately**). **But none of these dates has ultimate significance in light of Congress' detailed provisions for determining, on "the sixth day of January," the validity of electoral votes.  15.**

Besides the SCOTUS complicity in creating the time crunch by entering the stay in the first place, [3 U.S.C.  12s](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/12) reference to what Congress *could* do in the event it *still* had not received the electoral votes by December 27 makes no sense if a states certified electoral votes needed to be received by that date. You could make a decently strong argument that December 18 was a real cutoff, because that was the date Congress specified for the electors to meet and cast their votes. *See* [3 U.S.C.  7](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/7); *and* [3 U.S.C.  6](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/6). Arguably that requirement could be binding even if the votes weren't received by December 27.

Ultimately, though, all dates prior to January 6 were basically procedural milestones to facilitate a predictable, orderly process. The Florida recount was an extraordinary situation. Any date before January 6 could theoretically work. A case in point is the 1960 election, when Hawaii didnt even begin its recount until December 13, and  ultimately it only certified the result on January 4. There were two sets of electors appointed. But the electoral votes for the certified winner, JFK, were counted. It comes down to whether you want to make it work or not. January 6, unlike the other dates, was *unquestionably* a hard deadline. Thats when the electoral votes were to be counted and the winner was to be formally recognized. *See* [3 U.S.C.  15](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/3/15)

[This law review article](http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250 context=fss_papers) gives a great rundown of the flaws with the various legal arguments in the *Bush v. Gore* majority opinionranging from the SCOTUS interpretation of Florida election law (and disregard for federalism), to the convolution of the equal protection argument. Im not going to debate those issues in order to avoid taking this discussion even further off topic. 

With that said, the articles discussion of the SCOTUS decision to style the December 12 safe harbor as some sort of un-breachable cutoff is highly relevant here, because it drives home the pretextual nature of that argument:

-----------

[3 U.S.C.] Section 5 thus creates a safe harbor for states to ensure that their electoral votes are counted by Congress. **Note that going past the safe harbor does not mean that the electoral votes will not be counted.** The safe harbor simply makes the vote count conclusive. There are many examples of electoral votes being finalized after the safe harbor period, so missing the safe harbor deadline would hardly be an unmitigated disaster. In the 1960 election, for example, Hawaiis votes were not finalized until January 4.  **In the 2000 election, twenty-one states did not submit their electors to the National Archives by the December 12 deadline. These included three statesIowa, New Mexico, and Wisconsinin which the presidential election was particularly close. Four statesCalifornia, Iowa, Maryland, and Pennsylvaniadid not sign the Certificates of Ascertainment establishing the identity of their electors until December 14.** As officials at the National Archives patiently explained to reporters following the expiration of the December 12 deadline, **the reason for the seemingly slow pace of filings with the National Archives is that the real deadline is Dec. 18, when the members of the electoral college meet in their respective states** (and in the District of Columbia) to vote for the president and vice president. 

Nevertheless, Rehnquist asserted, the Florida legislature intended to take advantage of the safe harbor provided by federal law, and the Florida Supreme Court violated Article II, Section 1, Clause 2, because its interpretations of Florida law took Floridas election out of the federal safe harbor. Rehnquist thought the safe harbor was no longer available because the Florida Supreme Court had substantially changed Florida law as it existed on November 7, for the reasons discussed previously. Even if the Florida Supreme Court had not changed the law but only interpreted and clarified it, however, Rehnquist believed that the court-ordered recounts would take Florida out of the federal safe harbor because they might extend past December 12. 

**There are four problems with this** objection. First, the text of the Florida Election Code is completely silent about the safe harbor deadline. The only Florida lawmaking body that had said anything about the safe harbor was the Florida Supreme Court, which Rehnquist had just accused of reading things into the text that were not there. Second, December 12 is not the real deadline; December 18 is. **Ensuring that Floridas vote is conclusive is surely a valid purpose, but it is not the only purpose behind the election code.** Given changed circumstances, one has to decide **which purpose is more importantmeeting the safe harbor deadline or counting every legal vote and attempting to discern which candidate actually received the most votes.** Choosing between valid but competing purposes is a fairly standard job of courts in interpreting statutes. The **text of the Florida Election Code does not decide this question,** and Rehnquist and the Florida Supreme Court simply disagreed about which was more important. But that disagreement does not by itself constitute a violation of Article II, Section 1. Third, **at the very moment that Rehnquist wrote his opinion, the Florida legislature was planning to endorse a Republican slate of electors that would directly violate the safe harbor requirement** because the endorsement was a change in Florida electoral law that would occur after the November 7 election. This is essentially the same cast of characters that created the 1999 Florida Election Code, and thus offers fairly strong evidence that the 1999 Florida legislature was willing to forsake the safe harbor if something more important was at stake. Fourth, **the major impediment to completing the recounts by December 12 was the U.S. Supreme Courts stay of the recounts on December 9. The recounts were well on their way to completion when the Court stopped them. It then issued its opinion (along with Rehnquists complaint about tardiness) at ten P.M. on December 12.** It hardly seems fair to blame the Florida Supreme Court for going past the safe harbor deadline when the U.S. Supreme Court held it up until the deadline was almost past.

	<TEXT> **[1 of 2]**

 [**Issue 1**] As I understand it, the Florida court issued a narrow scope to recount the ballots, as a result of Gore's team's behest. Whether or not the recount could have included the overvotes at that point is beyond me, but I believe no, or at least not without more legal wrangling.


That's not 100% correct. 


It's true that Gore requested a hand recount of undervotes in 4 counties: Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach and Volusia Counties. This was arguably a legal and PR misstep, since it didn't quite fit with "count every vote" message and thus played into the Bush legal and PR teams' arguments that Gore was a "[Soreloserman](http://www.donspage.com/funny/pictures/soreloserman.html)" who wanted to cherrypick votes after the fact. Yet, despite Gore's narrow request, the Florida Supreme Court ordered a statewide hand recount, which is what SCOTUS halted in [*Bush v. Gore*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2298973060085224552 q=bush+v+gore hl=en as_sdt=2006). 

The FL Supreme Court ruling specified that ballots where there was no vote for President recorded by machine (undervotes) were to be counted. Yet, Florida had a broad intent of the voter standard at the time. As noted previously, the statewide hand recount had been under the supervision of Florida Judge Terry Lewiswho was enforcing uniform standards for the process and coordinating with the various county election canvassing boards. Initially, this process was concerned with undervotes (the famous "hanging" and "pregnant" chads). But as also noted, Judge Lewis told the canvassing boards that overvotes (not just undervotes) were to be segregated for potential counting and that those ballots where the clear intent of the voters could be discerned were to be tallied so that he could rule on the issue for all counties. 

It's probably impossible to objectively discern intent from an overvote ballot that has marks by more than one Presidential candidate's lines--even if one mark is visibly stronger than the other, or is partial (a possible exception would be where one bubble were erased but registered by machine as an overvote due to smudging).  

The specific overvotes I was talking about aren't nearly so ambiguous. Apparently, in counties across the state, there were ballots where voters both marked a single choice for President and *wrote in the same candidate's name in the space provided*. Clearly, these voters misunderstood the effect of doing this (nullifying their ballot). But they just as clearly intended to vote for the candidate who they were eager (or careful) to both mark and write in. 


Heres the relevant excerpt from [one of the articles I previously linked](http://rinr.fsu.edu/winter2005/features/battlefield.html):

RinR: One of the most interesting points you make in the book is that the focus on undervotes (ballots containing no vote for president)the hanging, dimpled and otherwise pregnant chadswas misplaced. Instead, you explain that a study by the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago, which looked at all the ballots that were initially rejected on election night 2000, revealed a surprise: most of these uncounted votes were in fact discarded because they were over-votes, instances of two votes for president on one ballot. What do you think the NORC study tells us about the election?

LdHS: Its an embarrassing outcome for George Bush because it showed that Gore had gotten more votes. Everybody had thought that the chads were where all the bad ballots were, but it turned out that the ones that were the most decisive were write-in ballots where people would check Gore and write Gore in, and the machine kicked those out. There were 175,000 votes overall that were so-called spoiled ballots. **About two-thirds of the spoiled ballots were over-votes**; ***many or most of them would have been write-in over-votes, where people had punched and written in a candidates name.*** And nobody looked at this, not even the Florida Supreme Court in the last decision it made requiring a statewide recount. **Nobody had thought about it except Judge Terry Lewis, who was overseeing the statewide recount when it was halted by the U.S. Supreme Court.** The write-in over-votes have really not gotten much attention. Those votes are not ambiguous. When you see Gore picked and then Gore written in, theres not a question in your mind who this person was voting for. When you go through those, theyre unambiguous: Bush got some of those votes, but they were overwhelmingly for Gore. For example, in an analysis of the 2.7 million votes that had been cast in Floridas eight largest counties, **The Washington Post found that Gores name was punched on 46,000 of the over-vote ballots it, while Bushs name was marked on only 17,000.**

RinR: For your research, you merged this set of data with detailed profiles of Floridas electoral precincts. What did you find?

LdHS: One of the things I found that hadnt been reported anywhere is, **if you look at where those votes occurred, they were in predominantly black precincts.** And (when you look at) the history of black voting in Florida, these are people that have been disenfranchised, intimidated. In the history of the early 20th century, **black votes would be thrown out on technicalities, like they would use an X instead of a check mark.**

**So you can understand why African Americans would be so careful, checking off Gores name on the list of candidates and also writing Gores name in the space for write-in votes. But because of the way the vote-counting machines work, this had the opposite effect: the machines threw out their ballots.**

It seems very plausible that Judge Lewis, charged with ensuring uniformity, would have issued a ruling that overvote ballots with both a mark and the name of the same candidate--which he'd *specifically instructed* to be tallied for all counties--would have been included in the total. Such a ruling would be on very strong ground under an "intent of the voter standard."

	<TEXT>  It's a common masturbatory focus of Fox News. My dad parroted the same shit to me about how nobody respected the US under Obama but they do now. Fucking lol, who respects us more now? 

It's shocking how out of touch this is. Nothing could be further from the truth, really.

It's actually Trump who is tarnishing our international reputation a bit more with each passing day. (Enough to inspire images like [Der Spiegel's recent cover](https://mobile.twitter.com/DerSPIEGEL/status/827562802571251712/photo/1) (Germany) or [this cover](http://m.imgur.com/KThk2cl) for the UK-based Economist).

Here are notable findings from Pew Research Center 2016 Global Attitudes Survey (I look forward to the 2017 edition, which will likely be even worse):

[Confidence in Obama](http://imgur.com/47aptn2)

[No confidence in Trump]
(http://imgur.com/lRMVuAf)

[Comparative confidence in various world leaders](http://imgur.com/QPxo8WK)

(Trump actually does *worse than Putin*, whereas Obama is the most, and most widely, respected of the leaders for which there was polling data.)

And these are older numbers. It's likely only gotten worse with the Muslim Ban, which received negative press coverage everywhere, saber rattling on North Korea, and disrespectful interactions with non-authoritarian world leaders (*e.g.*, failing to shake Merkel's hand but congratulating Erdowan and implicitly endorsing Le Pen). For instance, there's been a [dramatic drop in German confidence in US]
(https://twitter.com/MKarnitschnig/status/827267801924526080) since the election  in Feb. '17, only 22% of Germans see the  U.S. as a trustworthy partner, down from 59% in Nov. '16 (-37%). And that was before Merkel's visit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The idea is that people who live in different places have different wants and needs and should have their interests represented.

Right, and a direct popular vote would do just that. Everyone would have an *equal* and *proportional* say, regardless of where they happen to live, how close their neighbor lives, or whether they prefer the same party as most of the people of their state do. 

People in rural states wouldn't be ignored--far from it.

Since every vote would matter, Presidential candidates would have to campaign everywhere to assemble a winning coalition. Since many rural states aren't competitive now, interests of people in those states might even get *more* attention. And likewise, interests shared by rural populations in different states would also get attention, even if those populations wouldn't be large enough within their respective states to make those states competitive. 



This would transform our politics for the better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember those races. Hopefully, with the backlash brewing in 2018, it will be different. 

[In an interview, Sen. Corker declined to say whether he's running for re-election](http://www.wbir.com/mb/news/politics/sen-bob-corker-not-yet-ready-to-say-whether-he-will-run-for-third-term/432097887?mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTVRreVptVTVZell6WXpGayIsInQiOiI0RjUybm1QSkhYOWFZOFppT1N2amp4THIxcDNtM3Rva3h1ZGVOSzFWK3NBYWM1Q1BnTjV5OG9oOGRTcFZqM1dydER3YXdsRUp1OVJwM0VLMDg3d3V1SjJlMUEwM2dhQkJobm5IQTM1TDI4MnREUytIdUZXcGtKM01pUHg2SjZoZiJ9).  

Hopefully, he decides against it. That could potentially open up another path to a Democratic Senate majority (currently, the only remotely plausible one looks like holding every competitive seat and flipping NV, AZ, and TX).

But also to your point, whether one's vote matters shouldn't depend on where we live. A popular vote would let both* the votes of Tennessee Democrats and California Republicans matter and have an equal effect on the outcome. When someone says only big states would matter under PV, it's completely wrong. Individual votes would matter. So it would make sense to appeal for them wherever you could.  The result would be a truly national campaign with maximum incentives to turn out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. The fact I've managed to persuade you through rational argument is honestly the best complement you can ever give. 

Do check out the links when you get the chance, because there's a lot of additional evidence and nuance there. 

As for your question

I don't buy some of what Mensch is pushing, particularly the analysis (she sees Comey as some sort of tragically misunderstood hero), but I nevertheless find the timing of the laptop email revelations really suspicious. 

In my post immediately above, I linked to [this Chicago Tribune article](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html) reporting that the laptop emails were discovered more than two weeks before Comey was briefed. 

During those weeks, no effort appears to have been made to seek a warrant or review them. We know that it took 9 days to complete the full review, based on the time elapsed between the initial Comey letter and the second letter notifying Congress that the investigation's conclusions had not changed (including delays to obtain the warrant so the review could begin). So theoretically there could have been enough time to review the laptop emails in between the time they were discovered and when Comey notified Congress, on October 28. 

In his letter, Comey claimed to only have been briefed the day before, October 27:

In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. **I am writing to inform you that the investigative team** ***briefed me on this yesterday***, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.

When Comey received the briefing, one of the first questions out of his mouth should have been "when and where did you find these emails?" Upon discovering that no action had been taken during the preceding 3 weeks, he should have demanded a convincing explanation given the obvious potential to increase the effectiveness of an October surprise (which should not be the objective of an investigation). Likewise, he should have conducted at least a preliminary review to get a sense of how many emails there were and to exclude duplicates of emails that had already been reviewed. Having worked on various large document reviews myself, I can tell you that there's off the shelf e-discovery software that can do this. The letter and the way in which this was handled, [in violation of standing DoJ policy](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/us/politics/comey-clinton-email-justice.html?_r=1 utm_source=huffingtonpost.com utm_medium=referral utm_campaign=pubexchange_article mtrref=undefined), shows a worrying lack of adequate precautions to minimize the political fallout.

If Comey was lied to about when the emails were discovered (which would have been apparent before the election in light of the reporting), the people who lied should have been publicly fired and censured so that voters could take the attempt to manipulate the election outcome into consideration when voting.

Likewise, if Comey knew about the emails before October 27, then he may have mislead or outright lied to Congress in his letter. 

All of this is made worse by the contrast in how the Russian hacking and potential Trump collusion were handled.

Comey specifically refused to sign the FBI onto the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) [statement on October 7, 2016 that publicly attributed the attacks to Russia](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement)even though he agreed that Russia was behind the hacks and [had wanted to write an Op-Ed to that effect](http://www.newsweek.com/fbi-director-james-comey-russian-tampering-election-576417)supposedly because the October 7 statement was being issued too close to the election. But recall that 3 weeks later, to the day, from the initial release of the October 7 statement on Russian interference (which didn't explicitly say the interference was to help Trump), on October 28, Comey sent the letter that damaged the Clinton Campaign. Apparently 11 days wasn't too close to the election, but 31 days was.  (Whatever Comey's motives, his decision to do this against others insistent advice embodies the "I know best" attitude that I find absolutely infuriating.) 

The DHS/ODNI statement even [came up at the third debate on October 19](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/) and Trump questioned it in front of millions of people. 


Despite now vowing to do [everything in his power "identify, investigate and then call out foreign efforts" to influence an election](http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_TRUMP_RUSSIA_COMEY?SITE=AP SECTION=HOME TEMPLATE=DEFAULT CTIME=2017-04-13-12-52-45), Comey couldn't even be bothered to say a quick "actually, the FBI agrees with the October 7 statement" to refute the disinformation and innuendo Trump was spreading by mischaracterizing the FBI's non-endorsement of the statement as an indication that it was unreliable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, that's not accurate and the [NYT was criticized for its reporting of this issue](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/kausfiles_special/2001/11/everything_the_new_york_times_thinks_about_the_florida_recount_is_wrong.html). 

The recount stopped by the SCOTUS in *Bush v. Gore* was a statewide recount ordered *sua sponte* by the Florida Supreme Court under the supervision of Judge Terry Lewiswho was enforcing uniform standards for the process. 

In contemporaneous communications with Florida county canvassing boards, Judge Lewis instructed (*see linked article above*) that *overvotes*not just *undervotes*were to be segregated for potential counting and that those ballots where the clear intent of the voters could be discerned were to be tallied so that he could rule on the issue for all counties. This was not the standard applied by the NYT.

This is notable because there were a substantial number of votes statewide [where Gore's name was both punched in *and* written in](http://rinr.fsu.edu/winter2005/features/battlefield.html), causing a ballot to be "spoiled" (*i.e.*, registered as an overvote) and not counted by machine even though the voters intent was unambiguous. An analysis of the overvotes found about a 2.7:1 ratio of votes where Gores name was punched vs. those where Bush name was punched. Overvote ballots where the punch and write-ins matched would likely have been counted by Judge Lewis if the SCOTUS had permitted the statewide recount to proceed.  Moreover, there was ample time to complete such a recount. Given the extraordinary circumstances and compelling interest in getting the election result right, the purported deadlines could easily have been extended at least until December 27, 2000, when electoral votes were ordinarily to be certified, or possibly even to January 6, 2001, when the electoral votes were to be counted before a joint session of Congress.

The *Bush v. Gore* decision itself is widely deridedby *both* liberal and conservative legal scholarsfor its inconsistent equal protection analysis and disrespect for federalism (which the majority favored until it wasnt convenient). Evidently, even the majority knew the flimsiness of its reasoningchoosing to issue an unsigned *per curiam* opinion and expressly limiting its applicability as precedent to the specific facts of the case. 

Beyond the legal dispute, there were various acts of deliberate administrative sabotage and extra-judicial power-plays that biased the outcome against Gore, including the dilatory tactics used to stall the recount process (such as the infamous [Brooks Brothers rent-a-riot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_Brothers_riot), in which Roger Stoneyes *that* Roger Stonewas heavily involved, and Katherine Harris' orders halting the recount) as well as the [wrongful, intentionally over-inclusive purging of eligible voters from the rolls before the election](http://www.usccr.gov/pubs/vote2000/report/exesum.htm) (orchestrated by Katherine Harris and Jeb Bush). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fine, not all problems. But I think the broader point is that the EC affirmatively overrode the correct judgment of the electorate at large, and in both instances led to a worse decision. 

Whatever else one can say about the ECand there's plenty to be saidit fails more often than the popular vote at selecting good leaders. It even fails to prevent demagogues from taking power, which was one of its original purposes per Federalist 68. 

These failures are actually not surprising at all, since the EC narrows the scope of electoral competition from (1) who can win the most votes in the country as a whole to (2) who can win bare pluralities in a few swing states while locking down safe noncompetitive states simply by having a (D) or (R) next to your name on the ballot. This discards information about the *intensity* of voter preferences (*e.g.*, all of the GOP votes in Blue states and Democratic votes in Red states, as well as the excess victory margin in the states won by each candidate). This is precisely the sort of information that's can lead to a better decision. What's more, the EC makes the vast majority of states safe to ignore. So it reshapes candidates' policies away from serving most of the people in the country to appealing to closely divided states (which aren't necessarily representative), even when it doesn't change the ultimate winner. 

It's a bad anachronistic system that we need to abolish, directly through a constitutional amendment, or indirectly and more immediately, through [the national popular vote interstate compact](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/). </TEXT>

Since Trump was elected president in November, his support has declined among N.C. voters, according to poll results. While **Trump was elected with 49.9 percent of the vote in North Carolina, only 41.6 percent of voters currently approve of the job he is doing as president with 50.5 percent disapproving.** That approval number tracks closely with recent national polls, which found a 42 percent approval rating for the president.

...

Among N.C. voters, **59 percent oppose building the wall**, and support for the project is clearly split among party lines. Taking party affiliation into account, 76 percent of Republicans are in favor of pushing ahead with building the wall with 92 percent of Democrats opposing it. Among independent voters, nearly two-thirds oppose the project. Opposition to a border wall is especially strong among Millennial voters, with 65 percent against the wall. Women voters oppose the wall by at 62-32 margin, with men against the wall by a 56-39 margin. Eighty-six percent of black voters oppose the wall compared with 51 percent of white voters who are against it.

It'd be one thing if they were diligently pursuing the investigation but it were taking a while. What appears to be happening here is stonewalling by denying resources. The investigation is severely understaffed. For example, the House Select Committee on Benghazi had 46 staffers to investigate something that had been investigated 7 times before. The House and Senate Select Committees on Iran-Contra had 181 staffers. 

Trump-Russia, as of this week, had just 7 in the Senate. None were full time. And before this hire, none were legally-trained or had any investigative background.

Respectfully, fuck patience. 

If Republicans won't investigate seriously, then Democrats need to make their failure to do so into a midterm issue.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**New** from author of piece](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand/status/857254205916164097):

Source close to April Doss tells me she was brought on by the Dems and will work full time on Trump-Russia probe 

-----

The former head of intelligence law at the National Security Agency (NSA), April Doss, has been hired to work on the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, her law firm confirmed in a press release on Wednesday.

Doss, who spent over a decade at the NSA and now chairs the Cybersecurity and Privacy practice at Saul Ewing, LLP, will serve as the committee's special counsel as it examines "allegations that Russia participated in a disinformation campaign intended to benefit President Donald Trump, and claims of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia," the firm said.

Doss will join the committee on May 1.

...

A Senate source confirmed to Business Insider that Doss has been hired to work on the investigation but will not be "leading the probe."

Doss' hire comes amid reports that the SSCI's Russia investigation has stalled amid partisan bickering and staffing problems. Yahoo's Michael Isikoff reported earlier this week that, more than three months into the committee's investigation, however, it has descended into a "standoff."

The committee hasn't issued any subpoenas or requested any key documents such as emails, memos, and phone records from the Trump campaign, in part because its chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, "has so far failed to respond to requests from the panel's Democrats to sign letters doing so," Isikoff reported.

The committee's Russia investigation is also severely understaffed, the Daily Beast and Reuters reported. The seven staffers who are working on it are doing so part-time, and none has relevant legal or investigative experience.  </TEXT>

It's essentially a state-level bill of attainder directed at federal contractors. Since the contactors would be implementing federal policy, if state law interfered with that policy, there'd be a fairly clear supremacy clause/preemption issue.

I also see potential issues with equal protection and due process, as well as under dormant commerce clause doctrine (depending on how the blacklist were applied). 

I think categorical prohibitions on doing business would be the most likely to be struck down as unconstitutional or preempted. Factors and guidelines directing how CalPERS funds should be invested might fare better.     </TEXT>

-----

Comeys October 28 and November 6 letters are worthy of their own discussion. 

My main objection is that Comey sent the extremely vague initial letter:

(1) without conducting a preliminary review of the laptop emails and excluding duplicates [even though the FBI knew about it for 3 weeks beforehand](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html);

(2) knowing full-well that it would leak, and having explicitly acknowledged (*in his words*) the "[significant risk of being misunderstood" if it did;

(3) against the advice of subordinates and superiors, and in violation of long-established DoJ and general investigatory protocol;

(4) while applying a completely different standard to public disclosure of the FBI's still ongoing investigation of Clinton's opponent (see below);

and

(5) just 10 days before the electionwhile millions of people were already votinghaving apparently calculated, in part, that Clinton was far enough ahead that it wouldn't matter (which would be totally inappropriate even if Comey were correct because of the letters potential impacts on the victory margin as well as downballot races).

In his unshakable [self-righteousness](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/opinion/campaign-stops/james-comeys-self-righteous-meddling.html?smid=tw-nytopinion smtyp=cur), Comey was convinced that his own moral compass and judgment was correct and that everyone else was wrong. 

This [deep-dive NYT piece on Comey from last Sunday](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc) filled in some of the final missing pieces for me, and cast Comey in an even worse light than Id previously seen him:


**Should you consider what youre about to do may help elect Donald Trump president?** an adviser asked him, Mr. Comey recalled recently at a closed meeting with F.B.I. agents.

**He could not let politics affect his decision, he replied. If we ever start considering who might be affected, and in what way, by what we do, were done,** he told the agents.

**But with polls showing Mrs. Clinton holding a comfortable lead, Mr. Comey ended up plunging the F.B.I. into the molten center of a bitter election**. Fearing the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I. had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret, Mr. Comey sent a letter informing Congress that the case was reopened.

**What he did not say was that the F.B.I. was also investigating the campaign of Donald J. Trump. Just weeks before, Mr. Comey had declined to answer a question from Congress about whether there was such an investigation**. Only in March, long after the election, did Mr. Comey confirm that there was one.

For Mr. Comey, keeping the F.B.I. out of politics is such a preoccupation that he once said he would never play basketball with President Barack Obama because of the appearance of being chummy with the man who appointed him. But in the final months of the presidential campaign, the leader of the nations pre-eminent law enforcement agency shaped the contours, if not the outcome [*note: it totally altered the outcome*](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), of the presidential race by his handling of the Clinton and Trump-related investigations.

...

**An examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials, found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comeys approach to the two investigations, he handled them in starkly different ways**. ***In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.*** Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

**Mr. Comey made those decisions with the supreme self-confidence of a former prosecutor** who, in a distinguished career, has cultivated a reputation for what supporters see as fierce independence, and detractors view as **media-savvy arrogance**.

Whatever you think of Clinton, this double standard is inexcusable. Counter-intelligence investigations also inherently entail criminal investigations, so I dont think thats a valid distinction for why Trump was treated differently. Besides, Comey actually would have been doing the the right thing by not disclosing the FBIs counterintelligence and criminal investigations of Trump*provided he had afforded Clinton the same by-the-book treatment*. Having disclosed Clintons investigation, which he shouldnt have done to begin with, Comey now arguably had an obligation to make further disclosures in order to ensure that what he had said about Clinton would not be misleading. Instead, Comey allowed Trump to perpetuate a narrative that Comey knew was false and had himself enabled with his incomplete disclosures.  This is the peril of intervention. 

Indeed, Comey failed to attribute the DNC and Podesta email hacks to the Kremlin even as Trump publicly cited the FBIs silence on the October 7 statement to call its assessments into doubt. Here's a key excerpt from the same NYT piece, underscoring that Comey also erred on the Russia interference

Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.***

Mr. Comey said that in the intervening time, Russian meddling had become the subject of news stories and a topic of national discussion. He felt it was no longer necessary for him to speak publicly about it. **So when Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, accused Russias senior-most officials on Oct. 7 of a cyber operation to disrupt the election, the F.B.I. was conspicuously silent.**

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***
This is incoherence at best, and pure hypocrisy or an improper ulterior motive, at worst. Comey could just have said, "actually, we agree with this assesment." Yet he stood by and did nothing. This is the precise reason its why Comeys refusal to defer to others is so dangerous. Were at the mercy of his whims, and that undermines the rule of law.

---------------

Finally, [as Ive argued at length](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), the letters effect was decisive. To me, its actually harder to see how the letter didnt matter than how it did, when a swing of just 39K votes allocated among three states would have changed the outcome.  [I'm not the only one](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) with [this assessment](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/11/14215930/comey-email-election-clinton-campaign). [Not by a longshot](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/855798547505180673).

This is the most explicitly political of the criticisms Ive offered of Comeybut when the subject is a democratic election, political implications are no less important to consider than faulty investigatory procedures. Comey *should* have thought about the unpredictable ways his intervention could influence the election and if possible, chosen the option that had the least political impact.  Comey was not supposed to be the main attraction. Clinton and Trump were. Yet, the vague and improper letter on October 28, in particular, [sucked up all the bandwidth for substantive issue discussions](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/856534317987749889). The damage from this crowding out for what ultimately turned out to be a nothingburger can't be underestimated. In addition to tipping the Presidential election, it sabotaged the campaign's closing argument for downballot Democrats.

In late October, with Clinton up 6-7 points, her campaign and [President Obama began to pivot to an attack against the dysfunctional Republican Congress](http://www.cnn.com/2016/10/25/politics/obama-unleashed/) in order to build on the [momentum from Clinton's three dominant debate performances](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/clinton-probably-finished-off-trump-last-night/) and tie Congressional Republicans to the cratering Trumpwho they refused to disavow. The whole election had been gradually building to this decisive moment. Then, right in the middle of it, Comeys letter hit and yanked the football away, changing the narrative and reenergizing the flailing Trump campaign. The rest of the campaign became defense against Trump's exaggerated characterizations and outright fabrications of what the new emails contained. Democrats dropped across the board in the Senate polls and [generic Congressional ballot]( https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/senate/generic-ballot/). This was recognized at the time.

Thanks. It always makes my day when people find my blatherings worthwhile and informative.

I've probably spilled more digital ink on Comey than any other single subjectother than *perhaps* the advantages of a nationally-aggregated popular vote over the Electoral College, or my attempts to reassure people that midterms chances and downballot Democratic losses during Obama are best understood in terms of fundamental political dynamics (*e.g.*, who holds the Presidency, for how long, how popular they are) revealed by the remarkably-regular patterns we see when looking back at prior elections. 

Comey's actions bother the shit out of me for reasons I will lay out in two posts (originally meant as one but it exceeded the character limit). 

------------------

Foremost, as a lawyer, investigative procedure and ethics happens to be something I know a bit about. I don't generally advertise that fact except when asked directly, because I want the arguments to speak for themselves rather than rely on who I say I am or any purported expertise I may have. It also forces me to explain key foundational stuff to a lay audiencelike the difference between an investigator and a prosecutorrather than taking for granted that it's understood. 

What Comey did strikes me as unprecedented and highly improper. I argued against his intervention in [this detailed post from a week before the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb), which I think holds up pretty well today not only in its identification of the problem, but also its predictions. 

Essentially, Comey initially erred by editorializing at the July 5 press conference and only compounded the error with other decisions he made. Let me be clear that I don't think Comey is a garden variety partisan hack who pulls for one team or the other. Rather, he looks out for himself and what he perceives the FBI's interests to be. Over time, he has carefully cultivated a reputation for being impartial and he guards that reputation zealouslyperhaps too zealously, to the extent he forgets that his reputation isnt an end in itself. I think his press conference was an attempt to show his work and try to establish that he had reached his decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution based on the merits of the evidence he considered, without outside political pressure.

This strategy backfired spectacularly. 

Not only was Comeys decision criticized anyway, but he provided powerful ammunition to Clintons opponents when he criticized Clinton for what he characterized as extreme carelessness. Rather than reassuring Republicans that he was not carrying water for the administration and Clinton, the fact that he was so willing to commentwhen investigators *almost never* do in these situationscreated the appearance that there *had indeed* been interference, either because people independently reached different conclusions than Comey (which doesn't mean that Comey's conclusions were an unreasonable abuse of discretion), or because they inferred that Comey might be signaling that Clinton *had* committed crimes but his hands were tied. 

Compounding matters, people who arent legally-trained often dont understand that a criminal offense consists of [**both**]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrence) an *actus reus* (a voluntary wrongful action) **and** a requisite degree of *mens rea* (culpable intent). Even criminal statutes that don't explicitly mention intent are construed to contain a *mens rea* requirement. [*See*, *e.g.*, *Morissette v. United States*]( https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=787130527265701764 q=342+U.S.+246,+251 hl=en as_sdt=2006), 342 U.S. 246 (1952) (Crime, as a compound concept, generally constituted only from concurrence of an evil-meaning mind with an evil-doing hand  As the states codified the common law of crimes, even if their enactments were silent on the subject, their courts assumed that the omission did not signify disapproval of the principle but merely recognized that intent was so inherent in the idea of the offense that it required no statutory affirmation.)

This is an essential protection of substantive criminal law, and is encapsulated by the Latin maxim:

*Actus reus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*

Which translates to:

 An act does not make a person guilty, unless the mind is guilty.

**Many people understood that Clinton had committed a crime but got off on some technicality, when in fact the absence of *mens rea* negates the crime.** In other words, Clinton didn't unintentionally "commit a crime"which requires a criminal conviction upon proof, to a jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, of all the elements of the offense, *including* culpable intent. People yelling "lock her up!" or calling for Clinton to be disqualified from the election based on purported criminality were basically calling for punishment without a criminal indictmentlet alone a trial. 

The Trump campaign did everything to encourage this misunderstanding of criminal law and procedure. And the strategy was highly effective politically. Recall that the aftermath of the Comey press conference was [the first time Clintons poll numbers sank sharply](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/national-polls/#now), and that they didnt fully recover until *after* the Democratic National Convention. At one point, Trump took the only lead of the campaign in the 538 forecast, which is further indirect evidence of how much Comeys letters (and the media's sensationalist coverage of them) likely mattered.  


-----------------

Just as importantly, the press conference presented all this derogatory information about Clinton outside the context of adversarial legal proceeding where it could be challenged and various defenses could be presented. Now, this is the sort of procedural issue that might concern a lawyer a lot more than a non-lawyer. But think about what you'd want to happen if you were in the shoes of the person being investigated. Would you want the FBI using its coercive investigatory powers to obtain evidence, ultimately finding that the evidence wasn't enough to warrant a criminal referral, yet still publicly criticizing your alleged actions that, *by their own admission*, could not support a criminal indictment? 

This is essentially what Comey did. And it was wrong.


In his capacity as FBI director, Comey is not a prosecutor. Hes more like a senior police detective*an investigator*. Investigators almost always dont disclose derogatory information about the subjects of their investigationsthat is, unless and until theres a public indictment *by a prosecutor* that relies on the information. Comey had every right to give his most brutal assessment to the prosecutor with jurisdiction and discretion of whether to pursue charges against Clinton. But its not Comey's place to publicly scold anyone for admittedly non-criminal conduct. These rules and norms exist to ensure due process and curb the immense potential for [abuse](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-09-08/entertainment/9103070622_1_hoover-legendary-fbi-director-secret-files) through extrajudicial disclosure of investigatory or surveillance information.  

Riley Robert's excellent profile of Comey, from September of last year, is worth reading in full because its turned out to be prescient of the pitfalls of Comeys obdurate[e] self-assur[ance]:

[The Case Against James Comey](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/09/james-comey-fbi-accountability-214234)

Having fueled a firestorm of innuendo with his extraordinary press conference, Comey was then hauled before Congress multiple times to give testimony, where he further discussed investigative information that would normally not be disclosed absent an indictment. And when the laptop emails came to light months afterward, he felt compelled to supplement his initial testimony (at his discretion, because it was not required and against DoJ guidelines, in any event).

	<TEXT> For the second time in two major legislative battles, the Trump White House has issued an ultimatum  only to back down.

In the health care debate, the president was going to force a House vote on the package and dare skeptical Republicans to vote against replacing Obamacare, before abandoning that plan in the face of defeat.

And now, in the government funding debate, he's backing off his previous demand that Congress approve funding for his border wall.

...


The wall, of course, was the biggest applause line for Trump throughout his campaign  often taking the form of a call-and-response with his approving crowds. And given how divisive it is, inserting it into must-pass legislation like a government funding bill seemed to be the best way to get what Trump wants.

That's what the White House tried. Office of Management and Budget Chairman Mick Mulvaney said last week that any government-funding bill must include funding for the border wall. Throughout the weekend, top White House aides including Mulvaney suggested Trump might veto a spending bill that doesn't fund his border wall. Chief of staff Reince Priebus told The Post on Sunday that Trump's insistence on that point remained strong.

Fast forward a little more than 24 hours, and Trump apparently abandoned that demand. With still four days to go in the funding battle, he showed his hard-line stance wasn't so hard-line, after all. Basically, he had his bluff called  again.

...

This kind of bluffing and having it called is undoubtedly something Trump is used to in the business and real estate worlds. But in the political world, you are negotiating with the same people over and over again. And the lesson of the first two big congressional debates is that when Trump says a bill must contain XYZ, he doesn't really mean it; it's just posturing. And that doesn't bode well for future Trump demands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far we've found that he's constrained by public opinionor more specifically, others' perception of itas well as by the judiciary, and his own lack attention span amd basic competence.

Unless the photo op with all 100 Senators later today is a ploy to get them all in his grasp for a quick Palpatine-like purge (we know the Orange One watches Star Wars, after all), he's also going to continue to be somewhat constrained by the Senate and the dysfunctional House GOP caucus.

If independent Congressional oversight remains a farce, we might have to make do with gridlock until 2018 and hopefully Comey's desire to atoneor be lauded.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This appears to be new reporting and should be upvoted to the front:

The Turkish man who gave Mike Flynn a $600,000 lobbying deal just before President Donald Trump picked him to be national security adviser has business ties to Russia, including a 2009 aviation financing deal negotiated with Vladimir Putin, according to court records.

The man, Ekim Alptekin, has in recent years helped to coordinate Turkish lobbying in Washington with Dmitri David Zaikin, a Soviet-born former executive in Russian energy and mining companies who also has had dealings with Putins government, according to three people with direct knowledge of the activities.

**This unusual arrangement, in which Alptekin and Zaikin have helped steer Turkish lobbying through various groups since at least 2015, raises questions about both the agenda of the two men and the source of the funds used to pay the lobbyists**.

...

Flynn has offered evolving accounts of his lobbying work for Alptekin. In September, Flynn reported his client as a Dutch shell company owned by Alptekin. After being forced to leave the White House  reportedly because he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about his conversations during the transition with the Russian ambassador  **Flynn filed new paperwork in March acknowledging that his lobbying work principally benefitted the Turkish government.**

**The revelation of Russian business ties to the man who hired Flynn  which has not been previously reported  threatens to complicate the White Houses struggle to escape the shadow of the FBI investigation** into whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with Russian agents.

----

Regardless of what Flynn claims in his retroactive foreign agent disclosure, if it turns out that whatever work Flynn ostensibly did for the Turkish govenrment was actually paid for by the Kremlin through intermediaries, let's just say that might be a tad problematic for the Trump Regime.  </TEXT>

Also, to be clear, the "current political climate" of which you speak entails:

(1) the passage of 142 years since the uprising by white supremacist dead-enders of the earlier failed rebellion they'd mounted to preserve the right to keep black people as draft animals;

(2) the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolishing that repugnant institution, at great cost in blood;

(3) the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment formally granting former slaves full citizenship and equal protection under the law; and

(4) a Civil Rights Movement to end a century of Jim Crow, during which this illusory promise of full citizenship for blacks existed only on paper.        </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to whom and by what criteria? 

I was talking about fundamentals for 2018. In 2016, fundamentals models had a generic Republican winning the popular vote by about 2% against a generic Democrat.

Instead, Clinton won the popular vote by about 2.1%. Pre-Comey, she'd been leading national polling averages by about 6-7% and ended up  at roughly 3-4%. So Clinton slightly underperformed the national polling averages by 1-2% (which were more accurate than 2012), but overperformed the fundamentals models by about 4%. 

In any event, neither the polling based models nor the fundamentals predicted a landslide loss for Trump.

	<TEXT> My guess is that you may have misunderstood what your uncle was saying. 

We've placed substantial restrictions on our ballistic missile subs (SSBNs). But we most certainly still have them in active service, and they're still nuclear armed. They're probably the most important leg of the triad. 

We have 18 Ohio-class subs. Originally, all of them were SSBNs. The first 8 subs of the class carried the Trident I (C4) missile, whereas the last 10 subs carried the Trident II (D5), which is currently in service. The 4 subs that carried Trident Is were converted into dedicated cruise missile subs (SSGNs), and their Trident missiles were removed. The other 4 that carried Trident Is were retrofitted to carry the Trident II. So we have 14 active Trident II subs. 

Maybe what your uncle was saying is that we don't have **submarine-launched nuclear cruise missiles**? The US reportedly phased out its tactical nuclear warheads on its submarine launched cruise missiles in the 1990s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  Judge McCullough gets major respect. 

Just as McCullough was able to observe what the NC legislature has done with Governor Cooper, Gorsuch saw what  McConnell and the GOP Senate did to Judge Merrick Garland.

Think about Gorsuch's stature if he'd declined the nomination publiclymaybe even at the press conference where Trump announced it. The media would have been fawning over him. As would people who disagree vehemently with his judicial philosophy.

Trump could of course have withdrawn his nomination on the spot, but it would look terrible. Trump wouldn't be able to undo his prior lifetime appointment by Bush. So in the worst case, Gorsuch goes back to being possibly the most high-profile federal appellate judge in the country (who would very likely get nominated to SCOTUS down the line).

If, on the other hand, Gorsuch managed to somehow persuade Trump to re-nominate Garland (which would have been a smart political move by Trump that would've taken a lot of steam out of the current legitimacy crisis), there'd be tremendous pressure to re-nominate Gorsuch for the next open seat, or if the Garland nomination failed. Democrats would find it almost impossible to deny him an up or down vote after he made such a dramatic stand. Indeed, Gorsuch might have won many of them over to affirmatively supporting him with such a move. He could then take his seat on the Court as a consensus choicewith much more clout than he currently enjoys (he'd be the guy who stood up to Trump rather than the guy having the highest achievement of his legal career handed to him on a silver platter after it was usurped from another deserving jurist).

This type of legitimacy is vital for judges, who lack the power of the sword and purse, and must depend on their integrity and ability to persuade.    </TEXT>

Businessman and philanthropist Jeff Bartos has entered the 2018 race against Sen. Robert P. Casey  Jr. (D-Penn.), one 10 Democrats seeking reelection in a state President Trump won last year. Bartoss introduction video hits on a theme several Trump-era Republicans have embraced  that Washington is booming as political insiders take care of themselves.

The problem: Bartoss campaign has mixed up Washington with a city in China.

In the video, as Bartos says there are construction cranes everywhere in Washington, [theres a jarring, sweeping image of girders going up in a city much larger than Washington](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp-content/uploads/sites/47/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-24-at-6.45.32-PM.png w=1484). On Getty Images its labeled aerial view of construction, shoot by drone, and supplemental information makes clear that the picture is from the city of Hangzhou, with more than 11 times the population of Washington  and with no height limit.

Sen. Casey should use this to blow apart the entire theme as phony. And in any event,** it's mindbogglingly stupid to campaign against Washington when your party controls it.**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't be (assuming you didn't mean it sarcastically). Turnout is cyclical when you take a step back and look at the broader pattern in American history. 

The President's party almost always does badly in midterms. In 39 elections since 1862, it has lost seats in the House (or a share of the House, while it was expanding) in 36 of them. 

[This 538 article does a good job of explaining this with data since the 1920s.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-wont-defy-midterm-gravity/)

 A significant part of this midterm backlash effect stems from the opposition party's base being more mobilized and turning out at a *relatively higher rate* than the President's party's base. Since Obama is no longer in power, we expect Democratic turnout to rebound and Republican turnout to be relatively depressed. But another component is voters who switch sides. They create a 2-vote margin when they swing from the governing party (I know that's a generous term for the GOP) to the opposition.

In 2018, with an unpopular and extremely divisive Republican President facing a legitimacy crisis, I would expect based on the fundamentals to see turnout resemble much  2006 than 2014. Don't be surprised if we get a relatively high turnout (40%) midterm where young people comprise a higher proportion of the electorate than 2010 and 2014, and Democrats retake *at least* the House. 

The Senate will take more doing given the extremely unfavorable map. But it's far from impossible. And at this point I expect most of the Democratic Senators in states Trump won to hold on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno. 2008 was pretty damn emotional. Bush was a terrible President, and he couldn't leave soon enough. His second term (arguably) was better than his firstapart, of course, from that whole global financial meldown and 2nd worst recession in living memory thing at the end. 

Seeing people forget that *so* quickly, by the time the 2010 midterms rolled around, despite the unprecedented GOP obstructionism on Oba's legislative agenda and limited time the electorate afforded hom to start undoing the tremendous damage Bush and the GOP had wrought, was very disheartening.


 But it also showed how strongly cyclical American politics is. And that's why I'm not so worried about 2018just looking forward to it. I remember the relief in 2006 when we *finally* put a check on Bush. And I'm eagerly awaiting that relief again.

Encouraging:

Jon Ossoff benefited from an unusually strong turnout in the first round of voting in Georgias Sixth Congressional District last week, surpassing all recent benchmarks for Democratic turnout in an off-year election, according to an Upshot analysis of newly released voting data.

Past Democratic primary voters represented a larger share of the districts voters than they did in 2016 or 2014, and they turned out in greater numbers than in a typical midterm election.

The election in Georgias Sixth is only the latest in a string of special elections where Democrats have turned out in impressive numbers. Its a reversal from recent off-year elections, when Republicans turned out at far greater rates than Democrats.

...

**The Republican turnout was not weak. Past Republican primary voters turned out at rates that were nearly typical for a midterm  a rare feat for a special election.** It was enough to keep Mr. Ossoff beneath the 50 percent necessary to win outright.

**But Democrats did something even rarer: A larger percentage of Democratic primary voters turned out than did Republican primary voters**, by a four-percentage-point margin. **Even when Democrats surged in successful years nationally in 2006, 2008 and 2012, their turnout of primary voters didnt beat that of the Republicans, either nationwide or in Georgias Sixth.**

...

...Democrats ... did a far better job of turning out younger and less regular voters than the Republicans did. Over all, 56 percent of Democratic primary voters under age 45 turned out to vote, compared with 43 percent of past Republican primary voters of the same age. Similarly, 45 percent of past Democratic primary voters who didnt vote in the 2014 midterm elections ultimately voted, compared with 34 percent of Republicans.

The strong Democratic turnout wasnt the only reason Mr. Ossoff came close to winning last Tuesdays election, and could still win in Junes runoff. **Mr. Ossoff, who won 48 percent of the vote, plainly won a considerable share of past Republican primary voters, who outnumbered Democrats by a margin of 52 percent to 29 percent.** The implication is that Mr. Ossoff probably won 15 to 20 percent of past Republican primary voters, and around two-thirds of those who had never voted in a partisan primary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't disagree with you, but I think there are different contexts that call for different approaches. In an interview like this, on balance, it's probably better to get him rambling a bit and let his mouth get ahead of his mind. At a press conference, though, I would take the exact opposite approach.

Here's part of [a comment that I posted a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5oc9ra/comment/dciehhl) arguing for specific closed-end yes or no questions:


[Trump shouldn't be asked complex open-ended questions]. 

As Trump showed at the recent press conference, he'll ramble all over the place and turn the tables. 

He can't be asked any question that (1) contains multiple parts, (2) has an "and" or an "or," (3) calls for a comparison, or (4) invites any sort of narrative "why" response. Sometimes, you may want Trump to ramble on a subject, but it's better that the rambling be on the "how" rather than the "why"--because "how" isn't his strong point. 

The press needs to treat him as an an attorney treats a hostile witness on cross-examination. 

Short, pointed, single-issue factual questions that are hard to dodge (and that you likely already know the answer to through background research). There's no way to get real information out of him directly. So you force him to contradict his prior statements, official positions, or make ill-considered inadvertent admissions.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Key issue: this may not be revenue neutral. So it ordinarily would not be subject to reconciliation under the Byrd Rule. Theoretically, it could therefore be stopped by a Senate filibuster:

President Trump wants his administration to draft a tax plan that would cut the corporate tax rate to 15 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday.

The Journal, citing "a person familiar with the directive," reported that Trump told his staff last week that he wants to be able to sell a large tax cut to the public and is **less concerned about the proposal adding to the deficit.**

...

The corporate tax rate is currently 35 percent. Trump also proposed a 15 percent rate during his presidential campaign, while the House Republicans' tax plan proposes lowering the corporate tax rate to 20 percent.

Now, if Trump thinks he can sell this to the American People in order to break a likely Democratic filibuster politically, he's deluded (always a distinct possibility with him). [A recent Pew poll](https://twitter.com/pewresearch/status/856335640564301825) showed that 62% of the public thinks some corporations don't pay their fair share of taxes. That's the highest of any of the categories polled.

So unless he's setting himself up for failure, or has been beenly advised about what's possible under existing Senate procedure, maybe he intends to have his GOP Senate allies pull a nuclear option to broaden the scope of the Byrd Rule or simply kill the legislative filibuster.  </TEXT>

There's a reason we have civilian oversight of the military. Before we do these sorts of things, we need to think long and hard about who we support and with what objectives. Next we should look carefully at the anticipated long-term ramifications of that support compared to the next-best alternative. Then we need to do our best to identify unknowns and uncertainties and vigorously debate the alternatives in a context that encourages and respects dissent. *Only then* should the President decide among competing policies. (I can't imagine the Orange One doing a quarter of this).

And, even when you have a robust policymaking process, you can still fuck up.

	<TEXT> Yes we *can* point the finger at Comey because he sent his extremely vague letter:

(1) without conducting a preliminary review of the laptop emails even though the FBI knew about it for 3 weeks beforehand;

(2) knowing full-well that it would leak, and having explicitly acknowleged (in his words) the "[significant risk of being misunderstood](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/28/read-the-letter-comey-sent-to-fbi-employees-explaining-his-controversial-decision-on-the-clinton-email-investigation/?utm_term=.5b2bc866f165)" if it did;

(3) against the advice of subordinates and superiors, and in violation of long-established  DoJ and general investigatory protocol;

(4) while applying a completely different standard to public disclosure of the FBI's *still ongoing* investigation of Clinton's opponent (*see my reply to the post above*);

 and 

(5) just 10 days before the electionwhile millions of people were already votinghaving apparently calculated, in part, that Clinton was far enough ahead that it wouldn't matter (which would be totally inappropriate *even if* Comey were correct because of the letters' potential impacts on the victory margin as well as downballot races).


In his unshakable self-righteousness, Comey was convinced that his own moral compass and judgment was correct and that *everyone else was wrong.* The result: President* Trump. Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch. *Majority* Leader McConnell. 

Thanks Comey!

	<TEXT> [Comey's letter, by itself, was enough to tip the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2) (my take).

Here's [Kevin Drum's excellent compilation](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) of evidence.

And [Vox's](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/11/14215930/comey-email-election-clinton-campaign).

Were there *other* factors that could *also* have tipped this extraordinarily close election? Absolutely. In law, this is called **concurrent causation**. 

Comey is a particularly important cause because it's quantitatively discernible with a high degree of statistical confidence, and has such important prospective implications for our democracy.    

As Drum points out in his piece above, the claim that Comey *didn't* cause Clinton's loss seldomif everengages and tries to reconcile this overwhelming evidence. For my part, I've yet to see even an attempt to do so.

	<TEXT> You're right that it isn't the full story.

Comey's letter to Chaffetz (and earlier editorializing while declining to make a criminal referral in July 2016) *shredded* the long-established norms for investigations. 


Excerpt from [the long NYT piece yesterday addressing Comey's unprecedented actions](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/us/politics/james-comey-election.html?_r=0 referer=https://t.co/gU4pdevSXc):


**An examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials, found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comeys approach to the two investigations, he handled them in starkly different ways**. ***In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.*** Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

...

Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.***

Mr. Comey said that in the intervening time, Russian meddling had become the subject of news stories and a topic of national discussion. He felt it was no longer necessary for him to speak publicly about it. **So when Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, accused Russias senior-most officials on Oct. 7 of a cyber operation to disrupt the election, the F.B.I. was conspicuously silent.**

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***

Comey may be far better than whomever the Orange One would replace him with. But he's no misunderstood hero in this story. If it weren't for his misconduct, we would have Trump as President.

	<TEXT> How is this Comey propaganda?

This piece is *criticizing* Comey, and arguing that whatever Clinton's mistakes and shortcomings as a candidate, they don't absolve him of responsibility for his election-altering misconduct.

That conclusion seems unassailable. And [Comey is under investigation by the DoJ inspector General because of it](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/clinton-emails-doj-inspector-general-investigate-fbi-comey-actions-n706186).

	<TEXT> #####**Yes, Comey mattered  a lot**

**Its strange that people are even debating  point**. After all, just after the election, it was widely established that top officials in both the Clinton and Trump campaigns saw Comeys announcement of newly-discovered emails as a game changer. For instance, see this piece from Politicos Glenn Thrush, which reported that to be the case. Thrush noted that Clintons chief data analytics guru saw her numbers tank among a crucial demographic: educated white voters who had been alienated by Trumps videotaped boasts of lewd groping and subsequent allegations of unwanted advances.

Meanwhile, elections analyst Nate Silver concluded that without Comey and the Russia hacking, states like Florida, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania  which Trump won by excruciatingly tight margins  might have tipped to Clinton. Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race, Silver said.

In other words, if Comey had never taken that step, we might currently be discussing the staying power of the Obama coalition and the success of the Clinton strategy  in particular, the emphasis on attacking Trumps dangerously unhinged temperament, and his campaign of racism, hate, and abuse directed at Mexican immigrants and women  in driving college-educated whites into the Democratic camp.

**It is often argued that Comey is not responsible for Clintons loss, because he did not force her to set up a private server, or de-emphasize her economic message, or neglect the Rust Belt.** But this argument is weak. It can be true that Clinton was a very flawed candidate who made mistakes, even as it is also true that **Comeys letter had a major impact on the outcome  and potentially a decisive one  without which the Clinton strategy might have prevailed.** Given that the **Comey revelations ended up amounting to nothing in substantive terms, the fact that his decision did have such a large impact reveals his handling of the whole mess to be indefensible and reflects terribly on our political process**. Clintons real failings should not be permitted to minimize the significance of that.

It was not unreasonable for the Clinton team to conclude that the strategy of casting Trump as temperamentally unfit to handle national security  and too hateful and divisive to lead our diverse country  was going to succeed. Polls indicated for months that Clinton was on track to become the first Democrat to win a majority of college-educated whites in over half a century. Many analysts across the spectrum had concluded that such an outcome would probably cripple Trumps ability to prevail by running up enormous margins among white voters.

**And whatever the Clinton teams motives in making a big issue out of Trumps race-tinged campaign, it was the right thing to do.** For all the talk about Clinton playing identity politics, the candidate who played identity politics to a far greater extent was Donald Trump. His campaign  which fused the relentless scapegoating of Muslims and undocumented immigrants with revanchist appeals to **Make America Great Again  was all about encouraging and playing to a sense that white identity and white America were under siege. It was important for the country that Clinton call out Trumps white nationalist appeals for what they were  and that she defend the minority groups that he had targeted for vilification. Not doing so would have been an abdication.**

	<TEXT> Lichtblau is Russian deza of the highest order. Did you also post his article about how the FBI found no clear links to Russia in its investigation back in October? 

As it happens, [I was actually the one who posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5af8ku/was_a_trump_server_communicating_with_russia/?sort=confidence) the Slate article about [the Trump server suspiciously communicating with Alfabank](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html) that the [NYT article you're referring to](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/us/politics/fbi-russia-election-donald-trump.html) was used to quash*even though* [the FBI is apparently *still* investigating that potential link](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/09/politics/fbi-investigation-continues-into-odd-computer-link-between-russian-bank-and-trump-organization/). 

I've been highly critical of the October 31 NYT articlewhich *still* hasn't been retracted by the NYT, even though [it's garbage](https://mediamatters.org/blog/2017/01/17/when-new-york-times-helped-trump-putting-brakes-russian-hacking-story/215027). 

Good eye in noting that Lichtblau had the byline on that article as well as this one. I hadn't noticed that. But also note that Matt Apuzzo, Michael S. Schmidt, and Adam Goldman all have bylines *before* Lichtblau on this article, which directly contradicts the October 31 piece. 

I suggest that, in the future, you should check people's posting history before you make baseless accusations of shillingwhich, besides embarrassing you, are against the basic rules of this sub. 

Hillary Clinton's shit campaign cost Hillary the election, full stop. It's her job to get people to the polls for her - her and her staff. Russian deza didn't cast any ballots and neither did James Comey... except for his. If you don't like that his investigation into Clinton's illegal behavior made her look bad, maybe you can cry me a river.

I'm not going to waste time laying out Comey's misconduct again or re-arguing how the improper letter was decisive when a swing of 39K votes allocated among three states tipped the election. I've already linked to fully elaborated analyses of both issues. [I'm not the only one](http://m.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2017/04/lets-talk-about-bubbles-and-james-comey) with [this assessment](http://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/1/11/14215930/comey-email-election-clinton-campaign). [Not by a longshot](https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/855798547505180673).

 Clinton made mistakes in her campaign. Ive never denied that. But blaming her loss all on these mistakeswhile failing to recognize the role of the Russian interference campaign, Comey, or the [false equivalence and double standards in the media's reporting of the Clinton campaign](https://shorensteincenter.org/news-coverage-2016-general-election/)is far too tidy and oversimplified.

	<TEXT> Lol. This is sarcasm, right? 

Most of what I posted was an excerpt from the NYT article. 

Comey's letter almost certainly cost Clinton the election. 

Russia's DNC/Podesta email dump via Wiikileaks and "active measures," together with Trump's use of the hacked information, probably also were enough to tip the election. 

Those statements are totally consistent, if you're suggesting that holding Comey accountable for his misconduct somehow exonerates the Kremlin (it doesn't).

	<TEXT> That doesn't quite fit with what actually happened. Obama was in favor of attributing the hacks and interference to Russia (even if the Trump aspect of it was kept.secret), and actually did so in a October 7 joint statement from the ODNI and DHS. Comey declined to endorse the statement *despite agreeing with it*.

Excerpt from *this very piece*:

As [I said a week before the vote](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb), Comey's improper actions made me feel like we were living in a banana republic.

Some key excerpts from this article:

**Should you consider what youre about to do may help elect Donald Trump president?** an adviser asked him, Mr. Comey recalled recently at a closed meeting with F.B.I. agents.

**He could not let politics affect his decision**, he replied. If we ever start considering who might be affected, and in what way, by what we do, were done, he told the agents.

**But with polls showing Mrs. Clinton holding a comfortable lead, Mr. Comey ended up plunging the F.B.I. into the molten center of a bitter election**. Fearing the backlash that would come if it were revealed after the election that the F.B.I. had been investigating the next president and had kept it a secret, Mr. Comey sent a letter informing Congress that the case was reopened.

**What he did not say was that the F.B.I. was also investigating the campaign of Donald J. Trump. Just weeks before, Mr. Comey had declined to answer a question from Congress about whether there was such an investigation**. Only in March, long after the election, did Mr. Comey confirm that there was one.

For Mr. Comey, keeping the F.B.I. out of politics is such a preoccupation that he once said he would never play basketball with President Barack Obama because of the appearance of being chummy with the man who appointed him. But in the final months of the presidential campaign, the leader of the nations pre-eminent law enforcement agency shaped the contours, if not the outcome [*note: it totally altered the outcome*](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2), of the presidential race by his handling of the Clinton and Trump-related investigations.

...

**An examination by The New York Times, based on interviews with more than 30 current and former law enforcement, congressional and other government officials, found that while partisanship was not a factor in Mr. Comeys approach to the two investigations, he handled them in starkly different ways**. ***In the case of Mrs. Clinton, he rewrote the script, partly based on the F.B.I.s expectation that she would win and fearing the bureau would be accused of helping her. In the case of Mr. Trump, he conducted the investigation by the book, with the F.B.I.s traditional secrecy.*** Many of the officials discussed the investigations on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to reporters.

**Mr. Comey made those decisions with the supreme self-confidence of a former prosecutor** who, in a distinguished career, has cultivated a reputation for what supporters see as fierce independence, and detractors view as **media-savvy arrogance**.

-----

Here's another key point made by this piece, underscoring that Comey also blew it on the Russia interference:

Mr. Comey and other senior administration officials met twice in the White House Situation Room in early October to again discuss a public statement about Russian meddling. But the roles were reversed: Susan Rice, the national security adviser, wanted to move ahead. **Mr. Comey was less interested in being involved.**

At their second meeting, ***Mr. Comey argued that it would look too political for the F.B.I. to comment so close to the election, according to several people in attendance. Officials in the room felt whiplashed. Two months earlier, Mr. Comey had been willing to put his name on a newspaper article; now he was refusing to sign on to an official assessment of the intelligence community.***

Mr. Comey said that in the intervening time, Russian meddling had become the subject of news stories and a topic of national discussion. He felt it was no longer necessary for him to speak publicly about it. **So when Jeh Johnson, the Homeland Security secretary, and James R. Clapper Jr., the national intelligence director, accused Russias senior-most officials on Oct. 7 of a cyber operation to disrupt the election, the F.B.I. was conspicuously silent.**

***That night, WikiLeaks began posting thousands of hacked emails from another source: the private email account of John Podesta, chairman of the Clinton campaign.***
