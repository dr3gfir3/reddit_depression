	<TEXT> Yes, it's RJ.  He ran on a platform of Jobs!!!  But I can tell you that in WI there are MAJOR (mannnnny Billion $ industries) which are blue collar and hire people for solid long term union labor jobs working in paper mills, ship yards, etc that fire them at their 89th day.  Because on day 90 they are granted Union Membership.

Now Blue Collar Unions aren't without their own issues (lots of issues) but firing perfectly good workers at day 89 so you don't have to provide them benefits like health insurance, vacation, dental and eye care is unethical, and unamerican.  Not to mention blaming it on drugs . . . 

Maybe r/Trees would agree, but smoking a joint on the weekend shouldn't disqualify you from pushing pallets of supplies around a factory floor.  Treat it like alcohol.  Enjoy on your own time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's about civilians trying to survive the firebombing of Dresden.  Don't want to give too many spoilers.  

From a historical context, go research WW2 Dresden Firebombing.  We kinda already won the war, and Dresden was purely a civilian city w no industry or military significance.  Allied Generals knew this and bombed it to oblivion w a specific type of two phase bombing.  1st blow the roofs off buildings w altitude sensing conventional bombs. 2nd follow those up w purely incendiary fire bombs, which now hit exposed wood rafters.  It turned Dresden into one large oven.  Reports of casualties range from 30,000 to 210,000.  Based on refugees fleeing Nazi Germany (Eastern Front) the death toll was probably on the higher side. 

Edit: ps it's a fictional novel set in the framework of this event.  No idea what all the deletes were. Anything saucy? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't say radical.  Just more a-political and Ayn Rand's books, however much we dream of a world w objective leaders (regardless of political affiliation), her books are seen as very political.

She believes in charity of the heart, with an individual's choice on how, when, where, and how much charity to give; rather than an across the board forced charity through taxes (at the point of a gun was her common saying).  Because if you refuse to pay taxes they come to your house and demand payment.  If you refuse payment they threaten you w jail.  If you refuse jail they forceably throw you in jail, via armed officers of the law, possibly pointing guns at you if you resist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1984 and BNW are both similar but to me 1984 is as if WW2 never ended and told from the side of Russia where as BNW is as if technology becomes so advanced that people lose their ethical and moral compass, bowing to convenience and comfort.  But both books use media and manipulation of facts to distort perceptions.  Creating a weapon of mass media and publication for control of the masses.  Great many parallels! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every Governmental entity in the United States of America runs Property Taxes almost identical.

Your taxes are based on what's called a 'mill rate', derived from how much grain you needed to support the water wheel mill.  

Taxes are still called mills.  A rage of need is determined first, then the taxes are applied evenly across all real estate in the district.  If your district is taxed at 1.30 psf plus fees and special assessments, then that's your starting point.  If your property is below average, then technically you are overpaying. 

It's, pardon the pun, but par for the course, for large portfolio owners to hire outside firms to protest their taxes on their behalf. 

Say your taxes are 250,000 for a property and the tax firm protests them down to 175,000, saving your firm 75,000.  The firm will keep anywhere from 20,000 to 40,000, after expenses, depending on your agreement.  So the owner is saving less, but still some.

Sometimes owners don't give a shit.  Because 100% of the taxes are paid by tenants.  So they just pass that expense on to the occupant and get fully reimbursed.

For properties like Trumps golf courses, it's definitely more challenging to protest taxes.  And if I were him, for Mel a Largo I'd just pay whatever the county said they were.  For two reasons: 1- it's probably a hugely profitable place and arguing lower value is likely a losing battle.  2- Better PR.

But for other less performing assets, protesting taxes is the most fair thing to do.  If you are being over-charged by a blanket calculation then, and you DONT speak up and say 'hey this is unfair' then it's your own fault.

I get that this is a hit piece on Trump to make web-clicks for minting money.  And it's a political hit piece as well.  But honestly, every smart property owner, real estate investor, tenant rep, and REIT is doing the exact same thing.

Until local municipalities learn to value assets one by one, nothing (unfortunately) about this process will change </TEXT>

And less sniper / kill focused rewards


Also, at the end it'd be cool to see more reward points for 

most uplinks activated / deactivated
most damage done to ATAT
most vehicles destroyed
most uplink activations / deactivations prevented
most team members healed
most partners avenged 

Etc
