	<TEXT> I'm going to be graduating this spring with a Bachelor's in English (my concentration is Professional Writing). My ultimate goal is to edit novels. The problem is that I have done a lot of academic editing, but not a lot of editing for creative writing. 

I really need the experience before I become an editor, but I'm not sure the best way to do that. I've looked into becoming an editorial assistant, and I've also thought starting out with something different and then transitioning into editorial work.

Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was little, my friend spent the night with me while we were camping.  We slept in the same bed.  In the middle of the night, she wakes me up and says, "I don't feel so good," and promptly projectile vomits everywhere.  I back away from her and start screaming for my parents, and she follows me on hands and knees as she continues to throw up. In my mind, it seemed like she was the puke monster chasing me into a corner.

I had a huge phobia of being around sick people for years. </TEXT>
