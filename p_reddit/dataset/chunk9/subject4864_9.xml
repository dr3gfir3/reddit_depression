	<TEXT> Honestly,  I am reacting this way because I feel like you are just stiring things up and trying to get a reaction out of people (which is apparently working on me) and have already made up your mind. I guess I should have just not replied instead of engaging you and getting myself all worked up. Look, I believe what I believe from what I have studied. I am by no means enough of an authority to make a scientific case for astrology, so I have to bow out of this discussion because I have nothing of value to offer you in this subject.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prove you wrong about what? You are going on about how fake astrology is to a forum full of astrologers. Nobody here or anywhere owes you an explanation about the validity of astrology, and no one here thinks "oh, maybe rlcrew is right".  You are an insolent ass demanding that we show you astrology is real or you're not going to believe. I promise you, nobody here gives a crap if you believe in it or not, nor does anyone here need to defend astrology to you. I don't need to prove you wrong in front of everyone because everyone here believes ... so we already think you are wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because you said that none of the astrologers can give you a thumbnail theory. I question you coming into this with an open mind. People in this subreddit love to talk astrology. Try and find some scrap of evidence you can believe and then ask a question based on that. Like "Hey, I am new and am not sure how I feel about it yet, but I did some research and found that Gemini people love to talk, I do know some talkative Geminis, but my friend John is not a talker, can someone explain why?" We believe in it (to different extents) because we have studied it for ourselves, not because someone proved it to us. I'm not a moderator,  but you're welcome here, but people's interactions with you will be based on your disposition.  </TEXT>
