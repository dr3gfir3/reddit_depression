	<TEXT> Downtown, there is an apartment complex called Encore. Good price, great location. It seems you guys have the budget for it, it's within 12 minutes via the train. And a good location, close to restaurants and shopping and a grocery store. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly because people have an unreasonable hate for the author. When you get used to Brandon Sanderson or Stephen King or someone similar who pump out these huge books in record time, you start to set unrealistic expectations for when a book should be finished. 

I have heard people compare this series to Lord of the Rings  (rightfully so, IMHO) and they dont realize how much work it takes to produce a work like that. 

Hop on over to the subreddit and see all the bitching and moaning they do because Rothfuss does anything besides sit in front of his computer and write (heaven forbid he have a life, or develop a board game that hails from the book, or write something that isn't KKC). 

But yeah, I would say this is definitely a great book, series, and a great middle ground book for those looking into some middle/high fantasy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What words can I say,

For your heart to sway.

As much as I care, 

I must forbear

To beg and plead,

For I have no need

Or friends with which I can share.

 

Ho! What pain! 

For though I long to be with thee,

My beloved one,

Time and space and precious gold

Keep thee from mine supple grasp.

I long for thee, thine crafted beauty.

And though I wait, for surely my luck

Hath run low betimes, I hope and pray

That on this day, my luck will change

And bring thine hard edges

To rest with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Born in idaho, raised in Sactown. Huge Kings fan when they made the WCF run and then they stopped being good and I lost interest like most young kids do. 

Picked up basketball again when I moved to downtown Salt Lake and lived so close to the Arena. Randomly started playing 2K and could not figure out a team that wasn't a nightmare to manage.

 Liked the blazers core so I decided to gm them, and then I actually started watching the games in real life, right around last year's playoff run. I was hooked. Edging off the Clippers did it for me, fan for life now! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The worst part is this could be avoided by just remodeling the Road Home. High Ave is already a scuzzy part of town. The corner of the Walmart lot is going to be a prime panhandling area now. And my rent is surely not going to decrease because the rental companies are greedy AF. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great school! Don't worry about going to BYU. Having spent some time at BYU and other church schools, and now working on my undergrad at the U, the experience is night and day. I love it way more than the church schools for a host of reasons, most being the restrictive rules. My feeling are that if you have a testimony, the rules they apply to everyone will be obeyed. 

As for a mission, since I'm piggybacking your post, I would say wait and reevaluate, but be aware that spending time in a place like SLO will expose you to some parts of life that could lead you away from the church if you are not careful. 

I would say, having had some exposure to anti material and doubts at your age as well, and having served a mission after resolving them, that a lot of the material is put out by opponents of the church who spin material to make Joseph seem a lot worse than he was. 

And in true missionary spirit, I would say that the key to knowing he is a prophet is praying about the veracity of the Book of Mormon. So yeah. But having doubts is normal and human! Don't feel alienated because of it.



Also, go Giants! :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing that worries me about it is that when they eventually pull out of Syria ( all under the pretense that we stop contesting them) we will have the same power vacuum that existed in Afghanistan after the USSR left in the 70s, which will give some fringe groups the ability to take over and control Syria.

I think a global solution is needed, because every western country's security becomes an issue when a large extremist government is allowed to dig itself in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, this is more of a theoretical question. Can I use u sub when what would be du is on the bottom of a fraction?

Ex: the integral of (2x^2 )/4x dx

Is there any way to pull that bottom part out or do something to allow it to exist as a U sub?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the annoying part! This kid was dead last in the draft, and the 4 other picks were the pretty common TB, Gideon, KhaI, and Steel. He picked Murdock and obviously only hado the default build and these guys would not let up on him!

If my top 3 are picked in the draft, I'm basically screwed to have a bad game, I'm sure quite a few people are like that. </TEXT>
