Completely possible I am alone in this but wanted to check. 

Third party controller support seems rediculously limited for DS4. I honestly cant believe there isnt a company out there pumping out ergonomic gamepads right now, especially with so many aging gamers for the first time in gaming's history.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a hard time not mentioning Edelman in this question, too. Jules has had so much more volume, and of course in my opinion is a clutch player.....but I feel like there have been dozens of occasions where Amendola makes a huge, HUGE play, and *zero* occasions I can remember when he messed up in a big spot. 

And to take a pay cut 3 years in a row. 

I love this man. 

edit: I love the fact that so many people have so many different opinions on who it should be. Goes to show how many awesome players have been in this organization.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ESPN had nothing but people who were already well known pats haters be the ones discussing the story for months. Their reporters left verifiably incorrect information online for months and made false statements on tv. The patriots requested they remove incorrect information on more than one occasion. Once, ESPN apologized at 2 am when no one was watching....another time their reporter waited until 4 months went by to delete his false tweets, too.

All this on top of the fact that the way they delivered the story, sensationalized to the max, along with NEVER treating brady as innocent until proven guilty....which he never even was.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's never sonething I hate enough to make me not love or enjoy a game, but all the way back to Chrono Trigger, I have always felt taken OUT of the game by it, rather than into it as intended.

I would much rather experience a story....it's one thing if a main character in a game with branching story choices is one thing, but in your average jrpg, it just ends up bothering me. 

Am I in the minority? Persona 5 made me bring this up. This game is fucking soooo good and I am loving it. But I find myself wishing the main character had more of a story for himself. I like the character so much I just feel like there is a lot of lost potential by keeping him silent. And no, this isn't my first persona game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently almost 2 months into a complete lifestyle change thanks to my dog Baxter and my hero Tom Brady. Im not even kidding. I was in a horrible state of depression, my diet was soda and processed foods, and I did nothing but sit down at a computer all day. 

I lost my dog after the AFC Championship game, and sunk even lower. When the Patriots got their asses handed to them for 2 and a half quarters, Im not even kidding, it was the absolute lowest moment of my entire life. 

I was watching the game alone as I usually do and I had tears in my eyes not just because of the game but just life in general and I just thought of my dog and begged for a miracle. 

And then I saw Tom Brady, the guy who has been through so much his whole life, had to battle through his name and family being dragged through the mud, people who hated him, all of that.....and seeing what he did.....it left me speechless. 

It took a few days to sink in, but when it did, I decided to make a change. I told myself I was going to get physically and mentally healthy for my dogs sake, so that I would know for sure that his life would always live on,  but I *never* would have believed myself capable of doing it without seeing what I saw in the superbowl. 

In one day, I quit cigs, switched from processesed garbage, sugar, and soda to fruits, spinach, kale, and stopped eating anything fried. I switched my coffee to green tea. I began walking every day. It took me a month to be able to jog, but I have been able to do that for a couple weeks now. I actually ended up hurting my shoulders because I tried to do too much too quickly.....because I am that motivated. Really really weird spot to reply with such a gigantic message, but I have a feeling you can relate to me. This shoulder thing is really fucking my life up at the moment, but I am staying strong because of the same reasons that have kept me going the last couple months.  </TEXT>
