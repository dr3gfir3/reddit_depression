	<TEXT> Little backstory: I dated a girl for 6 months last year. We broke up, but managed to stay best friends. 

Now, we have little siblings who are all 10 years old. I have a brother, and she has two twin sisters. Me and my friend always said after we broke up that we expect my brother to end up ironically marrying one of her sisters. 

One of the twins decided to message me on Facebook yesterday and asked what's up. My brother was in the room, so I snapped a picture of him and sent it saying, "Him."

"Who's him?" She asks. 

"My brother," I say. 

Now tonight, she messages me again, with a school picture of her twin that was edited on some iPad app saying, "This is _____. Do you like her?" She asked me to show that to my brother. I couldn't help but go AAAAAAWWWWWWW </TEXT>

	<TEXT> J. Rogers in Alabama. A local family owned restaurant. My family ate there twice on two separate occasions driving back from vacation. Home made comfort food. Everything is made from scratch with love. BBQ, chicken, Mac n Cheese, catfish, etc. Absolutely glorious and the woman in charge is so friendly and so kind. Gave my family a big hug when we left and said, "We'll be praying for your safe journey home. Come back soon, sweetie pies!"

There needs to be more good people with a love for making good food in the world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A judo throw hurts like a motherfucker. Especially when done quickly and efficiently, it can knock the wind out of you. As for the striking power, a bigger dude is tougher to ko, but usually a knockout is all about the precision of the strike and not the power. Many times have pro fighters knocked out their opponent and said it felt like they hardly hit them. I'm not saying she won't meet her match. I'm just saying don't count her out

	<TEXT> Also, keep in mind though that despite her size disadvantage, the whole point of Judo (her base martial art which she won bronze in the Olympics) is to use your opponent's weight and size against them. A truly skilled Judoka like Ronda can throw anyone from any position no matter their size. A judo throw with near perfect technique should use almost no energy on the thrower's part. 

Once on the ground, a couple of precise strikes to the jaw will render the person unconscious. All she needs to do then is go for the kill.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, something like that happened to me. End of last summer before going into my senior year. Went on a kayak trip with my buddy. On the bus-ride upstream, his uncle let me sit next to him. I couldn't escape because it was the window seat. 

Turns to me, "Hi. I'm Uncle Jeff. Let me tell you what, my penis has gotten me into a lotta trouble over the years."

"Come again?" I said. 

"No I came too much, that's the problem."

Cue an awkward 20 minute bus-ride. My buddy was in the seat behind me laughing his ass off. His Uncle was giving me the full-blown (Giggity) sex talk! Gave me tips like "Use plenty of lube" and "wrap that sonofabitch up."

All legitimate advice, but WTF???? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He ended up getting cancer. 

He and my mom sat the three kids (me included) down last year. Mom said, "Your father has Hodgekins Lymphoma."

"What's that?" I asked, afraid cause I thought I knew. 

"It's cancer," he said, tears starting to form. 

The next three seconds dragged on forever. Little sister and brother started crying. I got a huge lump in my throat. Couldn't feel anything. Dad was wiping tears from his eyes, but wasn't outright bawling. 

"But it's very very treatable," Mom said.

"Should've started with that!" I said. I was worried for something very treatable. If you get cancer, you want Hodgekins Lymphoma. 

Next, the rest of my family said they were going to grandma's to tell her the news. Dad said that he'd probably be bawling there with her. Everyone went but me. I couldn't stand seeing my dad like that. 

He's better now. In remission </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly loved Heath Ledger. He really embodied what the Joker was. Not insane. Completely aware of his mental faculties. Yet truly believed society was some sort of disease. Something that needed to be destroyed. And the best way to do that? Turn it on itself. He believed society was one big joke. Something that only existed because people believed it did. Like a building built upon an unsteady rock. Just a slight gust can send it toppling over. "Madness is a lot like gravity! All it takes is a little push!" His monologues are some of my favorites. 

Christian Bale though... Yeah, fuck his voice, but his acting was great.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm playing through New Story+... Or I was. 

As we know, we get to keep all the upgrades and goodies from the previous playthrough. I get to the point where you go to Founder's Island for the Blimps. I take out the nearby watchtower then re-obtain the RHD. I decide, "While I'm here, might as well take out the other watchtowers and sky drones." 

I decimate the watch towers and wipe out all the serpent drones. I come to specific copter drone who's light is trained on the rooftop of a building. Without thinking, I hit it with a disruptor round then walk into it's light. Malfunction. BOOM. No more drone. 

Skip ahead a bit. Get to the point where I'm about to take out the Arkham Knight's two radars. Hijack the nearby drone for the part to blind drones with the RHD. 

Fuck. 

Fuck fuck. 

God no. 

No. 

NOOOOOOOO!!!!!

The game requires me to blind the drone that is watching the Radar. The exact one I destroyed earlier. And I can't do anything now. I can't jump to the Radar. I can't blind a drone. I can't grapple. Can't use any other gadgets. I can only look onward at the Radar just [83 M] away and weep. 

I was 48% done with this playthrough. And now I'm sad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, just a guy who likes things simple. I understand all that government does for humans. But it can only do so much. In part because we *believe* it has power over us. With our population the size it is, government is a good thing. But if our population stayed the size it was during the ice age, and we only had small tribes as a hierarchy, things would be much more simple than all this stuff we deal with now. 

No money, no crime. Any one does something that doesn't benefit the tribe? Kick them out! Let them starve! 

Everything about our society exists because we believe it does. In reality, those pieces of paper with historical figures printed on them mean nothing. Not worth anything. Gold too. And diamonds. It all has value because we believe it does. That's what separates us from animals. 

That could be a good thing. Or a bad thing, depending on how you look at it. 

Also, I do like gunpowder.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking about really buying this card. I follow UFC news constantly. I always watch the free fight night cards and prelims. The only PPV event I ever bought was UFC 181. That was a pretty good night of fights. 

I'm probably going to buy this one, because I'm a huge Aldo fan and I'm upset that I missed Aldo v. Mendes 2 (I'm an even bigger Team Alpha Male fan). 

Not a huge fan of McGregor, but I definitely see why so many people like him. He's a very good talker. People love a great public speaker. He also has some serious skills to back it up. He's funny and entertaining inside and out of the octagon. I'm not sure if he'll win, but I think he's gonna give Aldo a much bigger fight than most Aldo fans are saying. He's very unorthodox and hard to prepare for, kinda like Lyoto Machida. 

But, I can't pick against Aldo. He, GSP, Jon Jones, and Demetrious Johnson I'd say are probably as close as it gets to the perfect fighter. Aldo is crazy. Throws crazy things. I have Aldo, but McGregor will be a motherfucker to put away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a debate on who would win. Let's assume Cowboy has won. How would the UFC deal with a champ who wants to fight on every other card? 

Cerrone would be a champ even more active than Demetrious Johnson. Would he really fight every other PPV event, either as Main Event or Co-Main Event? Would the UFC tell him to wait every now and then, which would clearly drive him crazy? Would he even consider giving up the belt so he could fight more often? 

And yes, this is assuming he can hold on to the belt for a while.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because Sony and Marvel Studios only recently were able to close a deal and I'm freaking psyched about it!

Marvel sold the movie rights to several of it's characters a while back. Sony got Spidey. 20th Century Fox got the X-Men and Fantastic 4. 

Fox and Marvel are still at odds with each other. And Sony seemed to be a likely candidate to sell the rights back to Marvel. 

After Amazing Spider-Man 2 tanked, Sony realized they were in some deep shit. So, they turn to Marvel to strike a deal. 

Sony: "We'll let you use Spidey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe if you lend us some of your producers for the standalone Spidey films because most of our films were "meh" except Spider-Man 2 with Toby Maguire. We still own the rights. He's still ours. You just get to use him however you want and we use your producers and tie it in to the MCU."

Marvel: "Deal."

Until recently, Spidey wasn't in the Avengers movie universe, even though he still is in the comics. Now that Marvel can use him and all the other supporting cast, they have a lot more to work with.  </TEXT>
