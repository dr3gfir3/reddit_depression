	<TEXT> I enjoy listening to this one particular sports radio show that kinda makes fun of sports radio shows.  Last season there was a particularly brutal play in the NFL that left one player (Luke Kuechly) sobbing on the field because he was concussed so badly.  The host was talking about how shocking it was to see.  

He read a tweet on air  that was something like, "Hey Dan, this is a MAN'S sport.  Take off your panties!"

So the host spent the next 5 minutes on air describing himself "taking off his panties." And holy shit that was hilarious to hear.  

Edit: [Found the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDQ0JzjRhj0) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can see your points. 

Re:Pollos- Jimmy knows Mike gets into some pretty sketchy stuff, and the vagueness of it from Mike's end would (to me) imply being very careful. "Go here, get a coffee, watch for a specific car/person, I'm not telling you anything else." Again, it seems like Jimmy should know something probably bad is going on and to be extra careful. Not forgetting his entire life history of cons/shadiness and acting like you or I might act in the same situation. 

But yeah I can see how Jimmy's emotions probably overrode his judgement re:Chuck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did anyone else feel like Jimmy's actions this episode were pretty out of character?

His stakeout in Los Pollos was **so** amateur. Jimmy is a "professional" con artist. He should be really good at casually observing people/events without raising suspicion. The way he was so awkward and obvious this episode seemed really out of place.

And the second example, maybe future episodes will prove me wrong here... But in the previous episode, the second Chuck tricked Ernie, I immediately thought Jimmy would see through the obvious ruse. Instead he just walked right into the obvious trap.

Both of those seemed really out of character to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And a drinking problem that was building. I'm not sure how much the show developed it after season 15 or so. Starting with the episode where Homer goes to clown college (Homer makes his announcement, she says she'll have a glass of wine), then the Hank Scorpio episode (dramatic music as she has two glasses), and another episode or two in the seasons following she starts drinking quite a bit more. 

But not sure if they developed that potential arc further after that. </TEXT>

Well I wanted to mount it to my wall anyway and as for the remote? There are apps for that. I was worried maybe it would quickly die or something, but it's been a year and still looks gorgeous.

Around Christmas there was a PC for also $200/40% off that I regret not picking up as a media server.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I love Exodus, but my biggest problem is when I don't know what I want to watch and try just browsing.

Most Popular and People Watching are essentially the same lists of movies, just slightly different orders. Genres doesn't work very well, because almost every movie gets tagged with 10 different genres (for instance, Dr. Strange ends up in Action, Adventure, Sci Fi, Thriller, Suspense, probably more...), so they again end up as almost identical lists to Most Popular and People Watching.  

And the biggest problem with basically every browsing method, is they're almost all movies released in the last 2-3 years.  I've started browsing by Certificates (ratings), and that mixes in a decent (but not good) amount of older movies.  

But, the certificates lists are fairly static.  

I'm hoping someone found a script/plugin/something that shuffles any/all of the lists, so movies from the 70s/80s/90s/00s show up in any/all of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hear of the phrase, "The straw that broke the camel's back"?

I'm probably ditching Netflix at this point. Removing the things I've already watched, there's maybe only ~6 hours of content added every few months that's worth watching.  They're starting to turn History Channel in terms of just adding a ton of horrible awful shit in order to fill their catalog. 

And that VPN service I purchased after the recent new ISP fiasco? Oh, Netflix won't let me use that.  Neat.

Netflix has spent way too much money on Netflix Originals lately, instead of bolstering their non-Netflix content. 

For me, Netflix has become $10 a month for Futurama and It's Always Sunny reruns, and maybe a movie or two a month. I'm already borderline "Fuck it, I'll cancel Netflix."  If the rating system pissed me off as much as OP, it would be enough to push me to cancelling my service, since I'm already heading that way anyway. </TEXT>

Individual stylized backgrounds (as opposed to using plain backgrounds that loop), a huge amount of lighting/shading effects (as opposed to mostly flat lighting), minimal but well done 3d blending...

Go watch the simpsons episode where Bart gets a driver's license/gets stuck in Tennessee. Watch the part where the "camera" pans from the side of the car to the rear (I think when Nelson throws the toy dog out the window). 

In the DVD commentary they marvel at what an amazing job the animators did... Creating a very simple 90 pan with some amount of perspective thrown in. And it looks absolutely terrible nowadays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mac quotes Genesis as the first part of his day. The part he quotes goes - 

*And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.*  
*And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.*

Which leads to the "obvious" conclusion - his first activity is about water.

If he continued reading the next few lines...

*And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.*  
*And God called the dry land Earth;*

Really, that chapter was about the creation of Earth.  But of course Mac interprets it to be all about water.

	<TEXT> At least in Central Oregon, they so horribly mangled the transition from medical-only to recreational, it kept me on the "black market" for quite some time.  

The day it became recreational-legal here I went to my local shop and asked for an eighth. "Sorry but since we sell medicinal marijuana, we have to apply for a new permit for allowing recreational sales.  And we only are allowed to submit the permits now, and it will take 8 to 10 months for the permit to be approved."

Now I can buy no problems and the prices aren't bad.  But in Prineville it's still illegal (because the Federal government still says so, which is funny since it's such a Republican area, and normally they hate the Federal government telling them what to do...) </TEXT>

Now I tell others just read the second book. I still think it works fantastically as a standalone novel, and the first and third books are mostly meh. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] Fans of "hard" scifi - what are your views on veganism? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-15 13:39:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Disclaimer:** I am not a vegan, I've never been a vegan, I'm not trying to promote any vegan agenda. Just a thought I had recently, curious about others.

There are a good deal of near-future "hard" scifi novels out there, and there's a near-universal consensus about humans travelling the solar system - we'll be eating a lot of protein that doesn't come from an animal. 

As someone who's always wanted to live in "the future" (yeah yeah appreciate what I have now blah blah that's another discussion) I found it curious why I wouldn't take one of the "easiest" steps to emulate those characters and stories I enjoy. 

Why don't I eat like they do? There's the obvious answer - I'm on Earth, meat is readily available, why not consume it. But, I also find myself mocking people who eat "fake meat," even though they're consuming a diet much closer to my scifi heroes than I do. 

Anyway, just curious about others' thoughts on the subject. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a novel that actually deals with this.  Part 2 of the "System of the World" trilogy by Neal Stephenson. 

If you don't want to read 3,000 pages just to read this part, the **SPOILERS** tl;dr - a crew of boat slaves (the people working the oars) from the Mediterranean get caught up in the smuggling of gold/silver out of the New World.  The crew includes an englishman, african, a jewish man escaping the inquisition, a samurai, and a few others.  

(The books are "historical fiction," where the story itself involves mostly fictional characters/events, while the overall world is kept "true" to history.) </TEXT>

Being jealous is imagining a different reality - you have that thing someone else has, or that someone else loses that thing you wished you had.  

Those realities don't exist, and it's pointless wasting time thinking about them.  

Better is focusing on the real reality - what do I have, what do I want, how can I achieve that?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest gripes with google music - 

1) Playlist merging (the minor quirk, for making megaplaylists).  In spotify you could just open your current queue and merge it into a pre-existing playlist.  In gMusic you have to save your queue as a new playlist, and then merge the two playlists.

2) International music - I didn't play much of this when I was a (paid) Spotify user, so I don't know if Spotify is any better. But, for one instance, I tried a radio station based off Serge Gainsbourg - Requiem Pour Un Con, a 60s/70s jazzy french tune.  The station basically became "play anything french, it doesn't matter what genre or decade or anything, if it's french it goes in this playlist." (Some early thumbs up/down action helped steer it to what I wanted.)

3) Switching which device is playing.  Maybe I haven't searched settings enough.  On Spotify it was super nice when leaving my house to switch what was playing on my comp to my phone.  With gMusic it seems like both devices have their own setups and you can't just toggle which device is playing the exact same playlist.

But the better radio functions alone are worth it for me, plus you get free YouTube Red (no ads, can play youtube audio only, can play youtube while turning your phone's screen off).  

Plus, the security problems I had with Spotify.  For me, gMusic is definitely worth it for the same monthly fee. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Desktop Player probably resolves any of your UI issues (it looks pretty nearly identical to Spotify).  I'm currently compiling my third 1,000 song playlist, and while there's a minor quirk compared to Spotify in terms of megaplaylist creation, it's still pretty easy to do. (It's also been **way** easier for me to make good mega-playlists on Google Music since their radio station function is umpteenillion times better than Spotify's radio functions.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only reason I can think people do this is to level up their rank faster by getting "completed match" points.  Most of these weren't people trolling after bad goals or whatever.  From the start of the match, they hold down the accelerate button, and do nothing else, at all, at any point.  

This has seemed to be more common the past few months...

If the reason people do this really is to level up their ranking, maybe a system where they need a minimum of 200-250 points in order to get the "completed match" reward? So they have to at least contribute a little? 

I don't know why this is a thing or the best way to prevent it, but when a large majority of my games are 3v2 because of some jerk avoiding afk detection, matches don't feel so fun. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> (Note: This isn't a "buy books online or buy ebooks you big dummy" debate, please save those comments.)

I would drop by my local B N about once every month or two to check out their "New Science Fiction" section, typically 3-5 bookcases.  This was the easiest/best way for me to browse a whole lot of titles/authors at once, sometimes buying a hardback copy on the spot, sometimes buying the ebook later. I found a lot of my favorite books and writers this way. 

Last time I went in, there was no "New Science Fiction" section anymore.  (Apparently, there aren't any "New" sections for any categories anymore.)  I spoke to the manager of my store, hoping it was a local decision. Sadly, it isn't. 

The manager also told me, "The reason for the change is we found most B N customers enter the store looking for a specific author." I asked how having a "New" section prevented that before, and didn't get a great answer. 

I'm pretty disappointed because most online services are still pretty terrible when it comes to recommendations, and it's always a bit upsetting anywhere when a useful feature is taken away for specious reasons.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] Song - New-ish electronic song, around 120bpm, female singer and a *heavily* distorted male singer. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-03 11:42:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1) Even though it's (roughly!) 120bpm, the beat is "slow and plodding" and very simple through most (all?) of the song. For the most part it's just a steady kick/snare throughout. I think. 

2) The rest of the music was a few synth-y sounds, kinda 80's style in being long drawn out single notes, nothing too complex. The synths were mostly a higher pitch. 

3) The verses go back and forth between a typical female singer, and a very distorted male singer.  I'm not entirely sure you can really make understand many of the guy's words. Most of the pitch was removed so it sounded like a spoken word robot, recorded on an answering machine tape from the 80s, then that tape was thrown into a river for a few years, fished out, and played back over this song. 

4) The chorus is mostly the female, clear, high pitched normal singing. It goes something like "You make me some-THING / So what can I say / You make me hap-py booo-ooy / I can't explain"

The song was coming up on some Spotify radio for me for awhile, but then I stopped hearing it come up, and ended up cancelling my Spotify and switching to Google Music. 

Possible artists that I might have started a radio station from that led to this song coming up in the first place - Eskmo, Opiou, M Machine </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a recent transition from Spotify to gMusic, that's my one complaint with the gMusic service so far is their total lack of properly cataloging international music? Like I put in Serge Gainsbourg - Requiem Pour Un Con as a radio station starter, a French 70s jazz song.  And the radio just ends up being "play anything French, it doesn't matter what genre or decade or anything, if it's French, throw it in that playlist."   

Similar issues with Caetano Veloso, Gil Gilberto, Los Granadians... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually interested in all of those. I follow the NFL, and a player I respected quite a bit (since retired) played at a very high level at a much later age than most players at his position. In an interview he was asked how he was still playing at a high level when he was so old. His response was tl;dr "Maybe 2 or 3 times a week, I have a small portion of meat as like a side, otherwise I'm vegetarian." 

Since then I've taken quite a keen interest in, at the very least, severely limiting the amount of meat I eat. Can't say I could ever go full vegan, but I certainly see benefits in just about everyone eating a hell of a lot less meat for the health/environmental reasons as well. </TEXT>

Googling of course turns up a million results for AirPlay and how to stream *from* the iPhone *to* the TV, but I'm looking for precisely the opposite. Is Plex the best/only option for this? 

And as a side question - is there any way to update iOs without installing iTunes?

	<TEXT> Yeah, once Netflix really started to gain traction in the mid 2000s, the traditional media companies that gave them content started freaking out, and made new deals intended to hamstring Netflix. (That's why some titles only appear for limited times now, or seasons of tv shows take a little longer to reach Netflix than before, among other things.)

So they turned to producing content, to reduce their reliance on traditional media. And, like almost every cable channel, about 21 out of 24 hours per day is total crap.   </TEXT>

When they make their escape to the Roci for the first time, gravity is off, they say out loud "turn off your magboots and go quick!", turn off their boots, and then run like they're on Earth, just slightly more slowly.

They still think this is a malware download.  It has been one and a half years, and they do not realize this is being done by logging in through the website, and adding devices to user accounts there.

They still don't know.  I found out about this issue last night.

We trust them with credit cards?  This particular attack doesn't reveal cc info, but what does that say about their overall security, that they don't realize it's being done through their website?

Edit: Email I received today, bold for emphasis.

Hi there,
Thanks for your feedback.

We're always looking to improve Spotify in any way we can. We cant say now if or when any specific release will be out, but as soon as we've got something to announce, we'll let everyone know on the Spotify blog.

Also, we would suggest that you update your security software and application on your devices. **Sometimes, it's better to have your personal devices secured twice the normal security that everyone has :)**

If there's anything else, we're just an email away.

All the best, </TEXT>

But the other worry in this particular instance it's that it's allowing the Spotimb 0.2.1 exploit, which they've known about since July 15 of 2015, and they're still not interested in a relatively simple solution to 1) stop password mining, and 2) stop an active exploit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Full writeup I did trying to explain it on /r/Spotify - 

**Better TL;DR by Vice Magazine in 2015** - [Here](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/hackers-are-sabotaging-my-spotify-playlists-with-awful-ambient-music)

_____


Spotify's IT security just scared the shit out of me with how incompetent it is. 

1) Try logging out, and when going to log back in, type the wrong password.  Keep doing that, over and over.  **There is no limit to the number of password guesses a potential hacker is limited to.**

Notice how almost every website on earth has a system where after so many failed login attempts, you're locked out until you can verify another way?

2) This led to my receiving the Spotiamb 2.0 exploit.  An exploit that Spotify has known about [since July of 2015](https://community.spotify.com/t5/forums/v3_1/forumtopicpage/board-id/001/thread-id/134965/page/1)

(For those unaware, Spotiamb forces its way into your "Devices" list, frequently trying to either force-play certain songs, or just pausing/unpausing Spotify.)

You'll also note that the forum regarding Spotiamb is set to "Solved!" You can follow the steps on that page and get rid of Spotiamb, this is true.  **But only for however long it takes to brute-force your new password.** 

3) It's not wise, but many people use the same account name/password across a variety of websites/apps/etc.  If you have ever gotten Spotiamb (the forum runs to 8 pages), the hacker(s) know one of your username/password combinations.  Are you certain you don't use the same combo on other popular websites?

4) From that forum, Spotify's first (only?) public email reply regarding Spotiamb - 

" Thanks for your email. We understand that you're having issues with Spotiamb 0.2.1. 

Spotiamb wasn't created by Spotify. Please contact them and they'll help out with this.

We're always here if you have any problems with the Spotify service itself though. Just let us know!

Cheers,

Marc"

Wow, great response to a security threat, Marc.

______

**TL;DR** - Hackers can brute force guess your password on Spotify. I hope you don't use the same username/password combinations elsewhere.

Edit: Even if you use Free Spotify, hackers can still brute force guess.  I've never used the Facebook login, but I assume that's halfway fucking secure.
