	<TEXT> You say you practice every day. What is your practice like?

Someone mentioned it yesterday, but after warming up I like to play a "virtual round" on the range. I'll tee off with my driver. If I hit it well, I then aim at the close flag for my "second shot". If my drive was bad, I aim at one of the farther flags. If my "second shot" isn't on the mark, then I take a third shot and chip at a target ~20 yards in front of me. Then I keep track of how many "GIRs" I get that way. You can also mix it up by throwing in some virtual Par-5s and doing driver, hybrid, approach.

It's a fun way to simulate a real round and switching up clubs and taking different shots. It adds a little bit of the real pressure of, "Okay, I need to make this shot." I started doing that about a month ago and I've seen a huge improvement over just going to the range and hitting 10 balls with each club.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is something a lot of people don't understand: one small injury somewhere can create a cascading problem elsewhere as you compensate.

It's extremely common in runners. You start feeling some pain in your left knee, so you begin to favor your right leg to compensate for it. Then your right leg becomes injured as a result. 

The pitching motion uses your whole body: legs, core, arm. Any injury to one part can cascade injuries to the rest.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if my comment came off as snarky. I definitely know things are more complex than the "givers-vs-takers" metric, but your comment made it seem like that negated everything about it. 

But yeah, I mostly meant my original comment as joking. Cheers to polite internet discourse!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Well, youre making the assumption that the information would definitely have been leaked.

It absolutely, positively would have been leaked. There have been numerous reports that the New York FBI office is Giuliani-friendly and had access to the info.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely disagree. There are two scenarios here:

1. Comey notifies Chaffetz
2. Comey doesn't notify Chaffetz; others within FBI leak the info, and now you have the email story AND a cover-up story.

How can anyone say scenario 2 is the better one here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. Comey has been declining to answer every single question that went into specifics on people involved; he's done so when asked about Flynn, and Page. He's just being consistent.

I suspect Trump is indeed being investigated, but Comey's comment here is not evidence of that.  </TEXT>
