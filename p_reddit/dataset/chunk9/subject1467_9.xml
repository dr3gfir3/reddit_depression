	<TEXT> I would have to respectfully disagree with you, if you look at chickens raised commercially for meat they live miserable lives. They are specially bred and hybridized to go from hatchling to killing weight in around two months or less.

 In order to do this all of their instinctive behavior have been bred out of them except for eating as much as possible. They move as little as possible because movement = weight loss so they just stand there with their mouth half open and their eyes half closed in crowded conditions trying to breath.

 Once they reach killing weight there is a rush to get them to the processor as they will start dropping dead from heart failure.

Then you look at egg chickens. When an egg chicken is hatched it is sorted in to males and females with the males killed immediately.
For the females what sort of life they get varies with some places better than others but even the best means crowded conditions and a short life becoming soup or cat food at about eighteen months.

Even with all the economizing poultry producers have a razor thin profit margin. Putting these products on the table cheap enough that poor folks can afford them does not allow for many frills.

Now lets look at game cocks, anyone who is in this seriously does whatever they can to raise the best birds which means the best conditions, best food, medical care when they get sick, access to sunshine and grass and sex with hens. Here are some pics of game farms and game cocks so [you can see what they look like](https://www.google.com/search?q=game+farm source=lnms tbm=isch sa=X ved=0ahUKEwi_ibyZwoLTAhWNUSYKHcKGDaQQ_AUICygE biw=1366 bih=633#tbm=isch q=game+fowl+farm * imgrc=_)

A good gamecock is worth hundreds of dollars and by the standards of American cockfighting would be raised for two years before being mature enough to be allowed to fight in a match. Many different cultures practice cockfighting so they may have different practices.

 I understand that fight is controversial to say the least among people who do not participate but in nature, for many animals fighting and aggression are an imperative fact of life, roosters have a very short list of things they want to do today and fighting is pretty much at the top of that list  and what the cockfighter does is hardly worse than what a man who hunts with a hawk or a bow or a man who fishes with a hook does and these are thought socially acceptable and respectable by most.

A cockfighter on the other hand must accept a raid from a swat team and having his wife and children held at gunpoint while his birds are all summarily killed to save them from dying and then be locked up in a prison with killers and rapists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the days of slavery and Jim Crow laws blacks in some areas were restricted either by law or social convention from certain occupations and ways of making money, they could not raise cattle or horses (not as their own boss) but they could raise chickens.

The best way for a small scale chicken operation to make bucks in those days was to slaughter a few chickens and fry them up, put on your best clothes, and go down to the train station when a train was passing through and sell to people right though the train windows.

So many people saw blacks doing this that it became a meme.

	<TEXT> I have worked in California factories since the seventies and Latinos can be some of the most open race baiters around. They know they will have Latino activists backing them to the hilt if any complaints are made and white progressives are totally uncomfortable with criticizing anyone that is not white. The loonies that perpetuate the "all whites are racist, only whites are racist" crap need to shamed off the planet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A well liked receptionist at a place I was working at had a birthday and I decided to hop on my bicycle and go buy her flowers. On the way back I stopped at a red light and this van pulled up beside me with a woman driving and a guy in the passenger seat. she immediately started screaming at me for riding a bike on the road and shouting at the guy to get out and kick my ass but he just kept his eyes forward.

I am pretty sure it was all about the flowers </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the thing, the felt effects of having an unregulated mass of primarily poor and under educated immigrants flow across our border is going to be unevenly distributed across society with those with higher levels of wealth, education, and power enjoying only benefits of lower labor costs and those with lower levels of wealth, education, and power having to deal with the negative effects, having our wages held down, having to deal with people who bring a high level of cultural chauvinism, seeing factories and work crews that, when they were English speaking were open to anybody, turn into Spanish speaking work areas where only Latin Americans are hired and anyone else is excluded and shut out. 

You have to understand that your ideology is one that does not reflect the reality that I and many others are forced to deal with and I cannot afford it any more than I can afford a new luxury car. You can chose to involve yourself in these issues, for me it is forced on me.

And your tendency to declare anyone you disagree with as a "moral degenerate" shows something I have known for years, that for most progressives your emotional addiction to self righteousness is your only stake in this issue.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Proposition 187 passed easily because during the eighties there was a economic downturn in Mexico followed by a massive surge in immigration to the U.S.. Many chicano activists took this as a sign that their time had come and went on a loony binge lasting years.


If you opened a newspaper or turned on a news program in California you would be treated to chicano activists claiming that illegal immigrants from Mexico had a greater right to live in California than people of other ethnicities that were born here, demanding that non-Mexican teachers be fired from their jobs even if they could speak Spanish, demanding that Chicano activists be given special access to children in schools in order to promote an aztlanist set of beliefs and pushing the belief that if poor and uneducated people moved here from Mexico and remained poor and uneducated it was societies fault and responsibility.

 I remember turning on the TV and seeing protesters waving the Mexican flag and screaming MEXICO! MEXICO! MEXICO!and burning the American flag.

 When you have millions of people crossing a border to another country there are things you can do to either increase or decrease the likelihood of them being accepted, welcomed and successful and burning the flag of the land you have moved to and demanding special treatment and privileges that immigrants from other countries do not need is not helpful and if people voted for proposition 187 the progressive activist left had a lot to do with it </TEXT>
