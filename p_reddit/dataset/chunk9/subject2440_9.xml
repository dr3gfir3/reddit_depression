	<TEXT> Seafood curry. Probably Not Filipino. Our food is different from the rest of SE Asia because of the huge Spanish influence. Have you tried dishes cooked with produce native to the Philippines? There is also a big Filipino contemporary cuisine scene in Manila.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please try to soak your hands in a potassium permanganate solution for 15 mins. Then use a steroid ointment to help heal your hands.

Pls wear gloves at work. Something may be irritating your hands. 

Edit: changed cream to ointment. Just checked my medication.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah at the start. Then he got greedy. Power and money brings out the worst in people. He was human and he succumbed to temptation. He abused his position and bled the country dry, so all the progress he made, kinda got cancelled out by all the bad he did and even left us in the negative. 
 

You are right, we all need to change for the better. Our country needs to move forward, but we must not forget what happened in the past so that we do not repeat history.  </TEXT>
