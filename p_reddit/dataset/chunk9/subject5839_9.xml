	<TEXT> WHAT?! WHAT AGENDA? I'm actually not prepared for this if this is a troll. I don't get it? I'm oblivious to this WHOLE BOOK thingy.. all I do is play games, you can even check that in my other reddit posts. It is just frustrating how you would think of such thing?

How is it going to be one-sided? all I need to do in that essay is to come up with possible solutions to "increase book popularity in Sweden". are you actually being serious? :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry? I'm not trying anything if you think that? I'm making a school essay for how we can "improve book selling".. and I thought that I should make "making e-books" cheaper as an argument IF they are actually expensive. 

I don't have any "beliefs"? I don't understand, why are you angry at me for no reason at all? I just needed help from people who actually READ books.. :'// ?? </TEXT>
