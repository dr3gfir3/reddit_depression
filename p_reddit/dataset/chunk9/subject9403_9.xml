	<TEXT> Sad to see a lot of negative experienced. Homeschooling was mostly a highly positive experience for me. My parents chose to high school us because coming from a military family we moved around every couple of years and that made it difficult to really get involved in local programs or activities anyway. The education quality was great, and my parents - mother mainly - was very dedicated to making sure we were finding other outlets for socialization and using all sorts of creative plans for educational experiences like trips to national parks and historic sites.  
 It was a bit jarring going to a public high school because - as others have said - most people had grown up together since pre-school so it became hard in a small school to break in and make friends. The other jarring things was the massive drop in educational quality.  I entered 9th grade at a 12th grade reading level and was fairly advanced in most classes as well.  
I should mention I have known a ton of home school families that have turned out kids with very serious deficits in reading and educational abilities.  I think this is for a couple of reasons. Some people home school out of dedication to their child's educational success and to give them great advantages that can come with this style of schooling. Others home school out of some religious or societal obligation, with no real dedication to the value of their child's learning, and by far this latter group does great harm to their kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a homeschooler who's known several others both successful and unsuccessful, I'm sorry for your experience. I think it honestly all depends on the parent's involvement level. Homeschooling is not bad per-se, if the parents are proactive and dedicated to properly educating and socializing their children. I know a lot of homeschool basket-case wrecks because their parents did it out of some misplaced fad-following ideal rather than out of a desire to give their child a healthy experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Played for a few weeks with nep saving up stones for GF rolls but never got anything good. Told myself a few weeks back I would scrounge up stones for one more roll but if I didn't get Ronove I'd probably quit the game. I practically squealed when Ronove popped out,and he's carried me a long way since then.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it'd be neat if a certain enemy affected the board while you were moving orbs. Like the second your move starts five orbs randomly change color or switch to jammers, causing you two have to think on your fingertips with seconds to go.  </TEXT>
