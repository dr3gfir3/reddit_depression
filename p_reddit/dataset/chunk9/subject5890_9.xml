	<TEXT> I think I was viewing warrants incorrectly. I didn't quite know what the value was all about. For example, in my post, I mentioned I bought in at $17.xx. Now I am understanding that it means the movie had already made $17M over the strike price and finished at $19M over. There is no separate payout for "the warrant part" as I put it. The value will just keep gradually increasing until the 12 weeks is up.

I know that's old information and probably really obvious but I'm outting my dumb-dumb moment in case it helps another newbie!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I think that was the reason! It just had its warrant IPO not too long ago and I wasn't sure I wanted to tie up the funds for so long.

I'd love to read more of your thoughts if you feel like posting later!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I did end up buying into all of the current blockbuster warrants except Boss Baby though I can't remember why I didn't. It's already surpassed the strike price. Hmm... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really new to HSX and I was advised to look into blockbuster warrants to make some free money. I bought 10,000 shares of Lego Batman at $17.59 and it just delisted at $19.69. Yay! 

But I'm wondering when the warrant part comes into play. I was paid for the system selling my stock for me, but when does the warrant cash out happen? Do they need to wait for official weekend numbers? Box Office Mojo said it made over $300M and with a strike price of $155M, that should mean each share earns $145, right? 

Or am I completely misunderstanding warrants? 

*Update:* It would have helped if I had read Mojo correctly. The film made $174M, not $300M. If I had realized this earlier, the numbers would have made sense much earlier! 174 - 155 = 19. And the light bulb turns on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've ordered just once before on April 16th, it shipped the 19th, and I received it on the 21st. I anticipate a longer delay with the high demand for the foundations but a 5 day turnaround isn't bad at all!  </TEXT>
