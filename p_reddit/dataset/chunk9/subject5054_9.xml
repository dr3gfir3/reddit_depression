	<TEXT> Study (open access) | [Earths changing global atmospheric energy cycle in response to climate change](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14367)
___

**Abstract**

The Lorenz energy cycle is widely used to investigate atmospheres and climates on planets. However, the long-term temporal variations of such an energy cycle have not yet been explored. Here we use three independent meteorological data sets from the modern satellite era, to examine the temporal characteristics of the Lorenz energy cycle of Earths global atmosphere in response to climate change. The total mechanical energy of the global atmosphere basically remains constant with time, but the global-average eddy energies show significant positive trends. The spatial investigations suggest that these positive trends are concentrated in the Southern Hemisphere. Significant positive trends are also found in the conversion, generation and dissipation rates of energies. The positive trends in the dissipation rates of kinetic energies suggest that the efficiency of the global atmosphere as a heat engine increased during the modern satellite era. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access); [Evidence for a bi-partition of the Younger Dryas Stadial in East Asia associated with inversed climate characteristics compared to Europe](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44983)
___

**Abstract**

The Younger Dryas Stadial (YDS) was an episode of northern hemispheric cooling which occurred within the Last Glacial Interglacial Transition (LGIT). A major driver for the YDS climate was a weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). It has been inferred that the AMOC began to strengthen mid-YDS, producing a bipartite structure of the YDS in records from continental Europe. These records imply that the polar front and westerlies shifted northward, producing a warmer second phase of the YDS in Europe. Here we present multi-proxy data from the sediments of Lake Suigetsu (Japan), as evidence that a related bi-partition of the YDS also occurred in East Asia. Besides showing for the first time that the bi-partition was not limited to the North Atlantic/European region, the data also imply a climatic dipole between Europe and East Asia since the cold-warm characteristics are reversed at Lake Suigetsu. We suggest that changes in eastward moisture transport from the North Atlantic are the primary mechanism by which the teleconnection can be explained. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Over the past 17 years, the western boundary current system of the Labrador Sea has been closely observed by maintaining the 53N observatory (moorings and shipboard station data) measuring the top-to-bottom flow field offshore from the Labrador shelf break. Volume transports for the North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) components were calculated using different methods, including gap filling procedures for deployment periods with suboptimal instrument coverage. On average the Deep Western Boundary Current (DWBC) carries 30.26.6 Sv of NADW southward, which are almost equally partitioned between Labrador Sea Water (LSW, 14.93.9 Sv) and Lower North Atlantic Deep Water (LNADW, 15.33.8 Sv). The transport variability ranges from days to decades, with the most prominent multiyear fluctuations at interannual to near decadal time scales (5 Sv) in the LNADW overflow water mass. These long-term fluctuations appear to be in phase with the NAO-modulated wind fluctuations. The boundary current system off Labrador occurs as a conglomerate of nearly independent components, namely, the shallow Labrador Current, the weakly sheared LSW range, and the deep baroclinic, bottom-intensified current core of the LNADW, all of which are part of the cyclonic Labrador Sea circulation. This structure is relatively stable over time, and the 120 km wide boundary current is constrained seaward by a weak counterflow which reduces the deep water export by 1015%. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you direct everyone to the journal from which that figure is supposedly modified from? I'd like to understand its context.

Broadly speaking, the ability for the atmosphere to hold water is reduced under colder conditions, and increased under warming conditions. You can see this when comparing two general classes of glaciers and noting their respective climates: warm based, or temperate glaciers and cold based glaciers, where warm based glaciers are typically located at lower latitudes and cold based glaciers are located at higher latitudes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Transboundary health impacts of transported global air pollution and international trade](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7647/full/nature21712.html)
___

**Abstract**

Millions of people die every year from diseases caused by exposure to outdoor air pollution. Some studies have estimated premature mortality related to local sources of air pollution, but local air quality can also be affected by atmospheric transport of pollution from distant sources. International trade is contributing to the globalization of emission and pollution as a result of the production of goods (and their associated emissions) in one region for consumption in another region. The effects of international trade on air pollutant emissions, air quality and health have been investigated regionally, but a combined, global assessment of the health impacts related to international trade and the transport of atmospheric air pollution is lacking. Here we combine four global models to estimate premature mortality caused by fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution as a result of atmospheric transport and the production and consumption of goods and services in different world regions. We find that, of the 3.45 million premature deaths related to PM2.5 pollution in 2007 worldwide, about 12 per cent (411,100 deaths) were related to air pollutants emitted in a region of the world other than that in which the death occurred, and about 22 per cent (762,400 deaths) were associated with goods and services produced in one region for consumption in another. For example, PM2.5 pollution produced in China in 2007 is linked to more than 64,800 premature deaths in regions other than China, including more than 3,100 premature deaths in western Europe and the USA; on the other hand, consumption in western Europe and the USA is linked to more than 108,600 premature deaths in China. Our results reveal that the transboundary health impacts of PM2.5 pollution associated with international trade are greater than those associated with long-distance atmospheric pollutant transport. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Cosmic Ray Modulation and Radiation Dose of Aircrews During the Solar Cycle 24/25](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016SW001588/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Weak solar activity and high cosmic-ray flux during the coming solar cycle are qualitatively anticipated by the recent observations that show the decline in the solar activity levels. We predict the cosmic-ray modulation and resultant radiation exposure at flight altitude by using the time-dependent and three dimensional model of the cosmic-ray modulation. Our galactic cosmic ray (GCR) model is based on the variations of the solar wind speed, the strength of the heliospheric magnetic field (HMF), and the tilt angle of the heliospheric current sheet. We reproduce the 22-year variation of the cosmic-ray modulation from 1980 to 2015 taking into account the gradient-curvature drift motion of GCRs. The energy spectra of GCR protons obtained by our model show good agreement with the observations by BESS and PAMELA except for a discrepancy at the solar maximum. Five year annual radiation dose around the solar minimum at the solar cycle 24/25 will be approximately 19% higher than that in the last cycle. This is caused by the charge sign dependence of the cosmic-ray modulation, such as the flat-top profiles in a positive polarity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [A tipping point in refreezing accelerates mass loss of Greenlands glaciers and ice caps](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14730)
___

**Abstract**

Melting of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its peripheral glaciers and ice caps (GICs) contributes about 43% to contemporary sea level rise. While patterns of GrIS mass loss are well studied, the spatial and temporal evolution of GICs mass loss and the acting processes have remained unclear. Here we use a novel, 1km surface mass balance product, evaluated against in situ and remote sensing data, to identify 1997 (5 years) as a tipping point for GICs mass balance. That year marks the onset of a rapid deterioration in the capacity of the GICs firn to refreeze meltwater. Consequently, GICs runoff increases 65% faster than meltwater production, tripling the post-1997 mass loss to 3616Gt1, or 14% of the Greenland total. In sharp contrast, the extensive inland firn of the GrIS retains most of its refreezing capacity for now, buffering 22% of the increased meltwater production. This underlines the very different response of the GICs and GrIS to atmospheric warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Distributions of Earths species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by human-mediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Compared to the warming throughout the Quaternary period, no it's not abrupt. In fact, I think you'll find the term 'abrupt', in a geological context, to be quite ambiguous - varying by a great degree from paper to paper. I really don't think you understand the context of the discussion to be honest, as you repeatedly gloss over my comment and continue to push for a hypothesis that is not widely accepted. I would implore you to define how abrupt the warming during the end Permian was before continuing to push your argument any further. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did not say that there isn't evidence, I said the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis is not not widely accepted, which is a factual statement. The Permo-Triassic isn't considered an abrupt warming event, it's a mass extinction event which was initiated with abrupt cooling into a relatively short ice age^[1](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep43630) before warming over several phases, and tens of thousands of years. 

Notice that I stated abrupt warming events, and then showed a figure of marine isotope stages (MIS). Note too that the timeline from past to present is from right to left. Each stage, broadly speaking, shows an abrupt warming, followed by step-wise cooling into glacial conditions. For example, abrupt warming episodes can clearly be seen from MIS12 - 11, 10 - 9, 6 - 5, 2 -1, etc. Non of which is there any evidence to support an argument such as the Clathrate Gun Hypothesis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In all fairness, it is not. While it is certainly of concern when considering our carbon budget and warming, it's far too often over exaggerated and touted as a doomsday scenario. For one, the so-called 'Clathrate Gun Hypothesis' is not widely accepted, and for good reason. Recent studies also find such a scenario to be unlikely^[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016RG000534/full), ^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL068999/abstract), ^[3](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069292/full) . If it were indeed such a likely scenario, why is there no evidence of it occurring during any of the previous abrupt warming episodes? (see [here](http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/QuaTimeMIS.jpg) for example, the odd numbers are periods of relative warmth, while the even numbers are periods of relative cold - ie. glacial / interglacial periods) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Influence of Anthropogenic Climate Change on Planetary Wave Resonance and Extreme Weather Events](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep45242)
___

**Abstract**

Persistent episodes of extreme weather in the Northern Hemisphere summer have been shown to be associated with the presence of high-amplitude quasi-stationary atmospheric Rossby waves within a particular wavelength range (zonal wavenumber 68). The underlying mechanistic relationship involves the phenomenon of quasi-resonant amplification (QRA) of synoptic-scale waves with that wavenumber range becoming trapped within an effective mid-latitude atmospheric waveguide. Recent work suggests an increase in recent decades in the occurrence of QRA-favorable conditions and associated extreme weather, possibly linked to amplified Arctic warming and thus a climate change influence. Here, we isolate a specific fingerprint in the zonal mean surface temperature profile that is associated with QRA-favorable conditions. State-of-the-art (CMIP5) historical climate model simulations subject to anthropogenic forcing display an increase in the projection of this fingerprint that is mirrored in multiple observational surface temperature datasets. Both the models and observations suggest this signal has only recently emerged from the background noise of natural variability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [US CH4 Emissions from Oil and Gas Production: Have Recent Large Increases Been Detected?](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD026157/abstract)
___

**Abstract**

Recent studies have proposed significant increases in CH4 emissions possibly from oil and gas (O G) production, especially for the US where O G production has reached historically high levels over the past decade [US EIA, 2016; Turner et al., 2016; Hausmann et al., 2015; Franco et al., 2016]. In this study, we show that an ensemble of time-dependent atmospheric inversions constrained by calibrated atmospheric observations of surface CH4 mole fraction, with some including space-based retrievals of column average CH4 mole fractions, suggests that North American CH4 emissions have been flat over years spanning 2000 through 2012. Estimates of emission trends using zonal gradients of column average CH4 calculated relative to an upstream background are not easy to make due to atmospheric variability, relative insensitivity of column average CH4 to surface emissions at regional scales, and fast zonal synoptic transport. In addition, any trends in continental enhancements of column average CH4 are sensitive to how the upstream background is chosen, and model simulations imply that short-term (4years or less) trends in column average CH4 horizontal gradients of up to 1.5ppb/yr can occur just from inter-annual transport variability acting on a strong latitudinal CH4 gradient. Finally, trends in spatial gradients calculated from space-based column average CH4 can be significantly biased (2-3ppb/yr) due to the non-uniform and seasonally varying temporal coverage of satellite retrievals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Article (open access): [A roadmap for rapid decarbonization](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1269.full)
___

**Summary**

Although the Paris Agreement's goals are aligned with science and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved, alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments. Despite progress during the 2016 Marrakech climate negotiations, long-term goals can be trumped by political short-termism. Following the Agreement, which became international law earlier than expected, several countries published mid-century decarbonization strategies, with more due soon. Model-based decarbonization assessments and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it: disruption, innovation, and nonlinear change in human behavior. For example, in just 2 years, China's coal use swung from 3.7% growth in 2013 to a decline of 3.7% in 2015. To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristica carbon lawof halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade. Complemented by immediately instigated, scalable carbon removal and efforts to ramp down land-use CO2 emissions, this can lead to net-zero emissions around mid-century, a path necessary to limit warming to well below 2C.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Increased Land Subsidence and Sea-Level Rise are Submerging Egypts Nile Delta Coastal Margin](http://www.geosociety.org/gsatoday/archive/27/5/article/GSATG312A.1.htm)
___

**Abstract**

Egypts Nile delta, only ~1 m above mean sea level at the Mediterranean coast, is subject to uneven rates of submergence. This is a response to several factors leading to increasing land lowering (subsidence) of the northern delta and adjacent seafloor, plus an accelerating rise in eustatic (world) sea level in the Mediterranean. An average eustatic sea-level rise of ~3 mm/yr represents only ~26% to 45% of total relative sea-level rise measured along this margin. Three factors leading to subsidence are neotectonic lowering, compaction of Holocene sequences, and diminished sediment replenishment by much reduced Nile flow to Egypts coast. Subsidence accounts for variable average land lowering of ~3.7 mm/yr of section in the NW delta, ~7.7 mm/yr in the N delta, and ~8.4 mm/yr in the NE delta, based on compaction rates of strata thicknesses that decrease down-core between top and base of Holocene sections in 85 drill cores distributed along the delta margin. Among present critical challenges are marked reduction of Nile water and sediment below the High Aswan Dam that can now reach the delta coast. It is expected that problems of fresh water and energy poverty in the lower Nile Basin are likely to be seriously exacerbated in years ahead by construction of Ethiopias Grand Renaissance Dam (GERD). Completion of this, the biggest hydroelectric structure in Africa, is this year. Egypt, the Sudan, and Ethiopia must resolve the looming crisis of diminished Blue Nile water and sediment distribution to the lower Nile Basin and Egypts delta margin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Weather conditions conducive to Beijing severe haze more frequent under climate change](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3249.html)
___

**Abstract**

The frequency of Beijing winter severe haze episodes has increased substantially over the past decades, and is commonly attributed to increased pollutant emissions from Chinas rapid economic development. During such episodes, levels of fine particulate matter are harmful to human health and the environment, and cause massive disruption to economic activities, as occurred in January 2013. Conducive weather conditions are an important ingredient of severe haze episodes, and include reduced surface winter northerlies, weakened northwesterlies in the midtroposphere, and enhanced thermal stability of the lower atmosphere. How such weather conditions may respond to climate change is not clear. Here we project a 50% increase in the frequency and an 80% increase in the persistence of conducive weather conditions similar to those in January 2013, in response to climate change. The frequency and persistence between the historical (19501999) and future (20502099) climate were compared in 15 models under Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5). The increased frequency is consistent with large-scale circulation changes, including an Arctic Oscillation upward trend, weakening East Asian winter monsoon, and faster warming in the lower troposphere. Thus, circulation changes induced by global greenhouse gas emissions can contribute to the increased Beijing severe haze frequency. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Arctic sea ice, Eurasia snow, and extreme winter haze in China](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1602751.full)
___

**Abstract**

The East China Plains (ECP) region experienced the worst haze pollution on record for January in 2013. We show that the unprecedented haze event is due to the extremely poor ventilation conditions, which had not been seen in the preceding three decades. Statistical analysis suggests that the extremely poor ventilation conditions are linked to Arctic sea ice loss in the preceding autumn and extensive boreal snowfall in the earlier winter. We identify the regional circulation mode that leads to extremely poor ventilation over the ECP region. Climate model simulations indicate that boreal cryospheric forcing enhances the regional circulation mode of poor ventilation in the ECP region and provides conducive conditions for extreme haze such as that of 2013. Consequently, extreme haze events in winter will likely occur at a higher frequency in China as a result of the changing boreal cryosphere, posing difficult challenges for winter haze mitigation but providing a strong incentive for greenhouse gas emission reduction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes to coal, the markets simply don't care what Trump has to say. 

**Conclusion**

The U.S. coal industry is not on a path to recovery in the short or the long term, due to market dynamics unrelated to regulation. The industry will continue to suffer from declining demand, low prices, and its inability to compete with natural gas and renewable energy.  

Expectations will go unmet for more export sales, new coal-plant construction, and expensive coal-plant retrofits.

While times may have changed politically, the U.S. coal industry remains in financial and fundamental decline.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Repetitive mammalian dwarfing during ancient greenhouse warming events](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1601430.full)
___

**Abstract**

Abrupt perturbations of the global carbon cycle during the early Eocene are associated with rapid global warming events, which are analogous in many ways to present greenhouse warming. Mammal dwarfing has been observed, along with other changes in community structure, during the largest of these ancient global warming events, known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum [PETM; ~56 million years ago (Ma)]. We show that mammalian dwarfing accompanied the subsequent, smaller-magnitude warming event known as Eocene Thermal Maximum 2 [ETM2 (~53 Ma)]. Statistically significant decrease in body size during ETM2 is observed in two of four taxonomic groups analyzed in this study and is most clearly observed in early equids (horses). During ETM2, the best-sampled lineage of equids decreased in size by ~14%, as opposed to ~30% during the PETM. Thus, dwarfing appears to be a common evolutionary response of some mammals during past global warming events, and the extent of dwarfing seems related to the magnitude of the event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Timing of global regression and microbial bloom linked with the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction: implications for driving mechanisms](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep43630)
___

**Abstract**

New high-resolution U-Pb dates indicate a duration of 89  38 kyr for the Permian hiatus and of 14  57 kyr for the overlying Triassic microbial limestone in shallow water settings of the Nanpanjiang Basin, South China. The age and duration of the hiatus coincides with the Permian-Triassic boundary (PTB) and the extinction interval in the Meishan Global Stratotype Section and Point, and strongly supports a glacio-eustatic regression, which best explains the genesis of the worldwide hiatus straddling the PTB in shallow water records. In adjacent deep marine troughs, rates of sediment accumulation display a six-fold decrease across the PTB compatible with a dryer and cooler climate as indicated by terrestrial plants. Our model of the Permian-Triassic boundary mass extinction (PTBME) hinges on the synchronicity of the hiatus with the onset of the Siberian Traps volcanism. This early eruptive phase released sulfur-rich volatiles into the stratosphere, thus simultaneously eliciting a short-lived ice age responsible for the global regression and a brief but intense acidification. Abrupt cooling, shrunk habitats on shelves and acidification may all have synergistically triggered the PTBME. Subsequently, the build-up of volcanic CO2 induced a transient cool climate whose early phase saw the deposition of the microbial limestone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure how they came to 1.2C, as I've pointed out ITT and above, that (using HadCRUT) we're at [1.01247...C](http://globalwarmingindex.org/). Regardless, if we simply substitute 1.2C for 1.01247C in the above equation, we arrive at 1.49C in 16 years (2033), using a warming of 1.82C/century. 

Provided such a short interval of time, I think it's fair to state that a linear relationship is a reasonable approximation (obviously this doesn't hold for longer forecasts). Note too that other data sets provide different rates of warming. For example, NCEP TCR for the period 1975 - 2005 arrives at 1.49C/century, while Hadley arrives at 1.9C/century, a spread of ~0.4C between max and min rates. Even if the rate of warming increases (which it likely will) I still don't see a large difference. Let's assume present warming to be 0.02C/year and that it increases to 0.03C at 2025, let's also assume 1.2C instead of 1.01C. 

(1a) (8 yr)(0.02C/yr) + 1.2C = 1.36C by 2025 

(2a) (x)(0.03C/yr) + 1.36 = 1.5C  x = 4.7 years or ~5 years. So we reach 1.5C by 2030 (2025 + 5 years) instead of by 2033 as the clock suggests. 

I think I've been quite generous in the above set of equations as well, and yet the difference is not that large. Interestingly, if I use 1.01C instead of 1.2C we arrive at 1.5C in 19 years. With a little more fine tuning and getting even more generous with our rates of warming we have the following:

(1b) (4 yr)(0.02C/yr) + 1.01C = 1.09C by 2021

(2b) (4 yr)(0.03C/yr) + 1.09C = 1.21C by 2025

(3b) (x)(0.04C/yr) + 1.21 = 1.5C  x = 7.25 years or ~2032. Again, fairly generous with rates of warming and still not a large difference, less than a year off of the clock's suggested 2033. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are your predictions? 

A quick glance at a couple of *very* rough approximations shows the following:

[1980 - 2016](http://i.imgur.com/9yzmau0.jpg): 1.5C wouldn't be reached until 2062 (45 years). Applying 0.3C uncertainty brings this down to 2044 (27 years). Granted the rate of warming is likely to increase so a linear approximation isn't the most suitable. Noting this, if we start from [2000 - 2016](http://i.imgur.com/rbHDsMf.jpg) in an attempt to bias our rates of warming to reflect more recent rates we see that 1.5C wouldn't be reached until 2054 (37 years). Again, applying a 0.3C uncertainty brings this down to 2038 (21 years).

Using a warming rate of [1.82C per century](https://www.skepticalscience.com/global-warming-1860-1880-and-1910-1940.htm) (GISS 1975-2005) or 0.0182C per year would result in (16 years)(0.0182C / year) + [1.01247C](http://globalwarmingindex.org/) = 1.3C by 2033 and 1.5C by 2043 (26 years). Note that this value is not all that different from the *very* rough, quick calculation above of 21 years.

As warming is likely to accelerate I'm sure such values as 21 and 26 years can be reduced further, however, I would be skeptical of having it reduced by what appear to be rather large values required in order to reduce it to less than 16 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Major advance of South Georgia glaciers during the Antarctic Cold Reversal following extensive sub-Antarctic glaciation](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14798)
___

**Abstract**

The history of glaciations on Southern Hemisphere sub-polar islands is unclear. Debate surrounds the extent and timing of the last glacial advance and termination on sub-Antarctic South Georgia in particular. Here, using sea-floor geophysical data and marine sediment cores, we resolve the record of glaciation offshore of South Georgia through the transition from the Last Glacial Maximum to Holocene. We show a sea-bed landform imprint of a shelf-wide last glacial advance and progressive deglaciation. Renewed glacier resurgence in the fjords between c. 15,170 and 13,340yr ago coincided with a period of cooler, wetter climate known as the Antarctic Cold Reversal, revealing a cryospheric response to an Antarctic climate pattern extending into the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. We conclude that the last glaciation of South Georgia was extensive, and the sensitivity of its glaciers to climate variability during the last termination more significant than implied by previous studies. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Climate change will increase the risk of temperature extremes. Induced innovation could offset some of this threat. This paper explores the demand and supply for climate adaptation innovation in a market economy. Climate change induces this innovation because the rising temperatures increase demand for self protection products and for profit firms respond to these incentives. We then augment the model to introduce climate skeptics. Such skeptics reject the claim that the world is warming and thus do not increasingly demand adaptation products. We study how the economy's rate of adaptation innovation, cross city migration, real estate pricing and the welfare of agents with rational expectations are all affected by the presence of such skeptics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Clarifying the role of coastal and marine systems in climate mitigation](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.1451/full)
___

**Abstract**

The international scientific community is increasingly recognizing the role of natural systems in climate-change mitigation. While forests have historically been the primary focus of such efforts, coastal wetlands  particularly seagrasses, tidal marshes, and mangroves  are now considered important and effective long-term carbon sinks. However, some members of the coastal and marine policy and management community have been interested in expanding climate mitigation strategies to include other components within coastal and marine systems, such as coral reefs, phytoplankton, kelp forests, and marine fauna. We analyze the scientific evidence regarding whether these marine ecosystems and ecosystem components are viable long-term carbon sinks and whether they can be managed for climate mitigation. Our findings could assist decision makers and conservation practitioners in identifying which components of coastal and marine ecosystems should be prioritized in current climate mitigation strategies and policies.
___

**In a nutshell**:

\- Coastal wetlands sequester substantial amounts of carbon, mostly in soils

\- Interest in the climate benefits of coastal wetlands has drawn attention to how other components of marine ecosystems might play a role in climate mitigation

\- Coral reefs, kelp, and marine fauna, while important components of carbon cycling in the ocean, are not involved in long-term carbon sequestration

\- Due to jurisdictional issues, practical management of coral, phytoplankton, kelp, and marine fauna within climate mitigation frameworks would be difficult

\- Current climate mitigation efforts in the coastal and marine realm should focus primarily on coastal wetlands, as they represent long-term carbon sinks and potential carbon sources upon conversion, and can be managed for their carbon sequestration value </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

This study provides evidence of substantial increases in atmospheric ammonia (NH3) concentrations (14-year) over several of the worlds major agricultural regions, using recently available retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard NASA's Aqua satellite. The main sources of atmospheric NH3 are farming and animal husbandry involving reactive nitrogen ultimately derived from fertilizer use; rates of emission are also sensitive to climate change. Significant increasing trends are seen over the US (2.61% yr^-1 ), the European Union (EU) (1.83% yr^-1 ), and China (2.27% yr^-1 ). Over the EU, the trend results from decreased scavenging by acid aerosols. Over the US, the increase results from a combination of decreased chemical loss and increased soil temperatures. Over China, decreased chemical loss, increasing temperatures, and increased fertilizer use all play a role. Over South Asia, increased NH3 emissions are masked by increased SO2 and NOx emissions, leading to increased aerosol loading and adverse health effects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Modern warming is occurring at much faster rates than those recorded from the PETM. This is important because it relates to the adaptability of corals. It is certainly possible that warming, and anomalous warm events, may outpace the corals ability to adapt. However, it should also be noted that not every coral is the same - while some species may tolerate warmer temperatures, others may not. And, while some geographical locations may warm, others may provide refuge areas due to upwelling of colder, nutrient rich waters. The government of Australia provides an interesting read on the [history](http://coral.aims.gov.au/info/evolution.jsp) and [evolution](http://coral.aims.gov.au/info/evolution-species.jsp) of corals. </TEXT>

The abstract itself states the following:

The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Assessing the Methane Emissions from Natural Gas-Fired Power Plants and Oil Refineries](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b05531)
___

**Abstract**

Presently, there is high uncertainty in estimates of methane (CH4) emissions from natural gas-fired power plants (NGPP) and oil refineries, two major end users of natural gas. Therefore, we measured CH4 and CO2 emissions at three NGPPs and three refineries using an aircraft-based mass balance technique. Average CH4 emission rates (NGPPs: 140  70 kg/h; refineries: 580  220 kg/h, 95% CL) were larger than facility-reported estimates by factors of 21120 (NGPPs) and 1190 (refineries). At NGPPs, the percentage of unburned CH4 emitted from stacks (0.010.14%) was much lower than respective facility-scale losses (0.100.42%), and CH4 emissions from both NGPPs and refineries were more strongly correlated with enhanced H2O concentrations (R^2 avg = 0.65) than with CO2 (R^2 avg = 0.21), suggesting noncombustion-related equipment as potential CH4 sources. Additionally, calculated throughput-based emission factors (EF) derived from the NGPP measurements made in this study were, on average, a factor of 4.4 (stacks) and 42 (facility-scale) larger than industry-used EFs. Subsequently, throughput-based EFs for both the NGPPs and refineries were used to estimate total U.S. emissions from these facility-types. Results indicate that NGPPs and oil refineries may be large sources of CH4 emissions and could contribute significantly (0.61  0.18 Tg CH4/yr, 95% CL) to U.S. emissions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Global warming and recurrent mass bleaching of corals](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v543/n7645/full/nature21707.html)
___

**Abstract**

During 20152016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

___

**Abstract**

During 20152016, record temperatures triggered a pan-tropical episode of coral bleaching, the third global-scale event since mass bleaching was first documented in the 1980s. Here we examine how and why the severity of recurrent major bleaching events has varied at multiple scales, using aerial and underwater surveys of Australian reefs combined with satellite-derived sea surface temperatures. The distinctive geographic footprints of recurrent bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef in 1998, 2002 and 2016 were determined by the spatial pattern of sea temperatures in each year. Water quality and fishing pressure had minimal effect on the unprecedented bleaching in 2016, suggesting that local protection of reefs affords little or no resistance to extreme heat. Similarly, past exposure to bleaching in 1998 and 2002 did not lessen the severity of bleaching in 2016. Consequently, immediate global action to curb future warming is essential to secure a future for coral reefs.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation](http://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17\)30133-8)
___

**Highlights**

 \- Tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are enriched during desiccation

 \- TDPs are required for tardigrades to survive desiccation

 \- Expression of TDPs increases desiccation tolerance in heterologous systems

 \- TDPs vitrify, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities

**Summary**

Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive a remarkable array of stresses, including desiccation. How tardigrades survive desiccation has remained a mystery for more than 250 years. Trehalose, a disaccharide essential for several organisms to survive drying, is detected at low levels or not at all in some tardigrade species, indicating that tardigrades possess potentially novel mechanisms for surviving desiccation. Here we show that tardigrade-specific intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are essential for desiccation tolerance. TDP genes are constitutively expressed at high levels or induced during desiccation in multiple tardigrade species. TDPs are required for tardigrade desiccation tolerance, and these genes are sufficient to increase desiccation tolerance when expressed in heterologous systems. TDPs form non-crystalline amorphous solids (vitrify) upon desiccation, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities. Our study identifies TDPs as functional mediators of tardigrade desiccation tolerance, expanding our knowledge of the roles and diversity of disordered proteins involved in stress tolerance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [A lower limit to atmospheric CO2 concentrations over the past 800,000 years](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2914.html)
___

**Abstract**

Global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations varied widely over the glacial cycles of the past 800,000 years. But despite this variability, Antarctic ice cores have shown that CO2 concentrations were very similar during all the coldest points of these cycles. Remarkably, the recurring minimum CO2 concentrations (190  7ppm) fall on the lower bound of any known in Earth history. Here we show that although the volume of terrestrial ice sheets was normally distributed over the past 800,000 years, as might be expected from the approximately normal distribution of the orbital forcing that drove the glacial cycles, Antarctic temperatures have a strong cold mode, whereas CO2 concentrations have both a cold mode and a central mode. Although multiple explanations are possible, the recurring CO2 minima and pronounced cold modes are consistent with a strong negative feedback to decreasing CO2 that resisted further cooling on timescales shorter than 10,000 years. We suggest that one possible negative feedback is CO2-limitation of photosynthesis, either directly or via CO2-limitation of N2 fixation, which could have inhibited further lowering of CO2 by reducing carbon storage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Extreme sea levels on the rise along Europe's coasts](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000505/full)
___

**Abstract**

Future extreme sea levels (ESLs) and flood risk along European coasts will be strongly impacted by global warming. Yet, comprehensive projections of ESL that include mean sea level (MSL), tides, waves, and storm surges do not exist. Here, we show changes in all components of ESLs until 2100 in view of climate change. We find that by the end of this century, the 100-year ESL along Europe's coastlines is on average projected to increase by 57 cm for Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP)4.5 and 81 cm for RCP8.5. The North Sea region is projected to face the highest increase in ESLs, amounting to nearly 1 m under RCP8.5 by 2100, followed by the Baltic Sea and Atlantic coasts of the UK and Ireland. Relative sea level rise (RSLR) is shown to be the main driver of the projected rise in ESL, with increasing dominance toward the end of the century and for the high-concentration pathway. Changes in storm surges and waves enhance the effects of RSLR along the majority of northern European coasts, locally with contributions up to 40%. In southern Europe, episodic extreme events tend to stay stable, except along the Portuguese coast and the Gulf of Cadiz where reductions in surge and wave extremes offset RSLR by 2030%. By the end of this century, 5 million Europeans currently under threat of a 100-year ESL could be annually at risk from coastal flooding under high-end warming. The presented dataset is available through this link: http://data.jrc.ec.europa.eu/collection/LISCOAST.

**Plain Language Summary**

Future extreme sea levels and flood risk along European coasts will be strongly impacted by global warming. Here, we show changes in all acting components, i.e., sea level rise, tides, waves, and storm surges, until 2100 in view of climate change. We find that by the end of this century the 100-year event along Europe will on average increase between 57 and 81 cm. The North Sea region is projected to face the highest increase, amounting to nearly 1 m under a high emission scenario by 2100, followed by the Baltic Sea and Atlantic coasts of the UK and Ireland. Sea level rise is the main driver of the changes, but intensified climate extremes along most of northern Europe can have significant local effects. Little changes in climate extremes are shown along southern Europe, with the exception of a projected decrease along the Portuguese coast and the Gulf of Cadiz, offseting sea level rise by 2030%. By the end of this century, 5 million Europeans currently under threat of a 100-year coastal flood event could be annually at risk from coastal flooding under high-end warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

Realistic projection of future climate-carbon (C) cycle feedbacks requires better understanding and an improved representation of the C cycle in permafrost regions in the current generation of Earth system models. Here we evaluated 10 terrestrial ecosystem models for their estimates of net primary productivity (NPP) and responses to historical climate change in permafrost regions in the Northern Hemisphere. In comparison with the satellite estimate from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS; 2466gCm^2 yr^1 ), most models produced higher NPP (30912gCm^2 yr^1 ) over the permafrost region during 20002009. By comparing the simulated gross primary productivity (GPP) with a flux tower-based database, we found that although mean GPP among the models was only overestimated by 10% over 19822009, there was a twofold discrepancy among models (380 to 800gCm^2 yr^1 ), which mainly resulted from differences in simulated maximum monthly GPP (GPPmax). Most models overestimated C use efficiency (CUE) as compared to observations at both regional and site levels. Further analysis shows that model variability of GPP and CUE are nonlinearly correlated to variability in specific leaf area and the maximum rate of carboxylation by the enzyme Rubisco at 25C (Vcmax_25), respectively. The models also varied in their sensitivities of NPP, GPP, and CUE to historical changes in climate and atmospheric CO2 concentration. These results indicate that model predictive ability of the C cycle in permafrost regions can be improved by better representation of the processes controlling CUE and GPPmax as well as their sensitivity to climate change. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

In this study we conducted a comprehensive modeling analysis to identify global trends in extreme wave energy flux (WEF) along coastlines in the 21st century under a high emission pathway (Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5). For the end of the century, results show a significant increase up to 30% in 100 year return level WEF for the majority of the coastal areas of the southern temperate zone, while in the Northern Hemisphere large coastal areas are characterized by a significant negative trend. We show that the most significant long-term trends of extreme WEF can be explained by intensification of teleconnection patterns such as the Antarctic Oscillation, El NioSouthern Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation. The projected changes will have broad implications for ocean engineering applications and disaster risk management. Especially low-lying coastal countries in the Southern Hemisphere will be particularly vulnerable due to the combined effects of projected relative sea level rise and more extreme wave activities. </TEXT>

**Abstract**

Climate models project a strong increase in Arctic precipitation over the coming century, which has been attributed primarily to enhanced surface evaporation associated with sea-ice retreat. Since the Arctic is still quite cold, especially in winter, it is often (implicitly) assumed that the additional precipitation will fall mostly as snow. However, little is known about future changes in the distributions of rainfall and snowfall in the Arctic. Here we use 37 state-of-the-art climate models in standardized twenty-first-century (20062100) simulations to show a decrease in average annual Arctic snowfall (7090N), despite the strong precipitation increase. Rain is projected to become the dominant form of precipitation in the Arctic region (20912100), as atmospheric warming causes a greater fraction of snowfall to melt before it reaches the surface, in particular over the North Atlantic and the Barents Sea. The reduction in Arctic snowfall is most pronounced during summer and autumn when temperatures are close to the melting point, but also winter rainfall is found to intensify considerably. Projected (seasonal) trends in rainfall and snowfall will heavily impact Arctic hydrology (for example, river discharge, permafrost melt), climatology (for example, snow, sea-ice albedo and melt) and ecology (for example, water and food availability). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Selenium deficiency risk predicted to increase under future climate change](http://www.pnas.org/content/114/11/2848.full)
___

**Significance**

The trace element selenium is essential for human health and is required in a narrow dietary concentration range. Insufficient selenium intake has been estimated to affect up to 1 billion people worldwide. Dietary selenium availability is controlled by soilplant interactions, but the mechanisms governing its broad-scale soil distributions are largely unknown. Using data-mining techniques, we modeled recent (19801999) distributions and identified climatesoil interactions as main controlling factors. Furthermore, using moderate climate change projections, we predicted future (20802099) soil selenium losses from 58% of modeled areas (mean loss = 8.4%). Predicted losses from croplands were even higher, with 66% of croplands predicted to lose 8.7% selenium. These losses could increase the worldwide prevalence of selenium deficiency.
 
**Abstract**

Deficiencies of micronutrients, including essential trace elements, affect up to 3 billion people worldwide. The dietary availability of trace elements is determined largely by their soil concentrations. Until now, the mechanisms governing soil concentrations have been evaluated in small-scale studies, which identify soil physicochemical properties as governing variables. However, global concentrations of trace elements and the factors controlling their distributions are virtually unknown. We used 33,241 soil data points to model recent (19801999) global distributions of Selenium (Se), an essential trace element that is required for humans. Worldwide, up to one in seven people have been estimated to have low dietary Se intake. Contrary to small-scale studies, soil Se concentrations were dominated by climatesoil interactions. Using moderate climate-change scenarios for 20802099, we predicted that changes in climate and soil organic carbon content will lead to overall decreased soil Se concentrations, particularly in agricultural areas; these decreases could increase the prevalence of Se deficiency. The importance of climatesoil interactions to Se distributions suggests that other trace elements with similar retention mechanisms will be similarly affected by climate change. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

This study investigates the fundamental causes of differences in the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) eastward propagation among models that participated in a recent model inter-comparison project. These models are categorized into good and poor groups characterized by prominent eastward propagation and non-propagation, respectively. Column integrated moist static energy (MSE) budgets are diagnosed for the good and the poor models. It is found that a zonal asymmetry in the MSE tendency, characteristic of eastward MJO propagation, occurs in the good group, while such an asymmetry does not exist in the poor group. The difference arises mainly from anomalous vertical and horizontal MSE advection. The former is attributed to the zonal asymmetry of upper-middle tropospheric vertical velocity anomalies acting on background MSE vertical gradient; the latter is mainly attributed to the asymmetric zonal distribution of low-tropospheric meridional wind anomalies advecting background MSE/moisture field. Based on the diagnosis above, a new mechanism for MJO eastward propagation that emphasizes the second-baroclinic-mode vertical velocity is proposed.

A set of atmospheric general circulation model experiments with prescribed diabatic heating profiles were conducted to investigate the causes of different anomalous circulations between the good and the poor models. The numerical experiments reveal that the presence of a stratiform heating at the rear of MJO convection is responsible for the zonal asymmetry of vertical velocity anomaly and is important to strengthening lower-tropospheric poleward flows to the east of MJO convection. Thus, a key to improve the poor models is to correctly reproduce the stratiform heating. The roles of Rossby and Kelvin wave components in MJO propagation are particularly discussed. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**

We study the problem of energy exchange between waves and particles, which leads to energization of the latter, in an unstable plasma typical of the radiation belts. The ongoing Van Allen Probes space mission brought this problem among the most discussed in space physics. A free energy which is present in an unstable plasma provides the indispensable condition for energy transfer from lower energy particles to higher-energy particles via resonant wave-particle interaction. This process is studied in detail by the example of electron interactions with whistler mode wave packets originated from lightning-induced emission. We emphasize that in an unstable plasma, the energy source for electron energization is the energy of other particles, rather than the wave energy as is often assumed. The way by which the energy is transferred from lower energy to higher-energy particles includes two processes that operate concurrently, in the same space-time domain, or sequentially, in different space-time domains, in which a given wave packet is located. In the first process, one group of resonant particles gives the energy to the wave. The second process consists in wave absorption by another group of resonant particles, whose energy therefore increases. We argue that this mechanism represents an efficient means of electron energization in the radiation belts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This study refers specifically to atmospheric circulation patterns over the Arctic, and has *nothing* to do with the Antarctic.

Projecting further into the future, the effects resulting from internal variability decrease as anthropogenic warming overwhelms the system. 

I would state that while we would likely be seeing a decrease in Arctic sea-ice, it would likely rebound and the (+/-) resulting from internal variability would likely continue a relatively flat trend. Natural variability, on decadal time scales, cannot explain the modern deviation as is seen in [Figure 3](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v479/n7374/fig_tab/nature10581_F3.html) of Kinnard et al "Reconstructed changes in Arctic sea ice over the past 1,450 years" without a strong anthropogenic component. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...gasses absorb heat from the sun and create the greenhouse effect...

This can be misleading, as it implies the majority of greenhouse gases (GHG) absorb incoming solar radiation, when in fact, they are effectively invisible to the incoming solar radiation. However, the Earth absorbs the incoming short wave solar radiation and re-emits it as long wave radiation. This long wave radiation is what is absorbed by GHG and reflected back down towards the surface, generating the 'greenhouse effect'. The following simplified figure by [Chris Colose](https://chriscolose.wordpress.com/2008/03/09/physics-of-the-greenhouse-effect-pt-1/) illustrates this: http://i.imgur.com/nFfDuOv.gif    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Influence of high-latitude atmospheric circulation changes on summertime Arctic sea ice](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3241.html)
___

**Abstract**

The Arctic has seen rapid sea-ice decline in the past three decades, whilst warming at about twice the global average rate. Yet the relationship between Arctic warming and sea-ice loss is not well understood. Here, we present evidence that trends in summertime atmospheric circulation may have contributed as much as 60% to the September sea-ice extent decline since 1979. A tendency towards a stronger anticyclonic circulation over Greenland and the Arctic Ocean with a barotropic structure in the troposphere increased the downwelling longwave radiation above the ice by warming and moistening the lower troposphere. Model experiments, with reanalysis data constraining atmospheric circulation, replicate the observed thermodynamic response and indicate that the near-surface changes are dominated by circulation changes rather than feedbacks from the changing sea-ice cover. Internal variability dominates the Arctic summer circulation trend and may be responsible for about 3050% of the overall decline in September sea ice since 1979. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Tree-ring width reveals the preparation of the 1974 Mt. Etna eruption](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep44019)
___

**Abstract**

Reduced near-infrared reflectance observed in September 1973 in Skylab images of the western flank of Mt. Etna has been interpreted as an eruption precursor of the January 1974 eruption. Until now, it has been unclear when this signal started, whether it was sustained and which process(es) could have caused it. By analyzing tree-ring width time-series, we show that the reduced near-infrared precursory signal cannot be linked to a reduction in annual tree growth in the area. However, comparing the tree-ring width time-series with both remote sensing observations and volcano-seismic activity enables us to discuss the starting date of the pre-eruptive period of the 1974 eruption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I beg to differ. That is also not 'the full quote from the study', and discusses a different aspect of the study from which I am quoting - a simple ctrl F would have shown this. The section I am quoting is as follows:

"During the end-Triassic mass extinction event, relatively widespread groups are as likely to suffer high levels of extinction as groups with narrower geographic ranges. For example, Phytosauria and Theropoda have similar, geographic ranges in the Rhaetian ([Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980/figures/3)). **However, phytosaurs suffer complete extinction at the end Triassic, whereas theropod diversity remains stable across the boundary and into the Hettangian**, even whilst undergoing significant range expansion ([Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980/figures/3))." 

Note that the Rhaetian is the Late Triassic and the Hettangian is the Early Jurassic (you can review the geologic time scale [here](https://www.geosociety.org/GSA/Education_Careers/Geologic_Time_Scale/GSA/timescale/home.aspx)). If you examine [Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms8980/figures/3) you'll note that the authors state the following: 

The Aetosauria, Cynognathia and Phytosauria became extinct during the biotic crisis, despite the widespread distribution of Cynognathia and Phytosauria in the Rhaetian. The Probainognathia, Sauropodomorpha and Theropoda all survived the biotic crisis and expanded their ranges in the Hettangian, albeit with different diversification trajectories. The diversity of Sauropodomorpha increased, the diversity of Theropoda was stationary and that of Probainognathia decreased across the boundary.

I fail to see how this paper supports your rather catastrophic position. The authors clearly state that while some terrestrial vertebrates become extinct, others remain stable, some decreased, while others actually increased across the boundary.

You repeatedly continue to jump to conclusions, claiming support for your position when there are in fact large gaps between what you claim is support for your position and what the studies actually discuss. There will certainly be hardships to overcome as conditions will most likely worsen over the coming decades; however, extinction of Homo sapiens is absolutely not among them, nor anywhere to be found in mainstream scientific literature. It's clear at this point that I'll just be repeating myself, as I have already done so multiple times, but your belief is simply unfounded, and cannot be taken seriously. As I recall from elsewhere ITT you mention a minimum of 50 years.

You claim to be a science writer, would you care to share any of your work? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do I really need to show that 'studies' is the plural of 'study'? You provided a single (major?) study that made very broad generalizations about terrestrial vertebrates during the end-Triassic. Of which, the study itself also stated that theropod diversity remained stable across the event. You would be effectively cherry picking the data to fit your personal bias. Of course there are concerns regarding our current and near future scenarios, however, the extinction of Homo sapiens in main stream scientific literature, is not among them. </TEXT>

That's not what you said. What you said is as follows:

And no one here is worried about human extinction. LOL.

Those two statements are not the same, nor are their implications.  I don't think anyone would argue that humans are immune to extinction (in fact I may as well be certain). However, you commented about humans going extinct in a thread dealing with the effects of climate change. </TEXT>

Perhaps you could provide a different study, or number of studies, that support your position rather than the single study you keep linking to that states rather broad and non-specific implications?

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Improved estimates of ocean heat content from 1960 to 2015](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/3/3/e1601545.full)
___

**Abstract**

Earths energy imbalance (EEI) drives the ongoing global warming and can best be assessed across the historical record (that is, since 1960) from ocean heat content (OHC) changes. An accurate assessment of OHC is a challenge, mainly because of insufficient and irregular data coverage. We provide updated OHC estimates with the goal of minimizing associated sampling error. We performed a subsample test, in which subsets of data during the data-rich Argo era are colocated with locations of earlier ocean observations, to quantify this error. Our results provide a new OHC estimate with an unbiased mean sampling error and with variability on decadal and multidecadal time scales (signal) that can be reliably distinguished from sampling error (noise) with signal-to-noise ratios higher than 3. The inferred integrated EEI is greater than that reported in previous assessments and is consistent with a reconstruction of the radiative imbalance at the top of atmosphere starting in 1985. We found that changes in OHC are relatively small before about 1980; since then, OHC has increased fairly steadily and, since 1990, has increasingly involved deeper layers of the ocean. In addition, OHC changes in six major oceans are reliable on decadal time scales. All ocean basins examined have experienced significant warming since 1998, with the greatest warming in the southern oceans, the tropical/subtropical Pacific Ocean, and the tropical/subtropical Atlantic Ocean. This new look at OHC and EEI changes over time provides greater confidence than previously possible, and the data sets produced are a valuable resource for further study. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To clarify my point, I think there is a probability that climate change could result in economic catastrophe, and that there is also a probability that climate change could result in the collapse of specific civilizations *as we know them to be*. How high or low the probability of such an outcome occurring, however, remains largely uncertain. Equating economic catastrophe, or even the collapse of one or more societies to the extinction of Homo sapiens is simply wrong. Economic catastrophe  extinction of Homo sapiens, nor does the collapse of a single or multiple societies. 

For the above I have assumed that each of their premises to be true. That is to say that I have assumed the following statement to be true in its entirety:

 "All evidence around me says global civilizational collapse is inevitable and is happening as we speak."

However, should this assumption be false it further weakens the original argument (human extinction). I'm almost certain that the assumption is false. </TEXT>

It also states that theropod diversity remained stable across the event, even while significantly expanding ranges. </TEXT>

What you are in fact arguing in favor for is economic catastrophe, and collapse of civilization *as we know it*, but the conclusion (extinction of Homo sapiens) simply does not follow from the premises (ie. non sequitur).

___

**Abstract**

Soil organic carbon harbors three times as much carbon as Earths atmosphere, and its decomposition is a potentially large climate change feedback and major source of uncertainty in climate projections. The response of whole-soil profiles to warming has not been tested in situ. In this deep warming experiment in mineral soil, CO2 production from all soil depths increased significantly with 4C warmingannual soil respiration increased by 34-37%. All depths responded to warming with similar temperature sensitivities, driven by decomposition of decadal-aged carbon. Whole-soil warming reveals a larger soil respiration response than many in situ experiments, most of which only warm the surface soil, and models. </TEXT>
