	<TEXT> It amazes me that after being insulted by Trump, beaten by Trump in the primaries, and having his wife's face insulted by Trump, that he would still go on to fight Trump's battles.

Let's not focus on Russia's interference and Trump's team's collusion. Nope. Let's instead focus on grilling Yates for upholding the values of this country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah this was a pretty damning testimony. Basically 100% Flynn was in league with the Russians and Trump and his team were warned multiple times of this fact but went ahead anyways and only fired Flynn when that info got leaked.

This was essentially a hearing promoting the reason for a special investigation and special prosecutor. Basically Congress was all in agreement. </TEXT>
