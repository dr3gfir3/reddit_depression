	<TEXT> Personally the new disguiser has grown on me. Like Bodyguard, you have to die to really get the full use of it but the way it screws up the end game for town can be priceless.
I'm really getting tired of sheriff. No one listens to you until it's too late and I don't blame them. You can't even trust your own results until night 3. Sheriff should be able to find Arsonist in addition to WW and SK. </TEXT>
