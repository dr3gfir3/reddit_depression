	<TEXT> Saying thank you. 

Sometimes I bust my ass to get something done or to do something for someone that I don't necessarily have to do but they asked me to do it as a favor for them. Most times they say thank you, which makes going through the extra trouble worth it. But when they don't it makes me feel like shit. Like I broke my back to help you and you don't even give a fuck.  </TEXT>
