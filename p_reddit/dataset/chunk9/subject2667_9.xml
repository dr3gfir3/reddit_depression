	<TEXT> This is one of those movie gems hiding away waiting for the true film lover to appreciate. Such a well executed story it would be presumed to have been based on a true story. Even though it contains lesser known actors, they seamlessly portray the whole bag of emotions all great films contain. This film is captivating throughout with ever changing turns and twists. Prepare for a perfect blend of action and drama between a trio of foreign Israeli agents chasing a once notorious war criminal in hiding.

Normally not a fan of the switch between present and past that seems to be the most recent trend, however in this example the director uses this in a totally inspired way. Telling the story in well connected chucks and leaving each time step with most questions answered. This allowed the story to flow into the final path taken which at 30 years later in the story is unexpected. A lengthy film that you will never want to end </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imma just post this comment from youtube.
To everyone who's confused, here's what the video is about:
It's showing what little, often unintentional acts of racism by white people feel like by switching the roles (no "whiteface" isn't racist because there's not historical racism associated with it unlike blackface, look up blackface in minstrel shows if you want to know why blackface is racist today).  As you can see, black people are the majority race in this video, and there are posters of smiling black people on the walls.  When the white people walk in, the manager tells the saleswoman to "watch out", much like how black people are often  watched closely and followed in stores.  Then, when they start talking, she tries too hard to relate to them and it just comes off as awkward, forced, and makes her seem uncomfortable.  This would be like a white person saying "I love hip-hop homie, my favorite rapper is Soulja Boy."  Finally, she says "I'm not racist I don't see color" which is a common argument mostly used by racist white people.  There's nothing wrong with seeing color, and you're lying if you say you don't notice someone's color (unless you're color blind.)  The problem is discriminating off of color, just ignoring race and hoping it goes away isn't going to solve anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last kingdom

In a few words, "The Last Kingdom" is all I wanted to see in "Vikings" and I never did.

The plot is vigorous and every episode is full of twists: we don't wait around for things to happen, they happen. And they don't feel the need to keep half of the episode dull or in a slow pace, just to make some moments stand out, you won't leave your screen for a second because it's all interesting.

Acting, that was my major disappointment with "vikings", is good: let's not fool ourselves, just being intense is not acting, you have to give more to the characters to make them real people.

Although it's filmed mostly in gray, "winterish" colors photography is impressive, full of beautiful wild pictures.

The director has done a good job too, no weird or off center angles where you can't see the face of the actor and you try to guess, no jumpy cameras that make you dizzy and lose focus. The camera follows the action and the feelings and does the intended: it tells the story. Note that there are no obscene sex scenes and meaningless splatter violence. </TEXT>

yes he won for TWBB which was Danny's better performance than Lincoln. Many rightly consider Joaquin's 2013 spurn as  one the greatest snubs in oscar history and rightly so. There are few performances I know of that were more convincing than Joaquin's "The Master".

Their passports are taken from them as soon as they land so they are left upon the mercy of their employers who often beat them , rape them, throw boiling water at them and work them to death.So most are forced to take thier own lives rather than suffer the agony of slaving for days under torture. As part of an NGO who help these women  I have seen many cases which broke my heart and often leave me sleepless at night. There was a case of Saudi couple who  hammer 24 nails into Sri Lankan maid and most if not all of the accusers are often sent scott free either by paying blood money to their families or by a justice system that openly defends the accusers. It is a never ending torture for these girls working in Arab countries. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TLDR: Prisoner put in boiling hot shower for making a mess, prison guards not charged with a crime.

In June of 2012, 50-year old Darren Rainey, a schizophrenic man serving time for cocaine possession, died in the Dade Correctional Institution. According to prison witnesses and civil rights groups, Rainey died after guards locked him in a shower for two hours with water at 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Nurses who examined Rainey said that he had burns over 90 percent of his bodyand that his skin fell off at the touch.

According to an autopsy report released in January by the Miami-Dade Medical Examiner, Rainey died from complications of schizophrenia, heart disease and confinement in the shower.

On Friday, more than four years after Raineys death, the office of Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle stated that they would not be seeking charges against the four correctional officers allegedly involved in Raineys death.

The shower was itself neither dangerous nor unsafe, the report read. The evidence does not show that Raineys well-being was grossly disregarded by the correctional staff.

According to the report, the facts and evidence in this case do not meet the required elements for the filing of any criminal charge. Therefore, none of the correctional officers at Dade C.I. are criminally responsible for the death of inmate Rainey. Based upon the foregoing, we close the investigation without filing any criminal charges.

At least six inmate witnesses said that correctional officers had rigged the shower so that they could control the temperature from the outside, and that they purposefully turned the water to temperatures that scalded Rainey. The inmate witnesses also claim that Rainey could be heard kicking the shower door and screaming Please take me out! I cant take it anymore!

Prosecutors rejected those witness accounts, calling the testimony unreliable and not credible.

Milton Grimes, the attorney representing Raineys family, expressed extreme disappointment with the states decision.

We are appalled that the state attorney did not look deeper into this case and see the criminality of the people who were involved, Grimes told the Miami Herald.

A Miami Herald investigation into the Dade Correctional Institution called it the deadliest prison in Florida, and chronicled a litany of abuses suffered by inmates at the hands of correctional officers. Around the same time as Raineys death, another mentally ill inmate hanged himself from an air conditioning vent, leaving behind a list of alleged abuses he suffered in the prison.

In 2016, 16 inmates died while in custody at the Dade Correctional Institution. Throughout the entire state, 356 inmates died in custody, according to numbers provided to the Miami Herald by the Florida Department of Corrections.

	<TEXT> that is wrong according to Brits report in 58 % of the cases the perpetuator was entirely unknown to the victim. And in only 13 % of the cases were the perpetuator close to the victim. It is also wrong that most of the perpetuaors are domestic for the basic reason that the sweedish government has stopped taking the ethnicity of attackers just to  distance themselves from taking blame. Whtever your argument or conviction is it takes only to be human to understand that getting a 180 hrs community service  punishment for raping a 12 years old is not only wrong but shameful.

	<TEXT> Well it isn't totally unreasonable to assume that, considering the many reports of rapes on women and few cases happening to minors.Like the , 27 years old man acquitted of raping 13-year-old girl in Sweden because she looks well developed... and another case where another 13 years old was anally raped and got only 2 months sentence. And more recently a teenager in a wheelchair was raped by 4 men for hours. The men were sent scott free and the girl and other swedes who held a peaceful march supporting her  were shunned by the media and some sjw's.  It might not be happening every second but they do happen and sadly most go under reported. My girl friend is Swedish thus my interest on the matter.
