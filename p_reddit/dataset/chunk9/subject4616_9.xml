	<TEXT> I seem t'be in the minority on this, but I'd actually really like another origin story t'play out, one way or another. I mean, after *Civil War* we'd need it t'be done as some kinda flashback or another, but still, I don't think it'd be too much for the fans to take.

Hell, maybe make it - in part, at least - another Marvel One-Shot?

As for who gets t'play Uncle Ben... Stan the Man in a cameo flashback? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all,

I'm wondering what devices, face, and use-case combinations users have found offers them the most discretion in using their watch. I've worked in an area where such a device would attract a lot of (potentially negative) attention, and would like to know what I could do to keep such a device as inconspicuous as possible.

I don't currently own a device, so I'm open to suggestions on both what t'use and how to use it - and I know it's not Android Wear, but I'm also open to suggestions regarding the Gear S2/3.

Huge thanks in advance, I'm looking forward to hearing all comments and suggestions. </TEXT>

I don't have a question *per se*, but I'd wanted to share a [podcast](http://pca.st/N21i) I listened to recently on a viral cause behind obesity. Does this area of research have much crossover potential with your own? Or does the "internal" nature, as it were, of the patient's microbiome prevent this from occurring during the day-to-day running of your lab? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question concerning factory reset. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-01 16:39:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Probably gonna out myself as a n00b here, but in flashing CM 14.1 today I failed to adequately follow [this](https://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Install_CM_for_bullhead#Installing_CyanogenMod_from_recovery) guide, and missed the seventh step, which involves hitting Factory Reset. I'd previously hit all five boxes in the Advanced options of TWRP's Wipe screen, however, the phone reported that the previous OS wasn't present, and all my data from my last install is gone.

Should I go back t'TWRP for a fresh install and start all over again, or am I just about even with the guide? Did I essentially follow the steps, just labelled differently, or am I gonna make a mess for myself further down the line? What'cha think?

Huge thanks in advance, folks, and if y'all have any further advice it's much appreciated. </TEXT>
