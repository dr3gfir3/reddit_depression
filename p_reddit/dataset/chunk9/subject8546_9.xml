	<TEXT> Seems this is related to the recent study on brain size: 

He and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brains garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. </TEXT>
