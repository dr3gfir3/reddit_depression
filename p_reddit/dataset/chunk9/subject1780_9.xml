	<TEXT> To be able to break something into a series, each part has to be it's own mini-story, essentially. So keep that in mind. Your intro would need it's own chain of events. Why does it *need* to be a series, though? 700 words isn't solely a reason to do that. I've posted stories over 3k, and I believe some are way longer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the narrative. I like the style and I get why it was written that way. However, it isn't really a *story* and it doesn't do much to draw people into it. With r/nosleep readers, they typically like a story being told to them as opposed to a person talking out loud to someone. Actually, as I wrote that I found a better way to say it. 

So, this is a very creepy almost journal-style piece. However, most people expect a story and it probably fell flat with the wrong readers. It's still good! I wouldn't let the downvotes bother you. You pushed the envelope and it didn't get received well, that's all it is. 

Keep up the good work! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You make some great points! Now I'm going to make other ones:

#Series

Visibility - Significantly higher due to frequency of being on the front page (assuming upvotes) and retroactive reading.

Length - Series entries actually tend to be shorter, which people love because they don't want to read long stories. It sucks to hear, but it's true. If you hover between 500-1000 words, you'll have better odds than a 17,000 word epic. However, we live in an age of instant gratification. People don't necessarily want to wait out a series for a conclusion. They want a one and done deal.

#Long Ass-Story (there's an xckd about this joke)

Visibility - Unless you break the earth like /u/Elias_Witherow did with the *Feed the Pig* epic, you only have one solid shot of getting the upvotes you need to get serious visibility. That opening better be damn good, luck better be on your side, and you better have bribed /u/EtTuTortilla (Happy Birthday, buddy!!!) or you might miss your shot.

Length - People want a quick fix. Simple as that. There *are* long, super popular one-shot stories. Tons, even. However, I would wager that the majority of the top stories are either series or under...maybe 2,000 words? We live in an age of instant gratification. No one wants to put in effort, honestly.

**These are all my opinions. Nothing is fact. Nothing is real. We're all going to die. Time is just a manmade construct to confine us to mundane tasking to further the agenda of the few vs. the many. Hide the eggs.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, although the man himself implies that you need to have discipline in order to be great, I completely disagree. 

I don't actually understand the logic of forcing myself to write when I don't want to or don't have an ideas to write about. An old film professor of mine quoted someone who said (not verbatim) "just sit at a typewriter every day and write 500 words." That was supposed to be the trick, so to speak. Why would I do that? I *love* writing. If I'm forcing myself to do it then that means I'm not doing it because I love it, I'm doing it because I have to. For me, when an idea comes I'll run with it until I can't anymore. For a while that was almost every single day. Sometimes it'll be a week or two before I get inspired by an idea. 

I guess I'm saying that for me, I write when I have something to write about. I don't write to find something to write about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, 50k words will certainly exceed the limit Reddit has as a site. There's a 40k cap on *characters* meaning if you top that with words already it won't work. 

Next, 50k words is a shorter novel. A novella is typically less than that. Maybe between 10k and 30k (don't quote me on those figures).

My advice? Add more to it and make it a novel. You're already in that range. Flush it out a bit more, get upwards of like 60-70k, and consider an editor and publishing. I can think of at least one company who would be willing to check out your story if you go the novel route. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes you just have to do it. Not try. Trying is for fools and failures. You have to *do.* 

*Do* follow your dreams.

*Do* get rid of those who wrong you.

*Do* be a good parent.

I stood there in silence, up against the communal bedroom wall of the orphanage at 1:07am, on March the 14th. His crib stayed in my sights for twenty-nine minutes as I contemplated an escape plan. For the first time in my life, I hadn't planned my actions ahead of time. 

I knew two things as I stood there watching my son sleep on those recycled animal-print sheets. The first was that I had found the right child. Black. Scar above his left eyebrow after my previous attempt at taking him. Nose like his mother's (before it was broken by a suitor during a late weekend at Denny's). The second fact? I wasn't leaving that orphanage without him. He was *my* son. *My* legacy. He belonged with *me.*

At 1:36am an attendant tip-toed into the nursery to check on the children. Beautiful woman. Probably in her mid-twenties. Brunette hair. A sexy green cami, stained with blood across the front of her...assets. I truly believed she didn't notice me molded into the wall. Dark in the dark, you know? Her scream as she checked on Noah convinced me otherwise. Such a waste of a beautiful soul. Noah cried heavily as I climbed down the ladder with him. A combination of the cold, March air and never being held by me before. 

Had I planned better, I would have expected the authorities to arrive at the orphanage six minutes after I killed the attendant. I would have also figured out that a scream and a loud thud in an orphanage housing a previously sought after infant would raise immediate attention. However, I didn't plan ahead. I let my emotions get the best of me and at 1:42am, the joint was surrounded by three cop cars housing five officers armed to the teeth. Had I planned better I would have not been hiding in a drain ditch trying to muffle an upset 188 day old baby.

When the adrenal glands kick in and pump out copious amounts of epinephrine into your blood stream, you make rash decisions. Looking back on it now, knocking out such a young child might not have been the best idea. I needed to work, however, and that required use of both of my hands. I swaddled Noah in my denim coat to keep him warm.

The first officer was easy.  At 1:51am, he was shining his Streamlight Stinger flashlight into a dumpster that he was leaning into. I cupped my hand over his mouth from behind and jammed the ice pick through his neck directly into his carotid artery. I must have gone deeper than intended, though, since I distinctly remember him bleeding from both sides as I shoved him into his proper home. 

1:53am. Officer Kline was a heavier set fellow. Probably still allowed on the force due to some sort of favor or tenure. He was leaning over a thin metal railing overlooking a dark stairwell when I gave him a light bump with my sole. Thirteen feet onto two concrete steps snapped his neck. It also produced a sound *just* audible enough for the remaining three officers to hone in the location of Officer Kline's incident. 

By 1:55am I was able to safely retrieve Noah and we made our leave on foot to my new apartment.  After all of this time. 186 days after his birth, 51 after my first attempt, I had secured my son. I *did it.*

I woke up from a dream that night. 4:04am. I was standing in the kitchen of my apartment eating a honey ham sandwich on Italian bread with fpur banana peppers and light yellow mustard when my son walked in. A bit unusual, but he was my boy after all.

"Dad," he said "there's someone at the door."

Curious, I walked over fourteen steps and opened it. He was right. A woman walked in, charred to a point where I barely recognized her. She blew me off, went right to Noah, and began playing with him. Noah wasn't afraid of her burnt skin. Uncaring of her broken leg and torn open breast. He was...*happy*...like I was when I killed that bitch for taking the heat in my apartment all of those years ago. He was...*me.*

I checked on Noah after I woke up and he was gone. No signs of struggle. No signs of pain. Just a pink post-it that read:

"You're not the Record Keeper." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I had considered it before, but..," Mr. Braam murmured just loud enough to be caught.

"What was that? Considered what?" My voice cracked, defeating my stern intentions.

"Nothing. Oh, no. Nothing. We should carry on, yes?" Mr. Braam was stressed. He knew something. 

"Let's keep going." The deputy interjected. "I don't know *what* the fuck that was, but I'm not tryin' to wait around here for it to come introduce itself."

"No!" I yelped as everyone turned to me. "No. He knows something." I pointed to Mr. Braam who was now bathing in sweat.

"I..well, you see...*Rudenhou-*" The light drained from his eyes before he could speak the name of the hospital. Braam fell to his knees, body lurched and punching the ground.  Every time he attempted to speak his back arched and his voice croaked in a wet heave.

"**RU**..den..*hou,*" Braam grunted between heaving. The sides of his hands were quickly covering themselves in blood as he continually hammered the sharp gravel looking for strength.

"**DRu**..."

Addy clasped my arm and buried her face into my back. "Look!" She whispered.

In my determination to hear an answer from Mr. Braam I hadn't noticed the woman lining the walls around us. Twelve of them, standing motionless in anatomical position as if we wouldn't see them if they didn't budge. Their eyes weren't observing the situation at hand, they were fixated on each other, admiring the battered flesh that shown between tattered clothes. No one else seemed to notice.

"**DRU**...denhouuussseeee.." Braam mustered up a full word just before a stream of milky white sludge poured from his mouth to the ground. The women lining the walls let out a simultaneous, piercing shriek that paralyzed us all in agony. I fell to the ground with Addy, blocking my ears with my palms. I could just make out the deputy in the same position, crawling by his elbows over to the side of the now unconscious Mr. Braam. Then it all stopped. Silence. 

"Hey, Jacob. You good?" The deputy tapped me on the shoulder. "You've been staring at that hole for an hour."

"Huh, yeah. I'm fine." I shook my head back to reality. "Excuse me, Mr. Braam?"

"Yes?" He responded cheerfully.

"Have you ever heard of the word 'Drudenhouse?'"

 ((My idea for this was that our protagonist was daydreaming, maybe a plant by a witch - not sure. Also, the spelling of drudenhouse is intentional, as we wouldn't know the proper spelling until Mr. Braam or someone was able to elaborate on the word. Maybe this is fixed through a dialogue moment about the pronunciation? 

"Ahh, you mean druden*haus.*")) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely draw a lot of /u/decomprosed. He likes how I make him...oh. *Oh.* Draw from. Right. 

/u/iia, tbh. I learned a lot from him about how to formulate a solid plot while still being relatively concise. You can find his work on the front page basically daily. My Record Keeper stories draw a lot from his format.

/u/vainercupidOOC taught me how to avoid commitment issues and always finish what I start.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I would be in a very bad spot if it wasn't for having a creative outlet like NoSleep. Writing has really kept me safe and sane when I was going through some really, *really* dark times throughout my life. Since I've joined the community and become a regular contributor I genuinely feel like things have been so much easier on me mentally. Between all of the great people here, the (small) fan base I've developed through posting, and my fam at 30 Press I just feel more...I don't know, balanced?

I guess that's weird to say. Some random online community is what has really been able to keep my spirits lifted. But that's what it is. It's hard to find people who tick like I do. And now I've found literally [dozens](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/JqYTmjn). </TEXT>

After that, get frustrated because stepping away did absolutely nothing and Debbie is still gone and nothing you ever write will be good enough to win her back and you should just move on but it's so hard when literally **everything** reminds me of her and I just wish she would have given me a second chance.

	<TEXT> Hello again!

You might remember me from such films as [*You're Crusin' for a Bruisin', Bro*](https://youtu.be/NAhNBr2Wytk) and [*Jack Fell on the Candlestick and the Resulting Injury Required Sleven Stitches.*](http://m.imgur.com/gallery/XKBNV)

I'm here to update you all on my book, *Typos Included.*

[It's live on Amazon!](http://a.co/eiYYvOt)

All of the proceeds from this book are being donated to Helen's Fund at Recovery Resources here in Cleveland, Ohio. The fund is set up to help people with drug problems receive help, regardless of their ability to pay. I want to dive into the financial aspect for a hot second.

*Typos Included* is selling for $2.99 right now. Through Amazon KDP, I've elected to receive 70% royalties from each sale which will net $2.07 after fees, taxes, and the likes. That doesn't sound like a lot, but I'm also matching each sale up to $500 per year. To break that down:

One copy costs $2.99     
That earns me $2.07       
My match is $2.07

Total donation - $4.14 per sale

That should hopefully add up quickly!      

I'm going to be adding a spreadsheet to the sidebar of my [sub](http://www.reddit.com/r/subject1780) this weekend which will contain everything that goes on financially with this book and the donations so everyone can verify that I'm sticking to my commitment. 

That's all, folks!
