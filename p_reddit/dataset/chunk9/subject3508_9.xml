	<TEXT> Warning: 

The above "neo-Nazis in Ukraine" website (Global Research) has a less-than-stellar reputation.

https://www.quora.com/Journalistic-Ethics-and-Norms-How-legitimate-is-The-Centre-for-Global-Research

It is by no means an objectively reliable media source. The articles, videos, and other media it puts forth are highly skewed and often factually inaccurate.

Also, see here:

http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Globalresearch

While some of GlobalResearch's articles discuss legitimate humanitarian concerns, its view of science, economics, and geopolitics is conspiracist  if something goes wrong, the Jews West didit! The site has long been a crank magnet: If you disagree with "Western" sources on 9/11, or HAARP, or vaccines, or H1N1, or climate change, or anything published by the "mainstream" media, then GlobalResearch is guaranteed to have a page you will love.  </TEXT>

Can we not find out who the editor is for the segment that this graphic ran on and shame him or her to hell?

I mean there are real people at Fox making the decisions to show this stuff. Why can't we call them out by name?

I want to know who made the call on this and who implemented it. Somewhere, there is a gaphic designer sitting in the bowels of Fox who actually opened Illustrator and Photoshop and made this thing. 

Who is he/she and who gave the command to draw it?

	<TEXT> Yeah, except there is absolutely no guarantee the new NAFTA will be better for the United States. 

I mean, I'd love to read a paper on exactly what Trump hopes to get from renegotiating. But so far, I haven't seen that.

And as for your point: 

Make your starting position more extreme that what you want, and then slowly move in.

Your starting position has to be believable or people will know you are bluffing. "USA unilaterally just pulling out of NAFTA" is exactly that - extreme. It's like starting a negotiation by saying "If you don't let me have this and this and this, I'm going to slam this huge hammer on all our thumbs, including mine!"

Everybody be like: "Okayyyy...?"

But you're right, it's not hard at all to see how incompetent Trump is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  NBC News confirmed that the three-star general is being vetted by the Trump campaign. 

Looks like NBC *confirmed nothing*, but merely assumed he was being vetted on the "say-so" of a member of the Trump campaign.

NBC: Are you vetting Flynn?

Trump team: you betcha!

NBC: Well, okie-dokie then!

And to be fair, normally it is perfectly fine to assume someone is in fact being vetted when the campaign in question tells you it is.

1) Do we support globalism? or

2) Do we bash this because we can squeeze some librual tears(c) out of it?

And...they prefer globalism, showing their true colors. </TEXT>

I'm guessing FOX wants to poison the well so any time someone one points to these farmers' argument as fair, the rebuttal can be "these farmers only care about themselves and not about America". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What a complete crock of shit from someone woefully uninformed about life outside of the United States.

 I pay 30% percent taxes and see nothing back whatsoever.

The fuck you don't. US roads, schools etc may not be the best in the world, but fuck man, have you ever been anywhere else? "Nothing back whatsovere", what a laugh!

 I live in a police state where I can easily be shot and killed with no repercussion towards the officer that killed someone that was unarmed.

Maybe you are black in which case forgive me. But lemme just say "hyperbole much"? 
 
 I have no say whatsoever in the wars my country is involved in.

Dude, you can VOTE, dammit. You may not have much say, but "no say whatsoever" is just patently false. Stop whining and campaign.

 My government tracks and watches my every move. If I disagree with our current system, foreign policy or war motives, I can be labeled a terrorist, and confined indefinitely, as well as tortured.

I guess "technically true"? But trust me, the world knows far worse places to be against the government, to be "the opposition". Have you heard of any of them, or are you really that in the dark?

 I am a citizen of the United States. I am not free.

You know, this line right here ^ is what pushed me over to write this. You claming to be *not free* in the United States is really like all those white Americans who say "I feel so discriminated against". I'm sure any black person in the US will tell you that is bullshit. And coming on here and claiming you are "not free" while a citizen of the United States is really quite offensive to people who live in you know, actual totalitarian places. 

I mean go for it man, get together with the North Koreans and have a pity pary together about how fucking not free you all are. I'm sure they'll lend you a shoulder to cry on.

	<TEXT> Their next question proved more difficult: who was the man behind the parchment? Allen and Sneff believe the leading candidate was **James Wilson**, a Pennsylvania delegate to the continental congress, one of six men to sign both the declaration and constitution, and, later, **one of the original supreme court justices**. The researchers argue that Wilson, who **argued vociferously for a popularly-elected president** and separation of powers, played a more influential role in American history than most historians have recognized.

	<TEXT> No, you don't understand. That guy above was not saying homosexuals face problems in Russia because of Putin and the Orthodox church. 

He is saying that the authorities in Russia are using the cover of "this guy is gay!" to get rid of political opponents who are not gay, because calling them gay keeps the public off the authorities' back over it, because the prevailing mood in Russia is "ewww, gays!"

Any actual rounding up of real gay men is not what he was referring to at all.
