	<TITLE> Significance of glass breaking </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So we've all talked about them being inside glass cages, aquariums etc. Between the cells they're being kept it, the aquarium Homer sees, and the high school cafeteria they're all built very similar. 

I'm the final moments of the last episode the bullet breaks through the glass and into OA. They film this very dramatically so we see the 5 pieces broken around her heart. 

Is the breaking through the glass significant here? Meaning its breaking through a dimension or reality etc. She's on the outside while the others remain inside.  Now that the glass is broken she's free.
