	<TEXT> My old roommate had laser removal done on his. He went through tons of treatment and it never fully went away. It works differently on everyone. If its a smaller piece then better chances of it going away. I'm not sure what your stance on tattoo's all around are, but another option would be a cover up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I call them voices, but really it's just me thinking the thoughts. I dissociate them to me because I can't control what it is saying or make it stop. So it's not like some morgan freeman is ranting in my head. I like to jokingly call it my inner dialogue. Movies actually portray the thoughts correctly but not the emotion associated with it. My head can say shit all day, but when it starts fucking with my feelings I know something bad is going down.

I was in the shower moments ago, shaving yknow. For some reason I thought it would be a great idea to run the razor across my face (which I ended up not doing). Also there was the cutest little frog in there :D. Today I seem to be very absent.. The voices are just very random not really relating towards anything. ON OTHER OCCASIONS they are usually very mean :(. Some real live quotes coming atcha "That dude is fucking ugly what a piece of shit." "It would feel so good to listen to him dying" "Can you imagine the blood flowing over your hands as you strangle the life out of them?" "You should rape her, she would probably enjoy it.". And when they concern me "You're a fucking psycho how could anyone love something like you?" "You know there is no hope you'll never be better" "You're fine there's nothing wrong with you stop being a pussy".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like to think that reincarnation is real. Once we die we get reborn as a different person and sometimes dreams can be windows to what past lives were like. Over time your general personality changes and is morphed by certain things that happen. 

I also like to think that the universe is a huge ocean. Maybe we are just floating around on a tiny spick of sand in a huge ocean. Other planets are other little particles of sand, and somewhere out there, there are giant fish swimming around.  </TEXT>
