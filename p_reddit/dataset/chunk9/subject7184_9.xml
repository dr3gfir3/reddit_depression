	<TEXT> I am 34 and I have only have my license for 2 years.  I failed the practical (road) test 2x before I passed.  It wasn't that I did anything especially poorly, it was that I was afraid and nervous.  Visibly so.  Shaking.  I told the instructor I was nervous, hoping that he'd have mercy on my Soul.  Nope.

The 3rd attempt I literally faked it.  I was still nervous.  My tummy was so upset I thought I was going to shit myself.  (I actually photo-finished it to the local Wawa after my test, RIP the person in the stall next to me T_T)  But I just was polite to my instructor and said almost nothing, despite how I actually felt.  While we were waiting our turn to parallel park, he asked me why I never had my license before, and I said I never really needed it, but I wanted to have a baby so I needed to do this.  I was so far away from the curb when it was my turn to park, but still, I faked confidence.

When my instructor passed me, I literally almost kissed him full on the mouth.  I was so, so excited.  And now, 2 years later I'm no longer nervous.  It's no big deal, and I wish I could tell my younger self the same thing.

TLDR:  Just be confident (even if you aren't, pretend you are!) and take your time.  Good luck with your test!!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dr. Strange   World of Warcraft.

Ok, I think those 2 actually fit together well, since there's already a lot of magic and fantasy content in WoW.  Dr. Strange   his friends are pretty much monks and/or mages.  Definitely a really cool combo! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't care that you're poor and you need money so you clock in at 05:30 when you aren't scheduled to be here until 06:30.  I don't care that you sit there and milk the clock all day.  I don't care that you're supposed to leave at 14:30, but you usually linger at your desk until 15:30.  I don't care that you play Candy Crush at your desk during downtime.  I don't care that you take about 9,000 cigarette breaks all day.

What I do care about - what drives me up a freakin' wall is that you AREN'T EVEN DOING YOUR WORK!!!  YOU ARE SITTING THERE SCREWING AROUND AND NOT COMPLETING SH.T THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE TIME I COME IN AT 09:00.  You are making *extra* work for me b/c of this.  And our USELESS MANAGER is blaming me, even though I've explained the problem several times.  I've physically SHOWN him your negligence.  Nothing has changed.

And I can't get a new job b/c I'm too "overqualified" for anything.  I need to make at least the small amount I make now to be able to afford to live should I try to go anywhere else.  This has been my life for over a year.  I fantasize almost daily about sitting here and just not doing my work to see what would happen.  I fantasize about going over my immediate manager's head to the next level manager to tell her all of the bullsh*t that's been going on.  I fantasize about outright quitting.

I'm going to snap very soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ooh if you like to hike outside of Geocaching then you def should get one.  I've heard some horror stories on the Geocaching boards, lol.  Depending on how into Geo you get, there's local factions of message boards that you can get onto, and they have local meetups.  I went to a local BBQ once and it was SO MUCH FUN!!!  And I did a Halloween party that was hilarious.  Even my then-lazy lump husband did the stuff and actually enjoyed himself, so you never know ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm finishing up my last two weeks of community college. I'm graduating with honors.

Honestly, good for you for not quitting.  That's amazing that you were able to balance a kiddo and school, b/c I don't think I could have done that.  Heck, I could barely handle my life in general when BabySpawn was first born!!  And that's awesome your next step is a free ride!!  That is such a huge load off your mind (and pocket, lol.)

I totally get that whole "next kid" thing - uhhh it's not really that person's decision to make.  e_e  Every family has at least one of those asshats, I've found!

	<TEXT> Has your doctor said that your kids are overweight or unhealthy?  B/c if not, then I'm not sure I'd make an overly huge deal about it.

I do agree that everyone needs to be moving around and at the very least taking a walk once a day, just to unwind and relax and get the blood flowing.

You said that your kids aren't into sports - have you had them try them out, or they haven't shown interest?  B/c I remember my parents signing me up for t-ball, soccer, and dance w/o my ever having asked.  They did stop signing me up for dance when I expressed more interest in soccer/softball.  Could try to doing something like that.

Also - a really great and fun way to get out but it doesn't seem like exercise - GEOCACHING!  It's a global treasure hunt.  Some are easy peasy in a parking lot, but there are lots in parks that you have to walk or hike to, so that can be fun.  There are tons that are child friendly, too!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, this question 

It's hard but not impossible.  I used to keep BabySpawn in a little bouncy seat so he could watch me play.  Usually he just fell asleep watching me.  Mostly the first couple of months, it's eat, poop, cry, sleep.

It gets better when they get older and start sleeping through the night.  Now, at 1 year, 4 months - BabySpawn goes to bed at 8:30 so there's plenty of time to raid.  And on the weekends, he plays with his toys in the computer room while I play.  Sometimes he sits on my lap and watches me.

In the beginning, I'd rather sleep than play WoW, but let me tell you coffee does wonders :)  Yes, you will be playing less at first, but you will be back in action before you know it.

EDIT:  A word. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm one of those lucky people who's parents paid for her college, and I have a savings account (sadly not with $30k in it, though lol) but I still have a few money worries.  I work a full time job (40+ hrs a week) but I still barely make anything.  I couldn't afford benefits through my work after this latest "revamp of the system" so I now have that through my husband.  I make enough to keep us where we need to be.  I have little left over, but I still always try to deposit $10.00 a paycheck to my savings.  It sucks, but I would rather have it in a real emergency rather than a week's worth of coffee.  Some paychecks, I have to choose this.

Have you ever thought about talking to a financial advisor/planner?  You don't need to be rich to do it.  He can help you save and set up a budget to get what you want later in life, as well as manage your debit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Game Freezing - AddOn Help/Just the Server Lag? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-01 16:27:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This week, for some reason whenever I /reload or switch characters my game lags out and freezes so that I have to alt+f4 out of it.  Not entirely sure why.

When I disable all addons, it still takes a while to log out, but it doesn't freeze.  If I enable just 1 addon, it lags out and freezes.  It doesn't matter what addon that I enable.

Is this happening to anyone else, or is this just related to the strange server lag that I've seen several posts about?  Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the correct keto forum to post it, but I'm going to give it a shot.

I downloaded the Total Keto Diet app b/c I was wanting to try out some different foods and recipes instead of the same 5 variants I'd been eating.

But, I had a really hard time *finding* the ingredients in my local Shoprite.  They weren't anything crazy, things like almond flour, sugar free chocolate chips, etc.  I managed to find the almond flour but it was $10.00 for a very small bag!!  And they didn't even carry 100% cacao chips.

Where do you guys shop?  Is there anyplace that has a good variety of keto-friendly products like almond flour, etc?  (Or hey, just someplace where I can buy keto-friendly, ready-made muffins xD)

EDIT:  I'm in NJ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My son had torticollis, probably from the way he was laying inside the womb.  You can ask the doctor, and it will be documented.  Our dr sent us to a PT, which was a group of 3 different ladies.  They gave us a few exercises to try.

* Place your baby in the crib facing the wall.  She will naturally want to turn away toward the action.  So, it will help her stretch to her left.

*  Place baby on the floor or on a mat.  Jingle bells and make interesting noises on her left to encourage her to turn her head that way.

* Place baby on the floor or on a mat.  Gently turn her head to the left and hold for 5 seconds.  Repeat 5x.  (If she's like my son, she will probably get mad and not enjoy it, but it honestly helps.)

Also, be aware that if she continually is laying down on that side, her head might get a flat spot.  Baby did, and so we ended up needing to get a helmet for most of a year to correct it. </TEXT>

Baby's birth was only a couple of days early and other than the cord being wrapped around his neck, it was pretty normal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My then-boyfriend at the time picked me up from my house 3 hours earlier than we'd planned, so I wasn't ready.  I was a little surprised but I threw some stuff in a bag and said I would just shower and get ready at his house.  His shower was vile and filthy.  I tried not to cry as I showered, trying to keep myself from touching any parts of the walls.  He didn't buy me a gift or a card.  He dragged me out to eat at *his* favourite restaurant, and then back to his place where he just got shit-faced drunk.  We had to wait until he sobered up enough to drive me home, b/c I didn't have my license at the time   it was too far to walk.  When he dropped me off, I told him that he ruined my birthday, that it was literally the worst birthday ever.  He shrugged at me and said, "Who cares, it's just another day anyway." </TEXT>
