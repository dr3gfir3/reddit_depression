[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/65r7zw/the_changing_part_2/) 

I awaken in the Shardstake's basement. It's been converted into some kind of mini cinema. It has about twenty old, red seats in rows. I'm sitting, tied to the middlemost chair in the front row. All the other seats are occupied by dead bodies. Some of them are already skeletal, some are still decomposing. The smell stings my eyes. I am determined not to throw up. My head throbs with pain in the bump that Benny gave me when he knocked me unconscious earlier. 

I look around and see that there are bodies sitting upright against the walls also. I hear the door creak open and Penny comes over to me. She begins tightening the leather straps that are restraining my hands and feet.

"W-why are you d-doing this ?", I stutter.


She laughs in my face.

"You people.....", she sighs.
"What's happening to my wife ? What did you do to her ?"
"Do to her ?", asks Penny innocently. "Why I didn't do anything to her. It's The Changing."
"The Changing ?", I ask. "What the fuck is The Changing ?"
"It's the most beautiful phenomenon in human history. As far as we know, Frank and I were the first and only ones to ever experience The Changing. Until we had children, of course. To be short, The Changing is when a person, Frank, Benny, myself and now Belle, is completely normal, fits into society perfectly and lives a normal, boring, meaningless life until one day, over night, a series of Changes occur for a couple of days, and when that period is over, they come out of it as the same person, except they see things clearer now. They realise that human life isn't as precious as we previously thought, that most humans are worthless, irrelevant and ultimately, dangerous. That they are arrogant, self serving vultures that pollute the earth, cross one another for personal gain and manipulate fellow humans. That they deserve to be wiped out. And that they should suffer whilst doing it."
"So you turn into insane, preachy fucking sociopaths ?", I spit at her.

She cackles once again.

"Typical human answer. You would cast us aside, dismiss us as being sick or degenerates, whereas, in reality, we're the next step in evolution. We're more evolved than you people can be expected to comprehend. We can see past emotion, we don't need love, compassion, happiness or human connection. We're the next step in the evolutionary chain. We are superior to you people."
"So you don't even love your own children ?"
"Not anymore. Not after The Changing. We guide them until The Changing takes them. That's what's happening to Belle. She's a little later than the rest of us. For Frank and I, we both Changed at twenty five and Benny Changed at sixteen. We were so proud of him. And now Belle is the latest at twenty nine. Unfortunately there aren't any other of The Changed other than the four of us but, we suspect that if both Benny and Belle mate with regular people, their offsprings will inherit The Changing gene. Also, Frank can still reproduce if needs be. Then if we exterminate enough regulars, we can repopulate with a flawless society of The Changed. If Changed people populated the earth, there would be no wars, famine, hunger or terrorism. There'd be a functional, non emotional efficient society."
"So you're going to single handedly off every single other person on this planet ? Six billion people ?"
"Well no, not everyone obviously. We'll keep going at our pace until our people grow into a sufficient army to take on the remaining regulars."
"You're gonna go to war with the human race ? Haven't you learned that that's really not a good fucking idea by now ?"
"They've never went to war with us. And with bigger numbers, they'll have no chance."

Now it's my turn to laugh. Despite all the fear and pain and anxiety I've felt over the last few hours since Belle's family revealed themselves to be psychos, I still find all this dystopian shit completely ludicrous.

"So why haven't you killed me ?", I ask.
"Why haven't I killed you ?"
"Yeah, why haven't you rid the world of another 'inferior being' ?"
"Well, since Belle is the one who brought you here, we feel she deserves to be the one to do it. Plus, we'd like to keep an eye on her during her first kill and you're...... handy."
"I'm glad I'm so convenient."
"She's still in the transitional period so she's still rather erratic. You'll have to wait a while."
"Oh goody."

I wait, surrounded by the dead bodies, on edge from pure fear, for death. I jump when I hear someone coming down the steps into the basement. It's Benny, with his gormless face and signature metal bat. He shuffles in.

"She's nearly Changed. I gotta bring you up and prepare you. The less you struggle the less it's gonna hurt."

 He releases me from the leather straps. He rests his bat on the body in the seat next to me. He lifts me over his shoulder with surprising strength. He turns around so that I'm facing the bat. Now's my chance. I take the heavy bat, knee Benny in the groin and whack him in the head with the bat, knocking him unconscious. 

I sprint up the steps and race around the confusing hallways of the huge house and eventually find a door. The bat slips from my grasp as I rush past the pool, realising it was the back door. I run towards the fence, hoping the adrenaline will help me get over the top. 

Just as I reach my hand out for the fence, a pair of arms wrap around me and the world tilts for a disorientating second and I crash to the ground. It's Frank. He gets up and dives at me savagely. I kick him in the stomach, scramble up and run back toward the house. The back door is shut. I run along the back of the house and get to a large, floor to ceiling window of the sun room. I turn around just in time to see Frank bounding at me like a rabid dog. He crashes straight into me and I fall through the plate-glass window back into the house.

I wake up in the living room where Belle is tied up in her armchair. I too am bound in an armchair. I have a leather strap around my mouth also, preventing me from making any sound. She is facing away from me. I guess one of the shards cut my head when I fell through the window as there's dry blood down the side of my face. 

I look out the window. It's dusk. Frank and Penny are out on the front lawn chatting to a concerned looking neighbour. They probably heard me falling through the window. Penny and Frank are laughing and charming the neighbour. They're acting like regular, neighbourly rich folks with a happy family. I find it mind-blowing how much that neighbour's perception of this household is probably so unbelievably wrong. Little do they know of the horrific skeletons in the fucked up closet of the Shardstakes.

I try to scream, to attempt to alert the neighbour, but hardly any sound escapes the leather strap. Benny comes over and gently thumps my head when I make the noise. The pain the gently tap causes is searing and blinding. Pulsing, white hot pain throbs through my head.

I sit here, impossibly frightened. I've been in constant fear and extreme anxiety for almost the whole day and my bones, muscles and nerves are beginning to ache from it. I didn't think it was possible to be in such a state of heightened fear for so long. I realise something as I sit here. Hell does exist. It isn't a big fire and brimstone firey landscape full of tortured souls. It exists on earth. In small, condensed spaces and it only exists for a small number of desperately unfortunate individuals. I am one of those individuals. And Hell isn't a grand place where the devil rules. It's disguised as a happy, sunny, wealthy suburban paradise where a functional family live.

I think to myself how I got myself into possibly the only place where hell is a reality on earth. It's not war, where people are forced to kill for their country. It's not inside a terrorist camp where people are brainwashed into killing for a cause. It's in a house where the people don't kill for a cause. They kill because they are pure evil. Pure evil people who will not relent in torturing me or any of the previous victims lured into this micro chasm of pure terror. I think to myself how few times a human has been so afraid for so long. After a while, even in the direst situations, fear fades. But somehow, in this suburban Hell, I have been afraid for almost a day and my body can't take much more of it. So, yeah, Hell exists in a small situation where a person is forced to endure the most horrific experience possible. And I am that fucking person.

I begin to cry. Not even for me. For the time when I lived with my wife. My real wife before any of this shit happened to her. The chances are, I probably will never see her again.

Penny and Frank come back inside. Penny kneels down in front of Belle. 

"She's sleeping", says Penny. "She should be ready soon. Bring him into the room, Benny."

Benny complies and drags the armchair I am bound to down a hallway, past the kitchen and into a room I've been into before. The room is small with padlocked cupboards all around. There is a metal table in the centre of the room with similar leather straps to my armchair. There is a smaller table beside that with an assortment of knives on it.

Benny unstraps my straps and goes to lift me again. I kick him in the stomach, sending him flying backwards into the table of knives. The knives spill everywhere and Benny gets back up and swings his bat. I duck, grabbing a large looking knife.

Benny clumsily swings his bat again. Again, I duck and when his head is ducked down I jam my knife into his skull. I hear the steel breaking through the bone in his skull with a sickening crack. Benny slowly and calmly stands up, the handle of the knife sticking out of the top of his head.

For a second he seems calm, as if nothing happened. Then he sticks out his arms and backs me against the wall. A small stream of blood runs down his face. His fingers wrap around my throat and begin to tighten. I close my eyes. His grip isn't tightening. I look at him as a sheet of flowing blood covers his whole face, he can't see. He spits out mouthfuls of warm, sticky blood onto my face as it goes in his mouth. His clothes are saturated in it now and a pool is collecting on the ground. His body goes stiff as a board and he slowly tips over onto the floor.

I slide down the wall breathing heavily. I can't believe I just did that. He's gone. He was here a second ago and now he's gone forever. Because of me. I begin to hyperventilate. I sit here in the cold room and, before I know it, there's a layer of blood covering the whole floor of the room. I stand up but slip, getting blood all over my clothes. I nearly faint, but I will myself to stay awake. I puke.

After vomiting, I stumble out of the room and down the hall. I find myself in the same living room. It's just Penny standing there. Belle is gone. I stand in front a coffee table and see a butcher knife. I kick myself for not notcing how many knives were left laying around before. I spot the handgun Belle had this morning.

I look at Penny. She is closer to it. She rushes for it and as her fingers grasp it I bring the butcher knife down on her wrist. Blood spews all over her face as she howls in pain. I bring it down again, cutting through bone this time. I bring it down a third time and she falls back, flailing. I step back and look at the severed hand. I drop the knife, horrified. Penny is  screaming in pain on the floor. He left arm ends in a stump which is spraying blood at a dangerous rate.

She looks at me with woeful disdain.

"You know it's no one's fault but your own", I say.

I run down another hallway in the confusing mansion and I think I hear an engine. I hope to God it's the police. Suddenly, Frank bursts through a door opposite me, wielding a chainsaw. He rushed at me and I barely dodge his heavy handed swipe at me. He misses, tearing the family photos on the table behind me to shreds. I run upstairs. He chases me, growling. When I get to the top I turn and as he pulls the chainsaw back, I kick the handle, causing him to drop it down the stairs, breaking it. 

He lunges at me and scrabs me with his nails. I punch him and sprint back downstairs. He follows. I run into the sunroom, where he pushed me through the window. Frank gains on me and knocks me onto the floor, which is still full of glass. I grab the biggest shard I can find. He pulls a knife out from his pocket and slashes at me. I duck and run in a random direction. I find myself going upstairs again. I run through the maze of the second floor hallways and pick a random room. I run into it. It's a bedroom. I run out onto the balcony. 

Frank swipes at me as I turn around. I just about dodge it and shove the shard of glass I have into his eye. He screams in terror as blood runs down his cheek. I step back and kick the glass in further, silencing him. He goes limp, his body toppling over the balcony and falling into the pool and sinks to the bottom, turning the water red.

I stumble back, hardly believing what I just had to do. My vision goes blurry and then black. I panic for a moment before my sight comes back. I stumble downstairs, exhausted. I go into another living room. I hear someone coming at me from behind. It's Penny. She rushed at me, pushing me into a framed picture on the wall, headfirst. The glass frame shatters as my head hits it and blinding pain courses through my head, but it's not as unbearable as when I went through the window.

Penny scrambles up, she has some kind of cloth around the bloody stump. She gets up but I kick her in the stomach, winding her. She flies back as I run down another hallway. I run into the dining room. Belle is standing in front of me and, before I know it, she knocks me to the ground and start punching my face. She grabs at my neck and wraps her hand hands around it. She chokes me again. I see a rack of china plates beside me. I reach and grab one, and smash it over her head. She falls over, unconscious. I get up, limping, wheezing and coughing.  I wander around and see the patio. 

I see my coat hanging beside it.  My coat. With my phone in it. I run to it and take out my phone. I go out into the back garden, feeling the cool night air on my face. I ring 911.

"Hello this is 911, what's your emergency", chirps the operator.
"Please, help me", I cry. "I'm in the Shardstake house on Greenleaf avenue. Please you have to help they're trying to kill me", I scream.
"Okay, sir. Wha-", the phone gets cut off.

I look at the screen. It says low battery and powers off. I try to turn it back on. No dice.

"FUCK !", I scream in anger, throwing my phone in the pool, which was now full of red water.

I think I hear the garage door opening. I turn around and I'm blinded by a set headlights in the garage. They start speeding towards me. It's Penny in the Range Rover. I fall out of the way and the Range Rover speeds past me and past the pool and crashes into the wall with a deafening crash.

I walk over the car, hoping Penny is dead or unconscious. I look at the car. The whole windscreen has shattered. There is a small pool of blood collecting on the mutilated bonnet. Penny is sitting in the drivers seat with her head down, eyes closed. There's dozens of jagged shards of glass piercing her chest and arms and her stump has begun bleeding again.

Suddenly, Penny jerks awake and falls out of the car, splashing blood about. She tries to get up of the ground, but can't. She lies there, bleeding and unable to get up. She pulls a long shard of glass out of her jaw with a blood curdling scream. 

"Fuck you", she says. "I could've made this world great. I could've evolved this whole planet but you had fuck it all up didn't you ? You self righteous, selfish BASTARD !"
"You were never going to be able to take on the human race. You may see emotion as a weakness but we don't. We see it as a strength you don't have."
"Oh fuck you, you small minded prick. You know we would have made a great society but you didn't want to get a little hurt. You didn't want to experience pain so you did what all humans do. You did what you wanted despite the all the plans and ideas you'd be shitting on. You ruined everything."
"I didn't ruin anything. I rid the world of evil, ruthless serial killers who have no qualms about ending human lives."
"You just ended two human lives, you hypocrite !"
"I did it so the innocent people you would've killed in the future could live."
"It doesn't matter, anyway. Belle is newly Changed and young and strong and she'll rip you apart."
"Maybe I don't care if I get ripped apart. Maybe I don't car as long as you people are out of it. If Belle does kill me, which I hope she fucking does, she'll be locked away for the rest of her life."
"The police would never figure it out in time. She'll have all this cleaned up by tomorrow."
"Not unless someone rang them telling them that the Shardstakes are murdering people."
"You didn't."
"You can fucking bet I did, bitch."

Just then she manages to get up and she weakly thrusts the shard of glass she has at me. I block it easily, grabbing the one wrist she has left. She is wobbling as I am holding her. I let go of her wrist and she collapses into the pool, the red water enveloping her as she sinks to the bottom. She doesn't even resist as the last few bubbles of air rise to the surface.

I go back inside and try to get to the front of the house. I take a turn and end up in one of the kitchens. Belle is there cowering in the corner. She is crying loudly and looking confused. My heart flutters as I go over to her.

"Belle, sweetie ?", I ask gently.
"Phil", she cries. "What happened ? What's going on ? Why is this happening to me ?"
"It's okay", I say, helping her up. "We can go home now."

I put my arm around her, helping her up and then she stops crying. She looks into my eyes and smiles that evil grin. She reveals a knife and plunges it into my shoulder. I scream in pain as the metal pierces my skin and gets jammed in my bone.

I fall to the floor, screaming. The pain is making my thoughts cloudy. I can't think straight. I crawl across the kitchen, bleeding. I can't believe how horrific the last day has been. I can't believe I walked straight into this Hell, completely obliviously. Not only have I been subjected to the depths of bad human experiences, I walked into it willingly and ignorantly. 

I long for a time when I thought having a problem was not paying my gas bill. I miss the time when I lived with my mom in her apartment, in my own little bubble. Before I knew pain like this even existed. Before I knew fear or evil like this existed, back when I had enough blind faith in the human race to think that horrors like this never would happen. I want to go back to when I lived with my mom and appreciated the small things like a nice day or finding a dollar on the street.

The sweet sound of hope echoes in my mind. I have to survive this. Even if there's a chance, a tiny, tiny chance that I can experience that carefree, simple, boring ass life where I'd go to work and come home and complain about it, a chance at returning to normality and feeling that even once more, I have to take it. I have to survive.

Belle is giggling, choosing a weapon with which to end me. I crawl out of the kitchen and toward the front door. I hear Belle load a gun. She comes out into the hallway and points a large shotgun at me. She fires off a round and misses me completely, blowing a hole in the front door. The recoil alone sends her flying backwards. 

I hear sirens as I crawl down the front steps. I see my car. I crawl over to it and hide behind it. Belle comes out onto the porch and loads the gun again. She fires off another round, causing a window in my car to explode. She fires again blowing a hole beside me in the car. Suddenly, three police cars speed up the driveway. Several police officers get out and point there handguns at Belle. They look at me, bleeding and broken with a knife stuck in me.

"Drop the gun, mam", shout the cops.


I look at Belle. Her face contorts in irritance and anger. She grows contrary and shoots at the cops, catching one of them in the arm. The rest of the cops open fire on Belle, the bullets ripping her apart.

I'm sitting next to my mother in the police station. She's holding me. I survived. Holy shit, I actually survived. My mother tells me it's been nearly two days since the "incident". She says for the last two days I've just been going between catatonia, crying hysterically and blacking out. I can't recall any of that. Last thing I remember is bleeding out behind my car while Belle faced off with the cops.

My arm and shoulder is in a cast and I have band aids all over my head. The rest of today consists of police interrogations, court appearances and therapy. They tell me I'm going to have to go to therapy every day for a while. I do one "exclusive interview with the survivor of the Shardstake Massacre" before going back to therapy. I tell the therapist the whole story, leaving out no details. I can see her trying to hide the shock and terror as she hears the things I've been through. I don't blame her. No person should have to endure the things I've seen.

As the day comes to a close, I realise I'm still afraid. It's a different kind of fear, though. It's one that will fade. I'm not scared because of all the shit I've been through and seen or the things I had to do to survive. I'm afraid because of something else. Something far more terrible, sinister and incurable. I feel myself beginning to Change. </TEXT>

[Part 3](http://ww.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/662fxc/the_changing_part_3/) 

I drive to the doctors and look at her. Her long, black, silky hair becoming wiry from the dried blood. Her big, blue eyes wet with tears. I almost think that her waking up is the worst part because of the distress it causes her. She gets so upset. I remember being trapped in my bedroom for what felt like hours. I waited for her to start crying before coming out. I just couldn't risk waking her myself. 

"What did I do ?", she cries, ashamed. "Is this the hamster's blood ?"
"Yeah, yeah it's the hamster's", I lied, not telling her about the rabbit.
"I can't believe I did that, I'm so sorry. We can bury him when we get back."
"Sure, yeah fine", I say, distracted. 
"Where did the axe come from ?", she asks me.

I'd been hoping to avoid this question. 

"You just found it and started waving it around, that's all."
"Oh my God, I could've killed you", she gasped.
"No, no, course you couldn't", I lie, knowing full well that she nearly out and out murdered me this morning.

We arrive at the doctors and wait in the waiting area. I look at her again. She has stopped crying and is staring straight ahead at the wall. Her posture is unusually perfect. I realise she's starting to slip back.

"You alright there, Belle ?", I ask timidly.

No answer. I hold her hand. No response. Her eyes are glazed over. I know it's only a matter of time.

"Belle ? You okay ?", I ask again, squeezing her hand.

She mumbles something in reply. Okay, that's a good sign. It means there's still enough time to get her into the doctor. All of a sudden, the doctor walks in.

"Okay", he smiled. "I can see you now, Ms.Quinn."

Belle stands up slowly and walks in, back straight, no expression. 

"Should I go in too ?", I ask.
"No, I think I'll be okay", chuckles the doctor.

Minutes pass. I shift uncomfortably in my seat and check my watch constantly. Ten minutes. I get some water. Twenty minutes. I pace up and down. At the thirty minute mark, the doctor comes back out. His face is snow white and he is shaking slightly. He walks up to me.

"Your wife will be fine", he says with a wary look in his eye. "No treatment is necessary."
"Well what happened ?", I ask. "What's wrong with her ?"
"Nothing. Absolutely nothing", he says, literally pushing me and Belle out the door.
"Wait, what happened ? I nee-", I start to say but he slams the door shut and locks it. He pulls down all the blinds in his office.

I walk, deflated back to the car. I slump in my seat as Belle climbs in, eerie and vacant as ever. She is still dead-eyed. What the fuck am I supposed to do now ?  I decide to take her to her parents house. Whatever is happening, I hope they have some information, or at least be able to calm her down a bit.

I start the journey to the suburbs, where her parents owned what was basically a mansion. It was a stylish, three story house with a pool and an indoor hot tub and acres of land and a garage full of expensive cars. Her parents were the some of the nicest people I know, but I never liked going there because I always get this weird feeling that they're judging me because being a teacher will never allow me to make enough money to live their lavish, wealthy lifestyle.

But this, of course, is a special circumstance. Belle falls asleep almost immediately. I drive for a little under an hour before I reach the rich part of the suburbs. I drive past tall, meticulously clipped hedges covering the undoubtedly expensive abodes. I arrive at her parents gates and open them. I get back in my car and Belle's awake. The driveway is long and winding, with small forests of tall trees on either side. I drive down the little track as Belle begins to murmur.

"Fuck you", she says.
"I know that's not you Belle, try to fight it. We nearly there."
"I never loved you, you fuckwit", she laughs evilly.
"I'm not listening to you."
"You think you're so important, so caring and kind, looking after you're crazy wife. But you're just like all the rest of them. Put up with me for show and feed your ego and then dump me on my parent's doorstep like a stray fucking dog."
"I'm not dumping you-"
"Sure your not, you small minded dick stain. I bet you think 'all life is precious and everyone deserves equality' like some dim bulb fucking hippie. You think you're open minded and kind and a goddamn samaritan, but you're just a phoney fucking spineless dickhole just like the rest of them."
"Belle, I don't know what's going through your head right now, and I can't imagine how tough it is, but if you can just fight this for a little longer-"

Suddenly, Belle reached over and yanked my steering wheel and we swerved and scraped the side of my car on one of the trees.

"Belle, fuck....no.....STOP !", I yell, pushing her back into her seat.

Eventually she subsides and sits still, staring at me with evil intensity. She twitches violently every so often and whispers profanities to herself. Finally, we reach the end of the seemingly endless driveway and the fancy house comes into view.

Belle's parents must've heard the car coming because they're coming out onto the porch as I climb out of my car. I catch a glimpse of their gardener snipping the hedge as I get out and realise I've never spoken to her. In fact I've never even seen her face before, just the back of her head.

Frank and Penny Shardstake stand on the porch with warm, welcoming smiles on their faces. Sometimes I think their lives are just too perfect. It's almost eerie. Frank, a stylish ex-lawyer, is wearing a blazer with a shirt and creased suit pants and shined shoes. He has short, cropped white hair and well groomed white facial hair to match. He is wearing his signature stylish, black glasses. Penny, a retired psychiatrist who had her own psychology based talk show, is a tall, hippieish woman with icy blue eyes and long, bushy brown hair and is always wearing some kind of flowy cardigan or shawl. 

"Phil", beams Penny. "What a nice surprise."
"How are you, Phil ?", asks Frank.

Just as I am about to greet them and explain, Belle rushes out of the car grabs me by the throat, rushing me towards the wall past Penny and Frank. She tightens her grip and begins to choke me. She looks into my eyes with deep, real hatred as my eyes water from the lack of air.

Frank and Penny grab her and pull her back into the house as I slide down the wall, recovering. I cough and splutter and gulp down sweet bursts of fresh oxygen. I stumble into the house and see Frank and Penny restraining Belle in a soft armchair that has buckles to restrain your wrists and ankles. I've never spent much time in this living room, but still, it strikes me as odd that I never noticed this before.

Penny comes over and dusts me off.

"Are you alright ?", asks Penny, concerned. "Are you hurt ?"

Penny feel around my face and neck for any injuries. She leaves her hands resting on my back for an uncomfortably long time.

"Oh my God, Phil. We're so sorry about this", apologises Frank.
"Wait, you knew about this ?", I inquire, confused.
"Why don't you sit down with us in the kitchen ?", asks Penny. "I'll make tea."


I sit down as Penny boils the kettle. Belle's brother, Benny, who lives with his parents despite being thirty five, stares at me intently. He has always made me uncomfortable. He wears only army print clothes despite never being in the military, he always smelled of sweat, he had long, scraggly hair, never smiled and always carried a metallic baseball bat on his shoulder wherever he goes. I've actually never seen him without. He has never liked me and has made no secret of it. I tried to get along with him initially but I gave up after a while. I always wonder how Penny, Frank and Belle (for the most part) have turned out so well and Benny turned out like this.

He walks past me, making some kind of intimidating expression. I relax as he exits the room.

"So, has this happened before ?", I ask.
"Well, yes", admitted Frank. "But not since she was little."
"Well what happened when she was little ?"

Penny sits serves us mugs of tea and sits down.

"When Belle was around seven or eight, she began to act out in increasingly violent ways. It got to the point where  we were getting worried for our own safety as well as her's. She began to show signs of psychopathic and sociopathic tendencies. That's why we have the restrainment chairs, she used to get out of control and dangerous. So I did some treatment on her and it seemed to work. She doesn't even remember it", states Penny.
"Well, whatever it is, it's back. But it's only coming in bursts. Every so often, she would......sort of change. And do increasingly terrible things. And then, after a while, go back to her normal self and have no recollection of it", I say.
"Yes, well that's new. But not surprising, I've heard that happen on many occasions before. I'll do some research, and do some treatment with her", says Penny.
"I'm sorry for bringing her here, but I had no other choice. I.....she tried to......attack me this morning", I admit.
"No", says Frank. "You did the right thing. Thank you. And I want you to stay here for as long as you need."
"Has it gotten worse over time ?", asks Penny.
"Yeah, it usually only lasts about twenty minutes but she's been like this for over two hours now, I'm starting to get worried", I say.
"Don't you worry, Phil. It's okay now, you can relax", smiled Penny. "Why don't you boys go have a beer in the big sitting room while I talk to Belle ?"
"Sure", I say, finally relaxing.

Minutes later I'm sitting on an overly expensive sofa drinking a beer.

"So, Phil", smiles Frank. "How's the teaching going ?"
"Ah, yeah, it's going fine. I've been promoted to vice principal, actually."

I think I see Frank rolling his eyes, but I look up and he's still holding that warm smile.

"Well that's great", he says. "So, about Belle. That's gotta be pretty tough, huh ?"
"Yeah, well it's just kinda scary, is all."
"Well, I don't mean to pry, but, ah I've heard that symptoms such as the ones Belle is dealing with here, can be caused by extremely stressful environments. You aren't beating her or anything, are ya ?", he chuckles heartily.

I laugh nervously at this off colour joke he's just made about his sick daughter.

"You aren't, though, are you ?", he says with a stern expression. "Because if you are, I'll kill you. And I mean that literally. And don't think I can't because I'm nearly sixty, because, boy, can I do it. I'll rip your fucking skin off", he snarls.

I sit back, shell shocked. He bursts into the laughter. He loses his breathe from this apparently hilarious situation.

"I'm just kidding around", he says through his laughs. "You know I'd never think that."
"Yeah", I say, trying to chuckle but can't manage to.
"You know you're part of the family, right, Phil ?"
"Yeah, well thanks. Thanks a lot."

Penny walks in and sits down. 

"I think she wants to talk to you, Frank", says Penny.
"Alrighty", he says cheerily, slapping my shoulder, playfully.

Christ, that was weird. I tell myself I'm probably just tired. Penny looks kindly at me.

"This must be pretty hard for you, Phil. Dealing with all this for the first time."
"Yeah, it's kinda frightening."
"Yeah", she said, moving closer to me. "You must be so stressed. Never able to let off some steam."

She starts to gently massage my shoulder and I quickly jerk away. She doesn't seem to notice.

"No, well, I'm fine", I say nervously.
"Frank and I never, let off any "steam" anymore. It's frustrating", she whispers, looking into my eyes. Her smile fades. "Would you fuck me ?", she asks.

My eyes widen and I find I'm utterly speechless. What is happening ? Suddenly, she throws her head back and wheezes a good natured laugh. She looks at me.

"I'm kidding, Phil. Jeeze. Calm down. You look like you've seen a ghost", she laughs.

I don't even bother trying to laugh.

"Oh, I'm sorry, Phil, I shouldn't be messing with you like this, considering what's going on. I didn't even think, oh I'm sorry. It's just that Frank and I have been holed up in this big house for a while and we've kind've developed an irreverent sense of humour."
"No, it's fine", I say. "I'm just kinda tired. I think I'm gonna go to bed."
"Okay, but have some dinner first, I've been cooking a stew for a while in the upstairs kitchen. I at least owe that to you."
"Sounds delicious", I smile.

I sit down at the table with Penny and Frank and begin to nibble at my food. Benny is standing in the corner, ferociously eating an apple, the metal bat resting on his shoulder.

I eat my food quickly, knowing that the sooner I eat this, the sooner I can go to sleep and end this fucked up day. I am just finshing up when Benny comes out from his corner. He looks down on me, frowning.

"What did you do ?", he grunts.
"Excuse me ?", I ask politely.

He slams his fist down on the table and I jump.

"I said WHAT THE FUCK DID YOU DO TO MY SISTER, YOU ASSHOLE ?", he yells in my face.
"BENNY !", shouts Frank.
"What !", asks Benny.
"Go to your room !"
"Benny", says Penny. She then looks into Benny's eyes and nods to him, as if they both know something that I don't.
"Fine", Benny submits and retreats to his room.
"Gosh, I am so sorry about that, Phil. He's a little highly strung today", says Frank.
"It's no problem", I lie. "But I think I'm gonna go hit the hay, if that's okay."
"Sure, you must be exhausted", sympathises Penny.

I make my way up to my room and fall asleep almost as my head hits the pillow. I wake up at one in the morning. There is a sliver of moonlight shining in the window. I look out into the hall and I think I see the silhouette of Penny sitting outside my room, staring at me. I squint. No, it couldn't be. My suspicions are confirmed however, when the figure stands up and walks away, with bushy hair flowing behind them.

My heart pumps as I get up and go out into the hallway. No one is there. I rub my eyes. Did I dream it ? I decide to go to the kitchen for some water. I root around in the fridge and find a bottle of water.

"Phil."

I jump and spin around, nearly passing out from the fright. It's Frank standing still in the shadows.

"Oh, Frank. You scared the shit outta me", I chuckle.

He slowly and quietly walks up to me.

"DID YOU FUCK MY WIFE ?", he screams in my face.

I fall back clutching the fridge, shaking with fear, before realising what's going on. 

"Was that..... a ...... joke ?", I ask.

He stays silent for a minute, before releasing a wave of laughter. His face is red and he clutches my shoulder.

"I'm sorry, man", he wheezes. "You're just so easy to get."
"Yeah", I laugh, more from relief than anything else. "You got me good. Are you sure that was a good idea, to shout like that in the middle of the night ?"

He continues his fit of giggles.

"We have very thick walls", he says, still laughing.

I walk back to my room and I still can feel his eyes on the back of my head as I go back to my bed.

I wake up and it's morning. Thank fuck. That was one weird day yesterday. I go down stairs and find the place empty. I decide to go check on Belle. I walk into her living room and find the restrainment seat empty. I look around, panicked.

Belle comes at me from behind, knocking me to the ground. She wraps her fingers around my throat and chokes me. I start to lose breath. My eyes are filling with water. I get my feet under her stomach and push with all my might. She falls to the floor as I scramble up. She pulls a letter opener out of the coffee table and I run out the back door into the back garden. I keep running and escape into the shed in the back and I close the door and lock it. It's dark in here.

"Greetings."

My heart stops from fright. I turn and see the gardener standing perfectly still in front of me. Her hands are behind her back. She was smiling a wide, genuine smile, but there were tears streaming down her face.

"Oh, hi", I say, panting.

She starts to sob.

"Are you alright ?", I ask.
"Alright ? No, I am most certainly not. I cannot stay in this house any longer. And I can't escape, either."

She calmly brings her hands from behind her back, revealing a gun. She casually puts it in her mouth and pulls the trigger. A spurt of blood escapes the top of her skull and her body simply collapses onto the ground.

I scream. I hyperventilate. I can't breathe properly and I feel like I'm having a heart attack. It's a panic attack. It burst through the shed door. Belle isn't anywhere to be found. I run back into the house and up to my bedroom. I slam the door, processing what I just saw.

Just then, Benny reveals himself to be behind my door. He pushed my onto the bed and leans over me and puts the metal bat on my throat. He presses down with all his weight. This is the third time I've been choked in two days. And I'm getting real fucking sick of it. I grab the lamp on the nightstand and thump him in the head. He falls sideways and I run downstairs, wheezing and struggling for a breath. I rush into the living room.

Frank is sipping a glass of whiskey and gently playing notes on the grand piano. I don't even realise how strange it is that he's drinking whiskey at ten in the morning. Penny is wrapping herself in her shawl.

"Frank, Penny", I scream. "Belle's escaped. Benny just tried to strangle me."

Benny comes downstairs after me. Penny and Frank simply laugh good heartedly.

"No, seriously, please, help. I'm not joking", I plead.

Belle comes into the living room at this point with a handgun and loads it.

"We're not laughing because we don't believe you, Phil", said Penny. "We're laughing because we know."

At that point Frank, Penny and Benny slowly walk towards me, backing me into the corner of the living room. They're coming at me from all angles. No escape.

I look at their faces to look for any sign of a crack that this might be one of their jokes. But their faces are deadly serious as they advance on me. I laugh through the tears streaming down my face to see if they're messing with me. They remain stone faced as they come at me.

My knees turn to jelly as a crushing reality dawns on me. A realisation that it's not just my wife that's trying to kill me. The realisation that every person in this goddamn house is trying to kill me. </TEXT>

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/662fxc/the_changing_part_3/) 


I have always loved my wife. She is the greatest. She is witty, but not overtly boastful of her sense of humour, she's attractive but doesn't acknowledge it, she is nice, loyal and understands me. Having said that, I can't deny what has been happening since yesterday. It started off small, yesterday morning.

I woke up yesterday and came downstairs to the kitchen, to find my wife making breakfast. At first, I didn't notice anything unusual. I walked over to her.

"Hey", I smiled. "What 'ya making ?"

She didn't respond. She just stood there in her pink dressing gown, her head down, looking at the pan that she was cooking on. I walked over to her and looked at her. She was frowning but had a wide grin across her face. She didn't notice me there but just kept looking at whatever she was cooking. I looked down and saw what she was cooking. I stepped back and looked cautiously at her intense, focused grin. She was frying our wedding photos. 

They were just turning black as I put my hand on her shoulder. She jumped back and gasped as if she had just woken up. She looked around the room, dazed. She looked terrified. The pan fell on the floor. I turned the cooker off and cleaned up the ashes of our wedding photos as she sat down silently and sipped a glass of water.

"Belle ?", I asked, concerned. "Are you alright ?"
"I-I don- what happened ?"
"That's what I'm wondering", I said.
"I don't know, I must've been sleep walking or something. What was I cooking ?"

I decided not to tell her considering it was obviously not deliberate.

"Nothing, just paper from the printer."

After that things went back to normal for a while. Until about four in the afternoon yesterday everything was pretty much fine. Then I got home from the grocery store and hear a banging sound coming from the kitchen and I run in to find my wife slowly pounding her fist over and over again on our goldfish, which was now just a stain on the kitchen table. She was giggling happily to herself through that same, almost angry grin. 

"Belle, what the fuck ?", I shouted at her.

She looked at me and stopped laughing. She stood up with a completely vacant look on her face. She was a mess. There was blood all over her hands and she had pissed herself and there was urine soaked into her pants. She just stared at me without any emotion, as if she was just staring at a wall.

Suddenly, the life seeped back into her eyes. She looked around bewildered, just like last time, just like she was waking up. She looked at her hands and her pants and the table. She began to sob. 

"Help me, Phil. Please, I'm scared, what's happening to me ?", she cried at me.

I wrapped my arms around her and told her the biggest lie I've ever told. I told her that everything would be fine. The truth is, I didn't know what was happening to her either. I was just as scared as she was. She was inconsolable for a while.

Later, after she'd calmed down, I told that I'd make an appointment with a doctor. He gave me an appointment for today at two. She was in the living room, still shaking.

"We've got an appointment at two tomorrow", I said.
"Okay", she said distantly.
"Listen, It's going to be alright", I told her. "Maybe it's just some kind of deficiency. Maybe you aren't drinking enough water. I've heard that weird shit happens when you're dehydrated."
"Yeah", she sighed, knowing none of that was true. We both knew.

We went to bed early last night. I brought her upstairs and she fell asleep almost immediately. I fed my hamster and went to sleep as well. I couldn't sleep much, obviously, but I must have drifted off at some point because I woke up at around four in the morning. It was pitch black but I knew Belle wasn't there.

I reached out my hand and felt nothing but air in my bed. I got up and walked groggily downstairs. I didn't even know what was happening until I heard the squeals. Not loud ones. I could just barely hear something squeaking in pain and struggling. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the lights. She was cooking again. My heart started pumping.

The smell was horrible. I looked at her. There was no grin this time. No giggling, no terrifying look in her eyes. Just nothing. Her face was completely blank. No emotion, just like when she was waking up from it earlier. Her eyes were glazed over, as if she wasn't aware of what she was doing. I was afraid to look on the pan. I knew then and there I shouldn't have looked, and God, I wish I hadn't.

I shakily looked down and saw my hamster being fried alive on the pan. It wasn't squealing anymore, it was just lying there, getting cooked. The smell stung my eyes and I stumbled back. I tried to scream but no sound came out. I didn't wake her up that time. I ran back upstairs and waited in bed. About an hour later I heard her scream and heard the pan fall. I waited for her to come back up but she never did. She never did.

It's midday, now. I've been in bed since that happened last night. I don't hear her move at all downstairs. I heard her go outside a couple of times during the night but she always came back in. I'm too afraid to get up. I don't know what's happening but I just have to stick it out until two. Then we can go to the doctors. 

I decide I should check on her. After all, she is my wife. I don't want her to hurt herself. I brace myself and slowly head downstairs. I creep down the stairs and avoid the kitchen at all costs, in case she hasn't cleaned my pet up yet. I look in all the rooms except the kitchen. She isn't anywhere to be found. I grimace and prepare to go into the kitchen when I hear a sound coming from the basement. I travel into the basement and switch on the light. The bulb is tiny, and only covers the center of the basement. The back and four corners are always completely dark.
 
I squint into the blackness at the back of the basement. I see her figure, standing still. She puts a CD in the old radio and turns it on. She slowly comes out of the shadows. I gasp when I see her. She is wearing her wedding dress and there's blood soaked into the whole left side of it. Her eyes are glazed over and vacant like they were last night. She is holding an axe with dried blood on it. She takes a dew steps and stops. She holds out the head of a rabbit. It's eyes are drooping and covered in blood. She drops it and slowly sings along to the song. It's Chapel of Love by The Dixie Cups.

"Going to the chapel", she wails. "Going to get ma-a-arried."

Only her mouth moves. The rest of her face stays stolid, like she's not even there. Like her body left her behind. She steps toward me singing the same line over and over. The axe is in her left hand and she raises it. Suddenly, she screams and runs toward me, wielding the axe.

I run back up the steps and escape into the living room. She chases me. I look at her, in her bloody wedding dress waving the axe at me, and wonder where the woman I love is gone, and who took her, and why she deserves this.

She lashes the axe out and I barely dodge it. She lodges the axe in the wall and struggles to pull it out angrily. The evil grin is back. She slowly turns around and giggles at my petrified expression. I sprint into our bedroom and lock the door.

I wait here for her to come back. I wait here hoping that two o'clock will fucking come already. Most of all, I wait here and wonder what the hell is going on. Whatever it is, something is wrong. Something is very, very wrong. </TEXT>

[Chapter 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/66islm/motel_demille_chapter_3) 


Eve vomited. She had already thrown up three times from the smell. She waded through the thick black sludge from the decomposing bodies. She finally reached the door before puking again. She stumbled back up the stairs, tears streaming down her face. Her face was stolid. She was impossibly pale and there was a layer of tarry, pungeant goo from her waist down. She kept going up the stairs and ran to her room.

She fell in the door and tore off her pants. The concept of what she had just been through sank in and she had to bite a pillow to stop herself from screaming. She looked around. Her mother wasn't there. Eve needed her and she wasn't there. Of course she wasn't.

Linda sipped her martini as Dennis cleaned the countertop. He seemed to be relaxing a little.

"So why did you move here ?", asked Linda.
"Why ?"
"Yes, well you and your son moved here after your sister and niece did."
"Oh, well I divorced my wife and I got custody of Alastair and she got my daughter and I had nowhere else to go."
"Yeah I left my husband not long ago too. It sucks, huh ?"
"Yeah", responded Dennis before a look of realisation came over his face and he remained silent.

After several minutes of silence on Dennis' part, Linda wandered back upstairs to her room. She walked in and saw that Peter was already asleep. She fell on her bed, wondering how her life had gotten so out of control. Linda looked over at her son. What would she do when the summer is over ? She felt awful. She was making her own child stay in this unsettling motel that only the scum of the earth pass through. She began to cry.

Hours later, Peter woke up and quickly scanned the room. He felt as though someone was watching him. He checked his watch, barely able to make out the time in the darkness. Midnight. He looked around the room once more and then at the end of his bed. His felt the blood going from his face to his feet. He saw a child, no older than four or five, standing on the end of his bed. He wasn't smiling or giggling, he was just staring at Peter. He had long, blonde-white hair down to his shoulders and was wearing a tiny, old fashioned suit from the 50's. Peter tried to scream but nothing came out. Upon seeing that Peter was awake, the boy slowly turned around and crept into the darkness. Peter didn't fall back asleep.

The next morning, Eve was still laying on her bed, the pillow saturated with tears. She stared at the ceiling. She didn't know what to do. No one could help her. She didn't even know where she would go if she did call the police. Her mother and uncle would probably get arrested as well, for being an accessory and Eve had nowhere else to go.

Eve looked at her clock. It was nearly twelve. Still hours until her mother would arrive. Eve crept down the stairs and looked into the lobby. No one was there except Constance. Eve walked shakily over to the couches and thought about her options. Just as she sat down, she heard the door open. It was her mother. She was home early for once. Cordelia stumbled over to the stairs, her eyes not even open. Eve decided not to confront her until she got to their room. Eve followed her all the way up to the room. Cordelia didn't notice.

When they both got to the room, Eve began to hyperventilate.

"Mom", she asked timidly. "I know I don't ask you for a lot, but I really need your help right now."

No response.

"Mom, please. Okay, I'm just gonna say it. Elanora's been killing people. I went into the basement and I fell into a heaping pile of old bodies."

Cordelia didn't even react. She stayed quiet as if this wasn't earth shattering news for her.

"Mom, please. We're not safe here. Please, Mom, please, I'm scared. I don't know what to do. ANSWER ME !", screamed Eve, before beginning to sob again out of frustration.

Cordelia sauntered into her bedroom with a bottle of vodka and slammed the door shut as if nothing had happened.

Eve traveled back to the lobby. She sat at the empty bar. The door opened once again and a woman dressed in a white buttoned shirt tucked into a black, plain skirt walked in. She had dyed, wine colour, wavy hair that was tied back, making extreme angles around her face, which was quite pale, except for the bright red lipstick she wore. She took off her black, 1960's sunglasses and peered around the place. She walked up to Constance.

"I'd like three days please, darling", she said in a ridiculously posh voice.
"Reservation ?", grumbled Constance.
"As a matter of fact, I do."
"You do ?"
"I do, sweetie."
"Name ?"
"Wilkinson. Grace Wilkinson."
"I don't have any-"

Elanora burst in before Constance could finish her mumble.

"Grace !", she exclaimed.
"Elanora, honey. You look even more vibrant than I'd pictured you."
"It's alright Ms.Utile, Grace called me last week", Elanora said to Constance.

Eve ducked into the dining room before Elanora saw her. Constance gave Grace her key as her and Elanora exchanged a few more pleasantries. When they were both gone, Eve went to her spot on the couches and picked the pack of cigarettes that she hid between the cushions and went outside.

Eve went outside and once again sat on the porch. She lit up a cigarette and slowly inhaled the smoke, held it and then released it. She looked off into the distance. She didn't know what was happening. She didn't know why this was happening to her. She knew she didn't deserve this. 

Suddenly, Peter appeared on the porch behind her. 

"Can I sit ? My mom's gone off to get some clothes down town", he asked.
"Yeah, fine."

She continued to puff on the cigarette as he sat down next to her.

"So, you said you had a cousin, right ?"
"Yeah, Damien ?"
"I thought his name was Alastair ?"
"It is but you can call him Damien."
"Like.... from.."
"The Omen. You know, the little creepy shit who was possessed ?"
"Yeah I love that movie. So you think he's possessed, huh ?"
"Probably, knowing that weirdo."
"Has he ever done anything "Omenish" to you ?"
"Why, has he to you ?"
"Well, last night I woke up in the middle of the night and I thought I felt someone staring at me and, when I woke up, there he was. Standing on the end of my bed, staring at me."
"Holy shit, are you sure ?"
"Does he have long, white hair and wear a weird suit ?"
"Yeah."
"Then yes, I am."
"Yet another fucked up thing in the Motel DeMille."
"Why, what else happened ?"
"Oh, nothing, it's just that Damien has done shit like that before."
"To you ?"
"Well, when he and Dennis first moved here, I went to my room and he.....", Eve trailed off.
"You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to."
"No it's fine, it's just..... he "found" a dead fox out on the highway and..... he..... brought it to my room and...", Eve's eyes began to well up. "He got some pictures of my dad and smeared the blood all over them and left them on my bed. We couldn't get the smell out for weeks and I had to throw out the pictures."
"Holy fuck. I guess I got off light then."
"No, even what he did to you shouldn't happen to people. I'm gonna go talk to Dennis about that little fucker."
"No ! No, please don't", asked Peter. "I don't want any trouble. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't getting haunted."

Eve sat back down. She took out another cigarette and lit up.

"You know what I was thinking ?", she said.
"What ?"
"I've probably met my father's killer."
"What ?", said Peter, alarmed.
"Before I was born, before he was with my mom, my dad was engaged to this chick called Kate McClure. They were set to get married when she went nuts. She started abusing my father and hitting him and shit. So he left, obviously and met my mom. Years later she comes back and murders my dad for leaving her. None of us ever knew what she looked like and it turned out the name she'd been using all those years was fake. So they never caught her. She probably came through here. I've probably met my father's killer."
"No, she wouldn't be stupid enough to go to a Motel called DeMille, surely."
"She'd definitely be crazy enough."
"And your aunt would recognise her and do something."
"None of us knew what she looked like, she was here, I'm telling you. And if I ever see her again, I'll kill her." 
"Come, on. Don't talk like that", said Peter worryingly.

Eve went for her third cigarette and continued to stare at the empty highway.

"I'm gonna go get some breakfast", said Peter. "You want some ?"
"No, I'm gonna stay here."

After a while, when Peter was finished, he made his way back up to his room. He went up the floors. He couldn't remember which room was his. He'd only been in there once and he'd forgotten the number. Linda had the key but she'd left the room open. Was it 17 ? No, 19. No, 29. Which one wasn't he supposed to go in ? He decided on the third floor. He went along the empty corridor and stood in front of room 29. He twisted the knob. It was open. He walked inside and looked around. It wasn't his. It was bigger and had a large fireplace in the middle. 

He turned on the lights and his knees turned to jelly. The were two large tables in the room. Laying on one was Elanora's dead body. It had a tube going into her left, pale arm. On the other table was another dead body of someone whom he didn't recognise. It was impossibly thin and wrinkly and was already turning black. The blood from his body was being fed into her dead body.

"Well, hello, Peter."

Peter jumped and turned around. It was Elanora. A different Elanora. An alive Elanora.

"Wha- ? No, I di- ", Peter hyperventilated.
"You must be very confused, Peter. Allow me to explain. Five years ago, just before Cordelia and Eve moved here, I died. I was killed by a guest. Luckily for me, however, I had a witch curse me fifteen years ago. You know Constance, I trust ?  Well, I had her curse me. So, as long as I feed my dead body a full person worth of blood once a week, I can stay here, as a ghost and avoid divine judgement. And where better to get a dead body every week than a hotel full of criminals that no one will miss. How do you think that I uphold such a good record of harbouring criminals ? Easy. They never leave. Not one criminal has ever left this Motel. Pretty impressive, no ? You look terribly confused. Let me summarise. I have murdered every criminal that has stayed here so I can live forever. And not as a walk through walls, floating ghost. I can still eat, sleep, feel and be hurt. I just can't die. Unless someone finds my real body, of course."

Peter was still trying to process this bombshell and stay alive simultaniously. He stepped back and felt around for the lamp on one of the nightstands.

"Bu- but what about all the criminals before five years ago ? Why did you kill them ?", said Peter, trying not to cry.
"Oh, that was just for fun. And so they wouldn't leave and tell the authorities about this place. We can't have that, Peter, now can we ?"

Peter ripped the lamp out of it's socket but Elanora lunged for the poker in the fire and plunged it through Peter's chest. </TEXT>
