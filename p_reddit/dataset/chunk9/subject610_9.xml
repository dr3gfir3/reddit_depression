	<TEXT> Provocative title! Meaningless babble we could have predicted because he is exactly what he was when he campaigned. None of this is shocking AT ALL.  Stop the grandstanding and just get through the fucking storm. Baton up the hatches and clean up when he moves on and save your sanctimonious nonsense for something else. It doesn't help. Then, maybe vote? It's not that he won, it is that he didn't lose in a landslide.  </TEXT>

They get the neurotransmitters flowing yes. Also, if you have ever been a woman, or are a woman and are not trying to deny your sexuality, it feels good. They are sensitive. It feels good for them to be touched. It doesn't feel good when you have men who are clumsy and have no experience. Come on women, back me up.  </TEXT>

That is simply not true.

We can. Like the bad actors will roll over? Partisanship is a product of the people, the way our government is set up is to protect us when the people act a fool collectively.  </TEXT>

Complete bullshit. This includes your own actions. I predict you don't check a percentage in the high 90's of what you buy to make sure the workers are paid an ethical wage. Because you did in the single digits you think you can wag your finger. Your own hypocrisy dismisses your accusations of being unethical because you are a participant. You are calling a double standard that you are complicit in. You choose to acknowledge it only when it is convenient and when it denounces others and not yourself.

I don't believe half the people who claim this. The people who do it legitimately? How were they dressed? If a white person is dressed like an asshole, they are followed too. This is nonsense. Possible, but not a huge problem. 

Please also see prison populations and the gender wage gap.  

You did zero research on the gender rage gap. ZERO. Black people commit 50% of all violent crime at 13% of the population. Instead of lying about this, be honest and try to help communities in trouble. People like you keep help from communities like this. 

White male privilege is a thing. I'm sorry you're not seeing it.

When they are taken away from a group of people, the other people are not privileged because everyone gets them. It is a racist and divisive term used to absolve people from being racist and satisfy some sort of sick masochistic racism desire. If you have any suspicion that male privilege is a complete exaggerated bullshit, just spend 5 minutes looking up people arguing against it. If you come back with straw men arguments like "so I guess racism doesn't exist" or "so I guess misogyny has ended" you can fuck off.

I was banned in r/food for making a joke to the OP, that broke no rules, the OP confirmed he was on board with, for being offensive.



I was banned in r/atheism for clearly defining the behavior I notice in a group of people (people who say Merry Christmas) as a direct attack at the OP.   

When I was banned in one of those, I was unable to comment BACK to someone in the room. They initiated the contact. So I PMed them with "I was banned in the room. I assume you reported me? If you would like a response to your comment to me, let me know, and I will be happy to".  Then I was told by them and the mod that I harassed them. It is a shit show people.  

You simply cannot disagree, joke, or be on the wrong side of the fence of any issue or you will be banned. If you respectfully object, with no swearing, ad hominem attacks, or even coarse language, you will be permanently banned. All you have to do is disagree. I had one mod insist I apologize to them. For what? Saying the ban was unjust. 

You have no power in the situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The path is reasonable

You simply do not know anything about the path. It can take up to a decade and almost guaranteed to spit up families in a significant amount of circumstances. You are knowingly being dishonest right now.  Even many of the GOP thinks it needs reformation. 

More reasonable that 99% of the countries in the world.  

That is not true in the least. It is also not an argument. Your words imply such disdain I don't even know what to take seriously. To argue for a reasonable path is to not argue for something that is not stringent.  The Netherlands is very difficult, but reasonable. 

The problem is when people think citizenship is somehow owed to them.  

I see gist of what you are saying and don't disagree to a point with certain people, not immigrants in general. I will ignore you being a dick while saying it.

	<TEXT>  Inviting an academic or professional to make a presentation based on more than sensationalism seems a little more appealing.

I agree. You and people who feel the same can invite someone like that. 

Conservatism has a profoundly intellectual foundation. Maybe those of opposing viewpoints that attend the event would be interested by it. 

That is currently not allowed in college campuses. Conservative papers by the students are trying to be banned.   I advocate what you are saying here. I do not get to say what qualifies or not. 

Having a speaker that is looking to further polarize the sides is counterproductive.   

No it isn't. It challenges your stance. If you cannot argue Ann Coulters points, you are the problem, not her.   </TEXT>

That he told them? Absolutely. That he told them first? Hmmm did some fish get left out of the fridge?  

I am unclear of what you mean hear. He had to tell the Russians. That has consequences in the effectiveness of your strike. War is messy, war with Russia is messier.  

Well, if Assad was the target, I might not mind too much, but Ive a hunch that wont happen.  

You are smarter than this. You know that is not how it works. If the US did something they don't target the president. 

Hes been gassing Syrians since at least 2013 and in all that time,  

Yes? I think something should have been done. Obama is probably my favorite man alive, but I disagree with this. Well, he did ask congress. So, that is what you need to do. It is so hairy. 

its not in the USs interests. Bad things will happen. Stay out.  

These were chemical attacks on his watch AFTER he was supposed to have gotten rid of them. He never said "I will do nothing if they use chemical weapons again". EVEN IF, as much as I hate the man, you learn new things when you are actually in the office. This should surprise nobody. 

What makes these gassed babies different from all of those other gassed babies? Could it be to do with the timing?  

Congress didn't approve it. Both sides agree there was no time for congressional approval for what Trump did and Democrats even support it. Are you suggesting retroactive attacks for past attrocities? The time came and went and we opted to not do anything. So yes, those dead babies had no consequence. 

If you don't think he did enough, then I think that is good. He needs congress. It was a reasonable measured response. We will have 4 years of fuck ups, I am not in a hurry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He gave the Kremlin notice of the attack before congress.

Do you have any idea how fucking important this is? The results of not doing that could have been catastrophic. Without going into detail, with Russia, let's just say we have to be cautious even if it sidesteps our military strategy. 

Actually, Im all for that part  

When you are complicit in a chemical weapons attack, retaliation will and should kill people.  

But; 60 Tomahawks and none of them were aimed at the runways. Apparently. And a good number of the aircraft werent hit, including some that were in the open.  

Pretty sure this is accurate. 

The airfield was  apparently  completely functional, less than a day later.  

I have to confirm this. Everyone is so fucking polarized I am just trying to find news sources that are not skewing the story in the way they tell it. I am on the left, but NPR can get too liberal with their commentary in NYC. But the news portion seems no nonsense and I have never thought after, well that was misleading. BBC and AP too I guess. It just has to be a smorgasbord with a bit of skepticism and common sense to be able to have a reasonable conversation with people like you. 

Thanks for not being a dick.

	<TEXT> Ignorant? NO!!!!! You are identifying the problem. Sugar is killing you. You are addicted to it. Anything that releases dopamine in your brain is hard to quit. It won't be easy. Just know that craving is in your head. It is chemicals. Identifying it helps wean yourself off it little by little. You start to see it as something tangible, therefore something you can overcome. 

So what do you do when your body pressures you? Exercise is huge and not going too long between meals. Healthy meals with lean protein and LOTS of veggies. If you can keep your heart rate at 80% maximum for 40 minutes six days a week, the cravings will have the edge taken off as long as you eat healthy after you exercise.  

Fill your house with healthy food. Like I said, Costco if you have one. Frozen organic veggies. They wont spoil an they are in the house. Also, EAT FAT (as long as you cut out the sugar). If you find yourself successful at eating no sugar, increase your fat. Avocado, nuts, and coconut oil. Do not combine fat with sugar!  

You can do it! 

Edit: Trust me, I understand addiction, recovered alcoholic here.  </TEXT>

Whew. Also, check out [this book.](https://www.amazon.com/Spark-Revolutionary-Science-Exercise-Brain/dp/0316113514) and even mention it to your therapist. It is more about your brain than your body. But hey, having a much better looking body never hurt anyone. It is not a cure, but it takes that edge off. Exercise saved my life recovering from addiction.

	<TEXT>  If they never left their safe space, what you're saying would make sense.

No, just going to it. It is avoidance. Leaving it does not imply you are confronting anything.  

But I don't see how simply being in a safe space occasionally robs you of an opportunity to grow.  

Shocker.  

Many people travel but also own a home. They go out and experience other cultures, but sometimes they just want to go home and sleep in their own bed for a little while between trips.  

What are you talking about? 

One does not have to be in the mood for adventuring 100% of the time,   

Again, what? Are you even responding to the right person?

particularly if one is injured and needs a little time to heal.  

Injured? Heal? From what? Were you in a fight or were your feelings hurt? 

Of course it is possible to abuse the idea by hiding out in a safe space 24/7, but that is not their intended purpose.  

Time spent has nothing to do with what I am saying.   </TEXT>

Here we go. I would bet my life, literally my life, that the people you call bigots and homophobes are NOT. 

for my literal safety  

I call bullshit. You have been convinced that there is a threat. Oh look, [data!](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/latest-hate-crime-statistics-available)  Of all the hate crimes in the latest statistics, which are very small to begin with, 983 were for sexual orientation.

I've even been discriminated against in university by a very rude secretary  

That is your plight? A secretary that was rude to you? You could just be an asshole.  

and refused to let me back into an office where I was expected for an important meeting.  

I would love to hear her side of the story. The statistics are not on your side. Society however is overwhelmingly in support of you. Cut the bullshit. You are not oppressed. Live your life and stop trying so hard to be a victim.  </TEXT>
