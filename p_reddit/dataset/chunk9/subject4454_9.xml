	<TEXT> Yes that is true. However, the Creeds are like a short form explanation of the Gospel. 

You don't need them. But you need to believe the things they profess or else you aren't a Christian. 

They are summaries of multiple Bible verses that speak to the nature of God and the whole gospel. 

Since it takes many people years to read the entire Bible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Peter is a liar and the Bible is fallible? 

And people wonder why Lutherans, Catholics, and Presbyterians have catechisms that teach the essential faith. 

For this very reason.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My lord. You are being purposefully dense. The Creeds are based on Bible verses and proclaim the true faith. 

Yes, you don't *need* Creeds but if you can't say that you believe what they say, you're not a real Christian. Your faith is in something other than the one true God and unless you repent of your heresy you'll burn for eternity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That you don't believe the Bible (1 Peter 3:21) says baptism now saves you. 

And that you don't believe that your church professes the whole unadulterated faith. 

And that you don't believe that there is one holy and apostolic church that professes the entire faith appropriately. 

Means that you are not a Christian. 

I also assume you don't believe that the sacrament is the true body and blood of Christ Jesus. 

It's heresy. It's heretical. And no you aren't a Christian. 

And nope I'm not a Catholic.

And yet. I know how much better a human I am when I don't drink.

	<TEXT> If you don't believe the things in the creeds you aren't a real Christian. You must believe:

* In one god. And that that God made heaven and Earth. 
* In one lord Jesus Christ
* That Jesus is the only begotten son of God. 
* That Christ was born of the Virgin Mary
* That he suffered and was crucified
* That he died and was burried. 
* That he descended into hell
* That he rose again on the 3rd day
* That he ascended into heaven to sit at God's right hand. 
* That there is a holy Spirit. And that he is God 
* That the Christian Church that professes such things is your church.
* That their is only one true, holy, Church that professes the whole unadulterated faith. 
* That baptism saves you. (1 Peter 3:21)
* That all Christians should commune (this is my body, this is my blood) or Lord's supper. 
* That God forgives our sins.
* That we will eventually be resurrected in body and soul. 
* And that we will live forever in heaven. 

If you don't believe those things. I'm sorry, you aren't a real Christian and are wasting your time. 


And I don't mean reciting it. I mean that you would suffer death and all things rather than turn away from these teachings.

My psychiatrist is an elder in his church and went thru some principles of DBT and showed me where they match our faith based on Bible passages.

So I really appreciated it and was willing to try it out. If not for my sake because I respect the shit out of my psychiatrist for doing something so insanely caring for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marriage. 

It's probably why people get divorced. 

People think marriage is all love and sex and happy times. 


Marriage is that, but a lot of time it's watching your wife get her stomach cut open to birth your son. Cleaning up your husband's vomit when he gets sick and doesn't make it to the toilet. 

A lot of fighting about money. 

Buying toilet paper. Arguing about dumb shit like who left the milk out and hoe you don't want to waste 3$ on milk because someone didn't put it away. 

People think it's happily ever after. 

But it's basically two friends who live in the same house. And friends have fights and get annoyed with each other. 

But it is still kinda amazing.  </TEXT>

As for the psychiatrist, it's going to happen regardless. I tend to become interested in dudes with doctorates.

I have to get along with the person.

I didn't get along with the first therapist because he believed the truth was relative whereas I do not. And she just didn't want to allow me to believe in objective truth.

Which meant I couldn't continue.

This guy we have a bit in common but I am not sure if I can deal with being berated.

I don't think im supposed to feel like a shit person after meeting someone. All day afterwards I was thinking in trash and while I get we're gonna have issues. Idk if that's the proper way to deal with someone who cuts and contemplates suicide. </TEXT>

So one day in out with my family when suddenly I begin to pass out in the street. Some stranger called the ambulance and we go to the hospital. 

Turns out I was severely anemic. I ended up getting 2 pints of blood to get me to 7 when I was at a 5 or 6 prior. I think normally I was supposed to be at 12-13.

	<TEXT> Once in highschool, me and some friends decided to have a little party. We brought weed, and tons of drinks. So about 2 hours in all the girls left to supposedly go to the store and it was just me and 5 dudes. I probably should have left with the girls but I was determined to get fucked up beyond all recognition. I think I probably wanted to drink myself to death. 


So it's 15 year old me and 5 dudes ages 18 -24. We're all friends and hang at gatherings occasionally. 

So first were just chilling listening to music and doing shots. 

Then about an hour after the chicks had left and it was obvious they weren't coming back, the guys were like let's play poker. Halfway through that turns into strip poker. Well that doesn't turn out well for me.

Well a while later, im suddenly getting done by one of them, I don't really know how that even happened, I guess I blacked out. 

At that point I put on my jacket, my pants and my shoes. And the next day I wake up in bed not knowing how I got home. 

I figured I just ran the 2 miles back to my house. 

The next time I went to school there were all these rumors about what a slutty bitch I was and stuff. 

I couldn't really tell if it was true or not because, I didn't really remember shit after we started playing strip poker.

And I had decided to stay. 

But I really should have just left before things got weird. </TEXT>

So the DBT therapist is a little abrasive. He's kinda a dick. But I kinda like him, but I worry we'll butt heads at some point. 

I can't tell if he were berating me for being a jerk to the other therapist or if he was just being honest. He kept telling me about how rude I was to the other and how I wasn't going to actually do the work and he didn't want to waste time. And that i could just lie to my psychiatrist and say we didn't mesh. 

But idk. 

It's like WTF. 


Was he being a jerk. 

On the other hand. He loves the things I love. He had those saint candles with Einstein and Sagan on them. He loves Scotland and he loves hitchhikrrs guide to the Galaxy.

I do like abilify I felt it worked for me, but since im considered bipolar 2 now my doc wants to try other things. Especially since the abilify, didn't stop my manic episodes. Tho I didn't know they were manic. I just thought it was me being irresponsible and spending all my money for no reason. </TEXT>

Normally, there will be a 1 to 2 week period where I make a ton of terrible decisions like spending all my money (including g the rent with no regard for my families well being) etc. 

And then I'd be like normal and then I'll go back into depression for months at a time   


So this is all new to me. Maybe it's because we're adjusting the mood stabilizer? </TEXT>

Which is why I thinkI'm losing my mind.

I mean like at 2 I was all sad thinking cutting was a good idea.

And Tuesday I wanted to die.

And then in between Tuesday and Wednesday it felt like I could fix everything.

And now I feel the same.

Not normal for me.

And then what if tomorrow I want to die.

What if this keeps happening.

Monday, I set a date for my suicide. 
Tuesday, I felt super happy about setting a date for my suicide.
By Tuesday night, I said fuck it I'm just going to kill myself now. However, my pastor happened to call so I felt all cared about so I said never mind for now. 
By Wednesday morning, I was boned up to do a massive amount of cleaning. I made omelettes. I cleaned the car, I organized magazines, I got shit done. 
Wednesday night, I went to church. Everything was okay. 
By 2am this morning I woke up a little scared and upset about some choices I made. And wanted to cut but I decided to do something else because I made a promise. 
I took a nap and now I'm like cleaning, doing needlepoint, watching documentaries, I called like 20 different therapists to set up a DBT therapy program. I'm getting shit done. 

Then I for some reason became bored as shit or something and thought, this would be an excellent time to just cut myself. 
And then I called my psych. Because I'm thinking I'm going insane. 

This is not normal. 

I'm like all over the place. 

Anyone ever have issues like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Keto has been working for me. I already had had a hard time losing weight due to pcos. However, when I started meds for depression when I was only considered depressed. I rapidly gained like 30lbs despite following a diet with my nutrionist. 


I've been seeing a new weight loss specialist. He put me on a low carb high fat diet or keto type diet. And I've lost like 14lbs in the last month. 

Which is amazing. Because before I'd lose like half a pound every 2 weeks despite working out 3-4 days a week for an hour each day. And also following a strict diet with 1500kcal. 

So this is pretty sweet. 

That might help. Don't let the weight gain / swing get you down tho. 

Eventually everything will work out. As long as you take care of you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd rather answer that as Catholic. Because Christian as Protestant is a bunch of randomness mostly founded by feelings as opposed to the historical church and the historical reading of the Bible on a literal basis. 

I'm lutheran and we aren't necessarily too fond of being considered Protestant. Because Protestants tend to reject the real presence and things of that nature. And the liturgy. And the church calendar. 

But I get the frustration. But honestly I just don't want to be associated with baptocostals. So I introduce myself as a member of the holy apostolic catholic lutheran church.  </TEXT>

My grandfather died a bit ago and I was told I wasn't allowed to come to the funeral. No one would tell me where he was having the funeral. And this guy raised me. He was my defacto father. He's the one that taught me how to ride a bike, and questioned my first date. 

I didn't drink then. It wouldn't have changed my family from assholes to saints. It wouldn't have fixed the issues of what happened that made me and my other family members have a rift, and it wouldn't have brought him back. 

I made a meeting and told my new dad figures how I felt. And their advice and concern for me helped me get thru it. 

I promise you if my wack ass could get thru that you can get thru this. 

I'll be here for you. But most importantly try and make a meeting or meet up with a sober friend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dr said he was worried about me and strongly stressed it wasn't because it's his job.

I mean I have a plan, I need a new method tho I think the other one is way too Painful and drawn out.

It was that way because I figured I could finagle my way around the commandment that says thou shalt not kill. But I've learned it doesn't work that way.

I chose a date. I wrote the note and everything.

I also kinda told everyone but I put in in super happy terms about taking control of my unhappiness and doing something about it.

So we discussed inpatient as an option. I said it was ok. That I wouldn't do anything until I wrote out a pros and cons list and called him about it. 

So we're working on that.

He said it's good that I keep my promises. Despite unrelenting urges to cut I made a promise not to so I've been keeping that. So he trusts I won't til then.

However we think I need to work on redefining what makes me happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I'm depressed I don't spend money and everything is okay, but I spend all day not doing anything and wanting to die. 

When I'm in my hypomanic mode I clean, I cook more intricate foods, I do stuff and also I spend tons of money that I definitely don't have. 

Like for example, for some insane reason I decided about 2 months ago, which was when I was finally diagnosed as bipolar 2, to just buy whatever I wanted and overdraft my bank account by nearly a thousand dollars.  

So then I was stable and had a good plan to fix it. And if I'd have followed it I'd be fine right now.

But then I got depressed and didn't care 

And I think I've been manicy lately because I ordered a bunch of books and food and brought clothes and randomness and while I should have only been 200$ in the hole especially since my husband had worked some overtime it might have been less than that. 

But now I'm back there. I'm a grand in the hole. And rents due on Tuesday. 

Idk what I'm going to do. 

I mean I'll be back in the black but have like very little money to spend. Not enough for rent and the car payment that's due. And to have enough money for food and essentials til next paycheck. 

Idk what to do.  


I really fucked up. 

I think I need to go away or something. 
Idk. 

I'm just lost.


Edit: I forgot to add that I brought a dog even though I technically can't have a dog. But I was told I could get one for my son as a service animal. But this animal isn't even trained yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I shall pray for you, but keep in mind simul justus et peccator. Meaning that whole you are justified thru Christ we are still sinners. 

Even Paul said, "For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing." Romans 7:19 esv

Whatever that sin that he kept doing was. It didn't make him any less Christian. He was still very much a member of the body of Christ. 

Can any sin separate us from the Lord? No. That assumes that you are capable of undoing Christ's sacrifice. I know I'm not that powerful, and I doubt you are as well. 


Additionally, it sounds like you are depressed. Please go speak with a therapist or psychiatrist to assess your situation. Remember Christ created intelligence to help us. doctors (even psychiatrists) are there to help us get better and live a life that God wants us to have. 

It may not always be a happy life, but making sure that you're okay is important. 

Good luck.  </TEXT>

And rice is pretty cheap if you can buy a 20lb bag for 10$. 

When we ate carbs, my family of 3 went thru about 1 bag every 2 months or so. 

And frozen veggies are good. 

A big 5 or 10lb bag of flour
Some baking soda
Some baking powder
A 5lb bag of sugar
Some butter, or margarine that's good enough for baking and cooking. 

You can make your own cookies, cakes, and breads. 

And PB can be cheapish. 

Eggs are good. Try and buy a big 2.5 dozen or more set.  They really help on cost.  </TEXT>

I had a few gigs. Fact checker, research, and the. Bigger companies started outsourcing that to Indiad or I guess somewhere that didn't require benefits and a living wage. 

I did a few online writing gigs. And eventually I just gave all that shit up and became a stay at home mom. 

And now i cant get any work. Meanwhile I'm on some income based repayment plan for my student loans and as long as I stay a stay at home mom I pay like 5$ a month or something like that. And after 20 years it's completely forgiven. So idk technically I'm making out like a bandit because of the loan plan.

	<TEXT> I thought that it was supposed to mean like if you can't love me when I'm broke, or sick. Then you don't deserve me when I'm rich and healthy. 

Like dudes that leave their wives when they've gained weight. Or chicks that leave a dude when they lose their job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't like it. 1 I usually tip 20% or more and the ones that do add it automatically usually do 15 to 17. And just out of principle I refuse to then tip my standard. 

Also I like to tip cash. I feel like it's none of the government's business what money they get from my tip. So the less Uncle Sam can track the better imo. Not necessarily legal but you know us New Jersey types. Lol </TEXT>

I've applied to over 1000 different jobs. Including McDonald's, and Chick fil a. 

Apparently no one wants to hire a woman who hasn't worked in 5+ years. 

Oh well, maybe I can sue someone. Lol.  </TEXT>
