	<TEXT> It is a huge problem over here in the U.S. too, which is one reason I never take on clients from Asia. They are notorious for ripping people off, and the cost to sue them is prohibitive. 

These scammers are wiley. They will order just enough content so that the cost of suing them will be more than the loss, and then they disappear into the night. Sometimes, going after them is worth setting the precedent for other clients that you WILL take them to court if they don't pay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are a finance expert, you should be able to get much more than 10 CPW on a regular basis. I have a CPA friend who won't write articles on high finance for less than 20 CPW. If you don't have a degree or credentials, it might be harder. 

I do agree with finding micro-niches within the finance niche. For example, there is a huge audience for permaculture that is rapidly growing. A lot of those people are looking to make money at it, so you could write cost analysis of permaculture farming vs. conventional farming, or articles on how to get approved to buy property for permaculture (for some reason, banks don't like this idea, but they'll loan to conventional farms). I'd aim those articles at bankers, outlining why it would be beneficial for them to loan to permaculture operations.

Niches like solar and wind power also need cost/benefit analysis articles. If someone is planning to put up solar on their house, for instance, how much will they be able to recoup if they have to sell, or how much over time will the setup pay for itself? While a lot of this info is out there, it's mostly dated, so updated stats would be valuable to someone. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a gardening blog, and I'm going to start putting affiliate ads on it. I have Adsense up, and I'm an Amazon and eBay affiliate, so I'm going to start there, then search for better ones. I get about 3,000 visits a month, which I know isn't much.

Mostly, I've been posting about personal gardening with a few how-to posts. I'm going to start doing many more how-to posts and some plant profiles as well. I'm in Florida, so it's already a niche blog, since we have such strange gardening down here (we literally are gardening the same time as Aussies). 

I also want to tie in some outdoor living and design content, so I can pitch higher priced items. 

Does anyone have any tips on using Amazon and eBay, or even how to get better paying adsense ads? A link to a site or book recommendation would be fine too, although I've read so many affiliate marketing books, I feel like I"m in overload. 

TIA

	<TEXT> Since you're working digitally, you don't really need to be in the city to work. There are people who work digitally while traveling all over the world. Just start finding lawyers who don't have a blog or who have a neglected blog and write to them, asking if they would be interested in having you update or maintain it, or just to buy some articles for it. That's why I said set up a writer's website, so you could have something to show them. Check out some legal sites to get an idea of what kind of content they have, and use that as a guide to write your articles.

I write for people all over the world, even in the U.K.  I have a client who lives in Wales and one who lives in Australia. I'm in the U.S. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forgot to mention that once you find your work, most times sending a letter to her telling her to take it down or you will send a DMCA report to Google (mention that she may lose her adsense if she has it), her webhost and her domain provider usually works to get it taken down. Then you have to write to Google and ask them to remove it from search, so you can put it up or resell it without it being flagged as duplicate content. ETA: Also, mention that you will be posting her name and information all over social media, and also report her to LinkedIn.

Good luck! It's a lot of work, but once you have all this set up in form letters, it takes less than an hour overall to do.  </TEXT>

If so, file a DMCA complaint with Google asking them to have her remove the stolen content. It's either that, or she will lose her adsense.

Also, search whois.net to find out who her domain provider is. Put a DMCA complaint in to them as well, saying she is using their domain for plagiarized copy. It may do nothing, but you can also find out who her webhost is and write to them.

	<TEXT> I've changed my life completely in the past 9 years; went from a corporate retail job to being a freelance writer, moved from a 3/2/1 house to eventually this 520 sf apartment. I went from 1/4 acre lot to about 250 sf of garden space. I no longer own a car, so walk, bus and ride a bike (hadn't been on one in 20 years before this) everywhere. I spend less then $200 a month for food most months. I have very, very few clothes (down from two closets full previously), one good pair of jeans, and one good pair of walking shoes. 

Yesterday, I got tired of washing eating utensils, so I put away all but 2 of everything except I kept out 9 spoons, because that's mostly what I eat with. I don't really need 9 spoons, but I don't want to have to keep washing them all day, so 9 it is. 

I share a small community garden plot close by, and I've gotten to where I hate going there, because it's just one more chore I have to do. I had huge plans for planting my courtyard but instead, I've decided to lay out an area for a few favorite plants, then fill the rest in with mulch because it's just something I have no interest in anymore. 

I sometimes pick up things I think I'll eventually need or can use from beside the apartment dumpsters, but lately, I've been taking dumpster finds back out to the dumpster, because I want space more than I want stuff. 

I think a lot about getting rid of it all and going to live in a van, traveling around the country, because I've never really seen the U.S. due to no money to travel. I don't know how long I could do that, but every time I have to do a deep clean of the apartment because it's gotten a little out of hand, I think how nice it must be only to have a tiny little van full of the essentials of life. Just now, while I was watering my indoor plants, I thought "I should just give all of these away. What good are they to me, really?" Plants and gardening used to be my life, and now it just seems like work.

It's all just so much to take care of! My neighbor was shocked I don't have a washer and dryer, and I told her it's just one more thing to break and have to get fixed. She didn't understand how I can stand going to the laundry room to do my laundry, but I explained to her that I have so few clothes and linens now that I can do it all in two loads once a week. I wish I could do it in one. If I lived in a van, I could do it in one.

I look at everything in here every day and think "I don't need this or that or that or ..." you get the idea. I have 5 frying pans. Who the hell needs 5 frying pans? I used to love my things, and to a point, I still do, but more and more, they are just things to take care of and things that require space that I don't want to clean and take care of. If I didn't have all these things, I wouldn't need all this space. 

Am I going insane, or does anyone else feel this way?

	<TEXT> I moved 5 times in 5 years. I have gone from a 3/2/1 house on 1/4 acre, with one room and a garage I could not walk into, to this 520sf apartment with a small courtyard. I have sold, given away, had stolen, or just left behind things in every place I lived (except a temporary 3-month rental while I looked for a place.) I still can't sleep in my BR because it is piled with boxes -- and I do mean piled. The room is 14 x 11, and I literally have a pile of boxes in about an 8x10 ft area almost up to the ceiling, and I've been here 2 years in July. I guess you can say it's taken me 7 years to get to this point, and I'm determined to be in that bedroom with NO boxes outside of closets by Christmas.

Sometimes, I think of the things I no longer own and I don't have a clue why I thought I needed them. I only miss one thing -- my grandmother's wool blanket which was stolen from me, which I inherited when she died when I was 15 years old. That still makes me furious to this day, that someone would steal that from me, and I know who did it too, but can't prove it, because she took it somewhere and hid it. She stole a lot of things from me. That's the only thing I miss.

Right now, when I go through boxes, I look at things and say "Am I going to use this in the next year?" Some of those things in that room have been packed up since 1996. Some of them are important, but mostly, I don't even know what is in all those boxes. I carried around boxes of Christmas lights and ornaments for years, even though I stopped celebrating Christmas 15 years ago. I have no idea why. I don't know if I still have those boxes, but if I do, they will all be donated.

I guess the point of all this is that the further you get into the process, the more you realize that you don't need. I stare at a bookshelf full of books in my LR every day and think that I really should just give all those books away. I'm never going to read them again. I don't know why I kept these particular books when I got rid of hundreds of others, but here they are, and they are going to be pared down drastically very soon.

It's a process. Some do it quickly so they won't change their minds. Some give thought and consideration to every single item. You do you. We can't tell you how that should work.

	<TEXT> Which is why I hesitate to leave this college town, but even here, rents are getting crazy. All the new apartments they are building are high-end. The most affordable apartments are around $600-700 for a 1 BR in older complexes with lots of mold and maintenance problems. I lucked up with this place. 1 story quad, my own courtyard and outside gardens, great manager, great maintenace, pretty low utilities (garbage is paid for saving me $25 a month) and cheap rent. Of course, there is no pool, tennis courts, dog park, etc. here, but I don't need those things. 

It also depends on what part of town you live in. Downtown, this same size apartment in the historic district is $800 with no utilities furnished. I would really love to live in that neighborhood if I could afford to, but until then, this works really well for me. </TEXT>

Further inland is wine country and lots of agricultural land, if you're into permaculture or growing your own veggies. The only problem is that it is pretty cold in the winter because of a stream out in the Pacific, unless you go to Baja Sur, which is a bit more expensive, but still pretty great. You have two coasts to choose from, just like Florida, with each having a different feel.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And every one of those things was done by Democrats. The entire south was democratic, including the racists, before 1964, so the dems aren't completely innocent in this. They had no choice but to play to minorities once they passed the Civil Rights Act and the Republicans picked off the racists. Pretty much before 1964, all white people in America were racists. After 1964, you had to pick a side. More intelligent, well-meaning people picked the democrats. Before then, the Republicans were the party of the intellectual and financial elite, the fat cats. Now they are the party of the underclass, because they saw an opportunity to gain voters they could easily manipulate (less educated, more prejudiced). The democrats were left with what they have now, minorities and more educated voters. They didn't ask for these people, it's all they had. They were the KKK party before then, so don't paint such a rosy picture of the dems. I'm telling you, a lot of them would love to vote for Trump's immigration policies, but they don't have a choice with the voters they were left with after 1964. They talk a good game, but they aren't as wonderful and accepting as you may think. Look at Clinton's crime bill, and what Hillary said about black gangs being "predators." They knew that bill would disproportionately affect black youth, especially young black men. Nobody went after the Russian gangs, who truly are predators. But what do you expect from a poor boy from Arkansas? 

No, dems aren't so perfect. Underneath, they are all the same, just playing to different bases. The Republicans did what they did in 1964 because they saw an opportunity to take over the South and become a prominent party again. And they did. Now they're stuck in a quagmire of their own device. But hey, they got the South back, right?  </TEXT>

I pay less than $600 for a nice 600 sf 1-br with a large courtyard and porch here, walking distance to shopping with buses leaving every 10-15 minutes to go wherever I want to go. I'm willing to bet you can't get that in Cali anywhere -- well, except in the desert, maybe. My friend pays $800 for a 2 BR on about an acre of sagebrush and cactus.  </TEXT>

Some of them are saying it's the radicalization of the evangelical religion that's responsible.

A lot of church people stopped talking to her, and she had been in this church all her life.
