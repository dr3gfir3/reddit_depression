	<TEXT> That's a stupid cop-out. No offense.

There's long term value to a brand, often more than the buildings it owns. Uber and United Airlines are the poster children of how badly a brand can be damaged far worse than if they behaved ethically and humanely.

Ben   Jerry's. Apple. Several other brands do this and exist (or were sold) for huge multiples above their assets because they **don't** use the "maximizing shareholder value" as a Get Out of Jail Free card to being ethical and responsible corporate citizens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's also stuff that doesn't make sense until you think it through.

"Stupid regulations" like needing a badge to access airports. TYRANNY! 

Except I remember when I could use short-term parking or even those phone-friendly lots to wait 20m to swing over to SFO to pick up a friend. Cities planned that and negotiated with airports to make it happen because, at scale, it makes a LOT of sense and provides a LOT of value to EVERYONE using the airport.

No more.

Now these lots are clogged w/ Uber   Lyft drivers for hours. And general traffic (already a b*tch) is exponentially worse since there are too many cars with drivers trying to pick up a single fare, making traffic a nightmare for EVERYONE.

It's a Tragedy of the Commons situation, but the worse part is, sensible and pretty brilliant planning fixed it. Until Uber came along and said, "Screw all of you, because we're going to incentivize all our drivers to screw you over. xxxooo, Uber"

There are a lot of "stupid regulations" like this. No one wants to live next to a hotel full of party-hardy guests revolving around three-day stints where they drink until they puke in the bushes, wipe their mouth, laugh then go for round two. Now we all do, thanks to Airbnb. Progress! </TEXT>

Facebook basically said, "Screw your battery life, iPhone users, across all our Apps. Oh, and when you whine about crappy battery life, be sure to blame Apple, not us, mmmkay?"

Note there are ways to work w/in Apple guidelines and still get notifications thru (all those Apps with dynamic badge counters prove this). But Facebook either is too crappy of a development house to figure it out, or they think they're special snowflakes.

	<TEXT> This is because mobile platforms are a mess. You've got baseband systems, cell tower signaling, traffic analysis, a known ID via credit card payments for your service. These are the table stakes.

Then you have OSs of varying levels of security, privacy and leakiness. Versioning. Updates. ISPs messing w/ manufacturers messing with OS providers, all providing vulnerabilities. Thrown on top, whatever Apps you have are also potential problems.

VPN is better and all mobile platforms support this. I personally trust iOS over Android for the above reasons.

Don't use Mobile if your threat level is that high. Consider Silo-ing. Or a burner phone (but that's a whole different set of challenges). Consider a Wi-Fi only mobile platform if feasible. If none of these work, expect to put many hours into schooling yourself and always watching what your device is doing. </TEXT>

"A billionaire funding Neo-Nazi campus tours isn't *sponsoring* Neo-Nazi riots since he *personally contributed* the capital, from one of his corporate accounts to theirs," or

"We aren't Neo-Nazis, we're Alt-Right!", or

"We aren't Nazis, because  like Adolf  we *hate* Socialists!"

Yet in the end, a Wall Street billionaire is investing to increase violence on campuses. Maybe he figures he's got his, let The Hunger Games begin. Good times to be had!

And those embittered guys with silly haircuts, giving one-arm salutes? Those not-Nazis? Maybe they think if they race across a street fast enough to punch a woman in the face hard enough, someone like Paul Mercer will remember them.

	<TEXT> The Berkeley College Republicans need to get a new act besides hosting corporate-sponsored Alt-Right/Neo-Nazi has-beens at Cal.

[Fun fact](http://crooksandliars.com/2017/03/youll-never-guess-who-funded-milos-college): did you know that Paul Mercer (Arch-Conservative Wall Street financier) funds folks like Milo Yanni-I-Got-Kicked-Off-Twitter-then-CPAC-then-Breitbart  full-freight, all expenses  so hungry attention whores like the BCR can get them to appear at no cost? 

Yay, "Free" Speech!

 It turns out that Robert Mercer, reclusive hedge fund billionaire, also funded Milo Yiannopoulis' college bus tour, designed to dump on trans people and generally behave in a hateful way.

Why don't the Penn State Republicans see if they can get Milo booked? Seems like a *perfect* fit!

Even more delightful. It turns out that an *actual* student on /r/Berkeley found [multiple instances of Neo-Nazis trying to use the event to incite a violent riot](https://www.reddit.com/r/berkeley/comments/66814j/are_people_planning_violence_at_the_coulter/)

	<TEXT> The EU is set to inflict a double humiliation on Theresa May, stripping Britain of its European agencies within weeks, while formally rejecting the prime ministers calls for early trade talks.

The Observer has learned that EU diplomats agreed their uncompromising position at a crunch meeting on Tuesday, held to set out the unions strategy in the talks due to start next month 

And, this tidbit goes past even my capacity to overestimate the incompetence of the Tory/Brexit negotiators and their mad rush to activate Article 50:

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Britain failed to secure the backing of any of the 27 countries for its case that trade talks should start early in the two years of negotiations allowed by article 50 of the Lisbon treaty. The position will be announced at a Brussels summit on 29 April.

Despite a recent whistlestop tour of EU capitals by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, diplomats concluded unanimously that the European commission was right to block any talks about a future comprehensive trade deal until the UK agrees to settle its divorce bill  which some estimate could be as high as 60bn  and comes to a settlement on the rights of EU citizens.

Gosh. Maybe this was why many were suggesting a follow-up Parliament vote or Referendum where perhaps maybe more than 5% of the UK public agreed this was advised? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the problem is they found that burning Vapes "at high voltage"  to levels no Vaper would do since they'd be gagging and retching at the awful, burnt aluminum taste  had these negative results. [Not at low voltages](http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2015/09/criticism_of_vaping_study_is_o.html)  levels of toxins were "undetectable". Note these lower voltages are the ones actually used since they produce pleasant flavor.

The PSU researchers simulated vaping at low- and high-voltage settings consistent with those on a type of commercially available vaping device. *Gases produced on the low-voltage setting contained no detectable level of formaldehyde-producing agents.* Those produced on the high-voltage setting did, and the researchers reasoned that consistently sucking on a vaping device on the high-voltage setting would create a formaldehyde-related cancer risk up to 15 times as high as smoking conventional cigarettes. 

Naturally, the high-voltage data dominated the subsequent public debate even though low-voltage vaping produced less of the formaldehyde gunk than smoking conventional cigarettes.

The study's primary critics pointed out that vapor tends to taste awful when generated at the high temperatures responsible for formaldehyde formation, which leads to real-world behavior (like not inhaling and adjusting the voltage setting) likely to prevent harm.

This is like saying, don't eat cooked meat since when using skillets heated to 1,000, the carbon build-up that results is unhealthy.

Regular cigarettes, as directed (not while burning fumes off with an arc welder) have formaldehyde plus scores of other toxic chemicals (ironically, added by Phillip/Morris and the like). Pipe tobacco, a great deal fewer (although the tar and nicotine are themselves a problem).

It's very concerning that a model like this was used by these labs. Shady. Biased (conscious or not). They aren't doing themselves any favors. Once proper, longer-term studies are done and *if* they found health risks worse than cigarettes or even breathing city air, their credibility will be shot. Spreading this FUD doesn't help them or the public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who strongly backed the Soda Tax, this is idiotic. Unlike the Soda Tax, it's not about modifying impressionable children's habits. Nor is it fighting off huge corporations malicious actions. This will *hurt* people, especially attacking Vaping.

1) Vapes are **vastly** preferable to cigs, and allow many long-time smokers to finally kick the far worse smoking habit. And, non-smokers, that means you benefit too.

2) Vapes allow a couple puffs then that's it. More precise doses to treat the situation, versus once a cigarette is lit, it'll be smoked to completion. Thus again healthier

3) Getting kitted up for Vapes is non-trivial for kids. It requires knowledge, effort and more importantly, more than $40 to get started. No kid is going to drop this money on a lark. Very much *unlike* cigarettes.

4) The same with flavored blunt wraps  what kid would think, "I want to take up smoking, so I guess I'll have to learn how to roll cigarettes first, then buy special flavored paper, then take those *delicious* puffs of raw, unfiltered tobacco!".

*So* stupid, harmful and misdirected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Adding to your observation

Some folks are confused by the changing jurisdictions of the FTC   FCC. The former has these provisions but doesn't allow common carrier rules. The latter allows common carrier rules to be applied but lacks rules preventing ISPs from harvesting customers' web logs and more.

Thus, *ISPs were already under these rules,* but under a different jurisdiction. The change simply carried over this sensible rule to the new one. Which is why ISPs haven't tried spying and modifying users' Internet traffic before. That, and simple terror at the risk that making this vast info-grab would provoke a significant regulatory response and widespread consumer outcry. 

But knowing both Congress and the Executive are controlled by Republicans, their lobbyist minions figured (correctly) it was worth a shot. Sure enough: **no** Democrat voted for it in the House or Senate, while **all** Republicans voted for the ISP Spying Bill (minus ~10 GOP Reps who abstained). Then the Republican President signed it afterwards. Not a single Democrat birthed this privacy Frankenstein. I wish it were different. 

Stating these obvious facts isn't being partisan, it's being factual. If you don't like the reality, vote the Pols that made it happen out of office in 22 months, whichever party. Every single one of them, and whoever signed it into law in the Oval Office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait. The flag guy was cuffed? Do you know if he was arrested (or at least, driven away)?

It's blindingly obvious that, while the skater-dude was vocal, our MRA/Red Pill aficionado punched him first, cold-cocked and unprovoked, then followed up by trying to club him a couple times with a staff. Ineffectually, but still.

The gentleman was arrested last time, having assaulted a person with a weapon, the pole. Then in-between these events, arrested/detained by police during another assault. All times with ample video evidence. He's a twice-over felon. He's been making threatening noises to do the same thing in Berkeley again. And is being used as an icon by the Neo-Nazis' propaganda effort to provoke other Nazis to show up and riot here.

What does it take for police to send people like this to prison?

I'm trying to imagine some Black kid involved in three assaults w/ deadly weapon and a multi-felon background for guns, violence and robbery, making threats, all on video, and how that would turn out in, say, Ferguson. I'd imagine a *teensy* bit different.

Or for that matter, some skater-dude partial to black clothes and handkerchiefs. I mean, geezus, I recall people against clearcutting putting nails in trees in our national forests getting charged in Federal courts for felonies. </TEXT>

Getting a refund: As it says in Doublehops terms of service, they do not give refunds  and, I suppose I can say, based on not receiving any response from the company, they are true to their word.

He's "under-employed". No word on whether his bedroom is in a basement.

Despite championing so-called law and order and espousing tough-on-crime rhetoric, the gentleman has an extensive criminal history which features convictions for felonies in Texas and California for charges including robbery, grand theft, and the purchase and possession of a shotgun and SKS military caliber rifle from an illegal arms dealer.

This is almost too funny to be true, but considering who we're speaking of The flyer graphic guy is [supported by his wife](https://itsgoingdown.org/berkeley-violent-trump-supporters-merging-alt-right/). Normally, hooray! Except it's rich irony that a Red-Pill, MRA gentleman uses on a woman to support his anti-women hatred. 

Of *course* she is an Uber exec (what *is* it with that company and their supporting ~~evil~~ destructive ideas and organizations at every turn?). 

Even more typical, he apparently is trying to cheat on her (and their kid) via Tinder:

[The gentleman] is strongly supported by his partner and the mother of his child [name redacted] who works  for Uber in San Francisco. He, [redacted], and their son live in  south of San Francisco. Interestingly, screenshots showing [the gentleman's] activity on Tinder have also surfaced, and reveal that [the gentleman] has been trying to meet and date women on Tinder as recently as late February. This is very revealing of his character if he is indeed in a monogamous relationship with his partner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of the public key servers talk to each other, so the main ones (MIT and the like) sync +/- a couple days/weeks.

It's important to verify through another separate channel. Someone's site, a Twitter profile, Facebook (ugh!) that you've verified is them. Removing from digital channels (a phone call confirming via voice or meeting in person) is even better. If your threat profile is lower, this is good enough for many people. 

The best (and most impractical) means is a real world exchange of public keys, while checking state-issued IDs, assuming you don't know them already. Many DIY/Maker spaces and universities host key signing parties for this purpose.

What you do **not** want to do is accept someone's PK if, in their first contact (by email), they send you their PK. Or "verify" their PK by sending another email (from anywhere  email accounts are trivial to spoof or bypass). Any method that has a stranger giving you a key remotely is worse than using the public key servers. Note they may not be malicious, just sloppy. Nicely suggest another, cross-channel means.

Web of Trust can be an extra layer but then you're assuming everyone in the web is as strict as you like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically, if you went from you to VPN to Tor to site, path would be

(you)  (Your ISP)  (VPN many ppl using secure tunnel)  (Tor many, many more people, shuffled and bounced randomly)  (Their ISP/Ad Servers, etc)  (Site)  Round trip back.

So I suppose the advantage would be your ISP won't know you're using Tor. But ISP   VPN are still subject to legal orders so there's no protection between the two unless you use different jurisdictions. Then it's a matter of how badly the lawyers and/or entities want you. 

That is, it's a wrinkle, especially if your VPN is in a different country, since twice the orders would have to be filed. If Ernst Blofeld is relying on a VPN too much, he may as well start mixing Vodka Martinis since he'll be receiving guests soon. Moneypenny is probably safe, though. 

Assuming VPN keeps logs. If not, then adversaries would know x number of people are suspect, leaving you vulnerable to time analysis to weed out VPN users that don't match up.

More than seven departments, IIRC? But you're right, most of the officers were OPD.

Yay? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd imagine the lad knows a thing or two about OpSec, so I thought it'd be interesting to post here. An interesting IAMA, scope it out (click the link).

But his configuration is:

On my main machine I use QubeOS. I use Tor (via an old Dell machine) and a VPN. I set up the VPN myself and regularly set up new servers and switch them. I adopt different personas and never link anything back to my personal accounts. Just little habbits.

I have some things like my Soundcloud, Github etc that I'm not too concerned about. Stuff like that I don't mind if it's out in the open.

My machines use full disk encryption. If possible I will use public hotspots and randomly change my mac address so that no little clues are left on the router to confirm my machine connected to it.

I try to do as much as possible to keep certain things private and unlinked. I'm only human though.

I don't do anything illegal these days though, so I'm not as worried about having to hide certain bits of sensitive or incriminating data :)

Obviously, I'm not condoning (or castigating) what he did. Let's not go there. :)

But his choices are interesting ones if you're technically inclined. </TEXT>

*'Based on the information shared through this story, it appears that this young woman was the victim of trafficking.'*

Celeste Guap was only seventeen in February of last year when a pimp chased her down International Boulevard. She spotted an Oakland police car and approached for help. That's when she met officer Brendan O'Brien.

	<TEXT> It's complicated, though.

The first, best defense against hostile penetration attempts and DDOS (etc) is to *briefly* hold onto logs so, say if something weird happens, admins can call up the last x days' activity to see if persons or Bots were probing, how, and how far they got.

But as you note, there are trade-offs where with equal validity, folks could say, No logging, ever!

It's a continuum and where in that axis to set your pike down is a judgement, not an indictment. 

Some VPNs do as you say. But then it leaves them open to not spotting being taken over by a hostile party who can then monitor what's going on. And sure, there are counter-counter measures, and counter-counter-counter measures. Etc. Which, since they're more complicated, are also more vulnerable. Crazy, right?

NetSec is *hard*. And VPNs are yummy targets for Black Hats   agencies. This is known.

Again, I'm not a VPN/NetSec expert, but these *choices* aren't evidence of malice.

Of course, I agree with your larger point  if people want No Logs Ever, chose a VPN that does that. That's why I like /u/ThatOnePrivacyGuy's VPN Guide so much. He says, "I'm not you so I can't choose  but here's the best info for you to make the best choice for *you*!" </TEXT>

Even if he's confirmed as the Doctor Mengele of the Barbie world, and even is he had some connection (unknown, unstated, uncited) to the VPN, if you're their customer, big whoop.

That's a problem I have with a lot of /u/tweIph's assertions. Even at best, some of his most relevant claims come down to judgement calls that are valid but not ones he chose. Welcome to NetSec, pardner, you'll be seeing a lot of that!

	<TEXT> If it helps any, we've banned 6 people w/ 100 karma in six months, primarily for being "ist": racist, sexist, homophobic and the like. IIRC correctly, only 2 were insta-banned and that was because it was *really* egregious or when we nicely asked them to be a freaken human being, they told us to piss off.

25 accounts total in 6 months and these 100 karma accounts are spammers or bots.

Except for the bots, IIRC 80% of the bans are temp ones to let them cool off. 

Which, for 86K users, is crazy-low. We've got a really *awesome* crowd of subscribers. More often than not, the Don't Be A Jerk rule violators are flagged by them and we're simply, nicely following up.

	<TEXT> Uhh, I'm strongly against this. Not because anyone gives a crap what I say, but I want us to have a direct channel to anyone that wants to contact us over any issue, using any language they want, and their main account.

We get (and approve!) a lot of posts made by folks concerned enough about their privacy that even the most innocuous topic we have to manually approve. And that's *groovy!* If they're that worried someone will find out that, say, they're considering encrypting their hard drive, they'd be even more so if they had a Sub issue they wanted to discuss with us.

I don't want to have *anyone* thinking of raising an issue with us and not know it's between them and us Mods.

That said, we often discuss issues with that person included, for transparency's sake. Instead of keeping them out of the loop (Mods can do that in our Mod convos). And when appropriate, we move it on-stage here, but only after checking w/ participants that it's okay. Even when we know it's okay, we still confirm (like, Mods w/ each other).

Besides, for the most part, it's *really* boring, guys   gals. Anything worth it, especially Mod Super-Power stuff (banning, suspensions and the like) we post publicly, hopefully the reasons why.

Asking honestly: has anyone ever asked us something and we didn't reply? *Ever?* No? Didn't think so.

So, my two cents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone reported, Unrelated to NSA.

It's been a while, so I thought I'd give a quick refresher.

If someone is gathering data, someone else will try to warrant, subpoena, buy or steal it. Sometimes they'll make a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure out of which combos they'll use. Exciting! As Edward Snowden's early leaks noted, and Glenn Greenwald   others passed on, [Collect it all](https://www.democracynow.org/2014/5/13/collect_it_all_glenn_greenwald_on) is their mantra.

The best defense against data hacks is to not collect it in the first place. So, any entity gathering lots of non-anonymized data on individuals belongs in /r/NSALeaks. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I'm saying that in the real world, professionals sometimes have to strike a balance between different *kinds* of security threats. And that while they may make mistakes in either communicating them or setting them, it's not proof of malice or fraud.

I will say, whatever admins decide, they should be super-transparent then follow through with what they say. And if they change things (as it looks like they did here), then they should communicate that change, and why.

I'm still **really** confused over your outrage that a company with HK servers has the **audacity** to not offer service for Chinese customers. You **do** realize what an insane security threat that would be for any of these Chinese citizens? Are you aware that HK has a vibrant, and protesting, and at-risk, community? Your critique especially here makes, well, it's the opposite of good sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Copy-pasta-ing the comment I made elsewhere to here, so either way we have a record and/or point of discussion:

I'm trying to see what the issues are and I'm drawing a blank.

*I want to stress VPNs are not part of my expertise and I have no role for PTIO choosing whichever VPNs are on the PTIO list!*

* The story of the Canadian fugitive (cocaine smuggler AND animal (sex) liberation enthusiast? Really? Choose one!) arrested doesn't mention VPNs having a role in his being charged, but his real world activities getting him busted.

~~* Another story mentions the VPN server is in Hong Kong and the service not being available in China. That's not a strike against the VPN, that's good practices.~~

* Another charge is that a VPN was hiding that they kept (temp?, pretty sure) logs but this was known, including in high-profile blogs like TorrentFreak. They no longer keep logs past when the user disconnects, but when they did, they were transparent about it. Nothing shady or hidden, simply a trade-off in which threat(s) the VPN wanted to prepare for

* Another sent an alert to their users that one of their customers sent them a notice that one of their users was using the service and if the abuser/girl stalker didn't cut it out and leave the service, the VPN would start a tracing program on *one* server to find them and eject them. The abuser saw the alert, apologized to the VPN, and left them before they started the trace. No police involved. I gotta say, that's a win.

* The last had a server seized. They kept temp logs for a number of days to counter DDOS attacks. The seized server included the bomb threats (thus multiple threats against a school were (stupidly, and wrong) made). This seems a bit grayer since there's legitimate uses to briefly keep logs for network admin purposes, and didn't count on a server being seized. Perhaps they should have noted temp logs were kept? But kids, don't send bomb threats to schools (jerks!!) and if you do (jerks!!!), learn better OpSec? Freaken' Casual?

Am I missing something, or is there no big betrayal here? No real violation?

Please don't flame  as I said, I'm not The VPN Guy. Asking as a VPN Casual. Charges seem unwarranted, unproven, a stated violation handled privately according to published norms and a possible problem being entirely clear on where in the balance between network admin protocols vs 0 logging not being explicit enough.

That said, of course we will give Burung a head's up, linking this post. *Oh, wait, we already did. Sorted!*

	<TEXT> Dude with respect, try to stop typing like you're Vanilla Ice or Eminem.

DDOS *is* no joke. And that's only the lowest tier of hacks that even the dumbest script kiddie can do. And anyone providing internet services, including VPNs, have grown-assed adults who (hopefully) know their stuff trying to strike the right balance between different kinds of threats. You don't seem to understand there's a continuum going on.

Besides, I don't understand your BlackVPN critique. ~~They have servers in HK. They don't offer service in China. That's your "expose".~~

~~**But if they did, these servers would put their HK customers at risk of death or imprisonment.**~~

~~That's not bad, that's super-responsible. Kudos.~~

*Edit: okay, this is a fast-breaking issue and the claims were murky and poorly phrased   cited. So, lemme try again*

/u/BlackVPN pointed out that they kept connection logs (temp ones? But I won't say since I got things confused last time. Maybe they can clarify?) Security (required for privacy, required for anonymity) is a series of trade-off. Reasonable people may put themselves on different places on an axis of a given issue. No malice simply *a* preference. Regardless, it was open and declared in a high profile blog, TorrentFreak. Nothing shady going on:

In the past we used to keep connection logs with timestamps of when people connected and disconnected from our service. Now we delete that information when they disconnect.

You can find TorrentFreak articles where we openly admitted to keeping these connection logs. We were always completely honest about this.

So we have *a* guy saying he wants no tracking (which leads to other vulns). He suggested BlackVPN was hiding something when they were transparent. He also made many other questionable claims in the same post, which muddied the waters. 

What he may see as a conspiracy, others might see as striking a balance between a host of competing security threats.

If security was easy, everyone would be doing it without our help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And it should be pointed out, to you and other VPNs' defense, there are legitimate server/admin reasons to keep temporary logs. Nothing nefarious going on. Like anything, the further one goes in one extreme, the more of a deficit you're opening yourself up to in the other.

DDOS is no joke. Just a couple weeks ago, seems like nearly half the Internet was taken out by that IoT DDOS attack.

So, folks, remember VPNs may be on different points on the line for different kinds of security, but it's a judgement call, not an indictment or proof of bad intensions.

	<TEXT> A couple focus on privacy, service *and* price, though. 

The EFF [had an IAMA last week](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/) and one of the questions was, [Can a group of people valuing their privacy get together and become their own ISP? Would it be better for privacy?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/dffgeok/)

Also, [Is there a list of service providers that are the safest to use/ones that condemn the bill?](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/61hrzp/congress_is_trying_to_repeal_online_privacy_rules/dfgi45r/)

There are a number of Indy ISPs that exist that do, and a site that lets you see if there's one around you. Check it out!

Actually, check out the entire IAMA  a lot of really good responses there.

Regards IPSs vs sites monitoring you, the key difference is a browser plug in (or simply not visiting the site) allow consumers the ultimate opt-out. Short of technical solutions (VPN and the like), the only response to ISP spying is not using the Internet. That duck won't quack! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many well-intentioned FLOSS   community efforts fail because they become resource or cash black holes. So it's perfectly fine  healthy and better our our community, even  to think about how to keep things viable. Creators need to consider this and their audiences need to accept it when it works. I'd think so long as projects are open, transparent and choose mechanisms that can't be seen as conflicting with the mission, it's good to think about.

	<TEXT> Siloing would be a good first step. Only log into Work Google when working. Ideally only on a work computer. Failing that, a work browser. 

Never check anything else linking your work ID with your social ones, especially if you use other Google services. If you're allowed a browser extension, use one of the blockers to deactivate all the plug-ins (you can relax a bit on logging into unrelated services like Reddit if you do this).

As you note, scripts are browser-wide, so tabs are no protection. Private browsing will protect you from site-side monitoring (if a co-worker can check out your browser history) but not server-side (Google knowing you translated tentacle porn Manga using Google Translate).

Using separate browsers has the advantage of being able to remember, too. Most OpSec failures are because of what happens behind the keyboard.

Regards VPNs, make sure it's yours. If it's theirs, they own the admin   monitoring privs. Treat it as though you are at work.
 
Regards phone, if it's yours then say your significant other is creeped out in case your work gets hacked and they take over *the very same phone that is in your bedroom* and pervs can watch. It doesn't have to be a real threat, or one you're making. But that, regrettably, your SO is insistent, and you like nookie, so if they want you to check work stuff while on mobile, they'll have to get you a work phone. Or work nookie.

	<TEXT> True. I'm trying to imagine if the Post Office decided it'd be swell to sell the metadata they could, or garbage collectors collected the good bits of what everyone throws out and sold that. Or utilities. Doctors. Lawyers. Teachers. The list goes on.

The only difference? The telecomm companies are concentrated due to their being protected oligopolies, insanely wealthy (same reasons) and so they can pay their lobbyist armies more to bribe their politicians better. But they can't bribe all their customers  in fact they're doing the opposite, ensuring we all pay more.

Oh  see if your area has alternative ISPs. Many places do and are countering this attack by pointing out they'd never do it. Municipal broadband is another promising alternative to these oligopolies. Hurt them where it counts until the 2018 elections: in their pocketbook. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're confusing changing jurisdictions of the FTC   FCC. The former has these provisions but doesn't allow common carrier rules. The latter allows common carrier rules to be applied but lacks rules preventing ISPs from harvesting customers' web logs and more.

Thus, *ISPs were already under these rules,* but under a different jurisdiction. The change simply carried over this sensible rule to the new one. Which is why ISPs haven't tried spying and modifying users' Internet traffic before. That, and simple terror at the risk that making this vast info-grab would provoke a significant regulatory response and widespread consumer outcry. 

But knowing both Congress and the Executive are controlled by Republicans, their lobbyist minions figured (correctly) it was worth a shot. And to Hell with consumer-proles. Losers!

But I'm pretty sure you already knew that, right?

But this seems pretty innocuous stuff, as far as teenaged boy posts go. It's unlikely to get anyone fired, easily explainable and - assuming you no longer crow when women (or men!) bring you sandwiches - nothing that should impact your potential as an employee.

Sending someone you know is hostile to you your driver's license, verified email and $$, on the other hand, is reckless. Insane, even. Do not do this!

	<TEXT> In essence, all user data from the site was until now controlled by its European entity, SoundCloud Limited. From May onwards, data from users in the US will be transferred to the United States subsidiary, SoundCloud Inc.

The firm also goes on to state that this move will allow them to "provide those users with a more personalized SoundCloud experience".

This is EULA-ese for, "We want to monetize the Hell out of your Yankee address but the EU laws won't permit it".

EU has stronger privacy protections, particularly commercial ones, than the US. Especially for sharing with third-parties without notification or consent. That is, SoundCloud is **shredding** the privacy of its US users, not improving them.

They do note that they decide which jurisdiction to use based on the location of the IP address used to register an account. So, if you prefer to be under EU rules (you do), use your VPN to "become Greek," say. Create an account. Then transfer from old to new. Then delete your old account. Only use the new "European" one. 

Irony alert: this probably will cost SoundCloud more because it may mean they will try bouncing your Yankee bits across the Atlantic before bouncing them back to play them stateside.
 
Anyone know any quirks in deleted accounts keeping data? That is, should you blank out any comments or whatever with "x"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reasonable people may differ on the wisdom of using products from a company like Apple putting millions of very smart engineering hours to [ensuring their customers' privacy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/) or vastly smaller teams with more modest budgets trying to reach similar goals.

I'm okay with Apple. Then again, I'm not a Jeremy Scahill, Glenn Greenwald or Laura Poitras.

I don't trust companies who make money by selling your data or have a longstanding, cooperative relationships with governments. That rules out Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc. We expect (and want) Apple to respond to legal demands, but we also want them to fight for our privacy and resist sweeping ones. 

We also have to be careful with panaceas like "Always FLOSS". Because, Heartbleed, and numerous other vulnerabilities that crop up. Which is *fine*. It happens. It's found. It's fixed. Much like what happens with closed-source. The extra wrinkle is Trust. Do I trust Microsoft, the telecomms, Facebook or Uber? Hell the Hell no. *I* trust Apple. *For me,* and *my* threat profile, that works. But not for everyone else.

General rule for all devices  local backups. Encrypt everything. Don't jailbreak (if on iOS, if you are on Android, do root but do it under the watchful eye of savvy friends at first). Do update. Be leery of third-party Apps (but not paranoid). The higher your Threat Profile, the more things you need to ratchet up. 

It's a lot easier to do this under the Apple ecosystem, which means it'll get done by millions more than Android. That's safer. Getting into that sliver of a sliver of people who download a custom, hardened mobile OS then swap ROMs is great if you're in that 12%. But what practical use is that for the other 98%?

As Snowden, Schneier and many others point out, these days if the solution is something everyone can't use, it's not a good solution. We need better ones.

Mobile using cellular is such a jerry-rigged mess that if you have one, consider it a vulnerability: the baseband stuff and the like. So to an extent, we're arranging angels on the head of a pin.

On the other hand, I have friends who are 100% FLOSS. This is fine, too. We're happy with each others' choices since we recognize we're both sensible people applying different threat profiles and judgement to our individual situation.

Doing *something* is far better than doing nothing.

So you're right for your profile. I'm right for mine. Reasonable people can disagree. But we need solutions that *everyone* can use, otherwise we're *all* vulnerable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except for the simple fact that under a Blue President (a *very* problematic one that I've railed against his entire eight years), the FCC took over jurisdiction *and* brought over the FTC ruling so the FCC could enforce it. They made it illegal before the ISPs could even begin. Done and done. Finished. Oops, almost.

I try not to make partisan statements while here but in this case, it's observational: Democrats made possible a ban on ISPs spying on their locked-in customers, Republicans reversed it then pumped up these kinds of widespread privacy violations with the legislative equivalent of steroids, amphetamines and 7% cocaine-in-solution.

The vote breakdown speaks volumes. Not only that, they did it in under two months. This shows what a priority this was for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, "percentage root android os" on DDG gets these two, both anecdotal and with sampling problems but both under 1%. Also note it's "root" and not "custom Android OS" or "replacing ROMs". That is, folks who want to delete *Verizon Presents: Even Angrier Birds* are part of the group versus cypherfreaks like you and me.

[What percentage of Android phones are rooted?](https://www.quora.com/What-percentage-of-Android-phones-are-rooted): Indian engineer at a computer engineering school found 0.6% of rooted (note above qualification, and *whoo boy*, sampling problems galore) Android phones.

[How many rooted Android devices are there?](https://www.quora.com/How-many-rooted-Android-devices-are-there): 

A study would need to be commissioned for anything near usefully accurate numbers, but if you use the official statistics of devices that have opted to report using the popular and widely available Cyanogenmod family of ROMs and then pad that with non-reporting devices and the multitude of other ROMs available, perhaps "over one million" isn't out of the realm of possibility?

That said, the latest figures from Google (link I'm too lazy to include  click thru if you're curious) puts that million-plus in perspective and suggests that that rooted devices account for some amount that barely scratches the heels of 1%.

I did a proprietary study that had fractions of 1%, with custom ROMs a surprisingly large 10% of this figure. But I'm uncomfortable getting too specific (it was a bitch of a project that someone paid for). So I'm fine if you don't accept this beyond Some Guy On The Internet making the claim in this paragraph. :)

Of course, everyone is welcome to find better stats. Have at it, Reddit! Share with the rest of us! :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a tragical farce. First ~~AT T~~ Verizon tries ramming their spyware on a model of an Android model, most likely as a test before wall-to-wall installation. Then EFF writes about it literally the day of, which one day after the House Republicans voted to nuke the FCC rules against doing this. Then AT T pointed out it was only a test run on a single model (so far). So EFF modified their Deep Links article.

However, the EFF did bother reading the T C, and what they found was just as scary as their initial story. From the EndGadget article:

But the EFF spent a little time staring at AppFlash's privacy policy, where it's revealed that the software will vacuum up any and all of your private data. For instance, it'll snag your cell number, device type, operating system and the apps or services that you use. More crucially, the app will also harvest the details of everything installed on your device, your location and the contact details of everyone in your phonebook.

Verizon admits that the **information will be shared** within "the Verizon family of companies," including that of (Engadget parent) AOL. From there, the data will be used to "provide more relevant advertising within the AppFlash experiences and in other places." The other places being a euphemism for banner and display advertising all across the web.

So, if you're trying for a baby and you've got a fertility app on your phone, it's reasonable to expect plenty of banner ads for diapers and formula feeding. If you're doing something more private, like making your first steps out of the closet or dealing with a substance abuse issue -- and you've got a relevant app -- then Verizon's gonna know about it.

	<TEXT> As others note, it's in Beta. They want to boil the frog, not toss it in a fire. Most importantly, they want people to get used to using the Verizon App for everything or enough of everything that customers think they can't live without it.

*Then* they'll announce "feature upgrades" to "further customize their mobile experience" with an opt-out policy. *Then* after things don't blow up too badly, a mandatory one (or at least a $10/mo fee for not having Verizon watch everything you do on your phone).

	<TEXT> Won't happen. Never will. It's core to Apple's mobile identity. Remember, Apple the first manufacturer that insisted they, not the ISPs, control their platform. Forcing AT T into the deal, then making the others comply as well.

That's why when folks ask me which mobile phone is best for security, it's a no-brainer. Especially if they're not part of that tiny sliver of a sliver of people who swap ROMs for fun, or even, wipe then clean-install a custom OS. We're talking 0.01% and 0.2% type numbers, respectively.

Many other [experts agree](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/goodbye-android). Just on updates and upgrades alone. Let alone ISPs having veto rights and variant OSs. And their horrible model fragmentation. Or even the fact that agencies don't even bother suing Android/ISP creators to create a GovtOS for them  what the customers already use fits the bill nicely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's worth also including Glenn Greenwald's editorial, [To Serve AT T and Comcast, Congressional GOP Votes to Destroy Online Privacy](https://theintercept.com/2017/03/29/to-serve-att-and-comcast-congressional-gop-votes-to-destroy-online-privacy/), particularly this quote:

Its hardly rare for the U.S. Congress to enact measures gutting online privacy: indeed, the last two decades have ushered in a legislative scheme that implements a virtually ubiquitous Surveillance State composed of both public intelligence and military agencies along with their private-sector partners. Members of Congress voting for these pro-surveillance measures invariably offer the pretext that they are acting for the benefit of American citizens  whose privacy they are gutting  by Keeping Them Safe.

But what distinguishes this latest vote is that this pretext is unavailable. Nobody can claim with a straight face that allowing AT T and Comcast to sell their users browser histories has any relationship to national security. **Indeed, theres no minimally persuasive rationale that can be concocted for this vote. It manifestly has only one purpose: maximizing the commercial interests of these telecom giants at the expense of ordinary citizens. Its so blatant here that it cannot even be disguised.**

Thats why, despite its devastating harm for individual privacy, there is a beneficial aspect to this episode. It illustrates  for those who havent yet realized it  who actually dominates Congress and owns its members: the corporate donor class.

There is literally no constituency in favor of this bill other than these telecom giants. Itd be surprising if even a single voter who cast their ballot for Trump or a GOP Congress even thought about, let alone favored, rescission of privacy-protecting rules for ISPs. So blatant is the corporate-donor servitude here that theres no pretext even available for pretending this benefits ordinary citizens. **Its a bill written exclusively by and for a small number of corporate giants exclusively for their commercial benefit at the expense of everyone else.** </TEXT>

Hey, so thoughts on the ISP Spying Bill? Really great effort on our parts, anyway. Sometimes we win our battles, sometimes we don't. But so long as we keep in mind it's the larger victories on the horizon we seek, it's okay.

Also, anyone from [Fight For The Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org) has a standing invitation for doing an IAMA here, when you'd like. We usually do slower-paced ones over several days so they're a bit more relaxing (but with really great questions b/c of our audience) than the /r/IAMA ones. ;) </TEXT>
