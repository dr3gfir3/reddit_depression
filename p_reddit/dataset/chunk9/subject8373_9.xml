	<TEXT> I switched back to the stable channel from the dev channel, which makes you powerwash your chromebook. Start up and log in was pretty much immediate. I only tried it once though. I'll add an update when I see how quick it is when I get home. 

Edit: Booted it up and it took forever for the login window to pop up. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone have some info on the slow start up/login screen on the Dell Chromebook 13? I've tried it in the Stable and the Dev channel since I heard it was fixed. Is it a problem with my chromebook (bought last week) or is it a known bug? I'm wondering if there's anything I can do to fix it or just wait for an update.

**Stable Channel**

Profile pic and password window takes about 20-60 seconds to show up on start up. 

**Dev Channel**

Profile pic and password window show up immediately. Sometimes it won't let me type my password in for awhile, or I'll type in my password and then it kinda freezes for about 10-20 seconds.

	<TEXT> Did you consider getting the [ Panasonic 12-35mm f/2.8 ii](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1304868-REG/panasonic_h_hsa12035_lumix_g_x_vario.html)? Aside from the longer focal length of the 12-60mm, what are the differences? Looks like the prices are similar.

I'd like to get a super sharp and fast do-it-all type lens for my kit when I pick up the GH5. 

Starting from scratch, do you think it would be a bad idea to go all in on MFT lenses? Or should I strictly go speedbooster/EF glass? or go both eventually? I'm not sure what to do here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who is basically starting from scratch with lenses (Mostly have APS-C lenses), would it make more sense to get the speedbooster and invest in Canon glass or get MFT glass? 

I've been doing some research and I have a couple lenses I think I might get.

Panasonic 12-35mm f2.8 ii 
Voigtlander 25mm f0.95


If I were to go the speedbooster/EF glass route, what lenses should I take a look at? Any EF mount Sigmas you can recommend? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most companies have a lens tint guide that tell you what lens to use in different light conditions. The exact name of the lens tint you have should be in the description for the goggles you just bought. 

The second lens will usually be for low light conditions. For example, I just bought a pair of Electric eg2.5s that came with a black lens for sunny days, and then my extra lens is a light green lens for snowy, darker days. 

No tips on dealing with scratches. In fact, I just got one on the side of my new lens and I was pretty bummed. It happens. If it's not huge and not too noticeable, I wouldn't worry about it too much. If it does bother you, you can usually purchase a replacement lens for pretty cheap.  </TEXT>

I haven't gotten to use a Samsung Plus, so I can't compare to see if I think it's worth spending more for it. The square aspect ratio on the Plus does seem a little bit odd. I liked the ratio on the Acer 14. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to Best Buy last night and they had an Acer 14 on display so I played around with it. It seemed to handle a few tabs perfectly fine. But once I loaded up a long article and started scrolling through, I could tell it was struggling a bit. I couldn't tell if it was the Chromebook or the internet though. 

As far as build quality goes, I thought it was perfectly fine. The screen was big, the chromebook was thin, and it felt pretty solid. The Acer 14 might be my backup choice to the Dell CB 13 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi,

I've been doing a lot of research on chromebooks lately and I can't figure out what to do. Basically what I'm looking for is a quick machine that looks nice and will allow me to shop online, have tons of tabs open, and stream videos without hesitation. As a chromebook newbie, would this put me in the higher end of chromebooks?

**Budget**

 $500 USD

**Uses**

General web browsing (Amazon, Facebook, Reddit, etc.), Video streaming at home and watching movies while traveling

**What I'm looking for**

Aluminum body and high build quality, 12+ inch screen hdmi port, performance. 

**What I don't care for**

Touchscreen, tablet mode, usb-c

**Questions**

Would an Acer Chromebook 14 fit my needs? Or should I be looking at the Samsung Chromebook Plus? 

What are the benefits of having a touchscreen and tablet mode? I can't really see myself taking advantage of that.

What are the benefits of having Android apps? Will most newer Chromebooks eventually support them?

I've been wanting to get into grading as well. Do both companies have good color profiles? I've seen some people complain about the GH4 having yellow/green skin tones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think $600 was what he asked for it. I'm gonna double check with him right now. Maybe it was $900.

The C100 is a solid camera from what I've read. However, I think I'd rather get the features of the hybrids for that price. The portability and ability to take photos is somewhat important to me when I travel. I can't decide! haha I think either route will serve me well. I just can't decide on which to go with. 

I'm not sure if you saw my note, but my cousin can get me 25% off on the Sony. So it would be closer to $2250. The GH4 is still much cheaper, however. That $1k difference could be put towards lenses, accessories, gimbal, etc. Hmm...

Edit: Friend replied saying $650 for the light kit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the response. 

Should I take my friend up on his offer for his Lowell kit?

I'm not really sure where I stand on the hybrid vs. dedicated camera. On one hand, having built-in XLRs, NDs, and better ergonomics would be really nice on a dedicated camera. I think I'd be looking at maybe a C100s. On the other, hybrids offer a lot for a cheaper price. 

I'm not looking to buy a camera immediately. I can definitely wait. A GH4 could be a good option when the 5 drops. As a GH4 user, do you have any opinions on the GH4 vs. a7sii?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After filming for 3+ years on my Canon 60D, I think I'm about ready to upgrade. I'm not sure what route to take, however. I shoot a variety of things: mainly corporate, action sports, and documentary. I'm looking to get more into narrative and travel logs and will soon be shooting some music videos with a friend's band. A lot of this would be for personal projects and some low-key paid shoots. I figure if I ever land a big gig, (which I'm not planning on any time soon) this camera could serve as a b-cam and I'd rent an a-cam. In short, I'd like a camera that can handle almost anything. Being able to take photos would be nice, but not absolutely necessary. Also something to keep in mind is that I have a cousin that works at Sony and would be able to get me 25% off any camera gear.

Sorry, I know this kind of question has been debated a million times here. If someone could link me to a similar thread, I'd really appreciate it!

**Budget**

Willing to spend up to $5K USD

**My gear**

Canon 60D

Canon 50mm 1.8f

Canon 24mm 2.8f

Canon 18-200mm 3.5-5.6f

Rokinon 8mm 3.5f (For skateboarding)

Benro S7

A lot of the lenses I have are APS-C only, so I'm looking at buying new lenses as well.

**My questions**

Hybrid or dedicated video camera?

If I go dedicated video camera, which should I look at?

If I go hybrid, Sony a7sii or Panasonic GH4/5?

Should I consider an external recorder?

Should I go cheaper and get lights? I've got a friend that said he would sell me his Lowel kit for $600.
