	<TEXT> Then you are writing off most early shamanic belief systems that led to the evolution of every belief system in the world today. 

Not so - as I don't accept the premise that 'early shamanic belief systems that led to the evolution of every belief system in the world today' in any way shape or form.

It's an interesting discussion the intersection of Shamanic reality and mystical reality (or just 'Reality' as I would prefer) - but I don't concede one comes from the other. 

We do not perceive reality and live in a false one. There are many ways to access the true reality and Shamanism is one such (it's by no means exclusively limited to drugs btw, there are far more techniques in Shamanism than that) as is religion or whatever. They are not the *cause* of belief systems in any way... belief systems are merely attempts to explain what the methods reveal to you.

But drugs is something else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 99 names are manifestations so the one you focus on is the effect you get. This is them if anyone's interested:

https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Names_of_God_in_Islam

81 - the Avenger would be used for, well... is obvious.
88 - the All Rich - ditto

None of these are particularly esoteric or magical but the 100th name is. Roughly speaking no-one knows this 100th name though some people claim to... it's the equivalent of Knowledge of the HGA in some way. It's this name that gives the 'magical' power.

None of this is about djinn though, you're merely invoking and harmonising with an aspect of God. 

The Bloodline/Dynasty thing is interesting. It's not just a question of being the descendants of Muhammad but *specific* descendants. There's a hadith that Muhammad told Ali something in secret and when the other Muslims asked him what it was he told them "If I told you then you would kill me". This secret is believed to be passed down to this 'secret dynasty'.

Owning space and time is not something I've heard of them but it fits in many ways. There's lots about these people in Islamic lore and also other places. Still not much to do with djinn though.

	<TEXT> Another problem with this thesis is the distinction between Allah/Yahweh and the 'old Gods'. 

"Allah" is not a name... it is just the Arabic word for God so anyone wanting to reference God in a sentence in Arabic would use it... whether they are atheist, Muslim, Jewish or Christian. It's not a name. 

So the pre-Islamic pagans used it too to signify the 'overall' God which they also believed in... they believed there was one 'top God' (ie top Allah) and the other gods were minor gods. 

This view is in the Old Testament too - where the commandment is to 'have no other gods before me' - it doesn't *deny* there are other gods. Just says that Yahweh is the top dog.

And that's the situation pretty much in the region even now (with some nuance), it's very, very common to believe in djinn which are essentially the same 'minor gods' rewritten in an Islamic context. They don't need vengeance... they've been right up there since pre-Islamic times and nothing's changed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a pattern here. All the ancient sites of babylon/assyria/egypt etc are either war-torn or extremely hostile. 

I don't believe that... if you look closer you'll see it's not really correct.

* Iran - is only 'hostile' in Western agitprop - many old sacred sites
* Jordan - literally hundreds of sites. Petra onwards... very important ones. No aggro.
* Turkey - ditto... only real issues in the East because of Erdogan's fascism to Kurds and Yezidis and Daesh incursions
* Syria - only recently 'hostile' and we all know why
* Iraq - ditto
* Afghanistan - more of the same. 

Actually none of these places were in turmoil before the advent of the British Empire and the continuation of those policies to the modern day.

	<TEXT> Same shit. I don't see any difference between the Roman Empire and the Catholic Church and the current Western Leaders. There is none - they have one thing in common and one aim: control of the populace.

If you doubt this then ignore the labels like 'Crusades' or "Neocons" or whatever and look at *policy* as enacted on the ground in the region. 

You'll see it has been exactly the same for 1500 years and, even if you do want to label the players, you'll see that there are only a few different ones: Roman Church - to British Empire - to US hegemony. That's just 3 main actors.  </TEXT>

http://lithub.com/the-worlds-oldest-library-founded-by-a-woman-restored-by-a-woman/

Massive misogony (not exactly Islamophobia at this point) and women-hating ensued.

I tried to redress the balance but was personally attacked - example:

It's nothing but da'wah. Winning points so he can buy himself into heaven.

and then banned - not for any response I made (which were polite) but for this reason:

You are using our subreddit to push an agenda, and it isn't appreciated.

So, yeah... I'd say both Islamophobia and women-hating are the order of the day.

Soros/Rockafeller/ and Madeiline McCann have an extremely rare genetic defect.

Do they? Do they really? How do you know? What is 'proof' of this for you? How did you arrive at this position?

This gene, OTX2, also is responsible for the pineal gland.

Ditto. How did you arrive at this conclusion? What does 'responsible for the pineal gland' mean? It could mean many things... could you be more specific?

Recent studies showing consuming blood of young extends life.

I think you're referencing this study

https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/04/can-we-reverse-ageing-process-young-blood-older-people

Admittedly the name of the company sponsoring the experiments - Alkahest - is somewhat suspicious. BUT I think the tests are far from conclusive. 

One other thing re this - the animus behind such experiments and the assumed drive behind the 'Occult Elites' interest such thing is obviously to 'live forever' and as such is based solely on a fear of death. As is much of the New Age and futurist/self-improvement movement.

I would argue that such a thing is in direct opposition to any Occult understanding. Period. Occultism is understanding hidden laws - as in Laws. One of these laws is that you die. It's made that way. There may be something after and a large part of Occultism/Magic is familiarising oneself with those realms and finding out 'the truth' as it were. No part of it is *changing* them or trying to avoid the Law of Death. Any Occultist who tries to do this does not understand what Occultism really is.... hence these 'Occult Elites' are not Occult Elites at all (if they go this way) and know nothing. 

Look at Marina. She is 70 years old and looks 30.

That is actually an interesting and verifiable point.  </TEXT>

Beer production in Morocco was introduced by the French in the 20th century. Socit des Brasseries du Maroc is part of the Castel Group and oversees the production and distribution of beer. Popular beers include Spciale Flag (pilsner) and Stork (light lager). The Moroccan premium beer is Casablanca (also a lager), which costs more than the other two. Casablanca is also exported and, for instance, served in the Morocco pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World, Orlando, FL.

The breweries of Brasseries du Maroc are located in Fes, Tangier, and Casablanca, also a bottling unit exists in Marrakesh. The best selling international beer in Morocco is Heineken, which is locally brewed by Brasseries du Maroc under the supervision of Heineken International.

Following on from that it follows - again in this reading, yours may well differ - that the literal punishments referencing actual bodies (ie the traditional view of hell) are metaphorical.

	<TEXT> 'God' to me is shorthand for 'something higher' and transcendent. I don't think you can 'find' God in the sense you can find, say, a lion if you go searching in Africa or wherever, but you can find answers to questions you have which are informed by the transcendent. Imo.

If you take the numinous out of the equation then there's just no point is there? This is why I said atheists might be better placed... I've met very very many religious people(esp Muslims) who have no conception of the Numinous at all. Nor do they experience it... and if they admit its existence at all they often think it's 'demonic' or whatever. This is not all people but some.

Oth I've been with atheist friends looking up into the sky at the stars and we've both been speechless with 'wow!!!!!'. Both feeling a sense of awe. I don't call this the Numinous btw but it can be a way to approach it. 

To me the signs of God are supra-normal experiences which we all get glimpses of from time to time. If you want to invoke them yourself it's definitely possible. Get a *tasbih* and say the name of Allah 1000 times morning and evening for a month. See what state that puts you in. 

You might not want to call these things 'God' and nor would I because I don't think you can actually *know* God but they are indicators of something more... and that's maybe enough. You don't need to quantify it... if you have questions there could be an answer there. 

If you don't have questions (and many religious and atheist people don't) then how can you have an answer? Some atheists who ask the question you did (I don't mean you btw) 
don't REALLY have a question.... I mean by that they're not searching for an answer as such, they are happy where they are (and why not? Fair enough!) so how can they have an answer? An answer to what?

	<TEXT> Yeah but there are a few more religions than those three!

I'll bite and give you my take... will be shot down as usual on this sub but who cares!! 

I believe that God reveals teachings and paths to himself throughout history and probably most existing religions are evidence of these but - more or less - deteriorated. 

Why this happens is because people don't *really* want to travel the path to God - or rather they do, but they are not prepared to pay the price which is often the things you mention (for some people) but is more an attitude: you can pray, fast and abstain all you like and still end up in 'Hell' (not a literal place imo).

So what they do instead - one of the things - is they *change* the teaching/revelation to make it easier. They falsify it. Very obvious in Christianity but all others have it as a factor too. 

The other thing the religionists do is turn religion into a power-structure to control people. 

At this point religion no longer leads to God. Atheists are very often right about this. Christianity is not producing any Jesus's is it? Ditto Islam in our own Saints... plenty in the past but now.... not so much. 

But the thing is it *can* lead to God. So that's why I follow it. But in a different way than people who disagree with what I just said. To me, even an atheist could find God. It might even be more likely in some cases than a religious fanatic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We used to be able to interpret for ourselves though. 'aql and ijtihad used to be a thing till the people who we defer to said it wasn't. Not saying they're wrong but the grounds for saying their right can be questioned imo. 

The thing is though that one can't really argue against them now... they have defined an Islam (perhaps correctly, perhaps not) that is unquestionable.

If I quoted a hadith that they (or you) do not agree with then it would just be labelled 'misinterpreted' and 'this is why we need scholars' but all that really boils down to is this: we need the scholars to tell us the scholar's interpretations are correct.  </TEXT>

Sex is not only one of the main and most effective influences that control and subordinate us, it is the main influence *USED* to control us. 

You can surrender to it, dive into it, even shun it - but if you do not develop the capacity to control it then it will control you.

And of course there's another factor: the clock is ticking. If you don't bring it to heel while you can then one day you will wake up old. Your view on sex and sexuality may on that day be very different than it is now and your options, desires and possibilities may be very different too.  </TEXT>

I suppose given the anti-Muslim rhetoric and the outright Islamophobia as well as the racism in a wider context - not to mention the hate-crimes engendered by the Trump campaign and victory - he/she is really being nice. Ie assuming that given the above factors no Muslim would be stupid enough, or brainwashed enough, to actually participate in their own demonisation. 

She/he is undoubtedly naive and mistaken in that, but I maintain it comes from the heart and the right place nevertheless.

Asked to confirm whether he would introduce the policy against Muslims if he won the White House he said: I would certainly implement that, absolutely.

	<TEXT> It would prove what you are saying.

Yes but I like to know who I'm dealing with. 

I used to debate a lot with atheists and always was asked to 'prove' something or other. I invested many hours before I realised what a fool I was. It was never about that.

So I decided - when I saw the light - to never waste time or energy in this way again. But I felt a bit bad... maybe some people genuinely want to know the answer to something? 

So I decided I would always try to find out. If they were needing an answer or a point clarifying in order to continue the debate I would do it. If they were busy erecting an Auto-da-f and compiling a list of the next questions and possible routes of obfuscation if I came back with something I would pass.

This is why I asked. 

But you also answered - thanks for that - by this "It would prove what you are saying."

So I don't think I can be of further help. If I'm mistaken then you can always find an answer that satisfies you via Google. If I'm not then I'm doing the right thing by drawing this to a close. 

For both of us. Be well and Happy! Life is short! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer upfront, I'm generally against the presence of Islam in the West.

Good to know going in! ;)

If people like this author and Muslims in general want to talk people like me out of having these views they have got to stop talking like this. 

I don't know about the author but no-one I know wants to convince anyone of anything. We all have the right to believe what we want... you make your choice based on what you understand. 

My only caveat would be that you should be basing them on facts. So I think one can provide people with facts but they can do with them as they please. I don't personally care what someone thinks but if they are thinking something based on an incorrect premise then they should know... same goes for me. I hope someone who can see I am wrong about an assumption let's me know. 

Islamophobia is not real, it's completely made up. To treat my concerns with the regressive aspects of Islam as an irrational fear is outrageous.

Don't agree with this. We need a word for a real phenomenon. It could be another word - I'm fine with that - but it points to something real. People could have ISISophobia. No problem. Totally understand. Extremistophobia - ditto. 

But the fact is there are some people who don't make those distinctions and their fear of legitimate threats is translated to all Muslims as a whole with no distinction. We need a word for that. Until we find a better one 'Islamophobia' works for me, made up or not.

To treat my concerns with the regressive aspects of Islam as an irrational fear is outrageous. 

Agree, if anyone is ever doing that. I would not and no-one I know would. The only people I can think who would are Daesh supporters or extremist Islamists.

But I remind you of this - you said: "I'm generally against the presence of Islam in the West."

You did not say: "I'm generally against the presence of *regressive aspects of* Islam in the West."

So that gives a certain impression, rightly or wrongly.

I tell you this because I see something ugly happening in the next 10 years. The tide of opinion has changed, and it changed quickly.

Isn't that exactly what I'm saying? Don't get this bit. I'm saying it's due to Islamophobia and racism that something very, very ugly is about to happen. Less than 10 years. Imminently. 5 Max.

It seems that you seem ok with this but you're argument is that the problem is that this ugly thing should not be labelled the result of racism or Islamophobia? I hope I've got that wrong because it's pretty chilling if so.

Westerners are extremely tolerant and caring, but at a certain point the ugly side can be awoken if our new guests continue to do shit like this.

So to paraphrase - you say when pressed you are against *regressive aspects* but you admit the possibility that if these *regressive aspects* continue to do atrocities then Westerners will take extreme action - not just against the *regressive aspects* but against everyone who is of the same religion. 

It seems to me that there are only two possibilities here:

1) you think all Muslims are *regressive aspects* and that it is not just an extremist minority

2) you think there are some *regressive aspects* which are not representative of the whole but for some reason you do not think that any 'collective punishment' is a bad thing or, for some other reason, you do not want to condemn it but instead lay the blame on the *regressive aspects* for any misfortune that will befall the *non regressive aspects*

Kind of concerning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the considered reply. I appreciate it. I agree with you re his likely position on the alt-right but only to the extent that they are beyond the pale (for now). He had no previous problems identifying with the right in general, Republicans and Neocons. 

I think he went further than the 'ticking bomb' scenario (btw, surely this scenario, is as you point out never the case and highly unlikely) in these quotes but maybe it's just my understanding:

I am one of the few people I know of who has argued in print that torture may be an ethical necessity in our war on terror. 

His "Collateral Damage" argument:

 it seems obvious that the misapplication of torture should be far less troubling to us than collateral damage...... I believe that I have successfully argued for the use of torture in any circumstance in which we would be willing to cause collateral damage

Given what many of us believe about the exigencies of our war on terrorism, the practice of torture, in certain circumstances, would seem to be not only permissible, but necessary.

And this:

Some beliefs are so dangerous that it may be ethical to kill people for believing them.

I should say here that my argument is not with Harris per se but rather there is a deeper hypocrisy: his argument has weight and holds water in some sense (collateral damage) - I don't agree with torture but if you are not going to be 100% pacifist then his argument holds. 

The statements above would be less worrying if they were confined to a metaphysical discussion on the part of reasoned individuals of whatever ideology who have a firm grasp of complexity and nuance. However when you read Harris saying this:

**We are at war with Islam.** It may not serve our immediate foreign policy objectives for our political leaders to openly acknowledge this fact, but it is unambiguously so. It is not merely that we are at war with an otherwise peaceful religion that has been 'hijacked' by extremists. **We are at war with precisely the vision of life that is prescribed to all Muslims in the Koran.**

We have a problem.

	<TEXT> Sure but he is being a lot more specific than just 'meditating'. 

The thing is that he sets out a stall which explicitly references ideas and practices rooted in Buddhist tradition. He draws on these ideas and not only engages in Buddhist practices but has personally had a number of Buddhist teachers and instructors who undoubtedly are both teachers and teachers of Buddhism specifically.

The thing with Harris is that he is - as an atheist foamingly labelled me once and I love the label - a "goal post shifting badger".

He will call for torture but when called on it will obfuscate and not own it. 

He will support (say) Dick Cheney but when it isolates some of his peers he will not own it and shifts, falling back on 'context' or some other justification. 

He does the same with Buddhism - this is all exactly what I originally highlighted that differentiates him from other more sincere and honest atheists like Dennett and Dawkins (though that latter is clearly not really a thinker in the sense Harris aspires to be). 

This is a leitmotif of the current societal right-wing tide in the Zeitgeist actually... racists are running amok in the UK and hate-crimes are rising, all racists voted for Brexit but you won't find many Brexit supporters admitting to being racist but if you discuss with them they clearly are. 

Same with Trump and the alt-right. 

It's like they're ashamed of being themselves or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it's just a reference to current pop culture paranoia. 

For the record: I don't think he will as it is, don't think he has plans to either but I do think he will follow through with the registry and then - if another 911 or some sort of impactful catalyst were to occur - then I think he's the sort of President who might think in terms of internment.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  for reference i am a young white conservative christian male whos trying to better understand islam and help some friends who have the wrong view understand it better too, and my opinion is that articles like this are not only unhelpful, but make the problem worse

You could be right. But if it's his genuine experience then he should voice it and be free to.

I tend to think there's a lot of truth in it. There is such a thing as brainwashing and to think that only the extreme-left or extreme religious use it is perhaps naive. 

We all do it to ourselves... by consent. That's all he's saying.

	<TEXT> He is not otherwise practicing Buddhism.

Well he kind of is if he's doing the practice (and it seems he is) because that's all the practice there is. But I hear you.

It's still a moot point though (imo) because in either case he has to divorce the practice from an ideology that he (presumably) cannot follow in toto.

If he does that - takes a practice and rejects 'the religion' - then it puts him again in a false position re Islam. Why could he not do the fasting and 5 prayers for example? I don't think he would because I don't think he can see any benefit there - but they are a spiritual technique as much as meditation is. 

But he includes them by default in his over-arching rejection of Islam. Why not do with Islam what he does with Buddhism - ie, reject the religion and take the benefit? Because he sees no benefit I suspect and that was my earlier point. 

In any case there was one other thing that I forgot to say earlier which you've reminded me of with this: his reading of Islam is wrong, not because it is an atheist one, but because it is essentially a Neocon one.

There are many possible criticisms of Islamic strands of thought but they need to be done in the macro as it were because Islam is not a monolithic system. But Neocons - for geopolitical reasons - needed to portray it as such... that's fine for them but for a thinker then it behoves someone rational in a considered critique to address these mistakes.

But I think it's a case of 'my enemy's enemy....' here. Fine in politics - in philosophy, not so much.

	<TEXT> Hmmm, ok, I'll bite! My 2c:

I think there is a kind of irrational mindset humans can get into - essentially a mind-cancer of sorts - and the full spectrum of it leads from lumping one group together (Commies, Jews, whatever) for the purpose of demonising them without being susceptible to nuance and ends in Auschwitz (for example). It's not a progressive 'road' as it were but a condition and I'd put Sam Harris somewhere on this spectrum.

The main symptom of this condition - and anyone can have it, atheists, religionists, anyone (Islamists drawn to ideologies like those of Daesh would be another example of a more extreme sort) - is that it is irrational and self-contradictory in a way that not only is invisible to the sufferer but also *confirms* to themselves that they are right.

For example: Harris is a Buddhist. But he is also a radical materialist. 

He also, despite being a Buddhist an a Humanist, supports torture. Though seemingly only in the case of Muslims.

He also, despite being liberal (and a Buddhist) supported George Bush's war.

He also claims that when you pin down Muslims on so-called 'hate verses' they claim "context" as an excuse yet when he is taken to task for his infamous "some beliefs might justify killing the holder of the belief" statement he cites context.

Though this last one might be just ordinary hypocrisy.

He is not rational in many ways and is self-contradictory in a way other atheists aren't. That is to say if Person X is opposed to Harris's positions but also opposed actively to Islam then Person X's opposition to Islam will win out.

This is not the case with other atheists. Dennett and Dawkins seem to dislike Islam just as much but both are actively against Trump and oppose Brexit which is supported widely by Islamophobes on the basis of the immigration issue.

I guess he'll warm up if Trump follows through on the camps and the Registry though.

Fez in Morocco would be my #1 choice for such a thing. I rented a riad there for a while to achieve some vaguely similar purpose. You can definitely get into the 'setting' there as it's a visibly ancient environment. 

Istanbul (surprisingly) is another good place for this. If you can take a month off go and set off on a trip of discovery.  </TEXT>
