	<TEXT> Absolutely fucking not. I don't want Lonzo Ball OR Blake Griffin's injuries. Ball doesn't play defense and has no mid range game or slashing skills to translate at the NBA level. He's going to be a taller Jordan Clarkson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I have just the rub you are looking for. I use it on beef, chicken, pork,...anything but seafood. Equal parts salt and pepper, half measure of coffee, paprika and garlic powder, quarter measures of brown sugar, sage and cayenne. You can also add chilli powder if you want, or sub the coffee for cocoa powder. 

I didn't use sage for this one but I put it in pretty much all of mine now. https://imgur.com/gallery/D1Kr8 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a girl ask me to buy her a drink one night. I said no. She said she would give me her number. I told her "thanks but I'm not interested." Then she called me cheap. I proceeded to point out that we were in a college dive bar where all the well drinks and 20 oz beers were $1 that night. If you can't afford to buy your own drink for $1 you have no business being at the bar. </TEXT>
