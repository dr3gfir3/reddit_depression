	<TEXT> Here might be a dumb question.. I'll ask it anyways. So, I moved to the US about 3 years ago and immediately got insurance through my employer. I have had minimal interaction with doctors so far (*knocking on wood*), however, I have no idea how good or bad my insurance is. So if I theoretically get bitten by a rattle snake, which I have crossed paths with repeatedly, I have no idea how much I would have to pay... Is there a system in place that let's you check what my insurance would cover in the OP's case? If I would end up with a bill as that one here.. I have a reason to consider moving back to good ol'Europe. Many thanks in advance. </TEXT>
