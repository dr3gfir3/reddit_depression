	<TEXT> Actually the cost of universal healthcare would be much lower than what people are currently paying for health insurance. Instead of paying $500-$1000 a month for a family, it is around $50-$100 a month. This is what my friends who live in other countries pay for healthcare for a family and they are getting the same thing Americans get, but we pay more. We also have to pay 10%-20% of the bill. WTF!! Their overall costs per person are lower because the insurance pool is much bigger when everyone is in it. </TEXT>

Matthew (27:52-53) "The graves were opened; and **MANY** bodies of the saints which slept arose, and came out of the graves after his resurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto **MANY**."

Hello historians! How'd you miss that? Zombies. Roaming around. Seen by **MANY**!!

	<TEXT> Like Dr. Jason Fung has said jokingly: you will lose muscle and become a ball of fat. /s What happens in famines (this happens to all mammals) is a person will go into ketosis and then ketones and HGH (increases 3 times normal) will protect muscles for a period of time. HGH signals the liver to make glucose which the brain and red blood cells need. The body will burn fat for fuel. Once a person gets to 4-5% body fat then bad things happen and the body will really start wasting muscle. Other bad physiological things will start to happen too.

	<TEXT> The person consuming less calories will have their metabolic rate drop to balance the books after a few days eating less calories.  If they exercise, the metabolic rate will drop even further.  After about a week, they stop losing weight.  CICO stops working.  WTF! Steven Phinney found in a research project that a person sitting on a sofa for 4 to 5 weeks lost more weight than the people who did both (exercise and diet). However, people sitting on the sofa only lost weight in the first week and didn't lose more weight in the remaining weeks even thought they were eating a reduced calorie diet.

	<TEXT> CICO is not the whole story.  If a person reduces calories then the body will lower the metabolic rate.  Further, if a person exercises too then the metabolic rate will go even lower.  It is like the body is balancing the books.  Steven Phinney found in a research project that a person sitting on a sofa for 4 to 5 weeks lost more weight than the people who did both.

It appears that a good strategy to lose weight is to feast and fast...change things up.  The body will adapt if it gets into a pattern. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You will lose muscle and become a ball of fat.  /s  What happens in famines (this happens to all mammals) is a person will go into ketosis and then ketones and HGH (increases 3 times normal) will protect muscles for a period of time.  HGH signals the liver to make glucose which the brain and red blood cells need.  The body will burn fat for fuel.  Once a person gets to 4-5% body fat then bad things happen and the body will really start wasting muscle.  Other bad physiological things will start to happen too.

	<TEXT> I think in a few years, the science will be weight loss and weight gain is all about hormones. Ghrelin, leptin, insulin and many others signal to the brain the body is hungry or full. Keto diet does a good job of stabilizing the hunger hormones. When I was eating low fat, high carb, I had to eat every 2-3 hours because I was hungry.  Obviously something was wrong because without grocery stores available this diet is not sustainable.  It is good for the food corporations.  Now, I can fast for 36 hours, no problem and not be hungry. It is crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good luck!  How can a person tell which calories are being used and which ones are stored?  Brown fat will burn calories in heat loss.  It is just wasted energy.  Some calories are stored into white fat mainly if insulin is present.  But if insulin is low then what?  Furthermore, GI doesn't absorb all the food that is eaten.  I guess if a person was in a metabolic room they can measure everything then get a good estimate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't spike insulin and it makes a person feel full so that will naturally not eat more food.  The fat also boost fat metabolism and ketone production.  If a person wishes to win, that is what they have to do.  It is simple, and really works.  CICO is BS!  That is not how the human body works.  Calorie restriction fails.  If a person reduces their calories, the body will slow metabolism.  A person can eat one meal a day.  This works for a 2-3 weeks in losing weight, but the body will adjust and then it stops working.  Metabolism will slow down. </TEXT>

I will add the oil to what I am eating at breakfast.  Eating fat doesn't spike blood sugar and insulin.  It also will keep you from being hungry.  Macros are only a guide.  You need to experiment to find what really works for you.  If you are not hungry, try skipping meals.  Keep the insulin down, and body fat will drop.  Insulin is the key. </TEXT>
