	<TEXT> I thought that since it talks about mythological topics and the such, it would have some relatable territory to Rick Riordan. Except it being for adults rather than kids, for instance your example. But I'm pretty sure from these responses I was wrong. However I think that I might be able to sneak this by them though. I just won't bring up the vagina monster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been wanting to read the book by Neil Gaiman, but my parents are very religious. They believe that the book is sort of anti religious towards Christianity. When I was younger I read the Percy Jackson series, and they seemed fine with that. If these two series are similar, then I'm pretty sure they'll let me read it. If you have read from both of these series, could you give me your opinion? </TEXT>
