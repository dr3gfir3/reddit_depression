	<TITLE> [Spoiler] Back to the Future Easter egg in Episode 8? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-30 07:34:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just before Eleven unleashes her full energy, the clock on the classroom wall reads [almost 10:04.](http://i.imgur.com/xRYXEQl.jpg) 

10:04 is the time when lightning struck the Hill Valley clock tower in Back to the Future.

Is Eleven putting out 1.21 Gigawatts??

If it's not an Easter egg, it's a continuity error, because Mr. Clarke says it's "10:00 on a Saturday" on the phone in Episode 7, hours before the scene in Episode 8. So I'm going with Easter egg.

And... November 12, the date of the BTTF lightning strike in 1955, was also a Saturday night in 1983. 

Stranger Things begins on November 6, 1983, meaning that the climactic Saturday night was November 12. </TEXT>
