	<TEXT> That's thing thing... there was only one reported (proof) case of domestic violence toward's Nicole from OJ. Yet, on all these TV documentaries they constantly play 911 recordings during a call where OJ did NOT touch her the night of; then follow up that recording with Nicole's bruised face (selective editing). OJ is definitely not a saint, but I don't think he should be the poster boy for spousal abuse  you'd be amazed at the list of celebrities with domestic abuse, yet they're never mentioned. My mind was made up when I read Stephen Singular's book. Then if you add the EDTA (most want to refute this, but they don't find EDTA in blood straight from the human body), defensive wounds on Ron, and non-OJ flesh under Nicole's nails... and all the blood evidence that would only make sense is some crazy time warp. It's all interesting...    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right. And I guess that's why this case is still intriguing after all these years. We can all play Sherlock Holmes all we want (and I'm speaking to myself, mostly), but there's only two people (3, if you count the dog) who REALLY know who the real killer(s) is/are ... and sadly, they're no longer here.

It wouldn't be fun if we KNEW exactly what happened, right? :) ("fun" is probably not the proper word, but you know what I mean) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  jaxwtf - I appreciate you acting like a human being. The "OJ did it/Didn't do it" debate always seems to get ugly, so I commend you for being cool and adult about it. I'll be honest, I can't say he did it/or didn't do it for sure, but based on everything I've consumed, I lean more (a lot more) towards his innocence. And sure, 1-3 killers make more sense (with O.J. included). If you do decide to read the book, hope to hear your thoughts, regardless if your thoughts go against mine. :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Correct, EDTA is in food. There was a test done by some documentary (I forget which one). But basically, some dude ate at McDonalds (I think he actually ate TWO Big Macs) - similar to the meal Simpson ate that day). Long story short, EDTA didn't show up in his blood when he was tested later that day. And until I hear a recording of the phone call between det Phillips and Simpson, it's nothing but hearsay.

Oh, and I think the murders were drug related. Brent Cantor and Michael Nigg (both were in the circle of "drug" friends involving Ron... Ron's sister even dated one of them. They were both assassinated in the same vein around the same time Ron was...). 

I advise you to read Stephen Singular's book (I obviously don't expect you to at my say.... but it's an interesting read, and to me, the deal breaker). You have some points, but would love to hear what you think after reading this book that even Jeffrey Toobin doesn't know about.

I just don't want to be one of these things were we go back 'n fourth forever, ya know? ;)  Again, appreciate your time in replying.  </TEXT>

Gilbert also tried to plant cameras on O.J. when he took women home (so Gilbert can sell it to porn companies). He wasn't O.J.'s sports agent a la Jerry Maguire; he was simply his agent for signing expos and memorabilia. Gilbert was in it for the money.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> jaxwtf, thanks for your reply. I've seen it. I've also seen the TV series, and have also read numerous books. You have the right to your opinion, and I respect it. But how do you explain the EDTA found in the blood? How do you explain the missing blood from the vile (that had O.J.'s blood, which was given to LAPD voluntarily)? How do you explain the flesh found under Nicole's fingernails? (didn't match OJ's DNA); how do you explain the bruises on Ron's fists? (O.J. had no bruises); how do you explain NO BLOOD in O.J.'s ransacked plumbing at his house? The word "conspiracy" is thrown around too lightly. Honestly, answer some of my questions and if you give me some FACTS (not speculation), I will change my mind (and I mean that in a non-sarcastic way).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have loved to see a OJ documentary in a similar vein to MAKING OF A MURDERER. There are some great non-mainstream documentaries out there (such as the work of Brian Heiss  check out his vids on youtube and on this subreddit); Sure, the ESPN doc was nice and polished but one-sided (leaning more towards his guilt). As far as books, again, great ones out there, but most Americans won't look that deep - instead they'll listen to the BS that is repeated over and over again from mainstream media. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree with your examples.

Well, at least O.J. will *hopefully* be set free this year. If he does, he needs to keep it on the down low. But I do look forward to what he has to say about everything that has happened in while he was in prison (Oscar doc, TV series, etc).

But my main wish is for people to actually believe he's innocent instead of what the media throws out there. Sadly, this will most likely never happen. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Any American citizen willing to convict this man on faulty and quite frankly contaminated evidence is not a true American. If you were you would KNOW that this belief went against OJ's constitutional rights and had he been found guilty he would have appealed  and the appellate court would have reversed the trial court's decision and either did one of two things. Free him or grant him a new trial. Either way, those who believe him to be guilty would have still lost either way so thank God the jury used common sense and recognized the fact that reasonable double had been created in this case. Aside from all that, let's look at the evidence. Many of those who believe in OJ's guilt swear they're scholars because they claim to have watched the whole trial from beginning to end. They continuously stipulate that on the premise of OJ's blood even remotely being at the crime scene...HE'S GUILTY without taking into account that  first and foremost you had a racist cop on the force, secondly, the crime scene had been contaminated, and thirdly,  the evidence itself could not be trusted.

 Let me reiterate to you this point. When a crime scene is disturbed or contaminated, none of the evidence that is found there can be trusted. If a prosecutor still decides to go ahead and introduce that faulty evidence at trial they take a huge gamble. That is like asking a question that you don't know the answer to. That was Marcia Clark's first mistake but not her last mistake in this case. Her case was hinged on two things...1. The fact that OJ was a batterer and 2. OJ's blood being found at the crime scene and at his home. She thought for sure that she had a slam dunk case with those two things. That was mistake number two.  Now mind you, I tried with all my might to believe that OJ was guilty beyond all doubt, not just reasonable doubt but after watching this trial I came to the conclusion that there was no way that he could have done this. Now whether he knew about it before or after the fact remains to be seen. If he knew about it before the fact, he would have been an accessory before the fact and would have gotten the same charge brought against him...first degree murder. If he knew about it after the fact he would have been an accessory after the fact where this charge is not as harsh as the charge for an accessory before the fact. Moving on. 

The prosecutors contended that OJ was in a rage on that night. They even brought forth witnesses to attest to his character on that day at his daughter's recital..That was mistake number 3. The defense blew that claim and those witnesses out of the water where they showed OJ in a most joyful mood. Laughing and joking with Nicole's father and hugging and kissing Denise Brown. In other words, Denise Brown straight up lied about OJ's mood. So I submit to you, where was OJ's rage? Point established. Question: Why were the telephone records suppressed? In other words, if OJ was as guilty as they say he was, why was the telephone records not submitted into court proceedings? I submit to you that the telephone records alone would have exonerated OJ without the need for trial to continue?  Moving forward. Here comes Mark Furhman. Thought he was an ok guy. Thought he answered questions on the stand to the best of his ability until BAM those tapes came out that proved that not only was he a racist but he was a genocidal racist. That was mistake number four for the prosecution. The defense had a field day with that pile of shit. He denied that he ever called a black person a nigger in the last 10 years but just as recent as 1989  or somewhere around there he was using the word nigger quicker than water coming out of a faucet. He contends that if he saw a black man he would plant evidence against him. He also contended that he would like to put all black people together and burn them. Why is it hard to believe that someone of that caliber would not plant evidence against OJ. Of course he ran into OJ before, saw how OJ was living until he saw that OJ was with a white woman and he couldn't have that and told himself this. I will get that nigger one day and that one day came in the wee hours of June 13th 1994. This was his chance. As an officer of the law if you know that you are being accused of something that you know that you did not do you would state that you did not do it. I don't care how you slice the pie or what you say about oh he had to take the fifth. Remember that he had already perjured himself. How was him stating that he didn't plant or manufacture evidence in this case  going to incriminate him any further? The fact remains that he denied, denied, denied and that is what made the public and eventually the jury hate his pathetic ass. Of course, we're dealing with an officer who was with the LAPD who had been known to target minorities. Moving on. 

The glove debacle. How is it possible that OJ's blood got on the front part of the glove that was found behind the guest house? HOW? I want someone to make me understand this...Mich Cumstein, a fellow You Tuber, gave me the following explanation....."When taking the right hand glove off, he transferred blood onto it."...OJ would have had to be bleeding on his left hand in order for blood to get on the front surface of the glove found at Rockingham. OJ only had a cut on his left middle finger and that cut was not consistent with Ron or Nicole scratching him as OJ's skin would have been found under either of their nails nor would that cut have created enough amount of blood to transfer on that glove unless it was wiped on it. Also, To further my point, Ron Goldman had very short nails. Nicole had acrylic nails. It would be hard to make that type of cut.  The prosecution, thanks to Chris Darden, decided to make OJ try on those gloves...Mistake number five, which really cost them their case. How stupid can Darden be? Many people want to explain away the way OJ tried on those gloves. i.e. OJ was making it look like the gloves didn't fit. i.e. latex under the gloves, i.e. OJ stopped taking his arthritis medicine which made his hands swollen and thus this is why the gloves didn't fit. All of those statements are preposterous. The fact remains that Darden asked a question that he didn't know the answer to and failed greatly. Whether OJ pretended or not remains to be seen but from my perspective he really was trying to put on those gloves.  Back to the blood...Many people hinge OJ's guilt on the fact that his blood was found at both the crime scene and at his home..that meant that he was the killer but please tell me why Vannatter did not book OJ's vile of blood to Parker Center but instead so say forgot and carried that blood with him to both the crime scene and OJ's house? How is it possible for blood to be so neatly dropped in that manner? If you cut your hand deep enough to where it starts bleeding, and you start walking the blood won't drop as neatly as it did at both the crime scene and OJ's home where prosecutors contend that it was his blood. Why was blood even on Nicole's back gate? It was planted there. On to the socks. 

How did blood get on OJ's socks? If OJ had on those socks while killing Nicole and Ron how is it possible that blood seeped from one side of the sock to the other side of the sock. left to right? Let's say I have a pair of socks on and I drop blood on that sock, it would not seep through the sock as my body part is in it. Makes no sense. The blue knit cap was not consistent with OJ's hair BUT with an African American's hair. Why are people still under the assumption that it had to be OJ's hair when DNA did not prove that? William Dear has the best theory and more evidence that supports the fact that Jason Simpson is responsible for those murders. Please look at the docuseries coming January 15th 2017 on ID Discovery. Jason Simpson wore a blue knit cap that was found at the murder scene. A month or two later he's seen in a photo wearing a grey ski cap. Jason Simpson had no alibis for the night in question either. Jason Simpson threatened his co-worker or boss with a knife. He also threatened his girlfriend with a knife and I believe cut her hair with a knife. Jason Simpson has what is called intermittent rage disorder and was prescribed medication called Depakote where it calmed him if he was on it. Weeks before the murders he stopped taking that medication. Jason Simpson has a volatile history and even wrote crazy shit in his journal...In 1994 this is a following excerpt of how he felt and what he wrote....""A knife cuts away the parts of something not needed. This is the year of the knife for me! So what exactly did he mean by that. Anyway stay tuned because I believe William Dear even though there are people trying to discredit this man based on the fact that they really don't want to believe that OJ Simpson is innocent of this crime and will fight the truth no matter what which makes people in this God forsaken country sad. They would rather stay convinced that an innocent man is guilty of this crime rather than believe that someone who displayed psychotic tendencies and who had deep anger issues  who had been wounded by Nicole when she stiffed him on that Sunday night by not coming to his restaurant like she promised could not have committed this crime. People have psychological issues in this country when they would rather believe fiction over facts...
