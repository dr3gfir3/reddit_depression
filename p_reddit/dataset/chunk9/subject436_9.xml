We investigate the Flynn effect on several cognitive tests in England and Germany.



Individuals aged 50+ perform cognitively better if born into more recent cohorts.



The upward drift in mean cognitive abilities is similar across educational levels.



The use of modern technology by individuals aged 50+ has increased over time.



Trends in modern technology use are associated with the observed Flynn effect.

	<TEXT> The original research is scheduled to appear online Aug 31, 2015 and to be published Sept 4, 2015 in the journal Physical Review Letters. 

The "most original" paper I could find is this: https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3188

As for the biased headline, here's EurekaAlert ("Evidence suggests subatomic particles could defy the standard model" http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2015-08/uom-ess082615.php) and U of M (Evidence Suggests Subatomic Particles Could Defy the Standard Model https://cmns.umd.edu/news-events/features/3188). 

- - -

In my opinon, I should wait until Aug 31 2015 for this to be peer-reviewed published, and then - but not earlier - I'll repost with the title "Evidence Suggests Subatomic Particles Could Defy the Standard Model: The scientists working at CERN have found evidence of leptons decaying at different rates, which could be evidence for non-standard physics"  

Please let me know what you think. Thanks! and sorry for the mess I might have created.

	<TEXT>  parents smoking as related to ADHD

It's debatable, but there are several big studies published showing a significant, strong association between smoking parents and ADHD.

We found that maternal, but not paternal, smoking was significantly associated with elevated inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and total ADHD symptoms in children. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3124822/

Compared with children born to nonsmoking mothers and smoking fathers, children born of smoking mothers and nonsmoking fathers had a higher risk of ADHD (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.03 to 1.53). We also saw a higher risk of ADHD in children of mothers who used nicotine replacement during pregnancy.

http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/early/2014/07/16/peds.2014-0213.abstract

children who were exposed to secondhand smoke for less than one hour per day were 50% more likely to have some mental disorder compared to kids not exposed at all.

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/childhood-adhd-linked-to-secondhand-smoke/

Postnatal parental smoking was associated with both parent and teacher ratings of ADHD symptoms and oppositional behavior. After controlling for a number of covariates, several of these relationships were still significant. The risk of maternal smoking for the development of ADHD symptoms does not end during pregnancy. 

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3678953/


Children exposed to secondhand smoke in the home are more likely than children in smoke-free homes to develop behavior and learning problems, according to new research. These include learning disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and behavior and conduct disorders.
