	<TEXT> No, but I got a 26$ credit that I can't for the life of me figure out why. I have an EIP credit from the Black Friday deals, but those started posting the first month after I got it and posted since. Thought about calling 611 to figure it out, but why rock the boat? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YMMV but I call 611 and get it refunded via bill credits. It's not a perfect solution but better than not getting it back. Honestly from what I've seen most people aren't even inherently against it, they just wish T-Mobile was honest about what these fees are instead of calling them SIM fees and etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Death in Tibia for a high level back then could set you back weeks, or even months. Now it's days, or even just hours depending on what you classify as a 'high level' now (counting xp only for setting back)

I just started Medivia and am loving it personally. I hope it stays up for years to come. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Logitech G602 is an amazing entry level wireless gaming mouse. I think a total of 12 buttons (I think, don't quote me on that) including left, right, and middle scroll wheel click. I picked mine up new on Amazon for 50$, and you install the drivers by downloading them from Logitech's site. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Astera is a pretty good world too! Fidera is very nice also, I have a couple alts there and my main use to be there before xferring.

Honestly for pvp I have alts on Dolera and Hydera for when I feel like a good pk session. Pvp in Tibia is basically dead anyway besides waring bot guilds sprinkled with legit players trying to fight back here and there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ehh, lags have gotten worse (I assume they're actively being DDoS'ed atm) but not kicks for me. Just been playing lowbies because hunting on my main with a low of 350 MS latency, average of 450, with spikes up to 1k is just not doable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very true enough, I personally feel this way myself. More or less at least. How I think it'll go

BE is effective at stopping cheating just from blocking? CIP is happy and botters, if they stop trying to cheat/keep playing as  manual players stay as customers

Bot develops a way to bypass BE but autotool gets them? Still win

Bot develops a way to bypass BE via updates but BE when updated knows who bypassed/botted (so an 'update' war) and CIPS auto tool can't catch it? CIP ways pros/cons of letting BE mass delete botters.

As long as between BE and CIP Tibia becomes virtually cheater free? Everyone but botters win.


But my OP was just in regards to the people who say CIP says BE won't ban at all, which simply isn't true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To start, Tibia's forums aren't working for me so I can't provide sources/quotes, but you're welcome to just check official responses on the thread in auditorium anytime.

First Mirade said BE will block people from logging in who are using unofficial software and explicitly left out anything about bans.

When questioned further it was said BE WOULD NOT BAN AT ALL DURING BE'S TESTING PHASE but CIPs tool would work in tandem with BE.

When questioned again for after the testing phase it was stated "they could not provide further information at this time".

Yes, all this could mean they'll never allow BE to ban, only block but it doesn't mean they won't allow it to ban. It is simply up in the air right now.

I imagine if they do/don't allow it depends on a lot of things, including if BE does a lot of false positives in Tibia, if it'd kill CIP from losing so many customers they go bankrupt, etc.

I just see people everyday saying CIP explicitly said BE won't ban (with the implication of ever), which simply isn't the case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 7.4-7.6 , but probably like everyone here I'm biased since I started in 7.3 but was so new the game I didn't know a lot of stuff until sometime during 7.4.

E.g. my first ever char I had a "circuit" of hitting up east Thais trolls surface layer, heading up to this 2 (I think 2) rot spawn near Femur Hills (while killing wolves, dwarves on the dwarf bridge etc on the way) and thought I was getting amazing xp. By halfway through 7.4 I was no where near as noob'ish and understood the game much better.

And up till 7.6 is because I have never enjoyed the game as much as I did from 7.4-7.6. I understand why CIP has made the game easier, this isn't EQ1 days anymore, most people don't want an MMO to be their entire life outside work anymore. I have mixed feelings about this myself, it fits in this day of MMOS and will be far more attractive to new comers (all MMOs need new blood, without it they will eventually die, it may be a long slow death, but nevertheless) but it isn't the same Tibia as when I started. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a newbie PACC Trolls in Edron can be great for a pally since they drop spears,you can usually be self sufficient on them there. Just make sure if you have no cap for new ones to throw the unused ones on the ground for (from the corpse) for later. Dragging excess ones to DP at the end of the hunt for use on other hunting later is good too.

Also offline train every day, all 12 hours! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, I generally don't like Collectors Editions because I think what they usually come with is not worth the price. But I have to say that this is pretty pro-consumer thing to do and is really good for people who want to get the digital Edition, or just want the Collectibles and are not interested in the game itself (in this case IF they did this maybe a huge LOTR/Tolkien fan who didn't like SoM) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm, I transferred almost 2 years ago on a 144 mage to Astera. Went inactive almost immediately afterwords (until like 5 days ago) due to the friend I xferred over to play with went retired out of nowhere, I wasn't trying to hide or anything. I JUST came back, like I said 5ish days ago, and now I'm worried in the coming weeks I may have problems. </TEXT>
