	<TEXT> Investor Courts that overrule domestic ones has been some cause for worry, to the point where concern comes up with every major trade deal in circles that follow these developments. At the end of the day, huge trade deals aren't negotiated in a utopic vacuum. They're negotiated by lobbyists from the biggest players, and certainly not in the interest of a truly free market - and with the side effect that countries can be locked into them for years or indefinitely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Colin Fieman, the federal public defender assigned to Tippens (who also successfully got a similar case dropped in early March) would not tell Ars precisely what information on WikiLeaks he had wanted to introduce in court.

"Although the documents are now public, they are still classified, and I need to be circumspect about recirculating information in them," Fieman e-mailed. "However, I can tell you that some of the documents of particular interest relate to the **government's ability to alter time stamps and other metadata without leaving a forensic trail, and [its ability to] otherwise use malware that evades 'reverse engineering' by defense experts."**

It's kinda funny the ripple effects WLs has. In this case, they made public evidence that the government can frame someone for possessing CP enough to fool experts - and this federal public defender is using it to force the government into either forfeiting cases like this or try to figure how they can deal with that argument. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The short story: Andrew Scott was home playing video games with his girlfriend when someone began banging loudly on his door. Since it was 1:30 am, Scott was cautious and answered to door with a gun in his hand, pointed at the floor. He opened the door to see only a "shadowy figure" and began stepping backwards. The shadowy figure was Deputy Richard Sylvester, who immediately shot Scott six times, killing him.

Deputy Sylvester admits he never identified himself as a law enforcement officer. He also claims Scott's movement back into his apartment was perceived by him as a Scott attempting to find cover before opening fire. Perception is all that matters, and only one person's perception really matters: Deputy Sylvester's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mainstream elements of 'liberal media' ignored most of the NSA disclosures and the little attention they spent was largely on Snowden as a person, like suggesting he was a foreign operative. Based on that (and other leaks that occurred under Obama), I don't think they 'benefit from the leaks' except when they believe they can spin the leaks into a narrative they want to spread; and even then - I wouldn't expect them to make solid criticism of the system itself.  </TEXT>

And yeah, if in the name of 'resistance' you are echoing anything you can get a hold of on the internet without exercising any skepticism, you're probably going to make people dismiss everything you say - even if some of it is true.

In a June YouTube interview, former NSA deputy director Chris Inglis said he doubted that Snowden was in the employ of the Chinese or the Russians. Said Inglis, I dont see any evidence that would indicate that, and even if they were careful in terms of practicing denial and deception, I think there would be certain telltales that would show that Snowden was giving up intelligence.

When lawmakers point out that the bill does more harm than good, they'll likely be derided for refusing to "compromise." Granted with the ACA and other Congressional kerfuffles currently taking priority, this bill may take some time before large ISP lobbyists and lawmakers can finally table such legislation. But those of you that care about net neutrality need to understand one thing: net neutrality's death will come disguised as a 2017 bill pretending to save it.

	<TEXT> The Putin critic (an LGBT mother who fled Russia) he's sourcing said this:

Meanwhile, while Russia continues to dominate the front pages, Trump will continue waging war on immigrants, cutting funding for everything thats not the military, assembling his cabinet of deplorableswith six Democrats voting to confirm Ben Carson for Housing, for example, and ten to confirm Rick Perry for Energy. According to the Trump plan, each of these seems intent on destroying the agency he or she is chosen to runto carry out what Steve Bannon calls the deconstruction of the administrative state. As for Sessions, in his first speech as attorney general he promised to cut back civil rights enforcement and he has already abandoned a Justice Department case against a discriminatory Texas voter ID law. But it was his Russia lie that grabbed the big headlines.

It's about how important journalism is getting buried under wild allegations. People who have been shown to be disreputable now are getting treated like experts; people like Murdoch writer Louise Mensch. People who started conspiracy theories about Bill Clinton (like David Brock with the Arkansas Project) now play a leading role in the latest conspiracy theories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for posting OP. It's a really good article. John Stewart recently called on msm to 'take up journalism' now that they've been treated differently by Trump, and it's funny how they are showing their dedication to their old playbook. 

Forget covering lobbying   political donations; forget investigating government overreaches. They're just not up to the task. I guess it's fitting they've finally fallen to the level of Infowars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think he's a BLM member, but after getting fired from The Intercept for falsifying evidence   shoddy journalism - he wrote a five thousand word essay accusing The Intercept   "'New York liberal media'" as being racist.

The River front times did a lot of investigation into the guy, and holy cow is he something. For example:

More recently, Thompson launched a GoFundMe campaign, claiming he was running for St. Louis mayor. (He never filed the necessary paperwork.)

"This election is all about people power," he wrote. "Because only with your voices and your votes and your power can we fight back against Trumpian fascism and socio-economic terrorism." He raised just $25 of his $5,000 goal.

Plus, didn't Trump propose a military budget increase that itself is 80% of the entire Russian military budget? The US has the largest military presence around the world. If we have a dispute with a rival, it should be resolved diplomatically - not by dragging us down into nuclear tensions. We've gone this route before and saw the mess it got us in, why repeat history? </TEXT>

So we'll make an effort to make it look natural.
