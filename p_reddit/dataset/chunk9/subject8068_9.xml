	<TEXT> Neat. My first planeswalker pull was a foil [[Domri Rade]] back when Gatecrash was the new set on the block.

My first mythic non-planeswalker pull was an Elesh Norn from Modern Masters 2015, followed by a Tarmogoyf. I got 3x MM15 packs in my Christmas stocking. Norn and Goyf were in that bunch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bardoc the Magus of the Hidden Way

Bardoc believed that talents defined the individual, shaped the identity. The talents an individual developed were intimately tied to certain locations across the world, or certain objects, or certain events. So Bardoc started a rogue order of magi, called the Hidden Way, that took the Sajin teachings of balancing mind and body and went out on his own. The "Hidden Way" refers to the loci tied to the individual magi's talent.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a spin on the "my elves/goblins/dragons" are different threads  - here we post a hilarious quirk of our races that distinguish them from what you'd expect.

Rule of Two in effect - you comment on two posts before posting your own, unless you are the first person to reply to my OP.

My Elves are hilariously different: in a primitive world populated by simians, goblins, and devils, the elves mostly keep to their unusually sturdy trees that spring up from the nightsoil. They gained a nasty reputation from their penchant for tossing their dung at one another during inter-tree warfare. From this the elves became unwitting masters of biological warfare. It built them a fierce reputation.

Reality is - they are slope-browed turd-tossers that got lucky. </TEXT>

So the Blood Magus stole the chalice, used its magic to destroy the dragon with which he made the convenant. Now he roams the world doing heroic deeds - they were his bread and butter; with the chalice under his control, he need not worry about the threat of unending peace putting an end to his career. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The brutal stuff is a footnote, really.

A Minamo wizarding student named Choryu killed Hidetsugu's monk apprentice. [[Toshiro Umezawa]] slapped Choryu with a kanji that sent the Minamo wizard to Hidetsugu's lair, Shinka. Later, Toshi visits Shinka and finds that Hidetsugu had been keeping Choryu alive, vivisecting him piece by piece and sustaining the Minamo wizard by feeding him his own viscera. </TEXT>
