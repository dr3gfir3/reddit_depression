	<TEXT> Yeah, disease thanks to the disgusting Europeans that came over. This is coming from a Cherokee who has much family in the Tribe in North Carolina. Almost nothing before the settlers came had been affecting the tribes. 

The term genocide usage was correct. The damage physically and with intent done by the pilgrims and settlers were malicious and COMPLETELY done on purpose. The majority of the white men and women tricked, lied to, stole from, raped, killed, and belittled any native in their way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a person suffering from Depression, THIS.

How are people supposed to heal in life if they're supposed to be embarrassed and ashamed about their disorders? It's much easier to just come out with it, embrace it, and most importantly, talk about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely feel like all animals can make limited amounts of facial expressions to cue how it's feeling at the time. Probably less happy but more content and feeling safe and comfortable in this pic. The directions of animals ears helps too, and in this one they're forward. Also a signal for contentness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my freshman year of high school, my parents enrolled me in an all girls convent. The girls didn't like me because they discovered I was best friends of their nemesis. 

They decided to start a rumor that I had "a hit list" and "did voodoo." They would constantly taunt me. I never knew where they got those ideas from. I was and still am a skinny, quiet redhead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You condone this death penalty, yet American civilians kill are granted permission to kill THOUSANDS of civilians overseas. All for the slim chance of actually hitting intended target. How do those manslaughters justify this murder? One American life is worth maybe one hundred of their civilians' lives, imo. 

That fact, and the sentencing is tragic and unjust in my eyes.
The death penalty does not solve anything. No one should play God. 
Preserve life. Encourage Change.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Horseback riding is an extremely physically vigorous sport. Anyone who says otherwise has clearly no understanding of the sport. This is coming from a person who rode for 16 years and competitively for 4 years. Although it's true majority of horseback riders don't have much of an upper-body muscle mass, riders do have exquisite amounts of so in their legs. They do not only compare to but also challenge other athletes in other sports, in that department.  </TEXT>

So, thank you for sharing OP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A man tried to lure me into his car when I was 4 or 5. My dad came out of the building shortly after, luckily. He was a 30 year old dude in a business suit and a nice car from what I could tell. We're both white.  He looked ordinary to me. 

I learned then that monsters are everyday people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was 4 a man tried to lure me into his car. I was outside an animal shelter, near a semi busy road. The man was about 30 and I could instantly tell he wasn't trying to help me. I was saying no, but he wouldn't leave me alone. Luckily my dad came out and the guy drove off pretty damn quick. 

The world changed for me that day. Nobody had to explain anything to me. The world and men in general just because a lot darker after that, and I knew I had to watch out for myself.  </TEXT>
