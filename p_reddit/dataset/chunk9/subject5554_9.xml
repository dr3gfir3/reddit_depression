	<TEXT> If you think about it, I'm not even sure why they keep Owens as a heel. He looks pretty nonthreatening, and downright like he doesn't belong in the WWE. That sets him up for a perfect Mick Foley-style underdog babyface run. I feel like they're swimming upstream trying to make him look legitimate to casuals by putting him in a suit and giving him a belt to carry all the time. </TEXT>
