	<TEXT> That's because you're a beginner.  Everyone starts off being able to speak better than they comprehend, because let's face it, normal Japanese speech sounds like gibberish to a beginner.  Once you start becoming intermediate, the opposite becomes true.  You understand what is being said, but don't have the fluency to form your own complex sentences with speed.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am deeply sorry about your situation, but at least you can take some comfort knowing that you are teaching a valuable lesson to all closet atheists.  The message is clear: DO NOT COME OUT until you are financially independent.  DO NOT let emotions get the better of you.  No matter how much it pains you, keep up the act, pretend to be the good Muslim/Christian or whatever, do anything to appear religious.  Patience patience patience.  One day, you will be freed from these shackles, but the path to freedom takes discipline, planning, and courage.   </TEXT>

Your father will feel redeemed, your mother will be happier, and you can have more time to careful consider how to become independent.  You have to be smart about this.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hair grows from hair follicles. Repeated plucking can damage or kill the follicle, thus stopping hair growth. However, these cells can be repopulated from stem cells that reside in the hair follicle niche.   

This is speculation, but the hair follicles in the middle of your forehead could have more of these stem cells.  One type of stem cell in the hair follicle is derived from a cell population called the Neural Crest.  During embryonic development, these cells migrate from your spinal area and wrap around you until they meet at the front of your body.  The area where these cells converge could have a higher density of these special stem cells.  This might explain why the center of your face is more resilient to plucking.   </TEXT>

Sometimes I need to speak business Japanese because of my job, but sometimes I have fundamental gaps in my knowledge.

	<TEXT> I don't think you are addressing my question, as I already understand what all the conjugations mean.  The positive form is used differently, because you do hear people saying  and  rather interchangeably to say "I understand."  But people rarely use  to refer to themselves.  I am asking why there is this distinction between the usage of the positive form versus the negative form.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something I've noticed is that, for whatever reason,  seems more frequently used in first person, while  is more frequently used in second person  

 



But I never hear



This is strange to me because I would think that grammatically both can be used for first and second person.  Why is there a bias for  to be used more frequently in second person?  I would prefer if a native speaker could comment on this. 

Edit: modified for clarity. I am not asking for a lesson explaining the difference between  form and  form, I already know this.  This is a question about speaking idioms, not grammar.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He says it's illegal to possess technically.  But I decided to read up on this, and I'll concede the point that the legality of possessing these documents is still unclear, based on this: http://lawnewz.com/high-profile/law-prof-smacks-down-cnn-chris-cuomos-claim-that-its-illegal-to-possess-wikileaks-emails/

So in fact CNN might have messed up here, but it is also a matter of debate. They may have overstepped the line by being so confident with that statement.  But I really don't think this is at all equivalent to "fake news" which is literally making up an event to fool everyone.

	<TEXT>  I lurk on T_D regularly and haven't found a single instance of actual fake news from mainstream media.  They may engage in partisan reporting, witholding information, and making occasional mistakes, but they don't ever just make up stories out of thin air like the alt right does.  Remember that story about hundreds of thousands of hillary votes found in a dumpster? Made up by one guy who ran a fake news website to make money.  CNN would never, ever just fabricate a story like that.   What they do is report the facts but filtered through a lense of their own judgement, which you may disagree with...but this is not fake news </TEXT>
