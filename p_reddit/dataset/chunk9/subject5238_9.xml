	<TEXT> who knew who chris hemsworth was before he was picked as thor? or daniel craig before bond?  white actors get plucked from obscurity for breakout roles but the same thing is not happening for minority actors and in gits' case, it's egregious because they could have since the role was asian to begin with but instead they invented a whole new backstory to justify her beng white that weakened the movie, thats how averse to asians being in the leading role they are

being ok with whitewashing is the same thing as being ok with rosa parks sitting in the back of the bus because that's how its been done or whatever reason they asspull </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I originally wanted to watch last year but it only played one week.  Now it's back in theaters and I just got back from a packed screen filled mostly with teens, couples and even a few over thirty, from all races (and this was for a subtitled screening, there are also dubbed screenings)

The movie is about a girl and boy who switch places when a comet appears in the sky.  That's the story in a nutshell but it's so much more and I think that's why it was the number one movie in Japan last year and is second only to Spirited Away's box office.  It's also a coming of age story, a romance, about the culture of the countryside versus the city, the vanishing culture of parts of the country, and about the 3/10 tsunami.  The story is told with heart, humor, and without cynicism which is probably why the writer/director has been called the new Hayao Miyazaki although they are very different.  If one wants to understand Japan, this may be the best movie to convey where it is at this moment.  Both boy and girl roles are equally strong and developed so it's also a good date movie.  

It's really just a great movie period and I recommend it wholeheartedly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> we are talking about asian americans and more broadly minorities getting chances to play roles that were asian to begin with, it's a shame you think thats a bad thing or just dont care.  let me tell you, if it werent for sjws, stories like vincent chin would still be under the rug.  are you annoyed by asian americans on the news all the time asking for equal representation?  if youre white id say good, thats how change starts, since youre asian I have to ask again why is that a bad thing? </TEXT>

I like will smith, denzel, eddie murphy, chris tucker, id argue blacks get cast more because of white guilt over slavery.   id love to see a breakout hispanic or asian mainstream star which couldve happened in this ghost in the shell.  the story would've made more sense if it had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> such narrow thinking.  not everyone wants to watch a film with a lead of their ethnicity especially when the original role is japanese and it's still set in Asia.  that undermines the story.  

and in this case they went the extra mile to justify their whitewashing with an entire subplot  

glad brave producers like blumhouse are there putting out movies like get out  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hello there youngling, the tide is rising.  I love the prequels despite its flaws.  ironically tfa was so shallow and bad it made me appreciate prequels more.  here are some thoughts during a recent viewing of them.  we are growing, stay strong!

	<TEXT> great point, I love anime and always expect the movie versions to suck and they usually do.  anime isnt like a video game or book, it is its own art on par with movies and adaptations misunderstand this and try to make it into a standard hollywood flick 

without showing an understanding of the separate art that is anime, the anime fan then cannot be depended upon to multiply support and so that leaves mainstream audiences who for various reasons already mentioned in this post stayed away. </TEXT>
