this.  which is odd, he was so good at this sort of thing with Buffy, making it have a distinct look and feel, but he struggled with Marvel to have his action films have a unique or distinctive mis en scene. Not bad per se, just forgettable.

	<TEXT> Blue collar is *frequently* used as a sort of coded phrase for "poor white people", which is why i specified working class and lower/lower middle class, which is not.

That said, there is no indication that Pratt meant it that way. it sounds like its a tiny portion of a much longer interview and the point wasnt dwelled on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the author's tone is pretty misplaced.  Working class families and individuals are underrepresented in movies and TV.  Indie cinema does alright by them, but mainstream hollywood frequently features fairly affluent characters, not a lot of rural america or lower/lower middle class urban america. 

EDIT
While it's nice that Chris wants to see more people like himself on-screen, he is a straight, white male. And Hollywood has an *actual* diversity problem at the momentboth in terms of race and gender. So, actually, maybe it's time for there to be less stories like Chris Pratt's, and more stories about, oh, you know, literally any other marginalized community in this country.

Hollywood'd diversity problem extends beyond race and sex, though those are definitly in the forefront. The class divide on representation is huge as well

	<TEXT> Each movie is being made by different people, but it seems like each director is being allowed to bring a lot of themselves to the movies, and that they have some high level of control over the end result.  Maybe less so with Rogue One, but JJ abrams was definitly executing a lot of freedom over the films.  Less so than if it was an independent film, but more so than marvel </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lucas made up a lot as he went, the idea that all 6 movies were written in one sitting is pretty much debunked. 

Interviews with the various writers involved would indicate that the sequel trilogy was definitly written with all 9 movies in mind (not TFA so much, but 8 and 9 are definitly said to be looking at how the saga ties up) </TEXT>

I saw it as recognizing the failings of the jedi order, conceptually. He probably learned how his father fell, and saw how Ben fell. He went and studied the force in a way no jedi had, and emerged to say that there is greater strength in balance, rather than light vs dark  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the jewish hooker scene is great.


but the rest of the movie is a jumbled mess, with too many unrelated plotlines and characters i couldnt bring myself to care about.  

also, for it being about LA and New York in the 30s, they dont do anything cool with showing off the time or the culture. Its sort of about the most boring people in the film

a complete missed opportunity  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Woody Allen has a lot of these in his filmography.  That he made so many good films in the 70s, 80s, 90s, and still clearly knows a little of what he is doing, to see a film as bad as Cafe Society, which is truly terrible beyond belief and one of the worst times I have had in a theater, is saddening. 

EDIT

The AV club described Cafe Society as being like listening to a very old former mater pianist. They can hit all the right notes, but are incapable of making those notes sound good together  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, THX 1138, American Graffiti, and Star Wars are all fantastic films he directed, and I would say they featured good direction.

If he hadnt ever made a star wars prequel, and had returned to making films more in line with his first two after star wars, he would be remembered very differently. He just lacks the energy and temperament for big budget live action filmmaking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i mean, its def lightened a a lot, but cameras historically under expose people with darker skin, since film development was made to best represent the color pallet of white skin.  Digital is great in that it can just capture a raw image, and then be tweaked all over so that every individual looks accurate to how they look in real life. 

I mean, I've never seen Don Cheadle in real life so i dont know if that is accuratte to how he looks, but thats the idea </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked Collins, she used to be very centrist, which made her and senator snowe good senators to have (their inconsistency with partisan voting put them in a powerful bargaining position). She hasnt been as bad as most republicans recently, but has largely fallen back to partisan voting in the past few years. I'm not registered in Maine anymore (live in WI now) but unfortunately she could stand a good chance of winning. Hopefully, with ranked choice, the dems wont have to worry with their vote splitting.  </TEXT>
