Ive been talking to the girl. 

Do you have any idea how much harder that makes things?

Ive been so focused on the rest of the pain that I did not realize how powerful the loneliness was. 

I could be a hundred miles from home. All I know is that Ive never been here before. The person I loved most is intentionally making me suffer the most, and I know Im almost certainly going to die.

Painfully.

And I cant blame her for killing Gordon. Who really could, given the circumstances? Part of me admires her greatly.

And I ate his fucking liver, too. 

So Im not in much of a position to judge. And Id like a friend

Whats your name? I ask her after she had gotten her fill of intestine.

I dont know why she responded this time. Lucy, she croaked, as though she had not spoken in a while.

Hi Lucy, Im Phil. It was awkwardly silent after that. 

How did you get here? I asked after some time. I have no idea how much time, really. It melts by in here.

My mother doesnt love me, she explained succinctly. 

Oh, was all I could think to respond. I dont think my mother loves me, either.

I might have fallen asleep, because I suddenly became aware again. I jerked forth in panic, and felt my body up and down for stab wounds.

There were none. Lucy was staring at me.

Ive never been so happy that a child had not shanked me in my sleep. But it did prove that I had to get moving on some sort of a plan. 

I had to get the knife.

How long have you been a prisoner, Lucy? I figured that staying on her conversational side would be advantageous no matter how this thing played out. 

I dont know. Most of my life, I think.

My heart sank. No wonder she had been so removed, so callous when it came to killing a grown man. She wasnt part of society in the way that the rest of us are, and didnt follow the same rules. 

For the first time since I saw the tapes, I realized that someone else was worse off than me. 

Thats horrible. Where were you kept?

My mom held me in a room in a tall apartment on Emmeline Street, she explained casually.

I knew the only tall apartment on that road.

Thats where my Aunt Myra lives, I offered, hoping for some sort of connection.

My moms name is Myra, Lucy explained casually.

My head swam. The possibility was impossible. The reality unreal.

But given how much had changed, I think I knew the truth right away.

No. No, no, no. My Aunt Myra doesnt have any. children. I trailed off.

Not any that has been in the outside world, she went on.

I had vertigo. The puzzle pieces of my life had fallen out and would never fit together, ever. Everything was wrong. 

I wanted to die then.

And I realized that that was the game. 

But maybe there could be a win. Maybe I could keep my cousin safe, and make my own death worthwhile. Just maybe, I could control some small part of what was happening.

I needed to act.

Lucy, I explained, Lucy, we have to do some hard things. But its for the best, I promise. You didnt hurt me when you could have, and that means something very special.

But I need you to give me the knife now.

Her face changed. Her expression steeled, and I could tell that a lifetime of abuse had prepared her to endure hard things.

She stiffened. 

I crawled across the cage toward her. You can trust me. Please. Im your family, and you can trust family, right? 

I stopped in front of her. I must have been a sight  naked, dirty, covered in the blood of the dead man next to us. I bet I stank like shit.

I smiled. Give me the knife, little girl.

I lunged at her. Despite the struggle, I knew it would be for the best. I might be able to use the knife to free us both. But even if I saved her by offering my body for food, I figured I could die content. But I had to end it on my terms.

She would eventually come to understand that I needed the knife. Keeping her alive meant holding on to the idea that right and wrong meant something; Mom could never take that away.

Her body was so tiny and frail. Im sure that she was malnourished. I reached around and yanked the knife toward me fairly easily, but she held on. 

She whimpered. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I realized that she must have felt betrayed, and I knew how sad it must have been that she was able to trust me just a little bit and lost it.

Clearly, trust was in short supply with Lucy. But I would give it back. Eventually.

I snatched the blade toward me one more time and she yanked back. Her eyes opened wide with shock and she looked down.

The knife had slipped six inches into her torso.

I reasoned very quickly. Hope of medical coverage? Zero. Chance of survival without it? Zero. Amount of suffering she would endure even if I tried to help her? Incalculable.

The sooner this was resolved, the better.

Instead of pulling the knife back toward me, I pushed even deeper. Blood gushed from Lucys mouth, and she stared at me in shock.

I tried to say, Im sorry, but for some reason nothing came out. We just locked eyes with one another.

I pulled the knife all the way out, grabbed her hair, and slit her throat. 

That was an hour ago. I cant bring myself to eat her, at least not yet. But Gordons body is getting pretty foul already, so I know theres a time constraint.

Its part of the game. 



UPDATE: I dont get much internet time; it seems that my connection is intentionally being turned on and off at planned intervals. To clarify, Lucys death was an accident. I decided that I would give my life for her if I could, but that I needed to be in control of the situation. Clearly, I explained it here as poorly as I did to her. My brain is becoming quite addled. After the accidental stabbing, all of my plans fell apart. I knew that I had to put her out of her misery as soon as possible.

Im so sorry, Lucy.
