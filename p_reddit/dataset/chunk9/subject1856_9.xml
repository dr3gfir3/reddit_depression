	<TEXT> I second this, the cluster of state parks in Charleston are breathtaking. Pack a picnic and have lunch at one of their many overlooks, the views are postcard worthy. the beach houses in Brandon are also terrific and offer great views. The town itself is not as 'happenin' as Newport, but the views and atmosphere more than make up for it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all!

I won't be able to make it home to see family this year due to work. I will, however, have Christmas Day off and am looking for volunteering events around the city! Whether it be handing out toys or serving food, I'm game for anything. Does anyone know of anything like that happening on Christmas Day? Thanks in advance!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi there! I'm somewhat new to the area and am interested in finding places (preferably 2 hours or so of driving) where I can go clamming and crabbing. I've heard of a few places in Florence but wanted to see if Reddit has additional information.

Of course I'd love to come along with or bring along anyone into similar stuff so if you're interested, let me know! Thanks!


Edit: thanks guys and gals for the helpful tips. I greatly appreciate it :). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get my schedule a week at a time, but it is scheduled out 2 weeks out. There are alost always last minute emergency shifts that they text/call me about (they're totally optional and usually overtime though). If I have any preferences, I let the scheduler know. For example, I don't really care about getting Saturday's and Sunday's off since I don't have a spouse or kids to spend time with. But I do like having at least 2 days off in a row so I can go somewhere if I want to  and he's been really good with accommodating so far. Hope this helps!  </TEXT>
