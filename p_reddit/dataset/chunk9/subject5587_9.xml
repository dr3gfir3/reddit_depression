	<TEXT> I know others use GlusterFS on top of ZFS. I have not tested for this scenario myself, but don't let that hold you back.

From what I hear ZFS high-availability is hard to do just within ZFS due to split-brain issues. I'm unsure if this is fully solved. But one way to address this that I've seen is doing the GlusterFS or other clustered FS on top of ZFS, making it so you don't need to HA ZFS itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're going to operate at that scale, I would use FreeBSD for ZFS (myself prefer FreeNAS) due to the maturity compared to ZoL. With that size, if any bugs were to creep up, you could be in a real world of pain. ZFS on FreeBSD is way more mature than ZoL, so take that into consideration.

Also, you get a lot of tasty conveniences in FreeNAS that are still not exactly readily available in ZoL, like snapshotting, sync, and lots of other GUI stuff. You can do it in ZoL, but it's way more manual.

As for NFS vs iSCSI, I would recommend you use NFS as you will more efficiently manage your available space over larger-scale regards. It takes some explaining.

Otherwise, conceptually, ZFS is designed to be capable of spanning multiple shelves/racks, etc. </TEXT>

Things like the underground parking, the expansion areas. It's too bad the parking lights aren't exactly reliable last I checked, but when they figure that out, it'll be nice.

Chinook is a mall I actually like going to most of the time, not a lot of other malls I can say the same here in Calgary.

	<TEXT> Hmmm, the people I've helped move to Linux quite like Unity. I hope it continues to be an option.

Kind of a bummer that convergence isn't a priority any more :( But to be frank, how would I run all the apps I have come to rely on in Android, on Ubuntu? Are they actually easily usable on Ubuntu? If so, that solves a lot. If not, well... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that also depends on what level of IOPS you need, there's value to having more disks connected, and that is in the IOPS regard. With striped mirroring you can get very good redundancy, while also getting exceptional IOPS, but that takes more disks to get more storage. It's all up to the needs of the work.

That doesn't excuse the price fixing we're seeing though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the room the stuff is in is not visible to the outside, the only way someone could have known something was valuable in the space was prior knowledge. People don't just randomly break into rooms to steal specific high value items. Just because they could have taken the light houses, but didn't, doesn't mean they didn't know about it. Often thieves have to decide what's worth taking and what's not, and the light houses might have taken too much time to steal, making it too much of a risk.

But I don't know if the room was visible from the outside, etc. </TEXT>

As for MS Office, yeah that's not an industry standard, just popular. You're not going to change my mind on that one dude, no matter how much you say the same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only thing making this not the back is the fact that the PSU power plugs are not on this side. However, this is probably the modern front style from whomever design it. Since power plugs don't get re-seated as much as others do, it seems logical to swap the side they're on, but still have hot-swap PSUs. This design is quite fascinating because it breaks from the norm of having ALL the cables typically on one side.

In this configuration all the cables that are most likely to change, are on this side, which is presented as a convenient "front". The other side, with this design, you probably will NEVER disconnect the power cables themselves. With the way the PSUs are setup, they don't actually have the power plugs on them (so far as I can tell). This probably means then that the plug on the other side, connects directly to this, and then the PSU bridges the circuit to the internal PDU circuitry.

Although, as I continue to think about it, what I notice is I don't see any disks visible here. So this might throw my theory out the window all together! However, this could also be a diskless system. Perhaps it's high-density processing.

Either way, we need to go deeper. </TEXT>

The magnitude of the grounding issues alone to me screams fire or electrocution hazard. Again, if I'm going to be working on it, I would take zero risk in such a situation. I don't want some fire to start elsewhere while I'm fixing shit in another area.

	<TEXT> See, I fucking hate it too. It could either be them not knowing how to barter, or them just trying to use shitty tactics, but that doesn't actually matter.

Typically I hate it because it's wasting my time, and the reasoning behind why they say it is irrelevant, because my time is valuable.

So, what I do kind of depends on how valuable the item is, and how much I want to sell it. If it's a more valuable item, and I am more inclined to have it moved, I'll probably say something like "well how about you actually make me an offer?". But if it's something like a $20-$60 item, I'll probably just ignore them because the people asking these questions typically seem to be not worth my time in further "negotiating" anyways. So I just ignore them and go back to working on something actually productive.

Just because they say something, doesn't mean you have to respond. They're trying to get your attention, and if they suck at it, well they just fail at it. You don't have to let losers win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Remmina is just the client, and it can connect to a variety of protocols including RDP, VNC and I think a few others. By itself, it's not a solution for you, unless you already have the "server" end of it setup.

There's a bunch of ways you can do this, depending on your needs though, and I can't remember them all. If you want to use the RDP protocol there is a way to do it with xRDP (forget the exact name but there's a script to help you get it setup). But the most mature ways are VNC, X11 forwarding, or some variants of this (NX and other variants).

So... there's options, some are Linux-centric, some aren't. Best shop around. </TEXT>

Also, I'm on Vulkan now and I'm not really noticing any performance difference. I hit auto detect settings and it didn't change any recommended settings. On an i7-980x and GTX 960. I'm getting smooth play, 1920x1080, but most things are either "normal" or off. Should I try higher detail settings? Also, how can I turn on an FPS counter? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Okay so I'm working on an IBM x3620 M3 7376, and I flashed the BIOS to 1.17, except it keeps hanging on the second step of initialising drives and controllers. I want to flash back to 1.06, but the IMM won't let me do that until the "OS has finished loading".

I've swapped into the backup BIOS, and that's on 1.06, but I'm not seeing a way to flash the other BIOS in this state. I checked a manual for the system, but can't quite find a way to flash the 1.17 BIOS back to 1.06.

Anyone with keen ideas? Please share? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, sorry about the project x thing. We've had a lot of problems with them, and many people have confused them for us and it's become really tiring. I didn't mean to lash out at you like that. While your perspective on that event was that it was good, there have been many other problems their lack of quality has caused us, and I'm pretty fed up with them. So, again, I'm sorry, it's just caused me more grief than I'm okay with over the years.

Second, the reasoning behind this format is certainly a lot more than just what you've even more briefly outlined here. I just don't want to justify our decisions, at length, to every single person that inquires about them. That isn't really a productive task. Honestly, the ORIGINAL reason we (I) developed the format, way back when, was so that we could have more teams participating at a LAN that had capacity of 40 people. We were running 6's to start, and we saw that didn't result in a very good tournament or experience, due to the low number of teams that even _could_ participate. As such, I developed the 3v3 format initially to address that. Since then, we have refined it a lot of times, and found even more reasons to run with it.

Third, I hope you make it. That'd be cool, because the format is really fun. While you may have your concerns about it's viability in other areas, consider putting them aside and come have some fun? ;)

If you make it, I hope you have a blast. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a multitude of reasons, part of it is a blanket ban. While I know the cheating problem isn't as prevalent for TF2, we don't want to have any opportunity for that to change. Also, we have worked really hard to make sure "flawless" mice and other high quality peripherals are used, as we know it's a pain to use inferior gear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is our name Project X? No. We are LANified!, please read the actual branding used on the youtube page and video. I don't know why people keep thinking we are Project X, because we never have been.

In regards to the format, we actually have "dethrone" mechanisms in place to address rolling elements in the stage 1 facet. Should a team come in and then also steam roll the finals, then so what? At that point it's just like any other tournament. Competitive gaming sees similar elements in other games too, such as Seagull in Overtwatch, and countless examples of SKoreans coming to NA scenes for other games and wrecking face.

If you don't think it's fun, or sound, that's fine. That's just like... your opinion man. But we have used the format for the last two years at the Expo, in addition to the many years at LANs before that, and the proof's in the pudding. We have more people signing up for it at the expo than we can handle, and everyone says it's a blast. If it's working after 2 years, I'm confident when I say it's sound.

So... how about we all relax and consider that it _might_ actually be fun, hey? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reasons are many.

Firstly, the scope of it being implemented at the expo is due to limited commitment. The TF2 stuff will not have any advance registration for the tournament, as people at the expo will register day-of. This makes a team size of 3 much more feasible to actually be formed.

Secondly, we've already refined the format over the years of using it at our LANs on and off, so we know it works.

Thirdly, we've used it the last two years before this at the expo, so we know there is more demand than we can serve for it.

Fourthly, it's fun.

There's other reasons, but these are strong ones, and we see this format as serving the needs of the expo the best.

I cited eXtine here not just because of his reputation within the community, but because he is also familiar with the format. With people repeatedly blindly shutting down this format, it's helpful to be able to refer to someone respected in the community that actually has knowledge of this format. As such, he is a reputable second opinion on this topic. </TEXT>
