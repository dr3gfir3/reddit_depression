	<TITLE> Is there an existing compilation of Stephen King's works (or at least his most popular)? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I realise an all in one compilation of his entire career may be highly inefficient (considering the DT series alone has it's own set) but is there any sort of collection of his most famous works or something to that end? Looking to start collecting again and wouldn't mind being able to cut a few corners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, that's still the only time I think he's ever sounded truly angry. I was quite surprised when I saw those scenes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sort of love and cringe at Sora's super childish dialogue. Like really, Ansem put him and everyone he loves through absolute fuckery and the best way he can describe it is this.

Same with Namine, when she basically confesses to completely screwing up SDG's minds just so she could meet him. He's just like "i'm not happy you messed with my memories". BRUH. Like one floor ago she'd practically broken you as a person by this point </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played 6 hours of COM to see if I could learn to love it...I can't, so I figured just watch all the cutscenes and head straight for the days movie, how long could it take right? Nearly 7 hours later I wanna rip my hair out, just got to the damn credits...

Good thing I love the rest of the series. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did this same setup about a week ago. :) honestly by the last bar he was giving me so much hassle I just had to SR him to death, cheesing I know but totally worth it. Unknown was much easier in comparison, well done dude! ^_^

The only piece of advice I'll give (if you decide to fight him again haha) is take off combo plus and any finisher that's not blitz. The other finishers don't really affect him much, and If your combo ends at 3 hits, it puts him on a stagger and he won't revenge you mid attack.

But most importantly major kudos! </TEXT>
