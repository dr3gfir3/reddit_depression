	<TEXT> Haha yes and no. I live in an old rebuild hospital from 1880, they've made appartments in it 8 years ago and I have an appartment that's has a section of the old chapel. That's actually part of my living room.

	<TEXT> Worse graphics is completely in the eye of the beholder (also a very good game). Don't forget that Blizzard is a HUGE company and Griding Gear Games an Indie studio. 

Also, PoE really starts at around lvl 70-75. When you are playing a game beyond that gameplay matters more over graphics. 

You don't play a game to reach endgame and enjoy it more from there for the graphics, it's all about gameplay. And if it's not, then a ARPG is not a game you should play. Mind you, this is all my personal opinion </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People, come on! How can you honestly say D3 is better than PoE. Than you've never played PoE. I've playes both for more than 500 hours and believe me, there is NOTHING D3 beats PoE with. 

Just look at the amount of viewers on Twitch, D3 vs PoE. Grim Dawn is great for what it is. 

Also, PoE is 100% free. The only stuff you can buy is a bigger stash and cosmectic stuff. 

Also, in D3 they have to wait so freaking long to get the Necromancer (and PAY!!!). In the summer PoE is gonna get 6(!!) more acts added to the core game (so that's a total of 10 acts). FOR FREE!! </TEXT>
