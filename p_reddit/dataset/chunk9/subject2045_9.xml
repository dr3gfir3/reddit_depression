	<TEXT> One year almost exactly. I understand there is a calculator for this but I believe it's just a guide. Not law. 

The Globe and Mail reported that the amount isn't a simple calculation it can vary depending on how difficult it would be to get a job.

	<TITLE> Laid off in Ontario, Canada. Severance question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-19 15:54:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After a year of duty, my company shut down a number of offices and I have subsequently lost my position. 

They have offered a two week notice, two week severance package.

-Is that enough?
-What should I do next?
-There is an expired date on the initial severance contract (Friday) what does that mean for me if I don't sign?

Any other advice would be great. I know others in the industry have taken months to acquire a new position...
