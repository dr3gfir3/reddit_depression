	<TEXT> Yeah, but he doesn't use the Buckle Bomb as much anymore, nor does he attempt the Phoenix Splash as much as he used to. No more Top Con Hilo. And we all know the deal with The Curb Stomp.

It's weird because his moveset during his match at Summerslam 2015 with Cena was incredible and it's the most babyface he's ever looked. He was doing multiple dives, The Phoenix Splash, a standing shooting star press. It was incredible. I miss that Seth Rollins </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like your thinking. I can see a Braun rematch. Hell, maybe they can do some shenanigans with their first match where Braun beats him but his foot was under the rope so they restart the match or the other way around for Braun except they don't restart. Give a good reason for a rematch

I can also see Jeff being a contender due to the rumors posted a couple weeks ago. That would be awesome. Brock could throw around like a frisbee and Hardy would be **MASSIVELY** over like he is in any underdog situation. 

Another theory I have it one that I don't really have faith in its more of just wishful thinking is Angle. He's said that he's looking to get cleared so who is someone he could face where it would make sense? I think of either Brock or Triple H

I don't know why they would do that if he's going to be facing Roman come Mania next year. Same goes for Joe. I understand that the matches would be cool but Brock has no consistency to his character </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know, because I feel that they really want to use these next 11 months to do whatever they can to get heat off Roman and feeding him to Brock four months after he retired Taker would be exactly what fans want. He wouldn't get a single cheer. I don't know if that will be the case in New Orleans but at least it buys them more time. I think they're going to keep Roman and Brock as far apart as they can until then </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NO I don't. Her matches with Paige were very good. I mean, fuck. How long until that point had we seen Divas kick out of each other's finishers?! It wasn't no really dragged out because they got a good solid few months of her being a indecisive face between Punk and Bryan to being a RAW GM and some solid storyline with Cena and then she went on to have one of the most solid heel runs by a Diva at first valeting for Dolph and then her title reign. And there are tons of great promos besides her promos with the Bella's. Her promo with Kaitlyn was great during their contract signing. Her promos with Punk when he was heel were great. I can't believe you don't remember all her work with Bryan. It was gold

	<TEXT> Her promos leave a lot to be desired, but she's still the best of those 4  on the mic in my opinion and I've enjoyed watching her the most since they've all been called up. I understand that she's been given the most but still. Best ever? No but I see her potential and yes you're definitley right. A lot of that has to do with the way WWE books her, but oh well. I'm a fan </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sheamus was booked as dominant during his brief run in ECW.

	<TEXT> I'm blown away how he's going to most likely do another 4 weeks worth of segments with Ziggler until their probable match at Backlash. So that will be 2 months of promos from a guy who can't speak English very well and needs to establish his character with a larger audience. Not a good idea. And it's been 3 weeks of the same promo too. Dolph needs to lay him out one of these weeks or something to mix it up  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This] (https://www.netflix.com/title/80103395?s=i) is the business strategy it's emulating. It's not the fucking standard. I'm not arguing that. Kevin also did it for Keith's special and Amy will also be doing it for Rachel Feinstein in the future. I'm not defending it if that's what you think. I'm just explaining the benefits of it. I'm sure Normand is completely aware of that and has weighed the pros and the cons, and if he's not I'm sure his agent sat him down and explained to him that the name Amy Schumer means more in the public eye than Mark Normand. More eyes on the special means more money in everyone's pocket and Mark Normand could have a huge upside by the end of the year. Look at Lil' Rel </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought in with Guardians of the Galaxy and Jurassic World. But after seeing him in Passengers and Magnificent Seven and watching him be the fun loving goof on TV when he's on The Tonight Show or Good Morning America it just changed my opinion. Don't hate him but it's really evident nowadays that being likable trumps talent. He's not the only actor to get away with it  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As great as they are eventually they will get Big Fish-Small Pond syndrome in that they're more interesting than their division and it's no longer compelling and you want to see them break off and do more. Hell, if there's one thing that I could criticize Neville for (even though this isn't really a critique or even his fault) it's that. Especially because he's beaten everyone and has been given a lot more as far as character development goes. Sometimes I wonder if all he needed to rejuvenate his career was just a heel turn </TEXT>

Fucking faggots

I'm not above making fun of Big Jay for his style or his hair or his long-windedness but he's one of the funniest guys out there when he's on his A-game. Saw him live last year and he killed it. Really cool with fans. He bought me and the girl I was with drinks and stayed and hour and took pics with everyone  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These people on here are hilarious but can be fucking retarded in that they'll despise anything but will hate listen to 3 shows that they claim suck and say have been shit from the beginning, yet they hate on anything that's an alternative, funnier, and has a better batting average than OpieRaqio/Grandpa Afternoon Radio, Anthony Cumia/Sling Blade's Public Access Show, or J S. Any comic says something slightly liberal? They're labeled unfunny and called a fag and people on here pretend they were never funny (Louie, Burr, it goes on and on)

Legion of Skanks, Bonfire and CumTown aren't nearly as bad as people on here make them out to be, it's just the unspoken rule that it's the cool thing to hate on everything around here and shit on anything new brought to the table or with even the the slightest liberal agenda. It's getting old. Funny how people give Anthony and Jim shit for the exact same thing </TEXT>
