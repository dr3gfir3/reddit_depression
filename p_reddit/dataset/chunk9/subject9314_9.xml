It puts the claim back, but phrases it much better. It also makes it clear that the nukes of WW2 didn't actually contain that mass of TNT:

[The bomb's destructive power - it unleashes power equivalent to 11 tons of explosives - pales in comparison with the relatively small atomic bombs dropped on Japan at the end of the Second World, which had blasts equivalent to between 15,000 and 20,000 tonnes of TNT.](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/isis-mother-of-all-bombs-donald-trump-massive-ordnance-air-blast-afghanistan-a7684081.html)

	<TEXT> In the UK we have had free contraception for a very long time. It has certainly reduced family sizes, as have other changes such as reduced infant mortality and state pensions. (with welfare like pensions, you don't need as many kids to keep you in old age). Also it is culturally normal now for men and women to have children later, for career and financial reasons.

The number of large families, of five or more children is pretty small. They are mainly families with religious or cultural reasons for not using contraception.  I work in government stats so it's something I look at occasionally. The cost of them is not huge because they are few. (my source for this is me unfortunately - we haven't published this data)

Despite this the government has recently brought in measures to limit welfare payments to the first two children. As the average is something like 2.4 children this is quite draconian. It remains to be seen what effect it will have. However my bet is that the religious people will continue to have large families, and will live in greater relative poverty for that reason. Its not going to be good for those kids, or their effect on society later. [The Child Poverty Action Group have some stats on that.](http://cpag.org.uk/content/two-child-limit-universal-credit-200000-more-children-put-poverty)

Edit: Added a source.

	<TEXT>  First, the airline didnt use force.

Maybe the airport security are the culpable party here. In that case though I might have expected the CEO to just say it was nothing to do with United.

Second, when asked to leave private property and you refuse, you are then trespassing which doesnt make you " law-abiding"

He has paid to have that seat though hasn't he? One might draw an analogy with a tenant of a home. The landlord can't just tell them to leave and them beat them up for trespassing when they don't. I know this principle is derived from different legislation however.

You mean the people who are acting as agents of the OWNERS of the private property i.e. the plane? Of course they can tell you to get off.

Sure they can tell you to get off. The question is what is the limit of their power to remove a passenger who isn't doing anything wrong, other than sitting in their seat? Would the airline staff be justified in killing him? There is obviously a limit somewhere. I'd suggest it's before the point at which a 68-year old man has his face bloodied and requires hospital care.

Anyway a real court will decide at some point and us armchair lawyers can discuss it again then. </TEXT>

Assuming that the prices didn't recover, then eventually people would sell. They would either take less profit, or a loss in doing so.

We HAD a crash in 2008 and it sucked for everyone apart from those with enough money to buy near outright.

The problem with that though, was that credit was unavailable. The lenders might slow down, as you say, but they could not shut down all activity. They would put rates up, I suppose. There would be competition among lenders. </TEXT>

I think the relevant question here is whether the airline can use force to remove a law-abiding customer from its plane. I could see justification in a situation affecting the safety or comfort of other passengers. I think it's less clear that simple refusal  leave so that another can have the seat justifies use of force.

I don't think refusal to obey the crew can be a universal offense. Imagine if the crew ordered a passenger to do something dangerous or illegal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I read an article a few years ago about some researchers who tried to find what common beliefs are held between all groups that call themselves Christians and they couldn't find any. Christianity is a lot more diverse than most people think.

At what point though, is it appropriate to reclassify somebody as not a Christian? I know an enthusiastic Catholic who says she doesn't believe in sin or redemption or the resurrection, or transubstantiation, and expects to be reincarnated. 

The National Secular Society, and Richard Dawkins among others called for better questions in the 2011 census, so as to separate cultural affiliation from actual religious belief. We over-count theists of all types, and this leads to distorted polices and funding for schools etc.

	<TEXT> There was the Scottish Independence vote of 2014, though it might be argued that there was not a real risk, as the vote was safely for the union. 

I don't think any of the wars of the later 20th century put the UK at risk, and nor did the Suez crisis although that apparently dented the British Empire.

When Germany still had plans to invade us in WW2, so during the blitz and up to about 1941, but not really beyond were dangerous.

The 1921 war for independence in Ireland could potentially have taken all of Ireland (this risk now seems at its most elevated since then).

I don't think WW1 put the country at risk of invasion.

The campaigns of Napoleon III might have got to us eventually.

What else?

	<TEXT> French cooking is subtle. I do have to hand it to them.

However British food gets a bad rap. What we should be famous for is having the greatest range of international styles available.  The British foods are enjoying a renaissance too. It has a bad reputation as there was rationing from WW2 which only ended in 1955. In the post war years our food producers put so much effort into bulk production and shelf-life that taste took a serious hit. That is all finished now though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend of mine once poured petrol all over a 6ft tall already-lit bonfire to get it going. Everybody was drunk or stoned watching him do it. He seemed to take ages and saturated the pile with fuel while nothing happened.  A few small flames licked around the bottom but that's all.  It was just dawning on me that it was looking dangerous when WWHHOOUUFFFFF! 

Simon was inside the fireball. With idiot's luck he was ok bar singed hair and a burned finger. 

Then the fire went back down to a few licking flames again.

Having said that, trade regulation is a technical subject, so I don't think the general population should be expected to know about that. That's what we develop experts for.

Also, it was not a binding referendum, unlike the last Scottish independence vote. Parliament decided this was to be an advisory referendum. </TEXT>

We haven't had any riots yet, and its clear that many of the things the Leave side voted for are not going to be done, such as increasing the NHS budget by 350m per week.

In a less morally-sound empire the likes of Nigel Farage would be head-down in a landfill somewhere by now.

This is an argument against all parliamentary votes. You might as well scrap parliament and give the legislative power to the PM if that's the way you think. </TEXT>
