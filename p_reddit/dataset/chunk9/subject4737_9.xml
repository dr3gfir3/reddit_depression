	<TEXT>  2 . Scripture speaks of salvation as involving a destruction of the old Adamic self. 

St John Chrysostom wrote, referring to Psalm 1, in his "Instructions to Catechumens"

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*

*And speaking darkly of this crushing, and this mystic cleansing, the prophet of old said, "You shall dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel."*

	<TEXT> Just to give a few citations:

Saint Augustine (354-430 A.D.) discussed this question in his ["On The Literal Meaning of Genesis"](https://books.google.com.au/books?id=_s0kIgD0nCcC pg=PA92 dq=augustine+%22why+brute+beasts+inflict+injury%22 hl=en sa=X ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI9bXo9_PwxwIVguimCh1UJwPn#v=onepage q=augustine%20%22why%20brute%20beasts%20inflict%20injury%22 f=false), suggesting that predation is part of creation's intrinsic design:

*"But one might ask why brute beasts inflict injury on one another, for there is no sin in them for which this could be a punishment, and they cannot acquire any virtue by such a trial. The answer, of course, is that one animal is the nourishment of another. To wish that it were otherwise would not be reasonable. For all creatures, as long as they exist, have their own measure, number, and order. Rightly considered, they are all praiseworthy and all the changes that occur in them, even when one passes into another, are governed by a hidden plan that rules the beauty of the world and regulates each according to its kind."*

St Basil of Caesarea, (~329-379) in his [9th Homily on the Six Days](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/32019.htm), gives the anatomy of predators as an example of God's creative power, and I think he can be taken as implying that carnivory is a necessary aspect of these creature's lives:

*"If you examine the members even of animals, you will find that the Creator has given them nothing superfluous, that He has omitted nothing that is necessary. To carnivorous animals He has given pointed teeth which their nature requires for their support. Those that are only half furnished with teeth have received several distinct receptacles for their food."*

St Thomas Aquinas, (1225-1274) certainly no theological scrub, seems to have taken a similar view in his [Summa Theologica](http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/FP/FP096.html#FPQ96A1THEP1):

*"In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state* [i.e. prior to the Fall] *, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals. But this is quite unreasonable. For the nature of animals was not changed by man's sin, as if those whose nature now it is to devour the flesh of others, would then have lived on herbs, as the lion and falcon. Nor does Bede's gloss on Gn. 1:30, say that trees and herbs were given as food to all animals and birds, but to some. Thus there would have been a natural antipathy between some animals."*

So it seems that there were a number of prominent theologians who took the view that carnivory was initially present in creation, prior to the Fall. </TEXT>

My copy of the book is at home, and I'll look it up in the next couple of days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Historian of physics Helge Kragh, in his article "What's in a Name: History and Meanings of the Term Big Bang"  writes:

*It is possible that Gamow felt Hoyles big bang to be a pejorative phrase, but there is no documentation that either Gamow, Lematre or other protagonists of explosion cosmologies at the time felt offended by the term  or that they paid
attention to it at all. In any case, with the later success of the big bang theory it
became common to see Hoyles neologism as an attempt to make the idea of an
explosion universe, and Gamows version of it in particular, sound ridiculous. This is
not how Hoyle saw it. At the time he seems to have considered it just an apt but
innocent phrase for a theory he was opposed to, and he later insisted that he had not
thought of it in a derogatory sense. In an interview of 1989, Alan Lightman asked
him if he was really the source of the name. Hoyle answered 
"Well, I dont know whether thats correct, but nobody has challenged it, and I would
have thought that if it were incorrect somebody would have said so. I was constantly
striving over the radio  where I had no visual aids, nothing except the spoken word 
for visual images. And that seemed to be one way of distinguishing between the
steady-state and the explosive big bang. And so that was the language I used."*

*As a broadcaster Hoyle needed word pictures to get over technical and conceptual points, and big bang was one of them. When he had to explain the expansion of the
universe, he made extensive use of the inflating-balloon image that had first been introduced by Eddington in 1931 to illustrate a positively curved space with
increasing radius. Likewise, to illustrate the slow rate of matter creation in the
steady state theory, Hoyle appealed to pictures familiar to all Britons. In his first BBC
broadcast he explained that it would take about one billion years until a new atom
was created in a volume equal to a pint of milk bottle. And the
next year he said about the creation rate that it was no more than the creation of one
atom in the course of about a year in a volume equal to St. Pauls Cathedral
The standard view, to be found in numerous books and articles, is the one
reported in a popular book by Nobel laureate astrophysicist George Smoot and his
coauthor Keay Davidson. Hoyle had meant the term [big bang] to be derogatory,
they say, but it was so compelling, so stirring of the imagination, that it stuck, but
without the negative overtones. As we shall see, it
took twenty years until the term was seen as compelling and stirring of the
imagination.*

	<TEXT> On the subject of passagio, it's not really the ability to transition between notes per se.

There's a bit of mixed opinion among singers about different registers, but passagio refers to where the voice starts to shift into what's commonly called falsetto. For classical tenors, on challenge is being able to simultaneously prevent shifting into falsetto, and avoiding an "open" sound through the passagio and above. [See here for a brief demo of the "open" vs "covered" sound](https://youtu.be/uo6dDQiBGyI?t=44). For tenors, our passagio usually sits around E to F#. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  First, the expression "big bang" is STREET SLANG. It was introduced by Fred Hoyle on a radio show, as a sarcastic term that he didn't agree with.

As I recall, Simon Mitton in his biography "Fred Hoyle: A Life in Science" said that this is a myth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going OK, thanks. I'm not the best student, but funnily enough my best marks have been in the Evolution and Genetics units I've taken so far (76 and 82, from memory).

In terms of how it has influenced my views, one thing that comes to mind is that even at an undergraduate level, when you learn, you really start to learn how much you don't know. I guess I'm talking about getting a sense of the sheer scope of biology and just how deeply different issues can potentially be explored. 

I mean, to take an example that you would be readily familiar with, let's compare the incredible depth of learning and attention to detail that somebody like Joseph Felsenstein brings to bear in his comments on these issues, to Richard Dawkins' ["Behe is a fraud 'cos wolves change heaps"](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4rs07n/medicine_validates_evolutionary_mechanisms/d5fqt5o/) in his NYT review of TEoE. And you'll still see people citing the latter as some kind of "knock-down" refutation.

To be sure: this happens on all sides of the debate, there are only so many hours in the day, and I'm certainly guilty of not following up things myself. I guess as my learning grows in the future, I hope to bring a greater *depth* of analysis (Proverbs 25:2) to particular issues, rather than being a "generalist".  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seminarian: No.

Historian: I thought not. It's not a story the Monks would tell you. He's a heretical legend. Pelagius was an ascetic, so powerful in speech, wise and harsh in his practice. He could even use his methods to rid anyone of their passions... bringing about spiritual life. He had such knowledge of the holy life, he even taught that all men naturally had the grace in them to keep themselves from spiritually... dying.

Seminarian: He had a doctrine that taught people could actually... save themselves from spiritual death without God's grace?

Historian: The dark side of Church history is a pathway to many 
doctrines some consider to be unorthodox.

Seminarian: What happened to him?

Historian: He became so influential, that eventually he was condemned for lying about his true doctrines in order not to lose his power... which, eventually of course, he did. Unfortunately, Augustine knew everything he taught. Then condemned by the Council of Orange, his career was put to sleep. Ironic. His assumptions are unknowingly hailed in some traditions... but not he himself.

Seminarian: Is it possible to learn this doctrine?

Historian: Not from the orthodox. </TEXT>
