	<TEXT> ...Either because of the sound or their meaning, or another reason. Non-English words would obviously count also.

I love the sound of the words 'flotsam' and 'jetsam', and also 'ocean'. So, a lot of words related to the sea. 'Atmosphere' is also beautiful.

For its meaning, I love the word 'freedom'. I also love the word 'darou' or , a Japanese word roughly meaning 'probably'. I like the way the Japanese 'r' sound mixes into the lengthened 'oh' sound at the end.  </TEXT>
