	<TEXT> Perhaps in certain decisions, such as career and education you would need to consider other factors, but when it comes to things like hobbies, why wouldn't you do what makes you initially happy? What other criteria would you use? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't understand your view. Are you saying there's no point doing things that make you happy because they probably won't make you happy forever? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but using "literally" to intensify a statement which is figurative is different from using the word figurative. Even if what I am saying is figurative. Even if we accept that it is the incorrect use of the word "literally" (which I don't), we certainly DON'T mean "figuratively".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No one uses "literally" when they mean "figuratively". Saying "literally" intensifies the sentiment, whereas "figuratively" clarifies that you are not being literal, essentially doing the opposite. Hate this shit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to find AE Materials that you can use UNLIMITEDLY? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-08 18:37:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I find so much great stuff on VideoHive, things like templates, icons, effects etc. I use these for commercial work and I charge the cost of the license as an expense to the customer.

However, I really want to make a youtube channel that utilises some of these materials on a weekly basis. Where is a good place to find these kinds of materials for a one off payment for unlimited use, or even an annual subscription. I am willing to pay for the material, however as the youtube channel will be completely not for profit, I can't afford to shell out for licenses every video.

If anyone has any tips or links that could help me, that would be great. Thanks for your help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I die in 50 years time or so, why does what happens in hundreds or thousands of years time make any difference to me at all?

I got as much pleasure as I could from the world, and passed on the opportunity to some other people if that's what I wanted to do. Whether it lasts forever is completely irrelevant. 

The point is to create happiness in ourselves and others.  </TEXT>
