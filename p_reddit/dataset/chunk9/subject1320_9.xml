	<TEXT> Countless audio and videos are still be reviewed from the result of two investigations (with my home) this past Jan/February. Both US and UK teams descended on the house at different times.  The video below is of footage I had while the US team was in the home. They spent 3 weeks, living there.

	<TEXT> I'm in total agreement.  I'm just floored by it due to the fact of living and seeing this before my eyes for 4 years.  I've seen my desktop manipulated. My TV turned off and on, even turned off and on while unplugged.  What gets me though is the conversation. The deliberate conversation of " go lift one of these...."

	<DATE> 2016-09-29 20:05:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> April 2016 Steve and Don returned to the US(Bothell) and with them bought Nick Kyle of the SSPR.

The audio below is a snippet / (shortened so attention could be paid to the whisper EVPs) verse's the other noise and conversations.

Prior to the men's investigation that day. I setup voice recorders in both master bedroom and bathroom which is in the master bedroom or connected to it I should say. 

A series of trip wire, motion detect devices, cams and laser wire gear were going off in the bedroom. The room was sealed to prevent single person entry.  Once devices were setup the room was sealed. I have a remote CCTV cam in both rooms was able to hear and detect if and when the alarms would go off. They did. Several times.

Don had a theory about setting identical cams and etc. in the bathroom.  Up until now the bathroom was never really truly monitored. 

The audio below is of Don, Steve and Nick setting up devices in the bathroom.  The equipment being introduced is equipment never used. The audio was shortened of course to call attention to the voices. NONE OF WHICH CAN BE HEARD WITH THE NAKED EAR AT THE TIME THEY OCCURRED.


I'm very pleased that Soundcloud has a built in sound enhancement because the voices are clear. Especially after the 1st trip wire goes off (that Don and Steve are testing) at 1:10 motion detect goes off(that's us).

https://soundcloud.com/user-423872078/evp-image-detector

at 1:30 the entities begin talking to where you understand what they are saying. The 1st word one of them says is "Ray".


Vocals (something to the effect of)

"Ray,  Image Detector" 

"Cable" 

"its the only way it can be powered like that" 

"Go and Lift One of These" 
Allow me to put into context what it is they are saying and why.

There trying to guess what this new device is.  One refers to the other one as "Ray"  Very significant.

The word "cable" is mentioned which suggest there talking about the power cord. Some of the UK's devices and mine are battery powered. These devices in particular are not. They require power from the wall outlet. Which is in fact what Don and Steve were doing at the time this was happening.




Then one of them says "its the only way it can be powered like that" Which is why IT called Steve and Dons device a "image Detector"  I don't know about you but I've never heard of an image detector, neither has Steve or Don and both men would never utter that word.  The devices in the room(what Steve and Don were setting up, where Motion Detectors.) 




This might be a case of us and them splitting hairs as to what the device truly is.  Either way the fact that they are talking about it speaks volumes to their level of curiosity and intelligence. But they are not omnipotent when it comes to intelligence.  They have limits.  There revealing to you and me right now the limit to their knowledge.




Then comes the kicker of their conversation which is 

"Go and Lift One of These"  the one doing most of the talking is telling Ray to "go lift one of these"

In short he's telling Ray to go steal one.  Which suggest they want one to study, to analyze and to take elsewhere.  Where?  Your guess is as good as mine.

When I began my effort in 20014. Summer of 2014 to try to capture these guys. To try to obtain evidence  on video , on audio. The devices I used. many of them went missing. I'd place one down in the hallway or etc., walk away from it.  Come back that camera or etc. is either gone, turned around, turned upside down, or in some cases smashed to bits.  Some cameras are still missing. Some hard drives are missing. Some voice recorders are missing.  We have been able to determine that activity be it voice or physical phenomenon spikes when new devices, new technology is introduced into the test environment.


The only thing surpassing their feats and tricks is the level of curiosity these spirits posses.

I dont know about you, but I find this highly fascinating.  It deserves debate. It deserves conversation.  It is unbelievable.

Introduction.
During the latter part of August 2015 SEP were directly contacted by the client (Mr. Keith Linder) regarding reported disturbances taking place at his home in Bothell, Seattle, Washington USA. He claimed that paranor-mal disturbances had been taking place with increasing frequency and severity since moving into the property with his partner (Tina) in 2012. Pre-assessment of reported disturbances: Severity 6 of 10, Frequency 6 of 10. The client responded to a number of SEP email communications in regards witnessed and recorded paranor-mal disturbances. Though SEP do collate pre-investigation documentation, we cannot confirm pre-investigation incidents to be credible. However due to evidence obtained during active investigation stage 1 and 2, we have no reason to doubt the client at this time. Pre-investigation disturbances noted below have been considered authentic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> GREAT QUESTION:  It took me several years to catch up with some of the previous tenants in my house.  When I caught up with one she mentioned to me the problems they had.  Some of what we experienced they experienced: loud bangs, waking up finding every cabinet door open. Being locked out of the home, foot steps, shadows, pacing back n forth. Missing objects and thats about it.  The one thing different from her story than mine was the events she mentioned started a year after moving in the home.  She then went into detail about her abusive relationship , domestic violence coinciding with (and this is VERY IMPORTANT). a son less than 6 yrs at the time developing meningitis, her son also suffers from autism,  he became very ill n the home( my 666 office) at the time she became unemployed, domestic violence spiked. Both the violence and ill-son led her into alcoholism, she became very sick, retreated into the bottle, and felt trapped. She mentioned she felt repressed.  I believe and I admit this is my theory, but it no worse than the other theories, and some are compelling. I find this the most compelling of all in the sense that the horrors she mentioned to me, the condition of her son, and then the serious meningitis.  It grew dark, very dark in the home and she felt trapped.  She was unemployed, sick son, alcoholism and domestic abuse and I mean the worse kind of domestic abuse.  All that and more point to incendiary condition's.   Most Poltergeist cases point to children mainly female as being the cause agent. 10% of Poltergeist cases point to incendiary conditions which can led to enough negative energy being created: The condition itself creates the Poltergeist. The Poltergeist becomes the force that acts out the agents feelings.  That energy then gets trapped in the home. Takes over the home and will stay in the home for a considerate amount of time.  To extend its life it feeds of new energy. New house occupants.  Similar  cases show this will eventually fade out, only if enough time elapses between house occupants.  Which I'm here to tell you has not happened.  And here's were I contradict myself so forgive me but try to think deep about what it is Im saying.  The fact that this house for a period of time became no negative, became so dark . The energy became so thick, so concussion like, probably attracted other negative entities.  When it comes to malevolent spirits, opposite dont attract, alike entities attract one another. A house so negative, so vile, so ugly, so dark will attract other dark spirits.  Its like rats and roaches. One comes, they all come.  When you get down to it, thats what I think is wrong with this house.  Homes where a violent death took place have equal similarities. Same with a home were a major injustice was done.  Which one was done here. Im just not at liberty to share that detail.    When I finally got hold of the previous tenant, she didn't know me from atom. I asked her to describe her experience in that house. And her words not mine was "that house was a living hell."  I didn't know her from atom and I agreed with her 100%

	<TEXT> I can totally understand why someone would use the word "major claims". But lets be clear. Those are your words not mine.   One only has to study be it online, be in their local library, be it on Amazon the various books that document well the past cases of Poltergeist related activity. History is the best qualified to reward all research. In short look it up!  Compare my accounts with historic accounts.  Don't take it as gospel, or drink the Kool-aide as the saying goes.  But let your mind do the walking.  The similarities from continent to continent are profound.  Truth be told cases of burnt books, burnt bibles, wall markings, objects thrown have been recorded, reported and documented since 840 A.D.   More cases go unreported than are reported and rightfully so, look at the push back simply with this case.  No one wants to believe until they #1 see with their own eyes, which is basically what you're saying and #2 easy to label something a hoax just because they can't see it with their own eye's.    Instead of complaining what you cant see, which I would admit would be kick a$$ and cool.  But Poltergeist dont work like that. Instead drawn parallels to  alike events. Compare my testimony with the testimony of others, and by others I mean 800 A.D and beyond.  I admit I knew zilch about demons and Poltergeist before all of this happened. What I learned about demons I got from Sunday school. What I learned about Poltergeist I got from camp fires, and Hollywood movies. Which proves my point of un-learning what we think we know, we know zero.    It is very difficult to catch the "geist" in action.  Its almost like aiming a telescope up the random sky hoping to catch a Sun go Nova.  We know Suns do this, but we never know when its going to happen. We know lightening strikes. But who knows if and when one will happen let alone captured on film initiating mass destruction.  

The KPI's of my case are to a degree parallel to other cases.  There are elements of individualism. But for the most part there are similarities which has caused me to shun and laugh at those who say my claims are MAJOR. When compared to the 1000's of other cases, and yes there are 1000's of reported cases. These events are not major.  

We live in a really big world.  

Objects thrown
Spontaneous Fires
Wall Writings
Missing Objects
Items appearing
Rappings and more

are the tall tail signs of similar phenomena taking place.


Man has a lot of catch up if he's ever going to prove Ghosts are real.

Ghosts are real. Poltergeists are real but we're along way before there looked and accepted as being main stream.

There once was a time when man as a whole thought the world was flat and that was considered man stream.

Men use to think our world sat and existed on Turtles.

those relative terms and methods of thinking mean nothing to the grand scheme of things.

	<TEXT> I dont expect you believe anything. Several components must happen in order for you to day. Two I have no control over. The one I do have control is me sharing what I'm sharing.  If the written reports of others, witness accounts , previous tenants testimony, and clergy involvement dont sway you. Nothing will.  That's not why I'm here. I'm sharing an experience. You can either take it or let it alone. I do however welcome questions.  Since I believe thats why we're all here. To answer each others questions.  Ask away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Para I noticed you always revert back to the idea that with all this activity I should be providing you with something impressive. Truth be told I have. You're just too into Hollywood to believe it.   What I've shared with you is beyond impressive if you look at it as  a whole.   The crux of the matter is anything I show you ( what you define as impressive ) can still be faked. Can still be created with just the basic off Ebay movie software.  YouTube is littered with fake videos, and they have substantial hits as a result of doing that. U know why?  Because those individuals are satisfying your appetite for Hollywood visuals.  And lastly, you dont read or listen to well.  I've never seen the entity in my home write on the wall. Most of the time I've been at work. Sometimes we've been one room away. I've never seen a Bible ignite itself. I have seen one Bible on fire, but not catch fire if u understand the term correctly.  I have seen objects thrown as when I say thrown I mean I've seen an object fly in mid-air.  I've never seen an object launch, except for the plant by the entertainment center. Most Poltergeist phenomena happen out of site of the house occupant.  The Poltergeist is not in the interests of showing the home occupant how it does what it does.  The Poltergeist excels at doing most   (99% )of its mechanization out of site of camera and out of site of house occupant.  There are many theories as to why they do this. None of which you seem to be familiar with.  Even with a majority of the actions being done off camera or away from the house occupant, common sense can still prevail. One simply just needs to know the law of cause and effect and the law of gravity.  Objects cannot go airborne without the aide of energy.  E=MC^2 states that energy times mass are synonymous.  One needs the other in order to execute. I dont have the all the answers, so dont point fingers at me. One thing I do have is common sense. Heavy objects can't lift themselves and go airborne without the aide of something else.  That something else in my home, just happens to be paranormal.   

[As soon as you can show me video of the hovering spray paint can marking on your walls, or objects mysteriously levitating vertically, then flying horizontally across a room, we'll talk. Again, since you have cameras throughout the location, I'm certain that these videos must exist, right?]   

Your question just proves my point as to how you suffer greatly from not knowing anything about the paranormal.    I think Yoda said it best when Yoda told Luke. You must unlearn what you have learned. Dam dude didn't u ever watch the Matrix?  STOP THINKING SOME INVISIBLE HAND IS HOLDING UP A SPRAY CAN AND PAINTING WALLS.  That's kindergarten thinking.   

I have seen carpets in my carpet lay flat as most carpets do, go from the flat position to the being 100% rolled up position in a blink of an eye.  And I dont mean figuratively. I mean literally.  I once walked to my mail box and bought my mail home. 1) sat my mail on my computer desk upstairs 2) Leave my office and by the time I was at the landing stairway 3) those letters on my desk are now sitting on the mid-landing area.  These feats and actions speak to a level of Physics, a level of quantum tunneling, quantum physics which by mathematical equation alone is known to exists. STOP WITH THIS ADOLESCENT THINKING  that Caspar the friendly ghost is running around the house with a spray can.   The writings on the wall most likely happened in a blink of an eye.  The next time the Scientific American does a story on Parallel Universes I expect you to buy a membership.  You have much to learn dude.  Much too learn. </TEXT>

I wish u was but life doesn't work that way.  Are you adept to looking the devil in the eye and living to write about it?  What would your common sense tell you if you while watching TV saw a plant leave one table and fly across the room shattering into bits?  Would you deny your own eye's?  Your own common sense?  Would you say you had too much to drink that night?  Were you suffering from disillusion?  What would you do or say if you lived in a house where while sleeping your bed rose up off the ground?

Hmm let me see we've seen plants thrown, candles, thrown, a vase thrown, a cologne bottle thrown, a lamp thrown, an iron board thrown, a can of starch thrown. A chef knife thrown (that was scary).  Wall marking?  Multiple wall markings.  Multiple crosses drawn on the wall, the upside down man drawn on the wall, a 666 drawn, paw prints. "Die KL" drawn on the wall. Those are just for starters.  Lets talk about them. Pick your poison (subject)?  Give me what you got?   </TEXT>

It can only take snap shots of the images when motion is detected. I still have the original email and their attachments with the appropriate time stamps. One does themselves a disservice to scream shenanigans all the time.  Remember the Poltergeist, ghost, minion, spirit, demon or whatever wants you think that way.  It does things with an ounce of plausibility and an ounce of disbelief, as in this is all orchestrated and staged. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Summer 2014 House Attack - Foscam Email alerts. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-13 05:22:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Every now and then I comb through my video library aka video diary and see videos   pics I've uploaded that if combined tell a interesting story.  I had many Foscam cams setup in my house in 2014. Most were destroyed or just out right taken. 3 to 4 are still missing.  The Foscam has a motion alert, motion email notification. When the cam detects movement or sound it will send an email alert. A time stamp and snap shot comes with that email alert.  Video 1 shows the order of which events occurred that day in the kitchen.  Objects were moved around in the kitchen while no one was home.  These objects being moved are what I believe triggered the camera into action - of taking pictures and emailing me.  Follow and study how one chair disappears, only to return later in the office.

Video 2 was taken the same day.  I came home from work. I'm providing commentary about Video 1, which is the email, snap shot alert due to motion/sound detection.

	<TEXT> You do know "could" is not evidence.  The burden of proving something is matrixing is just as equal as proven something is paranormal.  Just because you say its matrixing doesn't make it so. 

I never heard of asking a question and the return answer ended up being the correct answer to the question asked.

I guess "Find Me" is matrixing as well

and 

"Three"

I think I've figured you out now.  In your mind the paranormal doesn't exist. It unreal.  In your view everything has a logical explanation to it whether we know it or not. Everything has a logical rational which means it fall's or exist within the confines of logic and science, but it not ghosts, its not the dead talking, its not demons, and its not Aunt Betty.

i love debating your kind as equal as I love debating the devout paranormal believer.

DAY ONE:  1st Bear Alarm goes off at 00:58 Goes off again at 1:03 Bear Alarm goes off a 3rd time at 3:34 4th time at 4:48.  5th time at 5:40 6th time at 5:54 Alarm goes off a 7th time at 6:13  8th time at 6:55 Bear alarm goes for a 9th and 10th time at 7:37 and continuous touch at  7:39.  11th time 14:14. then again at 14:22 12 times now.  13th time at 15:20.  14th time at 21:58.  Mic tap at 31:30 EVP at 34:07 "Keith" . Re-establishing baseline at 36:53.  DAY 3 TEST 3.  Bears goes off 1st time at  1:08:13  2nd time at 1:09:00 "Hey" EVP at 1:09:05  3rd time at 1:12:04. Mic tap 1:24:31.   Bears goes of a 4th  time at  1:37:08. DAY 4 TEST 4.  Bear Rings at  2:58:30. DAY 4 TEST 5. I'm ironing clothes, getting ready to go meet friends for dinner.  This Day 4 Test 5. 1st time at 3:43: 42. "KEITH" EVP at 3:54:03.Conclusion: The Bear Test was done for 5 days. There were 4 successful activation's (alarm going off) during the course of that time. Day 2 nothing happened. Day 5 nothing happened.  The number of times the alarm went off diminishes with each day.  The theory behind that is they simply got bored.  There numerous EVP's in this video. many I left out. I will list them later. Feel free to add them below in the comments section.  The "Keith" EVP at 3:54:03 is very noticeable.   My name is Keith BTW.  More tests, thought experiments are being done. I share what I catch.  If anyone doubt these claims as being real. PM me. I can make both teddy bears accessible.  The links below shed more light about this case.  The bed shakes, poking and prodding still continue while I sleep.   https://youtu.be/_xt7GiGhlrs  and http://www.coasttocoastam.com/pages/parapsychologists-declare-home-has-poltergeist </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ryuunken the "WHY" comes right after I say "Im about to put the hallway on lock-down."  A whisper says "WHY" Throw it in Audacity and you'll hear it clear as day.  Then comes "No" at 00:13 seconds.

Im not arguing with anyone. If u dont hear it, u dont hear it.  Others have. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> that's your ill-response to everything?  Someone substantiates our claims, the claims of previous tenants, conjurs up, falsifies  evidence  for book or movie deal?  Tell me the name of someone in this field, a name, a team, an organization that you believe to be 100% legit?  What source material do you support and agree with?  Careful how you answer that question?  That individual might already be reviewing the evidence of this case.  They might already be on team "Keith" I'd hate to disappoint you with their involvement.  The idea that truth is truth only because others want a movie deal or book deal is ludicrous and elementary.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If there's one thing I've learned since this began is the paranormal is vast.  Highly siloed and very closed in.  The left hand (of the paranormal community) doesn't talk to the right hand of the paranormal community.  The Zak Bagans of the community being of one those silos.

I talk to renowned individuals everyday.  Interesting enough the people I talk to, that talk to me don't view the paranormal community favorably.  So the feeling might be mutual.   But guess what the field in question doesn't belong to one group, one race of individuals.   Yu can't copy right the term paranormal.  I get contacted everyday by a lot of paranormal individuals.  I speak to other witnesses. Other researchers and other parapsychologists.  

Some (not all) not viewing me in a favorable way is more so a blessing. It tell's more about them than it does about me.

I'm just telling a story. A true story. Sharing evidence.  If that's the definition of being viewed unfavorably then history shows me to be in good company.

	<TEXT> EZ.  the truth is a relative term.  The "Why" is an EVP albeit a difficult one to hear, especially if you don't know what to you're listening for.  Especially if the EVP in question doesn't meet your definition of an EVP to begin with.  If I was to ask 5 people in the paranormal field their definition of an EVP i'd get 10 different answers. Lastly not everyone can hear the same EVP, even though its there. Many miss it on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th try.  One thing is true and this might be where your getting stuck at. There are many classes of EVP.  Some in the field dont like to call an EVP an EVP unless its a Class A EVP. I beg to differ.  We've compiled enough evidence, to show the quality of EVP rises with the amount of people in the room. Ex1 I'm a Mirror"  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uBte7PDEmTc vs "I Thought I Saw It" Ex2.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovIrMEZ-GiY

Ex3  Just me at home.
