	<TEXT> Just reading Whitman's article.

McCoy jumped to the right of Martinez and fired two fatal shots of 00-buckshot with his 12-gauge shotgun, hitting Whitman in the head, neck and left side.

Martinez threw down his now-empty revolver and grabbed McCoy's shotgun, running to Whitman's supine body and firing point blank into his upper left arm. Martinez threw the shotgun onto the deck and hurriedly left the scene, repeatedly shouting the words, "I got him."

Ramiro Martinez was initiallyand incorrectlycredited by the media as being the officer who killed Whitman.

Martinez is a dick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the fast reply.

* I've tried both automatic allocation, and defining an IP, default gateway and both Google and the router as a DNS server, with no change. Is there a way to configure a DHCP server address on the Windows side? The router has a page for it where I can reserve an IP address for a MAC address, but this does nothing when I try statically assigning the same IP on my machine.
* I've tried disabling and re-enabling the ethernet controller, but this also does nothing to change it.
* I'm on a home network that connects to a Virgin Media router. I'm using powerline adapters to connect to the box, which have been working fine previously and for 2 of the other wired connections in the house.

Thanks for your suggestions. Is there anything else you could recommend? I appreciate your help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

Been having a bit of an issue for the past week or so. My internet's been a bit sporadic, occasionally cutting out for 5 mins or so then coming back. Recently, these outages have been more like 2-5 hours, and nothing seems to resolve it. It's logged as an unidentified network, and is using a 'fake' ip (169.xxx...) instead of getting one from the DCHP server. When I try to contact using ipconfig /release and /renew, the DCHP server is unavailable. However, every other device on the network connects fine, and even with wireless my desktop can't connect. Any advice would be great.

System Specs:
MSI MS-7693 motherboard (970-A G46)
Ethernet Driver: Realtek PCIe Family Controller (version 8.1.510.2013)

Let me know if there's any other info you need - as far as I know it's fairly localised to my machine so I'd be surprised if there's anything wrong with the router.

Thanks!

	<TEXT> Correct me if I'm wrong, but the lower end versions of these machines ($599 and $699) appear to have PSUs that are too underpowered for the GPUs. The R9 270 requires a minimum 500W PSU, and the 750ti requires 300W, but the default one supplied is a 250W PSU.

Not sure if this is a mistake, but that would worry me. </TEXT>

I hate the taste. I don't abstain, I don't have a morality issue with it, I don't care about the health effects. When you start saying "Hey, let's get Groggle drunk tonight!" all I can think is that it would be like me force feeding you your least favourite food, and telling you "It'll be fun when you've had a bit". I don't. Like. Alcohol. And I will taste it in ANY drink you try on me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We went to see the Return of the King in the cinema. For those of you who have seen it, there's a sequence at the end of the film where there's lots of fade to black/white transitions between the Hobbits being picked up/being healed/going to the Grey Havens. After two or three of these, some guy had had enough, and when the next fade out happened, he just yelled at the top of his lungs "OH FOR FUCK'S SAKE!" </TEXT>
