	<TEXT> Perfectly handled! Well done for standing up to that kind of behaviour in the first place, and to do it in such a professional, respectful and non accusatory way is really very impressive. Kudos, I hope things improve after this conversation!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The issue with the analogy, and your interpretation of it is that women as 'locks' are the keepers of sexual activity and have to be 'opened' by being persuaded into having sex by men or 'keys'. You state that your understanding of the analogy is based on the relative 'difficulty' for men and women to engage in sexual acts. I think that this 'difficultly' you purport to be interested in is really a reflection of what you imagine male and female sexual roles should be. The key/lock only works if the average man is always looking for sex with as many partners as possible and the average woman is not so driven by sex and is instead always defending their virginity or monogamous relationship. If you take those gendered sexual roles as a given, the sure a cock is to a key as a pussy is to a lock. 
However, I'd argue that women's sexual desires have historically been routinely misrepresented, controlled and denied acknowledgment which have shaped cultural attitudes towards gendered sexual roles (and produced analogies such as this one). It's only relatively recently that science accepted that women could experience sexual pleasure! 

However, there is now more than ample evidence to show that women are just as much sexual beings as men, who enjoy, want and look for sex, and if you can accept that then this analogy makes no sense. Because as equally sexually interested partners suddenly the keys aren't trying to unlock those usually tricky locks who are so uptight and not driven by sex unless 'unlocked' by the right key which makes him so impressive if he manages to unlock a lot of them (maybe having a lot of sexual partners just isn't impressive for any gender!) And equally it's no longer slutty for a woman to have multiple partners because the gendered norm isn't that women don't really enjoy sex and therefore shouldn't seek it out.

	<TEXT> It's completely useless as a graph but I kind of like it, like it's so far removed from usability that it's almost abstract art.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep seems to be almost prohibitively expensive for small-scale soap makers in the U.K. Or Europe, you'd have to sell a lot of soap to be able to turn a profit if you're properly taking account of all the regulations - although possible silver lining of brexit is that they're all eu regulations ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These filled in area charts are awful, other than to deliberately obfuscate data why would you choose this over a a line graph?! </TEXT>
