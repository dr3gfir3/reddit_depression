	<TEXT> OP here my channel name is Roach the Human. There's a bunch of stuff there with me from different angles. Some of them have McJuggerNuggets comments on them I've noticed.

Edit: I'm also not here to spam I legit want to know... My GF and I are fighting about it. She thinks I look like him. I see it but... No one wants to think they look like someone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it all too well. They use children not just as roadside bombs, but they even use them as human decoys. You'd hear stories downrange about how children would be instructed to run into traffic in an attempt to avert convoys into IEDs. So either the kid is successful and the convoy along with the child is obliterated or they don't see the kid (HMMWVs have terrible blind spots) and the child is ran over. When people make this comparison between us and them and say dumb shit like, "the US bombs mosques all the time so it's fine!" It infuriates me. We are nothing like these guys. Not even the same damn league. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to go ahead and assume that not only do you not have any experience in the Middle East but you also probably have no military training whatsoever nor do you really understand the subtle nuances of battlefield etiquette. I'm not going to waste my time explaining to you how these conflicts have been fought half assed if you yourself can't see this after nearly 30 years of US involvement in the theater.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the religious building or hospital is being used as a hideout for the enemy, it is not operating in the capacity of sanctuary, therefore it is not protected under the LOAC. I can assure you the US never deliberately destroys mosques or hospitals unless Intel tells them otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to be clear - firing upon a religious building of any kind is strictly forbidden under our Law of Armed Conflict. It doesn't matter who trained who or who did what. The point is the enemy we have in our midst doesn't play fair or by the rules - I believe its time that we stop fighting this fight in the middle East with our mens hands tied behind their backs.

Edit: I'm aware if they are using the church/mosque/hospital as a base of operations, it can be attacked. I actually said that in another post below just minutes after posting this one. </TEXT>
