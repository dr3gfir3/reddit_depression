	<TEXT> tbf there's an awful lot to take from the CLIP (:p). i dont mean to make it come across that aldo has really bad head movement in general, cause that's not true. It's just that this specific video isn't a very good example of head movement regardless of the fighter or context and i think it's definitely important to distinguish between a just 'okay' technique and the good

I'd actually be interested to know if anyone disagrees and thinks this is a good example (it's not :P). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno, He'd better be careful with that head movement. He looked absolutely awesome in the Frankie fight at 200, but quicker doesn't necessarily mean better. 

Solely going off this clip (keeping in mind it's short af and realisitically hard to take anything from) it's nice to see him anticipating the strikes but i mean cmon, he bites on the feint which is something a more technical fighter (also one not sparring obviously) could land a quicker cross from, especially the way aldo just moves his head to the side rather than moving closer to the elbow. And then he slips the other way into the cross anyway which is like..not good :P It'd be nice to see him mix the head movement with his positioning as well, staying on the end of punches is a good way to get clipped, i like his pivot at the end though, that was nice :P 

at the end of the day, it's a short clip we can't tell much from, i'm sure he's done 100 different examples of the same thing all perfectly, but from this clip alone (and i mean just this clip alone), that wasn't a good example of someone with good head movement. Aldo is a beast for sure and he's shown godly head movement in the past, but unfortunatley this clip isn't that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had a similar experience but started at 3 and worked my way backwards. Purely by coincidence too somehow </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh i didnt even consider the CW's in the shakeup. That would actually be a really good idea! wow that would actually be a REALLY good idea (at least for the sake of the cruiserweights). Realistically though i can see WWE probably not doing this unfortunately which is a real shame. Who knows though i guess </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah this exactly, you could sorta reason it at first, but its gotten to the point where you're just cutting their legs from under them by continually separating wrestlers from CW guys. Not to mention the amount of awesome matches we're missing out on (which would really boost up both guys realistically) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah 100%. At first i guess you could kinda see it as a way to establish and make stand out the main stars of the CW division, but then they just did nothing with it, and its gotten to the point where you're totally right, they feel so disconnected from everything and everyone they could literally just not appear on Raw one night and you wouldn't even notice which is pretty lame </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah tbh this is definitely the likely scenario. I guess it gives the midcard of the CW division (is this a thing?) some depth. Would just be nice to see something come of it, especially with the long list of guys in line for a title already. The entire division seems to kind of just be dawdling around waiting for a match with Neville or Aries, so it would be nice if this feud led to a tag team or something kinda interesting away from the title i guess, give the other guys something to do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'd love to see Akira and Crews team up, i think that could only be good for both guys (especially Crews at the moment).

I am really hoping they quit it with the 'wrestlers' and the 'cruiserweight division' soon though, would open up a lot of interesting matches letting the cruiserweights match up against anyone like they used to have it, especially considering a lot top guys are pretty much technically cruiserweights, it seems silly to keep them separate  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah i guess this is probably the most realistic outcome tbh, would be nice to see something come of it though. I do wonder where Kendrick goes afterwards though, it's hard to see him do anything other than fade back down the ladder after this feud especially with all the guys in line now </TEXT>
