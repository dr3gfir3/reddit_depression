	<TEXT> I don't even know why I even bother writing on here as it's the same thing every damn day hahaha. CD29, STILL WTO. I'm pretty salty about it this time around since I managed to ovulate on CD22 last cycle. That's about it, will be seeking more medical answers pretty soon. 

At least I've got a nice weekend coming up, going to see John Mayer tomorrow night, woot!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly!! Since stopping HBC last August, my cycles were 106, 56 (O on CD41), and 37 (O on CD22), and now CD27 and still nothing. I know TTC sucks for everyone, and getting a BFN every month must be soul-crushing, but sometimes I just wish I could at least have a chance of getting pregnant each month, because ovulating twice in 8 months makes me both angry and hopeless.. -_- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but apart from 2 blood draws (the second for which I asked her to put more possible problems), everything is seemingly normal. My TSH at 3.7 in November and 3.9 in February worries me just a bit, but my doctor said it was still normal. Now she just told me that if this cycle isn't normal (clearly it's not looking good for that), that I should contact a private fertility clinic... :( kinda sucks because I feel a bit abandoned and have no idea what could be the problem.. </TEXT>

As for the LP, I totally get it. In the 2 times I've ovulated since August, my LP lasted 15 days, almost 16 (my period weirdly starts at like 10 pm). It just totally blows, especially when you've been waiting for so long to ovulate, then you need to wait even longer to get another shot when you know you're out :( Hang in there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry you feel that way, it gets really hard sometimes... I haven't had as many cycles as you but I'm going on 8 months with nada, and a month ago got diagnosed with depression and given a month off work. The doctor also suggested we might want to put TTC on hold for a few months, which I refused to do. However, my approach since then is I'll keep temping and tracking but I will not obsess, especially as this may mot be the best time to get pregnant while I'm not at the top of my game mentally. I figure that whatever happens, I have to trust in life and that it'll happen when it's meant to happen. If we miss the fertile window this month, it just means another month of being just us, drinking wine with a sushi supper, and other "fun" things like that... 

I wish you a BFP real soon but most of all I hope you feel better really soon :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thankful I had the guts to talk openly to my doctor about having a second month off work today. I'm feeling better than 4 weeks ago for sure but I'm really happy I get another 4 weeks to focus on myself and self-care and establishing healthy routines. Also SO for sticking with me, as well as my sister and close friends who have been so supportive. I haven't been as often on TFAB lately, but knowing all you peeps are here for support is great! I'm trying to take the more detached, less stressed approach to TTC, so keeping off TFAB for a bit is part of that, but I still love you guys :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's great :). My best friend is pregnant (on her first cycle trying, we started at the same time) and she's due in about 7 weeks... in the first months of her pregnancy I had all this sadness, grief and jealousy towards her (I'm not proud but it was so overwhelming) so I didn't really confide in her. Now I'm getting past that, and I'm learning to just open up and talk (about TTC but also about my emotions and stuff, depression diagnosis and all) and I've noticed it truly helps to open up, be honest and have people in your corner who really know what's going on. All my fears of judgement and feeling silly never came true, instead it just feels liberating. I'm glad to know you've got a great friend as well :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just want to chime in about going off BC! I'm another example of why you may want to stop BC in advance.  We stopped Bc in August and naively assumed I'd get right back to ovulating and get pregnant within a few months... well, it took 5 months before I ovulated even once!! Right now, I've ovulated twice in 7 months, so yes it can take time even though I wish you the best of luck :)

I've never managed to get a truly positive OPK, but the last 2 cycles I was getting close to a positive and BD'ed during that time, and sure enough, it coincided with the 1 day I had EWCM and a temp rise the next day. I get how you feel as peeing on 1-2 sticks every day for many days ain't fun, but for me it's 1 more sign to help pinpoint my O. Whatever you choose, good luck! </TEXT>

On the TTC front, I'm on CD 13 so I've started POAS every day, since I don't know when I will ovulate... It was on CD 22 last cycle, but my cycles have been getting shorter each cycle so far so I don't want to take any chances. 

To all the ladies where lots of snow has fallen, stay safe!! As for me, I'm looking forward to some nice powder skiing this weekend :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can just add another "Hell no" to all the good advice these 2 ladies have given. Yes it's scary, yes it sucks that some people might be inconvenienced if you get pregnant at the same time, but it's YOUR LIFE. ask any of the ladies who have been on here for more than 2-3 months, and I don't think any of them would tell you to wait. This process is hard and cruel and can take months/years. It's your life, and if having a baby is a life goal then I think the rest will work itself out. 

Good luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for this. I know I'm probably over-reacting about the meds and know that plenty of women take antidepressants while TTC/pregnant and their babies are just fine. I just didn't think that was going to be me, and somehow that is a big adjustment that I will continue to think about.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, thank you for all the advice and insight! I know that the list of potential side effects is always scary, but somehow it's just hit me hard this time. I'm giving myself a month to see if I'll get better without meds but will consider in 4 weeks according to my situation then. My doctor felt that TTC was another added source of stress and did mention that I was trying to do a lot all at once (which I kind of agree), but honestly for me right now, stopping TTC completely would be more stressful than just keeping at it in a non-obsessive way. Honestly the first 4 months of TTC were the hardest, but now I've just resigned myself that it will probably take a while and that it'll happen when it'll happen, but I can't bring myself to prevent it for a few months. Thanks for sharing your story, I wish you the best </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the advice. I definitely will consider meds if I am not better in 4 weeks time with therapy, rest and self-care and reflection on what I want. Wellbutrin has been mentioned in a few comments, so I'll look into that. As for Celexa preventing you from orgasming, I've never been able to orgasm anyway so it wouldn't change much for me lol -_- but it would be disastrous if it lowered my (already low) libido </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for that, I was doing too much all at once, but that's how I've always rolled. I guess it just caught up to me when the things I was doing were all things I didn't really enjoy. I'm trying to see how I can move away from this and not fall right back in that same trap... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for all this... I've been trying to answer everyone's questions and thank them for the support, so I may be repeating some things. 

We decided to keep TTC, but without obsessing, because I can't stand the thought of completely putting TTC on hold. 

I do plan on getting outside and doing things I'd left aside, like reading for pleasure, regular yoga, drawing, and I'd like to pick up my guitar again (haven't touched it in over a year). I also need to decide what I want to do about my work vs. School situation and would like to work part-time until I finish my Master's (hopefully this summer), but for now I'm just trying to go with the flow and trying to find out what I really want.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks Madge. I'm currently seeing my therapist weekly, no group sessions, I don't know how I'd feel about that. As for self-care, I guess I'm learning how to do that as well, as my whole life had just been a series of to-do lists and activities and juggling a thousand projects. Definitely long walks outside with my dog, taking the time to just do nothing sometimes, reading all the books I've been meaning to, and taking the time for more yoga and meditation are definitely things I want to do. Small home projects also make me happy when I do them, so will be looking into that  

SO and I decided to continue TTC but without obsessing. The thought of putting a hold on it is worse for me than just continuing to temp and know what's going on with my body, with the expectation that it probably will still take a few months. If it happens it happens and I know I will be happy and will have a big positive to focus on, and if it doesn't happen then I'll just have more time to take care of myself and feel better. Either way I can't stand putting a definite hold on TTC. We'll see how it all goes... thank you for your kind words </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My therapist does mostly humanist existential (not sure I translated that 100% right as it is in French), but she is also trained on CBT. I think we were doing a mix of both, but I'll read up on CBT based on the numerous suggestions on here and will see if I can ask her to go more toward that approach. Thank you for your kind words </TEXT>
