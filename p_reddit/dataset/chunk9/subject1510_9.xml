	<TEXT> Thanks Close-the-gate! 

I really wanted to show that the guy had a strong will to help his family, and to survive. But, if your up against something like that it often isn't enough. One often has no defense against a massive organized attack. Hollywood movies so often have unrealistic heroes that single handedly take down massive enemies. 

I think it can make people feel they have no significance unless they are some big shot. But, the cumulative power of many is so much more important in the real world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glad you liked it anonasd! Good question. and one I have been thinking about continuously for the last few years. Doing a kickstarter for each episode would be insane. There are a few options. 

There was  a lot of interest from some major studios that loved the short. But ultimately decided not to fund it as it didn't fit well enough into one of their marketing categories. There was also interest from smaller and online studios. But so far they have been flaky or unprofessional. But still, the more episodes do well the more likely someone could decided to back the rest. I don't love this option because so far my experience trying to get studio backing has been bad. But were someone to approach me that wanted to produce it and it turned out it was a good fit that would be great. 

Another option is, if I can get the 1st 3 or 4 episodes done and they do really well, to put the others on the new Vimeo pay option. For as little as possible. Like 25 cents an episode or $1 per year subscription. If I had gotten just 1.2 cents per view it would have funded episode 2. youtube pays very poorly. 

It is certain that I can't make the whole thing without some other kind of funding. I am already working too much and going broke trying to get it off the ground.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, there were parts of it I liked a lot. I do think it could have been told a lot better in a 10 min short film. We didn't need to see him take a shower or fumble around in real time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So all you need is headphones. If you have them. cheap or not doesn't matter. Not sure the zoom on its own captures real 3D, it does bin aural, which is similar. 

Also, in case it was unclear, the stuff in the kickstarter video has 3D sound. The original short doesn't. Although I will be remixing it in 3D soon.  </TEXT>
