	<TEXT> I think it does make a real difference to home owners, though. Prices have stopped skyrocketing in vancouver, and the same will happen in Toronto.

I agree that it is sort of whack-a-mole, but Canada doesn't have that many large cities that would attract that investment.

If Toronto is brought on board, it could very well become provincial or federal law.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The competitive reports in Crowdbabble are great for benchmarking. You can stack different brands against each other, and see the leader in different areas on social - audience, engagement rate, etc - as well as the industry averages. 

Getting accurate averages in your vertical is really helpful in creating goals for agencies. If no one in your vertical achieved 20% follower growth last year, for example, you can communicate that to clients who are asking you to double their followers. 

Crowdbable is also great for stripping out bullshit that other agencies have done in the past. They do ghost follower analysis, generating a list of the bots who follow any account. Ghost followers do boost your total audience size, but they can wreck things like engagement rate and conversion rate.  </TEXT>

Otherwise, their expectations around follower growth rate and impressions will probably impossible to meet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, this is really tricky for people on a strict budget because in a democracy everyone needs access to the news. On the one hand, if news organizations charged $0, the ads would have to be crazy to support investigative journalism - like video ads before every story, ads all over every page, ads in the middle of stories. On the other hand, if news organizations charge too much, they cut out people who need and deserve access to news. People on a low budget shouldn't have to just be stuck with the headlines only or crappy free news sites. 

It's like movies and music. Once people understood the value of having unlimited streaming, they were willing to pay for Spotify and Netflix. News might just take a while to catch up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the argument is that by inflating the population of Canada so much, we're building an economy based on artificial growth. The population of Toronto rises 150,000 every year - it's pretty devastating for the environment, for traffic, for subway congestion, pollution, and tearing up farm land to replace it with exurbs. Toronto will stretch all the way to Barrie soon. One of the main drivers of the Ontario economy, agriculture, will be gone. Ontario's debt has continued to skyrocket and there's no money for new infrastructure - like another subway line - so the arguments about creating meaningful growth by just increasing the population don't work. 

This impacts home prices because they'll continue to skyrocket as long as the government inflates them up with high numbers of new immigrants. They're using immigrants to artificially prop up the economy and housing prices, without any sort of long term plan.

This isn't against immigrants on an individual, personal level. Multiculturalism is a huge part of Canada's identity and I think it makes the country stronger. The choice to increase Canada's population so dramatically, over and above making up for the declining birth rate, isn't great for Canada in the short or long term. You can still have lots of immigrants and refugees at more responsible levels, without using them to prop up the economy in such a poorly thought out way.

	<TEXT> I suggest the same procedure that's followed for other cases, like you're saying - looking into it properly. 

If my house gets robbed and I go to the police, they go and examine  the scene, look for witnesses of the crime and start an investigation. 

If I get assaulted and I go to the police, they decide based on meeting me whether or not to investigate or go to the scene of the crime. Even if I remember witnesses taking photos of the event, the police won't look for witnesses and they won't go to the scene of the crime before making their founded/unfounded decision (from Ava's story). 

It seems like, from the article, cases of sexual assault are treated very differently from other types of assault or other crimes. Not even a cursory investigation is conducted. If they interview the accused and the accused say they didn't do it, then the charges are dropped - this doesn't happen for any other type of crime.  </TEXT>
