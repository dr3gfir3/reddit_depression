	<TEXT>   Although the White House claims that it fired Comey over his handling of the investigation into Hillary Clintons emails, the presidents letter to Comey didnt mention that investigation, instead mentioning the probe into Trumps ties with Russia. Even there, the language of the letter  particularly the part where Trump writes that I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation.  strongly suggests that the goal here was for the president to exonerate himself. </TEXT>
