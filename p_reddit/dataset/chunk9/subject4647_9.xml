Furthermore trump is the rallying cry. People lose interest if you go too complex. They are angry right now at trump, you turn the attention away from trump you lose the audience. You keep it about trump and slowly feed them redpills.  

And I would tell you if I made money. There is no rule against doing that. The truth is if I was doing that you wouldn't be able to tell because it would be spread over many accounts.  You would never ask any of the bots because they would all seem normal.   </TEXT>

Secondly trump is just the trigger. He is a symptom of a bigger problem. In the past people never bothered to really look at our system but thanks to trump they are now. I view trump as a positive he is the cause of the downfall of the whole rotten system.  

The real question is how did things get so bad that trump could win.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find this to be incorrect 

I don't know many Republicans that are literally *everyone but me*. Rather it is they have a skewed view of America due to propaganda where they see 2 groups. *god fearing hard working honest (white) people* and then *lazy degenerate who want their support but hate them (brown/atheist/hippies/gays*. The irony is the creative classes in cities support these poor rural white folks but they are low information and think that minorities and gay anarchist are living in SF mansions off their minimum wage work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it is time to celebrate. Not only did we win this round but this is acknowledgement by conservatives that government spending on science and such is good. They only care about these when they are not in power. Now that they have full power they literally support Obama's agenda 100%. Progress won and Reaganism  died, killed by republicans. Conservatives have given up with their insane policy. They let smart people make the policy now, although they pretend to be against it when they aren't in power. When they are in power they capitulate to us and admit we were right. They carry forward our policies.  </TEXT>
