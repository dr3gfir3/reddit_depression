	<TEXT> Pardon the million comments that are meaningless you're getting. In all honesty the coffee here is great. There's something for every taste. Last I checked there's something like a thousand coffee shops in the city. So if you're into coffee come check us out. My favorites in particular are Barista, which has coffee from a bunch of roasters, Ristretto if you're into espresso, Stumptown is the classic and is worth trying but is not the best, and Hearts is great if you're into pretentious stuff.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With spoiler season upon us, I've been thinking. Be careful about assumptions that certain strategies are trash and others are great. I've been playing a midrange demonlock that was posted a little while ago and I reached a higher rank in two weeks than I did in a month of playing aggro shaman before. 

Consider the fact that we, as a community, didn't really "discover" Finja water decks until late in the MSoG meta. 

All I'm saying is, try out new decks and ideas and see what works. Don't get caught up in what's meta. It limits what we can find as a community.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sort of. I kind of hate that name but yeah. 

The idea is that our culture has been absorbed by a misinterpretation of postmodernism that is mostly just about being as jaded and emotion-less as possible. Wallace's work, as well as many other contemporary authors and other artists, intentionally rebels against that with literary style and plot that is built on sincerity and emotional honesty. 

There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the heart of it.  </TEXT>
