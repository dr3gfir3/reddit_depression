I was recently looking at some of the data collected in the GSS and came across their question on attitudes towards premarital sex. I was interested in how Americans feelings about this have change over time so I used the GSS Explorer website to download the data they have on the subject. Once I had the data, I used Tableau to create the visualization.  </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau


I gathered the data for this tool from the Census Bureaus geography data that provided data on the total land area of each of the congressional districts. I then used Excel to clean the data and Tableau to visualize it. Since there have been changes to congressional districts boundaries in 4 states since the last population estimates were put out, I went ahead and built the visualization on the premise that the population of all the congressional districts are the same even though there are some differences. Since this is the case, the percentage of the population estimate should be treated as a rough, but decent estimate of the population. </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau

To create this visualization I used data published by the American Community Survey, a product of the US Census Bureau. I utilized the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample. The data can be found on the ACS Website. Once I had the data, I used Tableau to visualize the data. I grouped the Wages variable into the groups I wanted, formatted it, and published the visualization on Tableau Public.

It is worth pointing out that two major variables we are missing are length of time working at a job or in your field and a variable for the occupation of these workers. The ACS doesnt capture information about how long someone has worked in a given field. It would have been nice to have added the occupational data, but there a hundreds of occupation codes and we decided that was too daunting of a task to incorporate here, but hope to do so in the future.

Creating a perfect analysis of this would be nearly impossible, but for the most part, this data visualization seems to support the findings that on average women make less than men. You have to interpret these results based on the limitations we mentioned though.

I have moved a lot and the reasons for moving are very interesting to me so I created this visualization to get a better idea of why people move. I got this data from a tabulation done by the U.S. Census Bureau using Current Population Survey data. Once I had the data in a usable form I used Tableau to create the visualization. </TEXT>

We wanted to create a visualization showing how members of Congress voted on the recent bill that repeals FCC Internet privacy protections. To do that we took roll call vote data from Congress.gov.

	<TEXT> Its not quite an even split any more. The most recent estimate from the Census has it at about [80% urban - 20% rural.](http://www.citylab.com/housing/2012/03/us-urban-population-what-does-urban-really-mean/1589/)

This data is 5 years later than the 2010 Census, is only people 25 and older, and the NBER methodology might be slightly different so I was okay with the proportion being around a 85 -15 split. </TEXT>

I wanted to create a visualization that showed how educational attainment compared between rural and urban areas. To gather the data for this visualization, I utilized the Census Bureaus API to create a custom table for myself. I decided to use the ACS 5 Year Estimates for 2011-2015 so I could get data on all counties since rural counties usually have small populations. I used the html address below to pull the data. You will need a free API Key to pull data from their site.

http://api.census.gov/data/2015/acs5/profile?get=NAME,DP02_0058E,DP02_0059E,DP02_0060E,DP02_0061E,DP02_0062E,DP02_0063E,DP02_0064E,DP02_0065E for=county:* key=

I then needed to come up with a measure of what is a urban and rural county. I decided to use a crosswalk the NBER has for putting counties into the metro areas that they are assigned. The documentation for this table states that blank entries for metro areas can be considered to be rural so that is what I used for my measure.

Once I had the data in a usable form, I used Tableau to create the visualization. If you would like to alter or adjust the visualization, you can download the workbook using the toolbar below the visualization. </TEXT>

Tool: Tableau 

Last year, I created a graphic showing the number of Americans married last year by age using data published by the American Community Survey. Since then, new data has been published for the Census Bureau so I updated my initial visualization.

I used the 2015 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample to create this visualization. The data can be found on the ACS Website. I then utilized Tableau to visualize the data. This newer version allows you to break down the results by the number of times someone is married. You can look at the proportions of that total
