	<TEXT> I dated a woman who would do that. Thankfully, she was often willing to share. I swear to God, there's nothing better than being forced to lay supine as she wiggles her toes over your face, forcing you lift your head and back off the ground in an attempt to get her foot in your mouth.

It's worth the effort, though. If you're lucky, you'll catch her big toe between your teeth and bite, gently of course, but hard enough so she knows you mean business. You can suck the toe into your mouth, manipulate it with your tongue, and trace its nail along your gum line.

This woman I mentioned knew I was fond of what she grew between her toes and at the bottom of her foot. It wasn't a crust, but more of a flaky, fungal colony. It took some time to scrape it off, but my efforts were rewarded when the mycological gift settled on my tongue and dissolved in my saliva. In a two hour session, she could fill my mouth entirely.

On my birthday, she let me kiss her while it was still stuffed between my cheeks and gums. She sucked it out, then we snowballed the contents back and forth for a good ten minutes while she pinched the head of my penis with a ferocity I never knew she had in her, but I enjoyed it immensely. But yeah, this reminded me of that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sprouts </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-21 23:13:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My sunflower seeds started talking to me last month. I couldnt believe it; Id been lonely for such a long time. It felt good to have friends. I bet it was my mom who asked them to keep me company. I miss her terribly.

The clearest memory I have of Mom was when she told me that all the beauty in the world grows from something small. I was helping her in the garden, and wed just planted sunflowers. My favorite. A couple days later, she showed me the tiny, burgeoning sprouts that would eventually become the towering, yellow flowers I loved so much. She repeated what she told me about beauty. I remember being amazed. Id wake up every morning and head outside and check their progress. Each time, they were a little bit bigger.

Then there was an accident. A bad one.

After that, I didnt have a mom anymore.

Dad and I scattered her ashes in the garden right when the sunflowers were at their most radiant.

It took years for me to realize how much Moms death had affected me. I just thought I was a sad person in general, since Id known the feeling for so long. It didnt cross my mind that Id been traumatized and might need help beyond basic counseling. By the time I considered it, I was pretty far gone.

The sunflower seeds started talking at an important time for me. Id lost all hope of being happy again. Dad and I didnt speak. I had no friends. I spent all my time alone in my bedroom, wishing I was anywhere else. Anyone else.

Id developed a bad habit of using a pushpin to make small cuts and punctures in my arms and legs. They made me feel just a little bit better, but I still cried whenever I did it. On that special day, after a particularly painful cut, I heard the chorus of small voices coming from the table:

Dont be sad.

I jumped. I was alone in the house. Dad was working his first shift and still had another one to go. He wouldnt be home for another 14 hours. Again:

Dont be sad. Its a beautiful day outside!

A small package of sunflower seeds sat on the surface of my desk. They were a snack Id bought on the last day of school. Id eaten a handful that afternoon and forgotten about them. Theyd been sitting there for a week.

I wiped my eyes and stood over the desk. Inside the plastic, I could see all the sunflower seeds standing up.

Hi Rachel!

I jumped again. The seeds wiggled in their bag, almost like they were waving. Confused curiosity overcame my alarm. I assumed I was going crazy. Sunflower seeds dont talk to sane people. But they were talking to me. There was something comforting about them, too. Something familiar. I felt a wave of bittersweet nostalgia.

The sting of the cut on my upper arm brought me back to reality. It was about as deep as the pushpin was long. A thin rivulet of blood drooled down to my elbow. It was so ugly.

Almost on cue with the thought, the sunflower seeds began to comfort me.

Oh Rachel, its not ugly. It was just a mistake!

Dont worry - it will heal and youll forget all about it!

Their kind words were in stark contrast to the wound. Its edges were puffy and red, making it look angry. And it hurt. A lot. I didnt know how something so small could be so hideous. From the desk below, the seeds continued their praise and support.

Amid the voices and my own considerable confusion and discomfort, an old memory resurfaced - one Id kept below the surface for over ten years.

All the beauty in the world grows from something small.

The sentence echoed within my mind, bouncing and twirling and floating, as I considered its meaning and implications . The sunflower seeds watched my contemplation in silence. A minute later, I knew. I reached to pick one up as the rest of them burst into cheers of joy. I inspected the seed for a moment, then pushed it into the puncture as far as it would go.

A sensation of blissful contentment unlike anything Id ever experienced suffused through me. My eyes closed. Behind my eyelids, I was four years old again. Mom stood in front of me, beautiful and tall in her shorts and tank top and gardening gloves. Her smile shone down as she spoke her poignant, memorable words, and pointed her gloved fingers at the barely-visible sprouts pushing out of nourishing soil.

I lifted my eyelids to the sight of a plain, gray seed poking from the raised edges of my puncture wound like an engorged tick. Before I could tell myself how ugly it was, I stopped. I remembered what Mom said. The seeds on the desk cheered louder.

Two long, summer days went by. I spoke to the seeds and they spoke back. We made plans together. We talked about the future. Id covered the one in my arm with a piece of gauze. On the morning of the third day, the seeds asked me to take off the bandage. I did with trepidation, which turned out to be entirely misplaced. Inside the swollen, wrinkled edges of the puncture, a tiny, fragile sprout lay curled. When the light from the room hit the sprout, it slowly stood. It was indescribably beautiful.

Feeling better than Id ever felt, I stabbed the pin into myself over and over and over. Arms, legs, belly, shoulders. The only tears I shed were ones of happiness. I planted each seed with diligence and care. Days went by.

The hundred-or-so holes in me grew wider as the seeds sprouted and grew. I sat on my bed in front of the window to make sure they got enough sun. I heard Dad come and go from his jobs, leaving food for me without ever knocking or saying hello. I was grateful; I didnt want to be bothered.

Seed-sized holes became fingertip-sized holes. Fingertip-sized holes became quarter-sized holes. They all leaked, and none smelled particularly good. I remembered how Mom had used fertilizer in the garden that smelled terrible. It was always worth it.

I stopped keeping track of the days and only concentrated on the sprouts. They were all healthy and growing. All but one near my navel. It had turned brown and was wilting. The other sprouts told me it couldnt be saved. Id have to remove it or else theyd all get sick.

I started the process of pulling the foot-long plant out of my abdomen. I felt and heard ripping sounds as the roots were torn from within. The pain was immense. When it was all done, there was a shallow hole in my belly the size of my palm. It was streaked with white and yellow paste that smelled terrible. I spent some time wiping it away. Afterward, all the sprouts thanked me.

Another long period passed by. Maybe a month. I woke up today to the first blossom on one of the sprouts. It was the tallest of them all, sticking out almost three feet from my shoulder. All the days leading up to this, I felt excitement. Today, though, Im too weak to feel anything.

It took almost an hour for me to get out of bed. I looked at myself in the mirror. I was home to nearly 80 healthy plants, all between one and three feet tall. Root systems under my skin ran in complex patterns, bringing nourishment to the heavy, healthy sunflower stalks. We had a long conversation as I sat, barely able to eat the breakfast Dad had left for me. We came to an agreement.

Im using the last bit of energy I have to write this. When Im done, Ive agreed to go out and sleep in the garden. I cant believe I spent years feeling sad. Feeling ugly. Feeling like I didnt have a purpose. Even though Mom died when I was young, shed told me all I needed to know in one, perfect sentence.

Now Im going to go out and sleep in the same soil she used to bring beauty in the world. The soil where shes slept for the last ten years. I get to be with her again, and the world gets a new crop of sunflowers. Beautiful things that grow from something small. Just like [me](http://unsettlingstories.com).

	<TEXT> My buddy learned that the hard way. The hooker's name was Marissa; we should've known it'd be trouble just from spelling her name backward. Well, my buddy's really into oral sex so he started licking in and around, fairly confident in Marissa's cleanliness. One thing led to another and he told her to sit on his face. He was going to town and lickin' and lappin'. Everyone was having a great time.

Until he wasn't. Marissa was brought to orgasm. When an orgasm happens, there's a lot of muscle contraction and relaxation in the pelvic area. It turned out Marissa had been with a bunch guys earlier in the day and they'd, well, finished up in the other spot. One particularly strong muscle spasm later and he was cleaning the leavings of nine guys and the detritus from last night's taco salad from his forehead.

Anyway, yeah.

	<TEXT> I just want to be clear that I have no sexual attraction to ducks whatsoever. 

That said, if I had to fuck a duck, I would absolutely choose to fuck a Mandarin duck. They're so beautiful and pure. I bet they would be gentle, kind lovers who cared more about my pleasure than their own. It's honestly vulgar to call what we'd do "fucking," because it sounds too raw. Too primal. No, we would make love. Our act would be one of beauty and sweetness; enjoying one another in silence broken only by gentle sighs and whispered, joy-filled quacks.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I just learned the horrible, impossible truth about a drug called adrenochrome. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-03 18:21:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Please help.

Someone close to me may be connected to the disappearance and murder of countless children; most of them refugees or otherwise disadvantaged - all untraceable. All forgettable. And now, all dead. 

He told me about a drug called adrenochrome that could produce a high beyond any other. And unlike those other drugs, there are no ill effects. Quite the contrary; there are substantial benefits from consuming it: greater health, increased vivacity, and a host of other, smaller effects. Combine those with an intense sense of euphoria and you have a substantial demand.

The issue is this: it is a derivative of the chemicals produced by the human body when it is under intense, immeasurable fear.

My former friend, who confessed his involvement during a fleeting crisis of conscience, insisted this was true and cited a number of dubious-looking studies and fake news sites. But then there were the photos.

He didnt allow me to make copies for fear of implicating himself personally, but hed been to a farm, he called it, in one of the Baltic states. There were photos of countless people, all seemingly under the age of 15. They were naked and chained to tables and walls and floors in a windowless room the size of a football stadium. I couldnt estimate how many there were.

As he scrolled through the photographs and I debated killing him, I saw masked men hovering over the victims and torturing them. As they were being tortured, their blood was being drained into containers.

Other photos showed the production facilities - enormous rooms that looked like chemistry labs where the blood was filtered and the compounds were extracted.

The worst, though, were the mass graves.

Men stood around them and laughed as they unloaded truckloads of carcasses into pits. They used pitchforks to gather up anyone who had been left behind. 

I asked him why he was allowed to take these pictures. He said no one would believe it was happening. And hes been right.

Rumors about facilities like this have been around for decades. Journalists have tried to report on it, only to be laughed out of their editors offices. One journalist, a Swede, came the closest to bringing it into the mainstream. He died, along with his family, in a hideous house fire.

Listen to me: the pictures I saw were not faked. They were not staged. They were, without any doubt, real.

And theres one more thing. One more picture. Believe it if you want, I dont care. I need to get this off my chest.

There was an image of adrenochrome users. 

I dont know what I expected. Well, I guess I do: strung out, gaunt, miserable-looking addicts with despair and desperation in their eyes. Its what weve all associated with drug users thanks to heroin and crack and whatnot.

This was different.

The image was of a lavish conference room in a skyscraper. Where, I could not determine. Syringes of the drug were sitting on gilded plates on a thick table of polished wood. 

I recognized the faces sitting around that table.

World leaders. Entertainers. Religious icons. All grinning. All happy. All ready for their injection.

Seeing those familiar faces was the initial shock. It wasnt the final one.

On the far side of the table, almost too small to be seen but still unmistakable, was an iconic head of state. A recent one. He was laughing as he reached for his syringe, but there was something unusual about his hand. It wasnt its normal, small, pink self. It was green. 

It was webbed.

It was clawed.
