	<TEXT> I agree with you, I just do not think mandating pay scale is the answer...not that I have one to offer. 

I would personally love to see our tax dollars going to training people on basic office job skills, manual skills like masonry or on soft skills like negotiation...this way if someone wants to make more we are arming them with the appropriate skill set.

Like I said I may not have the answer but mandating pay scales can have some serious negative effects like reduced hours or complete replacement with touch screens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree, increasing the standard deduction could be huge for people who currently cannot take advantage of itemized deduction. 

The 15% corporate tax rate has more nuance. From what I have seen it will include a reduction in loop holes, so some industries will end up paying more than they do now, and others will pay less. Then you need to factor in any growth in the economy with more money swirling in people's hands which will be spent and increase more small business and corporate growth, leading to more tax revenue. 

Comparing the 15% rate to the current rate without nuance it absolutely means our government will bring in less money but these changes do not happen in a vacuum. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would argue it is ignorant to label people as climate denier's...what specifically qualifies someone for this label?

Creationist's as following their faith, so I would not call it ignorant...maybe misguided?

Trump looks like a competent President because he is following through on his promises and is also adjusting to the situation at hand when necessary. He has hosted people from all sides of the political spectrum, including those who heavily criticized him. He hasn't been President long enough to categorize him as either a success or a failure. This is always going to be a divisive question because there are people who adamantly despise him, people who adamantly support him, and people in the middle who are not ideologically locked in and will judge his performance on facts rather than feelings.

The biggest problem I see is, so long as people are willing to discount their fellow citizens opinions as ignorant simply because they disagree we will not be able to have a substantive conversation. I find it to be gross when someone tries to cast them selves as better than others because of a different political opinion, like you comment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is no possible spin on this- https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2015/nov/26/donald-trump-appears-to-mock-disabled-reporter-video

This is a great example of him being taken out of context.

Firstly, the reporter does not move around like that, in any way.

Secondly, he did the same motions to mock non disabled people...during the same speech. Ted Cruz and a General. Go watch the whole thing and see why is this a perfect example of out of context maligning. Anne Coulter wrote up a whole thing about it and if I can find it I will add. 

When viewed outside of the 30 second clip he does in fact mock many people in the same way, then go and watch an interview of the journalist and see how this mocking has nothing to do with the reporter's actual disability.

I check some of the others later in the day.

	<TEXT> It could be people are disgusted. I find that 'they' often misrepresent what was said or done. I also think that there was a concerted effort to support HRC during the campaign and maybe Trump's election was a reflection on how little influence some major media companies have in our evolving society. 

There certainly were 'journalists' exposed in Wikileaks that were int he tank for Clinton, and I am sure they are personally pissed about the Trump win.

It also could be people who are in media positions who personally are disgusted with Trump who let their personal opinions infiltrate 'news' reporting. 

I have found people who admit their bias when reporting often give more honest reflections(or their reflections are more easily measured against their bias). Ben Shapiro is a good example; Ben did not support Trump during the election and was very open about it, however when he reacted to something Trump related he gave an honest accounting. His running segment Good Trump/Bad Trump is a great example of this. 

So I am not totally sure, it also could be a ratings thing. Sensationalized reporting probably gets better ratings.


*Side Note: Shapiro recently seems convinced Trump is going to betray conservatives and be a big government President. I recommend his show for everyone no matter their leanings. He often criticizes right leaners by saying they wouldn't support something Trump does if Obama had done it.*

I mean NYT even tried to make a negative out of the Patriots visit. So I never expected a honeymoon because there are so many journalists who seem personally offended that Trump won. 

But, I see him as doing a good job so far and I would guess that over time more and more people will begin to agree.

	<TEXT> ... but the same thing can be said for every world leader, corporation, shoot I would even make the case it is better for the American Citizens. When you hyper focus on Russia and make it all about Putin ignoring the fact that there are so many other people, countries and companies in the world then sure it seems like he is helping Putin. 

If you apply perspective i think there is a very different story. I can be swayed by evidence but the article is citing things that haven't happened but they suspect it will happen. 

Stuff like Tillerson having a good relationship with Putin is good for us, we shouldn't discount Tillerson's years of experience dealing with foreign leaders and negotiating with them just because in that process he developed a positive relationship with Putin. 

So they article is designed to frame things in a way that looks like Russia will be on easy street because of Trump but does little to actually prove it. This is not evidence it is some guys opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Do you accept that Russian intelligence ran an unusual and substantial campaign to influence the election?

I accept that it is totally probable. I would like our government to examine the DNC server, which to my knowledge they have not and have been basing conclusions off of Crowdstrike's analysis. 

As for the internet trolling, I could totally see Russia doing this. Shoot we have American groups doing it. This unfortunately is a big part of the internet and any narrative. Look at this very sub, ShareBlue is a an organization born of Correct the Record who spent the campaign using internet users to push a narrative. If anything we should expect this from foreign governments, political groups, corporations and anyone else with a message they want to push. 

The RT part of the Russian campaign of influence is almost undeniable because it is Russian state television. But what I come back to with this over and over is that often times what was being discussed or pushed was straight from Wikileaks which has been proven to be accurate. So the influence was around factual items from the Clinton team. There may have been fake news pushed by internet trolls, but again that is not exclusive to Russia. 

An example of something I have seen people describe as a Russian narrative which I think is inaccurate is the Clinton health stuff. That was not a Russian narrative, it was people drawing conclusions based on real world events. Her fainting in 2012 and being out of pocket for 6 months, the constant coughing, and the infamous 9/11 fainting. 

I am concerned that Russia influence has become an overarching excuse for things that often times it is not applicable to.


So long story short, i can accept it but I will not accept it as an excuse for Clinton's loss or as something wholly Russian. And, not that you are saying it is, it is not part of the same conversation as Trump /Russian collusion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He by no means holds exclusive rights to dishonesty, but I can understand where you are coming from.

It's interesting because I am not surprised by revelations someone like Page spoke to Russians given his past. I also find it interesting that things like Trump meeting the Russian ambassador during the summer being reported without context that there were several ambassadors present. 

I have found much of the Russian narrative to be all story and little substance. I do not think it is wise to have it be considered criminal for people to meet with or speak with Russians, especially when so many people beyond the Trump team do it.

I honestly believe there is nothing there with the Trump/Russia narrative but I am open to changing my mind if anything beyond circumstantial evidence of conversations comes up. Where I find I am most conflicted is when someone like Mukasey (ex Bush AG)says that even if there is an email from Trump to Putin asking him to dig up dirt on Clinton it would not be illegal. So if that evidence surfaces and no charges are brought, it is still a really shitty thing to do. (I do not consider the press conference when Trump said if Russia had it to release the missing emails as this because that quote has been misrepresented for months).

In the end the narrative does not stand up to context, from my view. I can understand why people do not like Trump which you outline your perspective on, but I do not think this investigation will provide you reprieve from that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, which is why when i replied i said i re-read and corrected it. Then i quoted me correcting myself again in reply to you. But, since you need me to explicitly say it; I was inaccurate in my statement , "At the very least we know know that the FBI did not have evidence beyond what is in the public sphere to justify their FISA request." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could see an instance where the Obama admin wanted to abuse their power to spy on an opponent. There is no evidence proving it so it is just a theory. But if they used the dossier, or used the fact that Page spoke with Russians(which he worked in Russia and it would have been impossible for him not to) to spy on the Trump team there could be political motivation. 

Then you add in all the leaking, which is clearly political, and it starts to make more sense. Again this is just a theory not backed by definitive evidence. Just like the Trump/Russia theory. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you are misrepresenting what i said to be honest. I said I wonder what else they used as justification, implying I do not know and would like to know. 

I don't think it is. Although, as I commented somewhere else, re-reading the story I see it says it was used as part of the justification. So there may be something else used, but we do not know what that something is.
We also know that Clapper said there was no evidence of collusion, so I am interested to what else was used. This is why I hope Page does sue so maybe we can find out.

How do you get your comment from what I said?

I can point you to people saying there is no evidence, if you would like? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may be right, I need to go back and see what exactly the dossier was claiming about Page...unless you know it offhand. I do know he worked in Russia so finding connections between Page and Russia is not so crazy. I think the question is if he was promising concessions in exchange for something?

At the very least we know know that the FBI did not have evidence beyond what is in the public sphere to justify their FISA request. What I am most interested in is what, if any, evidence exists of any potential collusion that we do not know about? I had previously thought there was something to justify the FISA outside of public knowledge.

I have been leaning on the Clapper interview a lot lately, because it is the highest person who would have knowledge of the investigation, not associated with Trump, and he said there was no evidence of collusion. 

If there was nothing beyond the dossier, it is looking like the spying really could have been politically motivated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Page has also disputed any wrongdoing and says there was nothing illegal in his interactions with Russian officials. He blames former Obama administration officials for pushing the Russia allegations.
"I look forward to the Privacy Act of 1974 lawsuit that I plan to file in response to the civil rights violations by Obama administration appointees last year," Page said in a statement to CNN. "The discovery process will be of great value to the United States, as our nation hears testimony from them under oath, and we receive disclosure of the documents which show what exactly was done in 2016."

I hope he does sue, because he's right the discovery would be amazing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's odd is that there were numerous news outlets who could not verify the claims. This could be make or break for the investigation because if it turns out they used the dossier knowing it was false then we are going to be having a very different conversation.

If they can verify claims from the dossier, it appears it would be the claims against Carter Page, which he denies and is threatening a lawsuit over.

This may come to a head soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well we have seen some major concessions from China in the past month so I would say he didn't have to, but we still are getting benefit. 

China had said they were not going to accept NK coal, but still were until Xi met with Trump. They then turned the ships back and ordered more American coal. 

China is now going to be accepting US Beef imports which have been banned for 13 years.

China is taking a hard stance with NK based on our President's request.

So why would he go and insult them, now that we are getting concessions? I know many users in this sub never saw an insult they didn't like, but this is a good thing and demonstrates the strength of our President's diplomacy.

	<TEXT> Schiff said there was nothing definitive and he knows way more than both of us. Clapper, despite your claims that I am making things up, was the DNI during said investigation, he would absolutely know more than you or I and he said there is no evidence. 

Why are you being so dismissive of Clapper, why would he not know? I am not making up that he was the DNI, and as to why he would know what was being collected on the Trump team here is a list of the DNI's responsibilities:

Serve as head of the sixteen-member United States Intelligence Community,
Direct and oversee the National Intelligence Program; and
Serve as an advisor, upon invitation, to the President and his executive offices of the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council about intelligence matters related to national security;
On July 30, 2008, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13470,[1] amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the DNI's role.[2] Further, by Presidential Policy Directive 19 signed by Barack Obama in October 2012, the DNI was given overall responsibility for Intelligence Community whistleblowing and source protection.
