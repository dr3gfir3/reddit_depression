Beans 

2 cups dried pinto beans
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 TB chicken bullion 

1.  Soak beans in a large bowl over night or 8 hours.  Add plenty of water because the beans expand a little.  

2.  Drain water and rinse beans.  

3.  In a large stockpot add remaining ingredients with about 2 quarts of water.  

4.  Simmer for around 4-5 hours until beans are tender.  Add water throughout if it gets too dry.  

5.  Mash beans to the right consistency you want.  I use an immersion blender and it works perfectly.  Season with salt to taste.

	<TEXT> Cajun chicken pasta just sounds better than Pasta with Chicken and Cajun Seasoning.  Was probably named that as a description to what's in the dish as opposed to deeming it an authentic creation.

Don't take it personally.  The word Cajun is used much like "Buffalo".  Anything with buffalo wing sauce and chicken is now a Buffalo Chicken pizza, or Buffalo dip.  Does not mean it's authentic to anything from Buffalo, NY (where Buffalo wings were invented).  "Cajun" in most cases is used as a descriptor of the flavor profile.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a home cook for awhile and rice has been the HARDEST thing to "get right".  

EDIT:  Sorry it took so long.  I'll add the recipe for my beans too.  

RICE

3 TB vegetable oil
1 cup long-grain rice (jasmine works well too)
2 TB tomato bullion
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/2 cup mixed frozen vegetables (frozencanned)

1.  On medium heat, fry rice in oil for several minutes.  Use a nonstick skillet.  Stir constantly, do not let it sit idle.  Each grain will turn opaque and white.  

2.  Just before the rice starts to get slightly browned, add water (about 2 cups) with tomato bullion and onion powder.  

3.  Cover with lid and simmer on low heat.  Do not lift lid.  

4.  Once rice has absorbed all water, add frozen vegetables and mix.  

5.  At this point you have to go by the "feel" of it.  If it isn't cooked all the way (mine never is), I add a bit more water, mix it, and then keep the heat on low for 3-7 minutes and turn off heat.  Do not lift lid.  Steaming it with the lid on will make the rice fluffy.



BEANS

2 cups dried pinto beans
2 cloves garlic
1/2 tsp onion powder
2 TB chicken bullion 

1.  Soak beans in a large bowl over night or 8 hours.  Add plenty of water because the beans expand a little.  

2.  Drain water and rinse beans.  

3.  In a large stockpot add remaining ingredients with about 2 quarts of water.  

4.  Simmer for around 4-5 hours until beans are tender.  Add water throughout if it gets too dry.  

5.  Mash beans to the right consistency you want.  I use an immersion blender and it works perfectly.  Season with salt to taste.

	<TEXT> Pretty close, mister.  

I repurposed leftover grilled chicken for this recipe.  The grilled flavor really enhanced the dish.

1 lb. pasta (any shape)
1-2 lbs. cooked boneless chicken, cut into pieces
1 red bell pepper, julienned 
1/2 cup parmesan cheese, shredded
1 pint heavy cream
2 TB cajun seasoning (blackening works well too)
1 tsp granulated garlic 
1 tsp. olive oil
1/4 tsp. pepper
1/4 tsp. salt

1.  In a pan, heat chicken with bell pepper, cajun seasoning and oil for 1-2 minutes.  Browned bits are good.

2.  Add heavy cream and rest of seasonings.  Stir lowly until slightly thickened.  Add already cooked pasta and make sure everything is well coated.  

3.  Add Parmesan.  Turn off heat.  Garnish with parsley.  

EDIT:  

Not claiming it's authentic.  I got a this recipe from a friend and this is just the name he had for it.  As a Hispanic, people always label unauthentic recipes as "Mexican".  I don't care because it's really just a description or hint of what the flavor profiles and ingredients may be.  One time I shared my own grandmother's recipes only for it to be called non-authentic, so you really can't please everybody.  </TEXT>
