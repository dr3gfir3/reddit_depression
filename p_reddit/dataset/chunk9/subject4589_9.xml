	<TEXT> Ok I have to out myself as a doubting Thomas. I've accepted that God exists in my spiritual journey, I've accepted major social teachings from the bible, I go to church and try to meet with the local priest every week, I've accepted the necessity of the figure of Christ so that man can live in the image of God and I do indeed try to address Jesus when I'm praying. I *want* to believe but in the deepest part of my heart I can't bring myself to accept miracles at face value. I'm probably with [Zizek](https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t rct=j q= esrc=s source=video cd=1 cad=rja uact=8 ved=0ahUKEwjC75uljpjTAhWKCcAKHeApAb4QtwIIGjAA url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtABnznhzdIY usg=AFQjCNHgmUJTKp9hLk54sw3T3tlQ_DVywA sig2=Jmq2JG8SJZYu5evxCLeGLw) at the moment in believing that, Christ stopped believing in the Father on the cross and the people that 'saw' Jesus during the resurrection merely experienced some kind of intense hallucinatory fidelity to truth-event of the crucifixion. I know that faith isn't something I can intellectualize but without being convinced that Jesus literally rose from the dead my prayers just don't work. Any help would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd compare it to a set of competencies - there's no single way to show you're a 'team player' or you're 'courageous' or 'assertive' but these are pretty distinct traits even if the precise way they have are articulated is culturally influenced. Modern feminism seems to refuse to engage with the idea that such a thing a model for bare subjectivity exists - there is no such thing as a 'man', there are only 'black men', 'queer men', 'disabled men' and those subcategories can further be divided so that everyone simply exists in their individuation. This might make sense when you're defining a concept through language but it does not accord with real people's experience of being in the world. For this reason it's important that clear ideals are upheld and maintained - so that men/women/trans people have some kind of reference point when discussing how one should live life. By extension, this means that to say that some trans men might be incapable of a trait like courage would mean that we'd have to fall back on a strictly biological definition of gender.
It seems to me that women are able to maintain positive-sum relationships in a way that men aren't precisely because a feminine-ideal exists harmonious to social order which is constantly being curated through womens magazines, movies, instagram etc. A masculine ideal of this sort is desperately needed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. Gender is vital to self-conception and your experience of the world. If you don't believe me, ask any trans person how important 'passing' as their non-assigned gender is to them. The task is to construct a form of distinctly positive masculinity that puts typical virtues like courage, loyalty and leadership while deconstructing some of the more negative traits--allowing space for men to be vulnerable and talking about their experience of manhood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Under neoliberalism, we've witnessed a rise of what Tariq Ali calls the 'extreme centre' - massive cross-party convergence of over first principles political/economic issues. 'The left' (in as far as it's possible to put mass movements fighting for social justice together) has really been relegated to the role of the church in early modern societies ie a voice of moral authority in the public domain. Since the left is infinitely split and can't really agree over first principles (ie questions like 'is there such a thing as universal subjectivity?') it really does make sense to me for the Church to play a more active role in politics. I think the idea of 'wokeness' (ie being aware of insurmountable suffering in the world) is a key starting block to bringing the left and the church under the same banner but obviously there's a lot of points of divergence the left will have to work through.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That's not to say that Zizek has no applicability, I just don't think that the average person is what Zizek is writing to.

Are you kidding? Books like Beyond the Double blackmail are 150 pages, double spaced and extremely light on theory. Look at his public appearances and even his cultural references! He's clearly trying to make psychoanalysis and german idealism publicly accessible. To start philosophy by reading Greek texts seems plainly ridiculous to me. For me, I caught a few of Zizek's interviews then watched his lectures, read his articles, eventually his books - realised he was drawing from Lacan so picked up some Fink, took a class on Freud, Bought Ecrits, Read a few seminars that interested me, listened to a bunch of audiobooks on Hegel, took a general philosophy course and now I'm relatively confident that I understand the theoretical premise that Zizek is conveying through plastic terminology.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't done my research enough - and this could be a total extrapolation - but aren't "asian values" firmly tied to a vulgar materialist conception of reality in a way that is totally irreconcilable with a western emphasis on the transcendental? This was one of the main themes of Scorsese's *Silence*.  I'm sure I've read it in some theoretical texts before: I think Zizek genders 'western'and the 'eastern' subjectivity along Lacanian lines but the implication here is that autheoritarian capitalism will always remain an irreconcilable fantasy for liberal policy makers that would require a complete overhaul in the religio-social historical sense of subjectivity in the West. Correct me if I'm being ridiculous or orientalist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because Utopian ideals have also lead to terrible crimes and dystopias. All the biggest crimes were committed for "worthy" reasons. I'm not against a degree of idealism but it needs to acknowledge how and why things as they are.

Isn't our current political configuration a utopian ideal? If you look at the images about the future presented to us by advertising firms, silicon valley, political parties then we seem resolutely attached to the notion that things will only get better; when the reality is that we're fully aware how [we're heading for environmental crises.](https://www.lrb.co.uk/v39/n05/benjamin-kunkel/the-capitalocene)

You don't think there is a thing called British culture? I don't think it's possible to be a socially functioning person and not have a culture.

I don't think it's possible to isolate 'British' culture as unique. It's a bit tedious but I remember when people used to have posters that said "Being British is about driving a German car to an Irish pub for a Belgian beer, then traveling home, grabbing an Indian curry or a Turkish kebab on the way, to sit on Swedish furniture and watch American shows on a Japanese TV" before the internet and the form of hyper-globalisation we have now. 

 Which is a modern Western liberal notion, right?

Western, I'd even venture to say *Christian* but not specifically British.

 Do you mean if a British culture exists it is actually magically in everyone in the world? Where are you going with this?

I don't think that culture is oriented around an arbitrary conception of space confined to"the British Isles". Peter Sloterdijk compares it to a translucent dome where some people are inside (most of Europe, most of America, upper-middle classes in the developing world) and some people are outside (refugees, most of the global south, people in extreme poverty). It's possible to see the inside from the outside but we on the inside compartmentalise the outsiders imagine that fictional communities like borders are really what divide us.

	<TEXT>  That sounds a bit naive Utopian no?

Yes but what's wrong with trying to live up to utopian ideals? We've done so for most of our history.

 I just think we could emphasis materialism less. All this self made man idolatry seems like Ayn Rand myth making. Even a myth of self made culture. People come from a community not out of the ground. They all have specific cultures. Humans are social animals not single cell creatures.

It's not even about materialism any more though. In 10 years most of our interaction with capitalism will come through buying 'experiences', renting through airbnb, uber etc and desperately trying to gain reputation and influence ala the Nosedive episode of Black Mirror. It's an economy for sure but it cuts beneath the material into our deepest sense of desperation. 

 People come from a community not out of the ground

Yes but what community exists anymore in these post-industrial towns? Churches are crumbling, public space is being sold off, schools are becoming academies, councils are losing power, pubs are going bankrupt, jobs are becoming more insecure. There just isn't a sense of history in these places or collective belonging in the affirmative. If any sense of solidarity exists its a sense of interpassivity, based entirely on mutual rejection of the foreign other. That's an objectively pathetic way of organizing a community.

 Nationalism as a term here is just a stand in for ethnocentrism. I think saying any distinct ethnic group is held together by fear and hatred is inaccurate. All cultures have traditions, politics and norms. It's just part of how humans function as animals. That isn't distinct to British people. A person cannot be universal.

And what exactly would "british culture" be? Michael Gove's idea that we can instill British values in schools proved to be extremely pithy. Ask your average Brexit voter what year the magna carta was signed or what our most common tree is and they'd have no idea.  That plus the fact that historically we've been subjugated under divine rule - I study history and believe me there's nothing to be proud of looking backward. Fact is that if a culture exists today its global culture - go to hackney and you'll see people from all around living together under a sort of all encompassing natural religion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You shouldn't judge people by their ethnicity you should judge them by which university they went to, what house they live in and how much they earn. Globalist libertarian consumerist materialism?

Maybe we shouldn't judge people at all? If the only choice is either a) judge someone on something they could have said to have 'earned' if we're going to accept that at least some meritocracy exists (a good degree, a nice house etc) b) judge people based on something they were clearly born with and did nothing to earn - then I know what I'd prefer. 


 A sense of community, belonging and a group identity leads to more empathy and compassion. Outsiders help each other less. That's a pretty reliable rule.
 
That's not true. I think nationalist communities are tied together by fear and hatred, particularly the relationship of the nation to other nations. Native Brits need foreigners to build their own sense of identity, yet if we're going to forge a community based on excluding foreigners, any sense of solidarity we build is not actually about *us*, its about not being *them*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  That is your interpretation of a person you have never met, based on the selected media you've consumed of her public appearances. You don't know that. You assume that.

Yes. That's how politics is meant to work. Almost everyone that voted for her selectively consumed media of her public appearances and almost everyone that voted for her never actually met her. 

All we have are the words and images that we're presented with - and those words didn't seem to be rooted in any notion of reality as understood by ordinary americans. 

 The time to take serious stock was BEFORE we elected someone who is categorically worse than Hillary unless your assumptions about her include the aforementioned "shes a witch" conspiracy theory.

Reagan was a ridiculous charactuer of a man. So was Bush. I really just think Trump is the latest in a line of parochial fuck-you politicians. He's the physical embodiment of a society that's reached beyond itself, first as tragedy and now as farce. Yet the Clintons and the Democratic establishment that Hillary represented was willing to accompany the Republicans all along the way. Obama symbolised hope and optimisim - the notion that things can improve - but its not enough to be a symbol, a *fundamental* reconfiguration of the way politics is done had needed to take place. If Trump came after Obama then I'm sorry but should I don't even want to suggest who might have came after Hillary had she won.  </TEXT>

If you're a Dark-Enlightenment neoreactionary and you have some kind of surface level familiarity with the cannon then I think something like this could be written as a way inciting division on the left. I also think that it could be a way of positioning the woke left as some sort of infinitely repressive super-ego. The way the word 'free speech' is constantly banded as a pejorative around seems extremely suspicious to me, as does the way the word 'fascist' is over-used to the extent that it loses any possible corollary with reality. I'm all in favor of 'decolonize campus' movements problematising the parts of Kant, Hegel, Freud etc that highlight the imperalism implicit in the parts logic of modern philosophy but only to the extent that the rest of these key works aren't also thrown out.
