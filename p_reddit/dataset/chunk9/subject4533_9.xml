	<TEXT> basically shlohmo puts some of the elements of his songs in the left and right channels, in most cases his vocals. if you get rid of the mono channel and combine the left and right, youre left with just whatever is in the stereo space. i did this for his entire discography and discovered some neat little stems. 

asleep on the 22 (acapella)

beams (bells)

get out (acapella)

just us (acapella)

meet ur maker (brass)

wen uuu (drums)

wen uuu (ending acapella)

there are very small artifacts in a few of them. but most of them sound great. thought it would be cool to share with fellow producers and enthusiasts.

The second bug I encounter is similar to the first one except you can hear the ball bounce off but the ball itself remains still. If you drive slower into it, the collision noise gets looped and goes nuts. 

Both of these are solvable by simply restarting but i thought i should share them.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reveal and walk up to the house was done really well. The main things that bugged me were: 


- characters were not developed enough (what a surprise!) 
- too many edits that made it feel like a traditional movie instead of found footage. 
- uneventful jump scares 
- random stuff that contributed nothing to the movie. ie the infected foot thing and the whole "the footage was theirs" twist thing. 
- "look at the witch and you die" 


This could be just me but it also makes the original feel a lot less authentic.  </TEXT>

Ummmmm what? Are you saying that people shouldnt complain about a movie that was cheaply made? Are you saying people shouldnt complain about a movie that was filled with stock standard tropes and made for the masses? 

When you trade subtlety and realism for +4000dB screams and "0-100" moments, people are gonna be pissed. You enjoyed Blair Witch, good for you. Some people didn't. Who cares?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me personally I was a little bit dejected walking out of the theater after seeing this film. I am still currently organizing my thoughts but ultimately this film is just completely unnecessary. I stand by the statement that The Blair Witch Project is a film that should not be messed with nor expanded upon. Sure, its normal for viewers to want things to be explained (TBWP has handfuls of unanswered questions), but I think that is what makes it so special. The brief explanations of the mythology given in the original film are both effective and disturbing enough. We don't need a stylized reboot that fucks around with the mythology. 

The best part is that I was not affected by this film whatsoever and I am sure many others will agree with me. The film was not scary. A loud sound is not scary. Waiting for the next loud sound is not scary. Seeing the witch was not scary. Shaky camera is not scary. 

The most effective part about The Blair Witch Project is its authenticity. The way it was shot, the realness of the characters and the locals, the subtle hints of lore that pointed towards something truly evil. Its just something that cannot be effective in this day and age of horror films, found footage films to be more specific.  </TEXT>

The "malware detected" box keeps popping up when these programs are running but when I open them, Windows Defender finds nothing. 

When I open the file location of these programs, they lead to this folder: 

https://i.gyazo.com/e7dbb6419934652ba04a5ca88f105ba6.png

I have also tried MalwareBytes, both programs find a few malicious files but I always seem to get a few back. Is there any way I can get rid of them for good? Any help would be appreciated. 

Also, I have tried countless times to Google the problem but I seem to be the only one with these files.   </TEXT>

Im not trying to bash him, his project is a stellar example of how far you can get through pretty much just soundcloud. I just cant get into his uploads. I enjoyed his remix of cavalier but thats about it at this point. 

Is it just a good combination of likeable music and luck? Or is there some secret team behind the project?  </TEXT>
