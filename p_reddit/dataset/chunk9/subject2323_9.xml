	<TEXT> yea he was big before we knew who Armin and Tiesto were. Paul Van Dyk, John Digweed are more from his era. He had a very popular Essential mixes from around the world hosted by Pete Tong. The time when we first discovered MP3s and Napster, his global mixes were the big part of my download collection (Sydney, Shanghai, moscow, Goa, Miami and my personal fav Havana) I still have those MP3 somewhere...but youtube has most of them. Hope you can get into it!
