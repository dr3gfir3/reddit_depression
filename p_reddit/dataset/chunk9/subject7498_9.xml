	<TEXT> Did you by any chance happen to read *Once a Jailbird* by Hans Fallada? I picked it up at a thrift store cause I knew the author, but haven't heard much about it. It looks interesting, but I think it's a less popular work of his.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to make it clear to everyone since it confused me at first when I first discovered this book: *Alone in Berlin* by Hans Fallada is the same book as *Every Man Dies Alone*, which was also recommended here by u/Fuck_Passwords_

I believe Every Man Dies Alone is just the title they used for the American publication.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't get a chance to read it in high school, but read it recently at age 25 and loved it. The protagonist is obnoxious to many people, but remember this is only what it seems like on the surface. He really seems to be a caring kid that has a bunch of mental issues and nobody to turn to for help. There's so many wonderful subtleties throughout. The plot points, or lack thereof, aren't the point. It's certainly a polarizer, you either like it or you don't.  </TEXT>

Post Office by Bukowski *and* Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas by Thompson were both very funny as well.

	<TEXT> Me too. I'm not even finished yet. But the part where Yossarian claims he sees double of everything in the hospital, then says he sees just one of everything again. The doctor tests him out and confirmed he sees just one of everything. I actually laughed out loud for an unnecessary period of time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want an emotional ride, and based on your description, i'd recommend *Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes*. It's got Sci-Fi, Philosophy, is emotionally engaging, easy to read, and has loads of wisdom. It's considered a 20th century classic-- published in 1966. Starts out with poor grammar on purpose, but it changes quickly, so don't be put off by that. 

I just got real into reading within the past year, so I was in the same boat. I had an urge to re-ead a ton of books that were forced down my throat in high school. And i've already found I love a bunch of them now that i'm older and out of college. I also learned that a lot of classics can look intimidating, especially the real old ones, but many of them are not that bad. For instance, The Count of Monte Cristo, 1300 page book from the 1800's. Sounds rough, but so fast paced and engaging once you just dive into it. But then there are the heavy duty classics, which may be a different story.

If your looking to really get into reading as a hobby, i'd also suggest creating a Goodreads account and keeping track of the books you've read. You can add people, create your own shelves, rate and review books, and get reccomendations. It's a great way to stay motivated and search for new books. Also if you haven't already, check out all the awesome subreddits on here starting with r/books in addition to this one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a very, very sarcastic sense of humor. Many of the lines aren't being serious. Nothing in it makes really much sense yet either. It goes off on random tangents telling different stories. I just find it so witty so far. Not sure if this helps but I'm looking forward to seeing how all these stories add up. Don't feel bad if you want to take a break from it though.  </TEXT>
