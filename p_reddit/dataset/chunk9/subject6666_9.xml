	<TEXT> This is the first time I've ever told someone this.When I was about 10,I discovered something..something that I shouldn't found out. I was home alone and naked, watching TV on the couch.My cat Burger sat on my dick and started purring.It felt wrong but kinda good,this is also the first time ever I got a boner.Everyday when I got home from school Burger would sit on my dick while purring and while I give him head scratches,Burger would lick my cum.The sandpaper like feeling on my dick feels so good, I'm horny now typing this...

Next year I'll be moving out and a want to bring Burger with me.My parents would surely ask why because always act like I don't like him but secretly,I do VERY MUCH.There is also this feeling inside my gut that I need to tell my parents that I'm sexually attracted to cats.What should I do guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone goes on and on about Steve Bannon as this fucking racist and shit, but here's a couple points.

He never said he was a "white nationalist", he literally stated he was a normal nationalist, meaning patriot.

He was the only one close to Trump who was anti war. As soon as Bannon got out Syria strikes and MOAB came into place. Though many argue the MOAB never actually got Trump's approval.

Pisses me off how malleable Trump is but that's the only thing that had him doing well at first, and then the warmongering began.

As much as I don't like it, Bannon was a positive person in the administration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't that Black and White 

1. This bill is repealing an FCC regulation that hasn't taken effect yet. We all have been and are living in the absence of this rule.


2. This is not repealing the underlying statute that was the basis for this rule, which provides for generalized privacy protection. In fact, part of the reasoning for this repeal is that it creates conflicting regulatory schemes between the FCC and FTC, which already has rules in effect, requiring ISPs to provide some privacy protection.


3. The point about cable companies "buying" this bill is highly misleading. All the cable companies make contributions to nearly every candidate. In fact, the three senators who received the most from Comcast all voted against this bill. They were democrats Bernie Sanders ($64,974), Michael Bennet ($49,825) and Patrick Leahy ($41,200). Given that Comcast somehow couldn't "buy" these votes, one would think the vote had nothing to do with contributions and was straight party line - probably because it's the repeal of a last-minute Obama regulation.


4. What's being repealed is not a simple "you can't sell privacy information" but a complex, potentially burdensome set of rules that could make it much harder to do business for the cable companies. I'm not advocating one way or another, and I'm certainly not feeling sorry for Comcast, but it's worth noting that if the regulatory costs increase, you can bet the price of internet service is going to rise, too.  </TEXT>
