	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> On a daily basis, I receive up to 10 solicited calls from different scams/telemarketers.  These include "Senior Benefits", "Solar electricity", "Lowering my credit card interest", 100,000 mile car warranty...  etc.  

Every day, they are calling from a different number.  If I call the number back, it goes doesn't go through and I get the "your call cannot be completed as dialed".  Anyway, to the point.

I am waiting on legitimate calls and these calls are a nuisance and a waste of my time to be honest, not to mention getting my hopes up for it to be a legit caller.

I called Verizon about this and they offered to block the numbers calling in, or change my phone number.  Changing my number is not an option, and the numbers that call every day are different so giving them a list of numbers wont help them.

Im seriously fed up with these calls.  How can I get them to stop without changing my number?

How should I bring this up to him without being a dick about it?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Was driving today, shifting from 1st to 2nd.  Car was in gear (2) and I wasn't on the clutch, at this point I thought I was fully in 2nd gear.  Tried accelerating as normal but it was an abnormally slow acceleration.  Then followed by a gnarly waft of burning clutch smell (no smoke though).  This has never happened to me before, I'm not sure what I did or what happened.  Then I stopped at a light and went on, and it was just fine.


I'm usually very modest with my clutch use but this got me worried.  Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the STi wheels are my stock wheels that came with the car.  I bought a set of the stock subaru wheels for the winter.  So both my wheels are for different times of years and I probably won't be able to answer this question for you.

My STi wheels are the same 17x7, but they weigh a little less than the stock subaru wheels IIRC.

	<TEXT> I left a company last year in early November (in NJ).  I had about a weeks worth of sick time and another week of vacation.  Is it a requirement that companies pay you what you have earned in PTO?  I never asked for my PTO when I quit, and it's probably too late (5 months later) to ask for it now...  But for future reference.  Must a company pay you your PTO, or is that up to their discretion?  When leaving a company, how do you collect your PTO?

Edit:  is it too late to go back to said company and request my saved up PTO? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With warmer weather around the corner, I'm considering throwing on a set of PSS.  A few questions though..

I'm a modest driver but every now and then like to get the tail end loose.  Will I still be able to oversteer/drift with PSS?  Or is the grip too much for the engine to break the wheels loose?

Also, I remember reading somewhere that the stock wheels (17x7) are designed for 215's, but 225's fit it too.  Is going with the 225's any bit risky?  The tire shop I go to are very hesitant to put on 225's when they know the stock fitment is 215mm.

Thanks! </TEXT>

As far as the snow...  Get some blizzaks and you'll have more fun in the winter than you do in the summer with this car!  But really, it's very snow capable with the right set of tires and a little common sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I post to every comment about the brz in the snow:


Just went on a 1200 mile road trip from Philadelphia to Lake Placid NY and back. Stock BRZ with WS80 Blizzaks.


We did it all. Plowed through the snow, started on snow covered hills, uphill, downhill, curvy roads, snow filled parking lots, sheer ice. At one point, we drove through about 5 inches of UNPLOWED white stuff. We did not get stuck once!!


I really had my doubts about this car in the snow. Rear drive, light weight in the snow isn't the best formula. We didn't have much in the trunk aside from our cargo.  All you need are the right tires and a bit of common sense.


This car amazes me.

	<TEXT> My corporate office is upgrading laptops (i.e. Dell Latitude E7270) to Windows 10 and we have found that with Windows 10, they can't connect to our wifi.  We have a MAC filter in place, and our WLAN Policy Server is tied into AD for authentication.  Nothing has changed other than going from Windows 7 to Windows 10.  We keep getting the very vague, "Can't connect to this network".

	<TITLE> Switching my car insurance to another carrier. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-07 21:26:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My family and I will be switching to another car insurance provider in search of lower rates.  My policy consists of my parents and me (22 year old male).  I have my own car that I'm making payments on, and the car is solely registered to me (NJ).  

We're browsing for new insurance plans, and in order for me to be on my parent's policy (to make my premium lower) the insurance company we're looking at requires my car to be put in my father's name (transfer of ownership??).  Must this be done?

The car is registered to me.  I have about $8500 left on the loan, my dad co-signed the loan so my interest rate is low.  

As I am still making payments on my car, I do not have title-in-hand (yet).

I'd hate to have to re-register my car to my dad, only to switch it back after a few years.  Does this legally make my car have more than one owner if I switched the name? 

Or, does switching the registration have anything to do with who owns the car?  Does the insurance want me to switch ownership, or registration of the car?

Multiple insurance companies aren't giving me straight answers here.  Currently, the car   registration is in my name and that is fine with my current provider who allows this to be part of my parent's policy.

Thoughts?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just recently listened to a song that I loved when I was a senior in high school (5 years ago now).  I tried playing the song today while working, but the nostalgia factor kicked in and my mind put me in a place that was identical to how I was feeling 5 years ago.  I felt the feeling that I had walking down the hallway to class, doing homework at lunch, or driving my car out of the lot at the end of the day.

This feeling was incredibly surreal and gave me chills.  I had to stop the song and switch it to something else before anything else happened, lol.

Music is incredibly powerful.  Anyone else experience a feeling similar to this? </TEXT>
