	<TEXT> Hi, everyone. I'm just another nobody on the internet who wants to tell a story about a somebody.

This somebody was my 11 year old cousin who wanted nothing more then to listen to music, draw, and play volleyball. Sadly she passed away yesterday from something she had no chance of fighting.

Gorillaz was one of her favorite bands ever. She had drawings of everyone (my favorite was one she drew of noodle) and to be honest they were really good for a 11 year old. She would also cosplay 2d really well. 

I'm really pissed off that she never got the chance to listen to humanz in its entirety because I know without a doubt she would have loved it.

I just want to thank the band for giving her some semblance of happiness when she was alive.

Thank you.
