	<TEXT> There are 4, twelve man trials, with normal and hard mode (veteran) and an extra hard mode for the last boss on vet. That and the DLC HM Vet dungeons are considered the "end-game" in PVE. There is also VMA if you're into solo leaderboards. A lot of content for end-game, huge learning curve, huge gear grind- taking place in trials for BiS gear, as well as vanilla dungeons.
  
I encourage you to check out veteran HM trial clears on YouTube, to get a sense of what the combat and gameplay is like. It's incredibly fun- I'm still captivated by vMoL, and the craglorn trials.
  
Check out Alcast, Hodor, mechanically challenged, yolowizard, on YouTube. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, so- use all max magic enchants. Gold out your sharpened weps, flame staff back bar with ele blockade, front bar lightning/flame staff. Both sharp. Golden. Use force pulse not crushing. Get moondancer or IA jewelry. USE ALL DIVINES, thief mundus. If you're always using the pet, get daedric prey morph and front bar it(swap cancel this when switching bars), back bar execute. On your back bar hit the pet ability when you swap back to the front.
  
Watch Alcast's 2 sorc build videos for homestead. Particularly when he's fighting the dummy.
  
Any other questions, let me know. 38k on my pet build sorc at the dummy last night.

You can absolutely go flame-flame, if that's what you got. You will always have those 2 skills, AOEs and dots backbar, therefore LL goes there with wall of ele. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it's depressing. We tried vAA normal mode after the vMol run. Some nights are worse than others, we cleared vMol normal a couple nights ago with some problems (2 DCs) ... Last night we said to hell with it. VAA I heard was rough but we didn't get a single DC last night. It may have been because we all had our tin-foil hats on tight- audio off, quest markers/compasses off, no combat text, no name plates, polymorphs on, etc.
  
Our vMoL progression group is really pissed off. We were just starting to clear lunar phase consistently... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ideal comp for gear in pve would be- 2 ilambris, 1 heavy 1 med, 5 BSW, 3 moondancer or IA jewelry. VMA flame staff sharp back bar, moondancer Lightning sharp front bar. Moondancer/IA can be very difficult to get so a sub for that would be willpower + 1 non set piece. Definitely keep it sharpened. </TEXT>
