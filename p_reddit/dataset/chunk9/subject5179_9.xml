	<TEXT> I feel he is still not good enough. He still loses possession a lot. Used to score goals too, doesn't any more. Used to shoot from distance, doesn't any more. People talk about confidence, well, he has been trying to get that back since 2013! I think it's time.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the timing of calling it quits right now will be very good. We will have 3.5 months till the next Transfer Window before which we can install the new manager. But then the question is, has the Board even finalized a candidate? Even as a backup option?[Because there is that possibility where Arsene is not ready to sign the contract provided]

I really wonder what is going on. The more I think about it, more scared I get. I can picture empty stadiums and horrendous display on the pitch for the next 10 games. Europa looks difficult in that case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watched this game. But Chip lost the game when he went so defensive right at the beginning. You can never win against TheViper if you play that defensive. Cav Archers are a very expensive choice, Viper was surprised but amused and confident when he saw the first CA from Chip.

[Edit] - You can hear Viper talking about Map control in most of his videos, he enjoys it when his opponent goes that defensive because it gives him rest of the map.

All said, Chip did play a very good game, neat game. </TEXT>
