	<TEXT> There are a few options to make a chunkier salsa; though you're going to suffer from a change of taste, in this case, it's for the better.  

**Option Numero Uno:** Buy your **tomatoes from the Farmer's Market**, as u/BakoMan said, store bought tomatoes have less liquid than delicious Farmer's Market tomatoes, so you'll be able to use less tomatoes. **The Plus:** Your salsa will taste even fresher than before. **The Minus:** You will be limited to tomato season. **My Take:** In the past few months I've used both to make salsa (to go with my homemade tortillas); *heriloom* turns out to be the best as far as taste and chunk; *store bought* made the salsa runny and more like that shitty grocery store salsa that comes in a plastic container.  

 **Option Numero Dose:** If you have a **gas stove then roast your peppers** this will change the flavor of the salsa (for the better). This will allow you to **omit the vinegar.** Because your salsa will have a bolder flavor from the roasted peppers.  

**Option C:** You can either **Don't break the salsa down as much OR** as u/flyinggeorge suggested, **strain the liquid.**  

Well now you've got some options! Oh! Here's my recipe for salsa:  

1 basket of small Farmer's Market bought heirloom tomatoes. One Farmer's Market bought lime. 2 Serrano peppers roasted on an open flame. 1 whole grain of sea salt (optional). Salt (seasoned to taste). Toss the food (not the lime juice) into a food processor of blender. While mixing to desired coarseness, add lime juice. Salt to taste.  

Edit: Misquoted u/BakoMan </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they were burned during the time it was cool to burn Vonnegut books. I personally like the later books after the burning. So finding original manuscripts is your only option. These go for millions of dollars , thugh, so I'll give you a plot summary of each (DO NOT READ BELOW UNLESS YOU WANT SPOILERS):  

Slaughterhouse 1: The OP novel of Kurt. This one didn't get enough love, as it was a prequel that came out before the main book did. (Scholars often think that Kurt should have released this after V.) Kelvin, the main character, starts up the slaughterhouse. It's all about the trials and tribulations of one man trying to make a small living. Really good read if you want a one man taking on normal odds. There's a small section about a baker using grey mold to make everyone go crazy. Kelvin overcame the sickness of the grey mold; the landlord trying to get his wife and even managed to pay his taxes.  

Slaughterhouse 2: Here is where the fun begins. Kelvin's wife (unnamed) gives birth to a son, Bronschwiegg (Bronzi). Why the German name? For two purposes: First, ther Germans are closing in on thw town and Kelvin wants his son to sound like a German in order to fit in. Second, there is a visit from the Orondorffersons, an alien society comparable to the Illuminati of Earth. They inform, Kelvin that Bronzi is going to father one of the most important children of the 20th century. This novel is accredited to Kurt's first use of tropes with the phrase, "Stay in the water." being used exactly 256 times. The irony (and if you can find the manuscript online I highly suggest you give it a read); there is no mention of water in the book.  

Slaughterhouse 3: Considered, among scholars, to be the second best of the Slaughterhouse series, this is one action packed book. From the Old West style shoot out between, a now fully grown Bronzi, and his nemesis in the book, Ketlz Von Bastion; to the Lord of the Rings style battle between Bronzi's Jewish/Alien army and the Nazis; to the fact that the book is one of Kurt's longest novels at (500 written pages) coupled with the fact that he incorporates a numerology reference on each page. It's safe to say that this is my favorite (and many other's favorite) of the Slaughterhouse series. This is also where the term "Slaughterhouse" used in the slang term of massacre, bloodbath, etc, was coined. When you search for this one online be careful of the CreepyPasta of the same name (that one is about a Slender Man arcade cabinet that ate children or something; I actually finished the CreepyPasta then only upon research did I find out that I read the wrong book lol!).  I consider this Kurt's masterpiece; but I love written action, the thrill of trying to figure out exactly what an author is trying to describe adds to the excitement of the moment! Kurt's dry style really leads to great action! (For example, "He swung. I jumped. He swung again. I killed him. Farewell Dear Friend. Another attacked. I killed him. Farewell Dear Friend. My shirt had bits of stardust on it. Glaxxor ((Bronzi's best alien buddy)) was dead. Farewell Dear Friend). Needless to say "Farewell Dear Friend," became a part of human speech quickly. In the book the phrase means goodbye in so many ways. I'm in tears writing this because of "how deep it goes," another trope from the book. You have to just read it. For reals, you owe it to yourself to find the manuscript!!!  

Slaughterhouse IV: This is the first one that started using tRoman Numerals in the title. Bronzi dies. I'm just going to get that out of the way right now. He was able to make it to America (at the end of the third book) and father a son, Billy Pilgrim. This book is all about Billy growing up; he blacks out from time to time. Then Billy sees his future and alternate timelines of his adult life. There are so many alternate timelines that at the time it was released, people thought that Kurt was messing with them by not giving them a definitive book. The catch was actually far smarter than anyone at the time realized. In true Kurt fashion, his fondness of numerology surfaced once again. Instead of reading the book one word at a time you would have to read every fifth word of the book; or every third word of the book, depending on who's story you're following. So you pick a Pilgrim from the sixth chapter then skip to the corresponding word depending which Pilgrim you picked. Eventually everything was straightened out in a second edition of the book. The stories are pretty exciting. In one Billy Pilgrim joins his friends the Tralformadores, and fights in a space battle alongside them, but the Tralformadore's memory has to be wiped clean of Billy in order for them to continue existing as a species, the sad thing is they respected Billy immensely but knew they'd put him in a zoo if they ever crossed paths again. Iirc correctly the third Billy went out West and fought Jesse James for while until running into a big nugget of gold and retiring with his favorite prostitute. Fourth Billy was my favorite; he ended up as a kind of old-fashioned super-hero (Like Batman in a way) he used Leonardo da Vinci's flying machine to soar around New York, swooped down on enemies and strangle them with a noose. Fifth Billy is where a lot of the people thought the book would go; he became a butcher with a dark secret; he would butcher PEOPLE in the back of the butcher shop, but only criminals and murderers; a lot of people really liked this (and I think it's obvious where this plot popped up again). Sixth Billy was killed with only saying his catchphrase once, "I lived." Which brings up a great point! each Billy had their own catchphrase! I can't remember them for the life of me, but they weren't that memorable.  

Which brings us up to speed to Slaughterhouse V. I think you'll find out which Billy they decided to go with. Hope the summaries helped friend! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This guy was talking loudly on the phone in the library, the phone was loud enough to hear the person on the other end. He proceeds to walk to my are and behind me. I calmly asked him (in my library voice) to take his conversation elsewhere. Then I stare at him for a while, hoping he gets the point. "You staring at me isn't going to make me leave any faster," he says. I turn around and compose myself for a moment. He continues talking. I turn around and stare at him again. He doesn't get the point. It took me digging through my bag (my intention was to cut off his shitty ponytail, or tie, but let's be honest it's going to get bloody at that point and I probably would have killed him in my rage) to get him to finally leave.   

Had to calm myself down after that, listened to music box music lol! The good thing is that I was able to recognize that I was being triggered and kept it together until the asshole left. It's things like this, though, that really make me upset, not just about my life, but about people with BP in general. Why are people such assholes sometimes? Do they know that at any minute they could be on the receiving end of something terrible? Eh, I'm just rambling now, rant over lol! </TEXT>

If you're not keen on the idea of resting a burger on the bun then get one of those tins you mentioned and toss some wooowoo sauce in there!!! They'll be moist when your co-workers come to eat them.

Easy Mode:Look at the package and specifically look at the calories. Then the Calories from fat number right below it. If the calories from fat section is higher than half the total amount of calories then put it back.  

Medium Difficulty:  Lead your life by your own standers, not your friend's. Show them your dedication to eating healthy has paid off.  

Hard Mode: Stick to a healthy diet of good food and exercise. Cheat only once a week.  

EDIT: The calories from fat should not be higher than half the total amount of calories. </TEXT>

What OP needs is to disassemble a real burrito and see how it's made.  

The filling goes more towards one side than the other. There is far less filling in a smaller tortilla (6-8in.) compared to the restaurant sized tortillas (10-14in.) Fold the top and bottom over the filling; fold the side closest to the filling over and under the filling; then roll!

	<TEXT> Here are some ideas for the "No Rematch" clause:  

- The Power 25 system, in which the loser drops down to the bottom of the stack and has to work their way back up.  

-  DQ results in a suspension of competition and forfeit of the title to competitor.  

- A purposeful Count Out (c) results in (and I'm reaching here) a 24 Hour open title hunt, in which any Superstar can challenge for the title 24 hours after the count out is declared.  

- DQ by interference results in the injured party winning the match and gaining or retaining the title.  

What do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can always copy other cool sequences you see in matches. Then you can modify the sequences until they become your own. The problem is that your partner has to see the sequences too in order for this to work. 

You can also take the plan every spot approach. That might be overwhelming to some people, though. Maybe plan a few big spots and call some of the action inbetween.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's so weird the emphasis that common culture has put on breasts. I feel that in every way, the shame/disrespect/agony a woman feels by not showing her breasts is in every way an example of the specific women's body shaming that has gone on for way too long. A woman shouldn't have to show anyone her breasts; likewise they shouldn't be treated as dangerous sexual objects. Simply the things which men have that are more capable of feeding babies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First: Stop being a bitch in your own house. I know that might hurt, but it's your fucking house, man (and I wish someone was there to tell me the same thing).  

Second: If someone is in your shower for over and hour you have every right to barge in and tell them to get the fuck out.  

Third: She's on something. Meth doesn't have a smell like weed (I know, I worked in a place where a lot of customers smoked meth) it's more of a feeling than a smell.  

Fourth: You have every right to kick somebody out of your house if you don't want them there. Although I think you handled it well, seeing as there were repercussions anyways, they could have escalated into a broken window quite fast. Maybe turn the hose on her next time. </TEXT>
