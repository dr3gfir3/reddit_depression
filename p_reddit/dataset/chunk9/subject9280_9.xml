	<TITLE> Taking BPC-157 Orally </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-01 20:13:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I asked some basic questions about this peptide couple days ago and then proceeded to do a lot more research through the nootropics sub and various places on the web and through guides such as Ben Greenfield's [here](https://bengreenfieldfitness.com/2016/05/how-to-use-bpc-157/).

My plan is to purchase the BPC from Peptides Warehouse and then reconstitute it and use it orally.  I'm very much on a budget and already have an extra clean insulin needle and syringe from the stuff I use to inject testosterone weekly for hypogonadism.

I was wondering if it's okay to use the same needle and syringe when reconstituting and when drawing from the peptide later to spray into my mouth for oral use.  I know its possibly not optimal in terms of contaminating the peptide, but if I plan to use BPC-157 for just around two weeks and will never be injecting (so obviously I don't risk injection whatsoever), just wondering if its safe for me and will also not harm the peptide if I use the same needle and syringe for spraying over two weeks.

Also if I use distilled water for reconstituting and keep the peptide in the fridge is that okay? Or is bacteriostatic water a must for not harming the peptide's potency?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey I'm almost 24 and have the exact issues you went through with anhedonia and things.  I took adderall at a young age for years by prescription for ADD and I believe it definitely played a role in messing up my dopaminergic system, thus leaving me with a higher tendency toward severe daily anhedonia.

First I was wondering if since the time you took them do you still feel the improvements from the BPC-157 and the uridine?

I have no problem with needles and deal with them weekly for hypogandism but I would rather take this sublingually as you did and was wondering if you could tell me the way you did it.

Also have you noticed any negative effects over time from the peptide?

Thank you so much for your help, if you can help me out it means a ton coming from a guy here, who like you, has been trying everything for a very long time to heal his brain/body and thus his mind </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I would like to take it for its possible benefits in healing the dopaminergic system after years of stimulant use.  I was prescribed ADD medicines for years as a child and adolescent and suspect its part of the reason that I've suffered from severe anhedonia for the last many years.

I'm not afraid of needles and actually self-inject testosterone cypionate once a week under the treatment of a doctor for my hypogonadism, however I'd rather not inject this.  

Can you guys tell me if theres another way to take this substance such as sublingually or orally? I also really don't know how this needs to be mixed or where to purchase it, any help is greatly appreciated    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get [this](http://simplereminders.com/domains/simplereminders.com/uploads/authors/eckhart-tolle.jpg) right on your wrist and you'll always remember to dwell in the now and not identify with your ego.

In all seriousness I believe getting a tattoo can either be done with attachment to something or really just for the sake of adding something to your already fulfilled wholeness.  I wouldn't recommend you getting a tattoo related to meditation or anything for that matter if it will be done to fulfill a subconscious *need* to feel whole that your ego believes a tattoo will give you.

However if you recognize that this tattoo will just be a cool addition to your life I say go ahead and get it!

My recommendation would be a small quote from the book, anything relating to remembering that you are one with the universe (and everyone and everything) and that your egoic reality is just a phantom of your thoughts and not the truthful objective reality.

It's not talked about because it makes us look weak but people who kill themselves often suffer from this type of pain daily for years upon years with no treatment working. I'm sorry he's gone, I'm also glad he's finally at peace and is no longer suffering.

Maybe a treatment could have eventually taken away his pain, but either way it's okay because he's at peace now and no longer struggling.

I'm sorry man, this life can be so tough and the society we live in can make it 1000x harder. </TEXT>

Does this idiot realize that Israelis and Arabs aren't fucking white europeans? They're fucking middle-eastern sabras, aka semites.

This is disgusting to watch this bitch spread the most insane fucking lies.  Does she realize Israel has protection for gays and religious freedom while almost every one of its Arab neighbors is the exact opposite??  Go to Saudi Arabia and see how many women there are working.  Go to Iran and try to practice Christianity or Judaism in a safe and free manner.  I can't believe Joe believes the bullshit from this fucking nasty cunt. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Withdrawal making me very suicidal </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-24 19:40:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have extremely severe depression and anxiety and anhedonia and I started my withdrawal a week ago and then took about 1-2 grams on this past Saturday night so I relapsed. I only took for five-six months or so but took daily towards the end.

The withdrawal has made it impossible for me to enjoy a single bite of food, piece of music, conversation, or moment of existence. Every moment is currently extreme suffering. 

The worst part about it is with nothing to enjoy at all I can only focus on bad things and so my suicidal depression is here at the moment and I feel like there's no reason to live my life. I'm almost 24 and am three years behind in college and stuck at home and I've made so many mistakes in my life and am focused on my exes and all my lost friendships l. I don't know what I expected writing this but I really could use support right now because I feel like it's not gonna be okay and I'm not gonna make it to a better time. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After 3 weeks on TRT for my hypogandism I felt the best I felt in years and a good portion of my depression and anxiety began to fade and I had so much energy and a calm demeanor. 

Around a week ago at the end of my fifth week I began to feel not great and since then its been a week and I've felt terrible all week.

I just don't know for sure if I'm crashing now because my natural production has completely shutdown or something else TRT related and hoped I could get some input from you guys because I'm really not doing okay. </TEXT>
