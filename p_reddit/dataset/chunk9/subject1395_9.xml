	<TEXT> Not sure how helpful this would be for you, but I have a spare 1080p 23" monitor - it wouldn't cost much for me to ship it. If you need the higher resolution for a job, I totally would send it your way. It's got a bit of a scratch on the screen with a few dead pixels, but if you get a job that requires the higher resolution it's all yours. 

It would be a few days with UPS ground, but let me know if it would help you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This exactly. Traffic generally results from a long line of cars creating slowdowns in waves. If people merge properly, it's always better to split into two lanes. 

It's the same with lane closures on the pike - you create more traffic by all forcing into the one open lane rather than pulling up to the construction in another lane and merging - but people freak out and don't realize this. Instead they refuse to let anybody cut in because they "didn't wait in line". </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work in a hospital - one of our child playrooms has a new XBox One, but we can't use it online. We want kids to be able to play Lego Star Wars, etc. off the disc. 

We don't have it connected to XBL - is that doable? We've gotten it to play games once in a while, but now we keep getting the 0x8027025a error, Xbox took too long to start the app. 

Some googling turned up three fixes:

1. Hard reset. Didn't help.

2. Factory default. It's been doing this since we took it out of the box, so it seems very unlikely. 

3. Call Microsoft and get a warranty replacement. 

Does anyone have any input about fixing this? If Xbox without XBL is impossible, I'll just tell them to return it.

	<TEXT> Currently using Senn HD280 Pro with cable mod while on the go/commuting - and Senn 598Cs at home sans DAC/Amp. I'm considering a Schiit stack, but I'm not sure if I'd prefer to buy a $300 set of headphones instead. Are there any options at $300 that will be as much an upgrade as adding a modi/magni? 

Another question - I love Massdrop for giving me another excuse to get rid of my rent money a week early: what I'm trying to figure out is how often the deals they have are actually that good... I know Monk+ deals get people hot and bothered, but I keep frothing over the Fostex Purplehearts (which I won't be able to justify any time soon). I see things like the HE350s, but people seem to be upset that they are never as cheap as amazon, etc. Any input? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Room for Rent near Tufts! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking for May 1st subletter for 1 Bedroom in Medford Apartment. 

10 minute walk to Tufts. Right off Boston Ave, bus stop is 2 minute walk. 

Room is about 11'x15'? On the second floor off of the common area. Has one window, medium closet. 

Tons of storage space in the back of the house. Nice kitchen with full size fridge/stove/oven/dishwasher. Big common space. Second floor front porch. Free laundry in basement. 

Room for one car in the driveway. 

Three existing roommates (24-28 professionals), two on third floor, one on second floor. Really nice people. 

We're moving out because there isn't a lot of room for my girlfriend and I. 

I commute to Boston for work and it's about an hour by public transit - much faster by car. 

Close to lots of restaurants, Stop Shop/Trader Joes/Whole Foods, Davis Square (Red Line) and some nice places to walk/run/bike.

Nice management company, very responsive. No first/last/security. Utilities are reasonable and split with roommates evenly.

Let me know if you have any questions, want pictures or want a tour! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel that a cable should follow the natural twist of the wiring. A good wire should coil loosely and store flat. None of that packaged shit that comes twist-tied into a tight bundle. That ruins the coil.

Flat cabling generally has zero options for shielding, but round cables have varied twist rate and shielding options. Flat cables seem nice for short flexible runs in installed systems, but they're just a novelty in headphones and the issues outweigh any benefits (of which I can't think of any) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the review. I just want to clarify something on the Bose end. I worked for Bose for two years doing product support though. From 2014 to 2016 I was doing those warranty replacements. Two things have changed in the last year: warranty replacements and repairs for home theater systems are getting more scarce and support after the first year is becoming nonexistent, and they laid off 95% of their Massachusetts support staff and sent the jobs to the Philippines (also more and more of the manufacturing is taking place in China and Mexico)

I still like my Bose products - but I still give corporate the finger when I drive by on I-90.  </TEXT>
