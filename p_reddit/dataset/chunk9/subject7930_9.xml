	<TITLE> Can anyone shed some light on a directors process in animated films? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 05:45:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With live action films I understand rehearsing a scene, running it, stopping and starting and taking time to give notes and suggestions. A director can see his actors in relation to the set or setting in real time and adjust accordingly, or take a look at the image he's capturing and make changes. 

How does all of this work with animation? Does a director work both in creating the images we see as well as giving direction to the voice actors? How much of the animation artists work is dictated and/or shaped by the director?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welp. I did not expect to wake up to this thread having somewhat blown up. Thought there would be maybe 10-20 comments and that's it. I am surprised at the intensity of some of the criticism, but we're all fans here and I know how these discussions get the blood flowing. 

I am a fellow fan of Marvel movies and comic books. I've seen every film in theaters (most more than once) and I've got boxes of comics in my closet (including a box full of the One More Day/Brand New Day run that I can't bring myself to throw away for some masochistic reason). Guardians is my favorite (I've seen it over 50 times- how embarrassing). All this to say, I was not setting out to make absolute statements or judgements. I just wanted to throw out an observation I had. 

Thank you for the comments reminding me that SMH is not an origin story, and also that the Netflix heroes/villains exists. My qualifier for the movies I included in my list were solo debut MCU films centered around one hero, regardless of whether they are traditional origin stories or not. The Guardians are a team. DD/JJ/etc are TV heroes. Spidey appeared in Civil War but this is his solo debut. I know that I threw Vision in there, but that was more of an after thought that extended the observation I was trying to share.

I understand the backlash about Thor and Loki, but like I said below, even if they're removed from the list it would still leave 5 origin stories where the heroes face mirror versions of themselves. Which is not something I am looking to judge. If you read my initial post, I don't have anything negative to say about those villains. The First Avenger and Iron Man are some of my all time favorite MCU films. 

All I was trying to say is that I'm excited to see Marvel taking a slightly different route with Spidey and placing him in so many scenarios we haven't seen on film thus far. Thanks for your discussion and feedback, this sub is the bees knees. Much love, True Believers </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I agree that Thor and Loki is the biggest stretch, but the fact that they're both Asgardian Gods is nevertheless a similarity, which is the point that I was trying to make. It's not just a part of their names, it's what they are. Also I didn't include the Guardians because much like The Avengers, their story is the origin story of a team of heroes, not a single hero.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iron Man fought Obidiah Stane in a big, gray Iron Man suit, with the same tech and power set. The Hulk fought a big gray Hulked up Abomination. Thor, God of Thunder, (ultimately) fought his brother Loki, God of Mischief. Captain America fought The Red Skull, transformed by the same "super soldier" formula. Ant-Man fought Yellowjacket, another man powered by Pym Particles. Doctor Strange fought Kaecilius, a rogue sorcerer. And even Vision fought against Ultron, another physical manifestation of an AI.

Meanwhile, Spider-Man will be facing off against a high tech flying dude, a dude with high tech gauntlets, and the Tinkerer (who is pretty high tech). Nothing against the previous villains, I just think this is an exciting change for the MCU.

And yes, I realize they're skipping the spider bite "origin story" but for all intents and purposes it is an origin story as far as establishing a solo story for Spidey in the MCU.

	<TEXT> I actually mentioned this exact point in a comment below. The thing is, the article is about roles, not about directors. Ironically the three Oscar winning films you mentioned don't have any Latino roles, and that's what this discussion is about. Just as one example, Michael Pea was the first Latino in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, and he had a minor role that was somewhat stereotypical. I do think Diegos role in Rogue One is a great accomplishment, though it is yet again a Latino with a minor role in a film starring a white lead  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is incredibly interesting to me. We have incredibly successful people directing brilliant work, Irritu with Birdman and The Revenant and Cuarn with so many of his films, but we don't get to see Latino filmmakers producing work that champions authentic Latino stories. Though to be fair, both Irritu and Cuarn produced work involving their heritage prior to making big in the "mainstream" filmmaking industry. Same could be said of Guillermo Del Toro </TEXT>
