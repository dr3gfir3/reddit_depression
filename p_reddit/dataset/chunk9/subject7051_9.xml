	<TEXT> I'm not talking down to you, and I'm not sure why you think that. It's obvious you aren't in a good place, people who self harm aren't either. It's a form of self-medication, much like emotional eating or binge drinking. The self-harmer masks emotional pain by causing physical pain. Is it healthy? No, of course not, but neither is excessive drinking or binge eating to cope with emotional pain. 


People do what they need to do to survive and manage. Even excessive drinking, emotional eating and self-harm are better than committing suicide. I guess my point is that just because you don't understand it doesn't mean it doesn't help them cope. I don't self-harm. My brother did. He eventually stopped, when he got the help he needed. 


It is not for anyone else to determine what works when coping. I did judge you as a bastard earlier and that was wrong, but it makes me angry when people who suffer from depression turn on each other instead of supporting each other. 


People who suffering from depression need professional help. I've seen to many people try to cope on their own either attempt suicide, or succeed. This includes myself. It wasn't until after my almost successful suicide attempt that I realized I needed help. Professional help from people who knew what they were doing. 


I have supported many friends and family members through their dark depression hours. All I can tell them, and what I am telling you, is that it does get better. It will, I promise. 


I'm not going to fight or argue with you anymore. Just take care of yourself and do what you need to do to get healthy and happy and I'm going to go do the same.


I truly, sincerely wish you all the best in your battle.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Listen, I'm sorry you seem so miserable still. It's obvious to someone that has suffered from clinical depression for over twenty years that even though you claim that you've conquered the beast, you're still battling. The "miserable" part is observation, the bastard part is my addition based on your behavior towards others. 


You don't get to tell others what works for them. What works for you won't work for everyone. I'm so sorry you feel like nothing works for you, but the simple fact of the matter is that for many people, including myself, the anti-depressants you knock saved my life. They save many lives. 


Please try to get additional help for your depression and let your friends and family help you. Pushing them away is not a victory or triumph of depression, it's you sinking deeper. Rejecting all efforts by everybody, including your Doctor is you sinking deeper. I know you don't feel this way and you are probably going to be abusive towards me over it, but I have seen too many people go down that path, and a few of them never came back. 


Just try to take care of YOURSELF, don't worry so much about how other people wrestle their demons when yours have you in a headlock. 

Best of luck.  </TEXT>

Everything I could to feel better, listening to my Doctor, allowing my friends and family to help when they wanted, took anti-depressants, started exercising, went to counseling and group therapy. I dug in and fought too. What I never EVER did was judged anybody else's journey back from the darkness. Everybody has to do different things to survive their darkness. All your comment proves is that you are still a miserable bastard.  </TEXT>

He and his wife have been married around three years, she doesn't drive, is depressed, gained a schwak of weight since they started dating and is one of the most kind-hearted people I've ever met. But he does everything and they have a one and a half year old. He can't even work outside the home. He has to work from home, part time (she can't work) and if the baby starts getting fussy, even if she's home and he's trying to work, he has to get up and deal with it. She cannot be left alone with her own child because she "can't handle it". She refuses to get help because she doesn't believe in traditional medicine. My BIL always looks tired. I know it's hard, but you need to firmly ask her to get help. My husband had to do that for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is worth it. The difference is that you went to the vet! You didn't hesitate because you knew it would be expensive. When we had my dog's cyst removed they told us it would be several hundred dollars for pathology. We refused. She's 11 years old. If she DOES have cancer we won't be so selfish that we put her through chemo. There IS a line that every owner needs to draw, but refusing emergency vet care is unacceptable. Anyone who TRULY loves their pets could not watch then suffer and refuse to take them to the vet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mrs. Judgemental, actually. I'm going to spend my time and money taking care of my herd. And if one of them gets sick I will march them into the vet without hesitation. If I had to give up an animal to ensure proper treatment, I would. Allowing an animal to suffer is disgusting. I don't care how poor you are, allowing any living being to suffer because of selfish greed is unacceptable. If you can't afford the vet bill, nobody is calling you a shitty human. Avoiding the problem and pretending it doesn't exist when an animal is clearly suffering makes you a shitty person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly? I don't care much for people. I keep my world simple, honest and open people and many creatures. I would rather spent money saving the life of a beloved pet as opposed to a random human being who may or may not be a shitty person. I work hard for what I have, it is my right to spend my money on people over animals. However, I am Canadian and as such, I pay taxes to sustain a healthcare system that I rarely access. I believe it is our duty to pay into a system that benefits all of us, even the less fortunate, the unemployed, people on welfare, etc. so I believe that I can spend my money on the creatures (that bring more far more joy than the vast majority of people have) and not feel an ounce of guilt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a rich person by any means, but my dog was dealing with an infected cyst, that the vets insisted was nothing, for several years. It finally started getting uncomfortable for her so we paid $500 to have it removed and she is so much better now. I understand that it is hard to scrounge up the money for these kinds of things, but if you allow a living creature to suffer because you are cheap asshole that makes you are a bad person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, my eldest eighteen. He's been dumped twice in his life and I had to hold him while he cried for hours. He's been with his current girlfriend for three years, who is also a straight A student and they are both attending the same college. He works full time and finds the time to engage his little brother in various activities. My youngest is twelve, and I'm relatively positive he has no girlfriends that he's stalking. So for both my children I'm going to have to say that the amount of girls they have hurt stands at a big 'ol ZERO. And when people say they "Fucked up their first kid", it's not in a I-raised-a-serial-killer type way. It's in a I-made-a-way-bigger-deal-outta-that-than-necessary type way. There are failures as parents that don't incite a child to become a mass murderer. You just maybe yell too much or spoil them too much, but you learn from your first one, and that's why second siblings seem to get away with so much. We've learned what to make a big deal out of and what not to.  </TEXT>
