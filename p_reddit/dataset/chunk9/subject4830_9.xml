	<TEXT> I think the odds are pretty low.

From the US perspective, Trump does talk tough, but war with North Korea is a huge risk. It's not like bombing Syria or Afghanistan. There's a reason that previous US Presidents haven't attacked NK. There would likely be a large number of US casualties with the soldiers stationed in South Korea, and a large number of South Korean casualties. I could see public opinion in the US quickly turning against US military action.

For the NK perspective, they have been walking a fine line for a number of US Presidencies. Getting as close as possible with their provocative behavior, without starting another war. They may talk tough, but I gotta think they know how badly a military conflict with the US would go. What do they really have to gain?

The big unknown is that neither have been pushed far enough where they need to follow through on their big threats and start shooting. It's really hard to say who will blink first in this game of chicken. In some ways, it doesn't matter who makes the first move. Once the shooting and missiles start, a lot of people will be killed on both sides of the DMZ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is asking for a whole lot of things to go right and very little to go wrong. One of the problems with North Korea is that have been making threats for years but they haven't had to go through with the threats. Who knows how tough, or crazy, they really are. It's possible that the US bombs sites in North Korea and North Korea backs down, but I still think it's a huge risk.

We have gotten this far with a mixture of diplomacy, sanctions, and threats. I would be more comfortable keeping that pressure up, and increasing the pressure on China to have them crack down on North Korea and Chinese businesses that work with North Korea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This logic has been in play with North Korea for a long time. Seriously, what can we do now, in terms of military action, that won't make the situation worse?

Let's say the US does attack North Korea in the next few days because they think another nuke test is about to happen. We could damage or destroy that facility, but wouldn't North Korea also retaliate with an attack on South Korea or Japan? Presumably, they could fire a nuke into South Korea. That would be the end of the current North Korean leadership, given the massive military response in reply, but a whole lot of people could be killed in the process.

We could take the risk the North Korea wouldn't retaliate if the US blew up their nuke testing facility, but that does seem to be a huge risk. </TEXT>

 Welfare is often how polygamist communities like Hildale in Utah and Colorado City in Arizona substantially support themselves. Polygamists often use food stamps to feed their families. Former polygamist Benjamin Bisline said, "If it wasn't for government subsidies, these people couldn't survive. There are people here with 15 wives on welfare.'' Bisline still lives in a polygamist town.

 Colorado City and Hildale were on a list of the top ten towns with a population over 2,000 in the Intermountain West for reliance upon Medicaid (health care for the poor) in 1998. And in that same year the same towns draw from the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program (food for low-income mothers) could only be equaled by Western Indian reservations and impoverished inner cities. 33% of Hildale and Colorado City residents were using food stamps in 1998. To put this into perspective, respectively Arizona's average was 6.7% and Utah's 4.7% during that same period. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can relate. To this day, my mother swears she has never watched an R rated movie, and sites [Catholic movie guidelines](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Legion_of_Decency) from her youth.

I didn't have such issues around movies and even enjoyed trying to watch the porn channel on the old school cable boxes, trying to spot the occasional genitalia through the static.

I did have all sorts of issues around nudity and my own body. In my later 20s I went to a place with a clothing optional hot spring. Initially, the idea of stripping down in front of a bunch of strangers seemed terrifying, but it was a time in my life when I was trying to challenge my boundaries. I went for it, got nude and had a soak. It was a liberating experience that I still fondly look back on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Should we be concerned that restricting the H-1B visa process might lead to more outsourcing? Wasn't that part of the reason for H-1B visas in the first place, to get qualified people in the US and to keep companies from sending jobs overseas?

If you are running a software company and need people, it's not like there is some huge pool of US citizens sitting on the sidelines, who have all the skills needed for the job. If companies can't find the people in the US, won't they just look to places like India, and open or expand development offices there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But lately with so many H1-Bs trying to judge their US coworkers on their educations, it becomes somewhat of a deal.

That does sound annoying. I haven't run into that problem. A friend, a US born and educated engineer whose parents are from India, he applied for a position at a company, interviewed, and then was turned down because he didn't graduate from IIT. Seems like they could have saved everyone some time and read his resume in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Ask those H1-Bs to write down the name of those excellent institutions they graduated from. 

It seems like the research should be done as part of the interview process.

In my experience, the school a person attends is not a good indicator of how good their work will be. One of the best engineers I worked with had an English Degree. He is now CTO of a very successful company. People who have dropped out of college to start working are also often quite good. By comparison, I have worked with a number of people from top tier schools that most people dream of getting into, and they often struggle professionally. They are very smart academically, but that often doesn't translate into being a good engineer in practice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As someone who works in high tech with a number of H-1B teamates, I don't support what Trump is doing. It's a complex issue. On the bad side, I have seen people with H-1B visas get lower salaries, work long hours, and get treated like they are stuck because their visa is tied to their employment. I don't see how these changes to the visa process would address this issues, other than raising the salary requirements.

I don't see how this will help companies. There is a shortage of tech workers, both US born, and from other countries. Whenever we interview for a new position it takes a long time to find someone. I see no evidence of some large pool of high skilled and unemployed US engineers. In my experience, you have a better chance of getting hired if you are a citizen, it's less paperwork and lawyer work. </TEXT>
