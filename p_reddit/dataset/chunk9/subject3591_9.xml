	<TEXT> Cool, thanks for a reply.  If you're ever here, check it out!

edit: just thinking some more.  Go to the nearest Mexican place and order three "soft" (that's the egg batter) relleno with a tomatillo salsa and there will be almost no flour, and very tasty! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I at some great fried cheese yesterday.  This fried cheddar looks horrible.  Anyway, my deep fried cheese yesterday was stuffed inside a hot pepper and battered with a mixture of egg and a little flour.  It's called a relleno, and I don't think a little bit of flour and veg will hurt your keto diet.  Will it? </TEXT>
