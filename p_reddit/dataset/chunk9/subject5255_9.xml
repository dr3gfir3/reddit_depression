Even if they cast a Tibetan actor to play the role, it would probably make a backlash for playing a racist stereotype character worse. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIL the reason why The Ancient One in Doctor Strange casts Tilda Swinton causing whitewashing backlash because The Ancient One was already a racist Stereotype old wise Asian character and either decision would still receive backlash so they decided to just choose a talented Actress to play the part. </TITLE>

	<TITLE> [serious] What's up with the hate with La La Land in r/movies </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-04 12:19:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's shocking how many people here hate La La Land.

- Movie had such a great innocent message.

People who just want to peruse their dreams.

It's beautiful and simple. 

And the filmmaking is pretty incredible. Nobody makes movies like this unless it really is coming from a place of passion and love for movies.

- I get it. Just because someone worked hard on the movie doesn't automatically make it good.

But you can't atleast admire the effort?

But no, FUCK THIS MOVIE.

It's boring. so underwhelming. Worst Movie I've ever seen!

*these are actual comments I've read here's my link

https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/67vitq/when_people_say_la_la_land_is_overrated_i_show/?sort=new





- I get it people have their own opinions.

If you think the movie is just okay.

Then that's fine, totally understandable, but I'm not talking about people like you tho.




La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical comedy-drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle, and starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a musician and an aspiring actress who meet and fall in love in Los Angeles.

	<TEXT> I had a dream where I was fully aware of it.

I'm not sure if it's Lucid Dream because I wasn't able to control any of it.

While I was in the dream, for some strange reason something triggered me to realize that this wasn't real.

So literally the first thing I wanted to do was to fly and it's not happening.

It felt like a bad trip because I felt trapped and I tried to wake myself up but I can't. There was more stuff I can remember but yeah...

But eventually I did woke up like in the middle of the night and I just went back to sleep.

I never had a dream like that ever since, like 5 years ago.

I'm not sure if it counts in my life because it's a dream, that was definitely a surreal experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone know any likeable one note characters?

Basically a character that is simply one dimensional and doesn't have alot of depth but just has a presence that allures you.

So Likeable that kinda makes up for that one character flaw.

Can a personality of a character make you forget that?

For some reason I can't think of any right now but I'm confident there are some that are just on the tip of my tongue, I just know it.
