	<TITLE> Unexperienced Emotions? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Is anyone else experiencing previously unexperienced emotions due to nofap? I've usually been a pretty desensitized guy, looking at gore and even attending funerals without being too emotionally shaken. Ever since starting nofap, my emotions have amped up what seems to be an infinite degree. I almost cried because a girl called me cute. Is this normal? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 21 Day Check-In! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-30 01:47:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a 16 male, and I finally reached my 21st day, marking my 3rd week. I have a message for beginning Fapstronauts: It is not impossible. The first 15 days are absolutely the hardest. Having relapsed 5 times, I know how difficult it can be to relapse and start up again. The first week of nofap is slow, with long drawn-out days where all you can think about is fapping. Once you get past your 1st week, the days start to accelerate. By the 2nd week, you will encounter days where you will only be tempted once or twice a day. After day 16, I would have days where I wouldn't think about fapping at all. I am by no means flatlining, but I am finally on the verge of breaking my addiction.

Now this does not come with time alone. There is some work involved. There is a simple philosophy that I employed. You can't fap with people around. My mother is a busy-body, she is always doing yard work or work around the house. Whenever I get the urge, I make it a point to go help her. I won't be able to fap with my mom around, so I know that I'll be safe from it for at least the time I'm helping her. It's the same with hanging out with friends, etc.

The times where you are alone are the hardest. I have a period of about 1 hour and 30 minutes to 2 hours where I am home alone every day. The best thing I can recommend is to work out during this time. Working out can place the sexual energy into something more productive than fapping. If you are not looking to workout, then start something that requires full concentration. I have a female friend who is also doing nofap, and she likes to work on art when she gets the urge. My point is: Find something to do. Whether it's art, video games, listening/playing music, etc. Find something that requires complete devotion of attention.

I hope this helps! :) </TEXT>
