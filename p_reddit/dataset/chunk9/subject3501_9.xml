	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure I'm the one that says the weird shit to random strangers.  I once told a cashier Best Buy that I stole the credit card I was paying with. She then asked for my ID. I gave her the ID and she was like wow, you look a lot like the guy in this picture. I proceeded to tell her that my girlfriend had just skinned his body for me and that she's really good at making their skin suits fit real well.  </TEXT>
