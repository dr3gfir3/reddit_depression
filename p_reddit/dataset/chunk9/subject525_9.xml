	<TEXT> People are definitely addicted to the game. Why else would you keep playing something you're constantly complaining about? Sunken Cost Fallacy? Addiction? Optimism (lol)? Probably a mix tbh </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stopped playing HS just before One Night in Kharazan released, but I still watch Kripp, Amaz and Noxious play, I just have it on in the background. You're certainly not the only one who feels like this </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. Haven have a card called Elena's Prayer that synergises with all their heals. Haven does have a lot, but dragon's heals have stronger bodies attached to them like waterwyrm and Ouroboros, and they can each heal multiple times  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> It's becoming easier and easier to remove amulets; they can no longer be thought of as "semi-permanent" </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In vanilla Shadowverse there were select cards that had "destroy an amulet" and these minions had pretty heavy stat penalties. They were tech cards, and seldom saw play at all, primarily because there wasn't really any amulet that was dominating everything else to a level that warranted it.

In DE we got Odin, an 8pp 4/3 that banishes one thing, which can be an amulet. Odin was always a tech card. You played him because you had a specific card in mind that you wanted to counter, be it Mordecai, or you could use it to get rid of any one thing that was posing a threat at the time.

In RoB we got Bahamut, a 10pp 13/13 that destroys everything, amulets included. It was played a good amount as a control tool. At this point, high value amulets are still playable, but at great risk to being destroyed by Bahamut a couple of turns later.

Now we have lightning blast, a 10pp (let's face it) dragoncraft spell that banishes your opponents board, amulets included.

My point is that over the expansions, amulets (that were supposed to be "tempo loss + value over time + hard to remove" things), are becoming more and more risky to develop a deck around, and that worries me, because I love amulets, they have some of the most interesting effects in the game.

**tl:dr**
*Amulets are easier than ever to remove, removing them no longer has to be a tech choice thanks to Bahamut and Lightning Blast. They can no longer be thought of as "semi-permanent", especially the expensive ones.* </TEXT>
