---

That Halloween, the whole town was convinced that any party was going to end with a slasher massacre and all the parents agreed with them. Photos of Terry Lewis in the clearing had been leaked, and no one really argued over the school sponsored Halloween party in the gym.

I knelt in Auguste's room, at his feet, and he crowned me with fake laurels. I wore a white bedsheet tied into a lose chiton, brushing against my knees. My crown nestled in my dark hair, I rose, and tied a red cape about my shoulders.

Auguste kissed my cheek before stepping back and stripping out of his street clothes; instead, he pinned a purple bedsheet into place, tumbling down to his ankles, and draped his shoulders with a navy clock. I gently placed an ad-hoc wreath of plastic grape vines among his barley-gold hair, and he kissed me again.

"Hello, handsome," Auguste said. I smiled into Auguste's hair.

"Flatterer," I replied. Auguste danced away from me, picking up a small glass bottle of clear liquid. He palmed it and held up his hands, grinning at his little magic trick.

We walked to school, shivering in the wet and freezing air, and joined the other students waiting in line to get into the gym. Auguste's fingers danced across my bare forearm, humming softly.

Mr. Fall was a chaperone, the bull mask hanging around his neck. Auguste giggled into mine; I felt Fall's eyes as intently as I felt Auguste's hot breath.

"He's not even hiding," he murmured to me. "He wants us."

"He wants *you,*" I corrected, moving through the endless throngs of people. Fall's eyes never left us.

I'd be lying if I said that party was interesting  all parties are the same, too loud and full of people I didn't really care to speak to. Instead, all I could focus on was the electric tension of Fall's eyes on us, Auguste's fingers wrapped around my red right wrist. An hour more passed, and we walked by the punch bowl.

Auguste tilted the glass bottle into the bowl, and we swept ourselves away quickly, chitons swishing. From the other side of the gym, we watched Fall drink the tainted punch.

"Wait," Auguste whispered in my ear. "It's happening soon."

My hand brushed his waist, twisting the purple fabric. The music shifted, low and intense, and the lights shimmered, the crowds slowing and pressing and melting. Time dilated and stretched out, the music inching slowing through the air.

Auguste and I walked a loop around the gym and back to the punch bowl, where Fall still stood. There was a flush upon his cheeks.

"Nice costumes, boys," he told us. Auguste giggled, alluring. You could tell it was fake, if you really knew him. "Dionysus and Apollo? Very unique."

"Thank you," Auguste said. "You inspired us!"

"Mhm," I agreed. Fall grinned, feral around the edges, and it matched the grin on his bull mask.

"Well, you guys look great," Fall said.  "I'm glad you were so inspired. Are you enjoying the party?"

"Yeah," I lied. "But we're probably going back to my house to watch horror movies soon."

Auguste leaned his body against mine, and gripped my wrist. Fall watched the movement intently.

"You two be careful," he told us. "There's a murderer out there."

One was standing in front of me.

"I know," I told him, soft and serious. Fall stiffened.

Auguste gripped my cloak as we left with a handful of others, the drizzle turning into a pounding rain. Our chitons became slicked to our bodies, yet neither of us seemed to notice the cold. We walked along the sidewalk, the others falling away from us until we were alone. I know we really weren't; my hand slipped from Auguste's waist to the slit in his chiton, parting it to touch the bare skin of his thigh. Auguste laughed, arms twining around my neck and lips pressing against the corner of my jaw.

"Come on," I said loudly, and we ducked into the woods. I knew we were followed.

Auguste danced from my grip and undid his bedsheet chiton, letting it fall to the earth and reveal his nudity to the world. In the misty grays of the rainy forest, he shone white and vibrant. I followed him, stripping off my own costume and barring the twisted red of my birthmark.

"Follow me," Auguste sang, sweeter than a trilling songbird. "Follow me, follow me"

My feet were silent; the murderer's crahsed against the underbrush. He was a shadow in my vision, lured by Auguste's luring dance.

"Follow me, follow me, follow me"

I let the murderer come in front of me, the rain flowing down the valley and ridges of my body. The murderer let his mask fall to the ground, forgotten, and behind him I put it over my own face.

Auguste came upon the pond and stopped before the shore, pale and striking, the smooth line of his back to the forest. I watched as the murderer came behind him, his hands on Auguste's bare hips.

"I've caught you," Fall declared, proud. Auguste laughed like a mockingbird.

"No," he declared. From the trees, I came up behind and wrapped my arm around Fall's neck. He choked, shocked, and I dragged him from Auguste. My foot stepped down on the side of his knee with a crunch; Fall screamed and Auguste kept laughing.

I pinned him down, hands around his neck and squeezing, pushing him down into the mud. Fall's legs kicked out until Auguste sat on them, and Auguste reached around to take the bull mask off of me and put it on himself. I bent down, mouth opening, and sunk my teeth into his jugular. Auguste wrapped his arms around my shoulders. I bit down and wrench my head back, taking Fall's throat with me, and I was drenched in blood and rainwater.

"I love you," Auguste whispered into my ear. I smiled.

We didn't eat Fall's liver.

---

Mr. Fall was the fourth victim of the Woodland Butcher and over the following year, he was called the last. Perhaps in some forgotten and dusty cold case file, his intact liver is mentioned in conjunction with the other victims' lack of them.

Auguste was my homecoming and prom date, slow dancing in matching suits to the clean versions of Top 40 pop hits. Our chaste kisses taste like copper and secrets.

After high school, we were college roommates in the dorms and shitty studio apartments, never really returning to the town we met in for more than a handful of days. More and more Thanksgivings and Christmases were spent in the strange comforts of the Bellefleur-Veisis rather than being outsiders among my own family, until I woke up one day and realized I hadn't talked to my sister for a year and a half.

I didn't call her that day, either.

We have a home now, a townhouse in the city with a fireplace. Above it is a mask of a red-faced bull. Sometimes our son, dark-haired and golden-skin, will put it on.

He is whole and perfect and almost old enough for the stories so he can learn what we are like I once learned. We will teach him like how Auguste's fathers taught him and how my father should've taught me, a line of survival lessons passed on from father unto son.

The Woodland Butcher is still alive in my hometown, a half-feared demigod crowned with horns and pale hair. I lay beside him every night, and Auguste presses good morning kisses to his vivid red face.

Perhaps one day we'll stalk those woods again.

My father  or, at least, the man listed on my birth certificate  knew I wasn't his from the moment I was born, I think.

My older sister, Laura, was born with flawless skin and her father's chin, and I know Laura still has pictures of her sitting upon his shoulders. I was born marred, deformed, and my father knew I wasn't his, that I was a cuckoo bird left by another man for him to raise.

My father called me a freak and a bastard, a silent little devil that ruined playing happy little families. Daddy would yell, Daddy would drink, and I endured in the quiet way I always do. Mom wanted a divorce, Daddy called her a cheating whore and grabbed a kitchen knife.

I was six. I hid in the hallway closet and watched Daddy scream and pace in front of the door, wanting to kill the changeling masquerading as his on. Mom was bleeding in the kitchen. I was not afraid. My teeth ached, baby teeth slowly being replaced by adult ones.

When the cops came to arrest Daddy and bring Mom to the hospital, the social worker called Laura and me brave. I didn't understand why  I stayed quiet in the closet, Laura called the cops. She was asking after Daddy in tears.

As much as she loves me, I don't think she forgives me for that. We moved, and my new first grade teacher tried to molest me. We moved again, our lives uprooted because of me once more. I know Laura doesn't forgive me for that.

I am not my father's son, but sometimes I wondered if I inherited the same sort of madness  if inside me there is the same potential for violence.

I know the answer, now. I know myself in all the intimate ways men fear.

In English, Mr. Fall has us write poetry.

The wounds of Eric's death were still raw and oozing, classes muted and tearful. Mr. Fall looked upon our drawn faces and declared that day would be spent quietly writing.

"Rich sensory details add to poetry's appeal," he told us. "Write what you are feeling."

Mr. Fall understood teenagers.

Most wrote dirges to Eric, mourning songs meant to be wailed before a pyre. Eric's death, no matter how visceral, felt too remote for poetry. It's almost too far for prose. Auguste's ankle was touching mine. My pen glided across the paper.

"I hate poetry," Auguste said with a pout as we left class, our rough drafts left with Mr. Fall. "I'm bad at it."

"No one's good at everything," I told him. "Not even you."

Auguste pouted.

When we got our poems back, Mr. Fall had asked me to see him after class.

---

School had cleared out completely, the long halls empty except for Auguste and me.

"He's scoping out the competition," Auguste told me. "He's jealous of you."

I rolled my eyes. "No, he just wants to talk about poetry, I'm pretty sure."

"You're so narrow-minded," Auguste sighed, before sitting in the common room to wait for me. I went into Mr. Fall's room; he was shuffling around papers, stopping in place when he saw me.

"Hi, Leo," Mr. Fall said. "I liked your poem. It was very different from your classmates. Even Auguste's."

"Well, we're not the same person," I said, slouching down into my chair. "Auguste isn't much of a poet."

"But you are," Mr. Fall said. "Did you write it about Auguste?"

Both the dark and red halves of my face were good at hiding blushes. "...Why?"

"You two are very close."

"Yes," I replied. I did write the poem about Auguste. I didn't like how Mr. Fall looked at me, intent and calculating.

"You have a very mature style of writing," Mr. Fall said, steering the conversation to gentler waters. "There's a poetry competition, at the end of November. I think you'd do very well in it."

He handed me a flyer and I took it. It was in the larger, slightly more cosmopolitan town twenty minutes from ours; I barely made the age requirement, my seventeenth birthday on the first November.

"Thank you," I said. "I'll think about it."

When I left the classroom, Auguste was leaning against the lockers and not even bothering to hide the fact he was eavesdropping.

"I'm cold," Auguste whined. I shrugged out of my jacket and draped it around his shoulders, and he snuggled into it with a happy noise. The door to Mr. Fall's classroom slammed shut.

We walked down the hall before Auguste asked, "So was the poem about me?"

"Obviously," I said. "But I wasn't going to tell him that. It's weird."

"It's *cute,*" Auguste said, smiling so hard his cheeks were pink. "I can't believe you! I'm your muse!"

"Jesus, stop," I replied. Auguste leaned against me.

"Anyway, I think Mr. Fall wants to fuck both of us," Auguste said. "Or he thinks too much about us fucking."

"Gross."

Auguste and I hadn't had sex. We've never had sex, in fact. I always thought it was uncomfortable and degrading how the other boys would turn themselves in fools over it; Auguste viewed its promise as a means to an end, without any interest in the messy act. It was another way we fit together and another way we didn't fit with all the rest.

"Do you think Jack Carmike could be a serial killer?"

We were doing homework on Auguste's bed  or, at least, I was doing my homework while Auguste scrolled through Facebook and played detective.

"I mean, he wears a fedora every day," Auguste continued. "And I think he left that weirdo poem in my locker?"

"That one about your thighs?" I said. "I don't think he could do it physically, to be honest."

"Good point," Auguste agreed.

Auguste's door creaked open, and Mr. Veisi poked his head in.

It was easy to tell Alexandre Veisi was, for lack of a better term, Auguste's sperm donor  both were blond and alabaster, but Auguste's savage beauty tamed into something more aristocratic in Alexandre.

"We're making dinner," Alexandre declared. He had the hint of a French accent around his vowels. "Your father and I would like to meet the boy you've been spending all your time with."

He raised an eyebrow at the pretzel we were folded into.

"Uh," I replied intelligently.

"We're having *fesenjan*," Alexandre said, and then turned on his heel.

"Oh fuck yeah," Auguste said, stumbling out of bed.

"Did you tell them you had a boyfriend?" I asked. "Are they cool with it?"

Auguste stared at me.

"No," he said slowly. "My two gay dads are totally not cool with my boyfriend."

"You know what I mean," I grumbled. I tried to straighten myself some before Auguste dragged me downstairs.

The thing about the Veisis is the air of effortless perfection.

Alexandre Veisi was an art dealer. Cyrus Veisi taught history at the University of Washington. Their house was decorated like a magazine, yet warm and lived in. They were gorgeous and charming, the sons the same. It was one thing to spend time in Auguste's radiance, but another to be surrounded by his family and their brilliance.

And I  misshapen thing, cast out from everywhere, alone from my birth  felt strangely accepted.

Doctor Cyrus Veisi, a tall man with skin like polished bronze, brought out a chicken stew spooned over white rice and decorated with the seeds of a pomegranate. He served me with a glass of deep red wine.

"I'm going to assume you've partaken before," Cyrus told me. "And I'd rather you'd partake around responsible adults."

"Thank you, sir," I said. Cyrus's eyes were the color of a flat sea before a tsunami, and they sliced right through into me.

"Such a polite boy," Alexandre said. "How did you get saddled with Auguste?"

Auguste pouted. We ate, the chicken infused with the taste of pomegranates.

"What do your parents do?" Alexandre asked me.

"My mom is a tax attorney," I said, and then without input from my brain, "My dad's in prison."

Cyrus made a calculating noise  not judgmental, just processing. Auguste squeezed my leg. "That's rough for a young man, navigating this world without a mentor."

"Life can be difficult without guidance," Alexandre said mildly. "Someone to help you understand yourself."

Once, Auguste and I went into the city for a day, and as we sat in a coffee shop, men kept sending him drinks in hopes of catching his attentions. He would laugh at them, like all their efforts were the most pathetic things in the world. And why wouldn't he think that, a being of milk and honey promises that could drive men to madness. Was he born like this, or was he taught?

Alexandre smiled like melting chocolate.

"I've never really been a good son," I said. Cyrus tilted his head.

"You're young," he told me. "You can't know that yet."

We talked about the nature of gods in English class as we explored their stories  what makes someone a god rather than a mortal man? Their values, their relationships, their immortality?

I thought that we all have the potential to become so great and terrible only blood can sate us  perhaps gods were just beings that understood themselves without the lies and vanities of men. If we come to understand ourselves at our purest, become something concentrated and raw and *real,* we would become creatures of ichor instead of blood.

It was raining on the night we discovered the Woodland Butcher.

Our stomachs were full of animal and pomegranate, and fat droplets bogged down the pine branches so they bowed to us. We didn't wear jackets. The raindrops were diamonds in Auguste's hair, his feet caked in mud.

We went into the woods hand-in-hand and fearless, barefoot and water-drenched. I felt drunk, the edges of me hazy, and I knew that Auguste was me and I was Auguste, one being in two bodies. Auguste, pale haired, led me into the woods, to the pond, to the water and to the trees. We hid behind them when we heard the sound of rending meat.

Auguste's hair tickled my chin as we leaned over to look, the rain shattering the pond like bullets on glass. Beside the muddy waterside stood a bare-chested creature wearing the face of a vivid red bull with twisting black horns. Below him, supplicating and dead, was a pale youth, his blood slicking across the undergrowth and the bull's chest.

We watched, curious, as the bull tore into the youth with his hands, his intestines tossed out across the clearing like trash. His chest heaved, and before us the bull lifted up the mask and became a man, a man we knew  Mr. Fall, panting and crazed. He knelt down in the grass and muck, hand digging through the youth's belly and ripped out the youth's liver, biting into it and letting the liquid run down his chin.

Before us, Fall ate the youth's whole liver and then left the body for the scavengers to find, melting into the forest opposite us. We stepped out from behind the trees, gathering around the corpse.

"It's Terry Lyle," Auguste murmured. The captain of the soccer team; he had slipped his number to Auguste the other day. "Mr. Fall killed him."

"Mr. Fall is the Butcher," I said, and my words made it true, the trees the only witness. "He's eating them."

"We know," Auguste said. "Only we know."

He looked at me with bright, tricky eyes.

We didn't go to the cops, Terry Lyle's guts up to our ankles. It didn't even cross our minds. We knew what Mr. Fall wanted  to gorge himself on milk and honey like he gorged himself on liver.

Auguste kissed me, chaste, on the mouth. We knew what we had to do. </TEXT>
