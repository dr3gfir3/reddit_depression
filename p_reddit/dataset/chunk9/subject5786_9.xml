	<TEXT> 'Successful' is Conaway's description, which probably just means they got through it without bickering. And, still no date for the open (house) hearing, but the witness list is shaping up:

 Representatives Mike Conaway, the new Republican leader of the House Intelligence Committee probe, and Adam Schiff, the top Democrat, addressed reporters together after Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey and Admiral Mike Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency, testified at a classified hearing.

 "We had a very successful hearing," Conaway said.

 Schiff said the witnesses had provided "some additional insights," and the committee was working together very well.

 Neither responded to questions.

 Schiff and Conaway later issued a joint statement on Thursday's classified hearing saying they remained committed to working with the FBI as it continues its investigation. They said they are currently sending out invitations for witnesses to testify and requesting documents.

 They said they were looking forward to the next steps of the investigation, including an open hearing with former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, former Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates and John Brennan, who was director of the Central Intelligence Agency under Obama.

 Nunes canceled that hearing when it was originally scheduled in late March, frustrating Democrats, but the committee has now promised it will take place at a still undetermined date.

And a welcome reminder:

 Yates and Clapper are due to testify in the Senate on Monday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ryan definitely doesn't give a shit.  House GOP just wanted to pass a symbolic bill in order to dispel their feelings of wholesale failure and to claim they fulfilled their dishonest campaign promises.   Shifting the responsibility to the Senate is actually part of the plan.

They wanted to get it done before recess, but to think passing this will lessen the anger and protests at town halls is a major miscalculation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It is urgent for Americans to think and speak clearly about Donald Trumps inability to do either. This seems to be not a mere disinclination but a disability. It is not merely the result of intellectual sloth but of an untrained mind bereft of information and married to stratospheric self-confidence.

 ...

 What is most alarming (and mortifying to the University of Pennsylvania, from which he graduated) is not that Trump has entered his eighth decade unscathed by even elementary knowledge about the nations history. As this column has said before, the problem isnt that he does not know this or that, or that he does not know that he does not know this or that. Rather, the dangerous thing is that he does not know what it is to know something. 

 The United States is rightly worried that a strange and callow leader controls North Koreas nuclear arsenal. North Korea should reciprocate this worry </TEXT>

 #####Customs and Border Protection (CBP)
 The bill contains $11.4 billion in discretionary appropriations for CBP  an increase of $137 million above the fiscal year 2016 enacted level. These resources ensure the nations borders are protected by putting boots on the ground, improving technology, and stemming the flow of illegal activities in and out of the country. 

 In addition, to meet emerging needs at the border, the legislation provides $772 million in funding as requested by President Trump in his March 2017 budget amendment for improvements to and maintenance of *existing* infrastructure, technology investments, and increased Border Patrol agent hiring. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In December 2012, NPR's Peter Overby wrote that "as the barriers crumble between policy research and partisan advocacy, the building blocks are there for DeMint and the conservative Heritage Foundation to build a powerful operation with political clout."

 Instead, many within the organization felt that DeMint had "made the think tank too bombastic and political  to the detriment of its research and scholarly aims," Politico wrote, along with the "sense that he's made the institution too much about himself."

Interesting.  So, still the primary research arm of the Republican party, but not Trump's Republican party.

 [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/the-fight-for-control-of-the-heritage-foundation/525033/?utm_source=atlfb) reported that the driving force behind DeMint's ouster was Heritage Action CEO Mike Needham, who oversees the group's 501(c)(4) political advocacy arm.

 "To the Trump-averse elements on the board, Needham has pointed to DeMint's growing coziness with the new administration as evidence that the think tank, a beacon of movement conservatism, needs a new steward. At the same time, Needham has been telling pro-Trump board members like Rebekah Mercer that Heritage needs a leader who will follow the president's leadeven going so far as to float White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, a key Mercer ally, as a potential future president, according to one source."

Never mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Investors looking to buy a condo at Trump Tower in the Philippines would have found, until this week, some high-powered video testimonials on the projects [official website](http://www.trumptowerphilippines.com/).

 There was Donald Trump, in a message filmed several years before he was elected president of the United States, declaring that the skyscraper bearing his name near the Philippines capital would be something very, very special, like nobodys seen before. Then there was his daughter Ivanka Trump, now a senior White House adviser, lavishing praise on the project as a milestone in Philippine real estate history.

 After The Washington Post inquired Monday about the use of the Trumps in promoting the Manila project, the links and videos on the corporate website could no longer be accessed. Nonetheless, their lingering connection to the propertys sales pitch shows how difficult it is to separate the president from Trump-branded projects, particularly in foreign markets where there is less oversight of how his image is used. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Senate has confirmed 26 of Trumps picks for his Cabinet and other top posts. But for 530 other senior-level jobs requiring Senate confirmation that are empty, the president has advanced just 37 nominees, according to data tracked by The Washington Post and the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Services Center for Presidential Transition. These posts include the deputy and undersecretaries, chief financial officers, ambassadors, general counsels and heads of smaller agencies who run the government day-to-day.

 Thats less than half the nominees President Barack Obama had sent to the Senate by this point in his first term.

 Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who has publicly expressed frustration with the process, has routinely peppered the White House Personnel Office for updates and called Trump directly to press for faster action on filling vacant jobs at the Interior Department, said two people familiar with his contacts, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity for this report because of the sensitivity of hiring discussions.

Interesting bit here:

 But the nomination process has also been slowed by the unusual degree of scrutiny the White House is giving job candidates. Prospective nominees for senior posts and even some of the more junior ones must win approval from competing camps inside the White House, according to close Trump associates and Republican lobbyists.

 Around the table for weekly hiring meetings are chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon, representing the populist wing; Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, leading the establishment Republican wing; White House Counsel Don McGahn; Pences chief of staff Josh Peacock; and Jared Kushner, the presidents son-in-law and senior adviser, representing a business-oriented faction, according to a lobbyist and several White House officials. For economic appointments, Gary Cohn, director of the National Economic Council, also sits in, as does the presidents daughter, Ivanka Trump, when a hiring decision piques her interest.

 "We make sure the people involved in hiring decisions dont have an objection, Priebus said. To get to that point, youve gone through a long process. If someone has a serious objection, unless it can be resolved, its probably not going to move forward.

 One area where Trump has been productive, by historical standards, is executive orders. He has released 25 executive orders, more than the past two presidents at this time.  (At 100 days, Obama had 19 orders and Bush had 11.) 

 Trump has also declined to pursue his pledges to investigate or "prove" his own conspiracy theories.

 Finally, on inspection, some Trump orders amount to little more than optional advice for the government  not binding reforms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  President Obama, according to the Times sources, thought that acknowledging Russias attempted interference would not counteract their influence, but magnify it, causing American voters to doubt the elections legitimacy. Then candidate Donald Trump was already loudly and frequently claiming, without evidence, that the election was rigged, and the White House did not want to be seen as stepping in on behalf of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

 Obama shot down the op-ed plan, but the administration did not permanently dismiss the idea of alerting Americans to Russias interference, they just decided the first news of it shouldnt come from Comey, on his own in the press, before a formal intelligence assessment could be completed. Comey, having already created an election controversy by publicly shaming Clinton earlier in the summer over her use of a private email server while Secretary of State, apparently thought he was uniquely credible to discuss the Russian efforts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  President Donald Trump expressed confidence Thursday in Congress ability to pass both legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and a spending bill to avoid a government shutdown next week.

 He also predicted that health care legislation would pass "next week or shortly thereafter.

 I wanna get both, Trump told reporters. Are you shocked to hear that?

 Were doing very well on health care. Well see what happens, Trump said. But this is a great bill, there's a great plan and this will be great health care. Its evolving.

 This has really been two months, and this is a continuation. And the plan gets better and better and better, and its gotten really, really good, Trump said. And a lot of people are liking it a lot. We have a good chance of getting it soon. Id like to say next week, but it will be  I believe we will get it, and whether its next week or shortly thereafter.

Everything with this guy is a big blustery promise that is simply unfeasible.  It's always 'coming soon' and 'evolving' and we're always waiting to 'see what happens' which is usually nothing or just abject failure despite consistently being described as something 'a lot of people are liking a lot'.

Ask yourself, if a con-man became President, how would he act?  Because I'd argue exactly like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most normal human beings when making a proclamation like this with a stated end-date would immediately get to work if they weren't working on it already.  Assemble a team, coordinate with the IC, collect the best available physical and circumstantial evidence, deductively craft the most accurate and plausible explanation, and put out a polished, robust report - maybe even ahead of schedule.  

Trump, though, is not like most normal humans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump has zero foreign policy.  Everything is up in the air, pending review, we'll see what happens.  Every day is improvisation day in this administration.  

He treats geopolitical tensions and conflicts like he's running another election campaign.  I'm sure the South Koreans also preferred Obama as Trump's word on the delivery of military aid is now meaningless to them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out the embarrassing party line split:

 Support for accepting refugees still splits largely along party lines. The vast majority of self-identified Democratic voters, 86 percent, support accepting refugees. Among GOP voters, just 23 percent supporting accepting refugees, while 73 percent oppose them. Independent voters back admitting refugees, 58 percent to 37 percent.

Disparity by gender is also pretty significant:

 There is a gender gap: Men back admitting Syrian refugees by a 9-point margin, 52 percent to 43 percent. But female voters support accepting refugees by a 30-point margin: 62 percent to 32 percent. </TEXT>

Trump's a moron. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump's slowly chipping away at the norms, accessibility, and transparency in our federal government,  Basically anything that is for the good is on the block.

This administration must be pinning their hopes on the tendency for people not to notice or complain too loudly when the changes come gradually like this.  But by the end, if this continues unchecked, the degradation and radical shift backwards in this country will be obvious to all. </TEXT>
