Essentially no large websites can work on this model. The fraction of people who are willing to pay for any content whatsoever is vanishingly small, and most people aren't willing to work for free. People are going to either stop using adblock or get used to tracking and native advertising.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Soldiers can wear several layers of armor, though this would make them move slower.

 It doesn't seem counterintuitive to me that dwarves can wear multiple layers of armor. This is dwarves we're talking about, mobility is a distant second consideration behind turning oneself into a medieval battle tank.

It makes sense that flexible materials can be layered, but it seems unlikely that multiple suits of [plate armour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Rustning,_Gustav_Vasa_-_Livrustkammaren_-_32921.tif) could be worn while maintaining any flexibility. It would be much better to simply use thicker (or more riged/textured) plates and/or additional leather and mail layers - plate is already nearly impenetrable. </TEXT>

Not at all. I happen to be white and male, and I certainly don't oppose myself or my female friends and colleagues. 

 Slavery was (and is) a class distinction. 

A distinction that (in the US) created a special bottom class for black people. 

 Jim Crow was an intentional system to keep blacks in a lower social and economic class, imposed by upper-class whites to hoard more wealth and power for themselves.

Themselves and the other non-blacks. 

Look, I don't disagree with you that economic issues are important. I just

a) Don't think that they are more important than guaranteeing basic human rights for women, minority races, and the LGBTQ community. Your right to more money is not more important than a transgender person's right to a washroom or a black dude's right to not get fucking shot. 

b) Don't think it's a wise strategy to alienate minority voters, as they while they reliably lean left-of-centre, they may very well not turn out if they are sold out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Reddit, right now, isn't advertiser friendly

And CSS is to blame? No.

Not directly. 



Reddit's demographics are overwhelmingly young, white, male, tech-savvy, and impatient - people likely to use adblockers, have good bullshit detectors, and not have a lot of disposable income.

Again, not CSS's fault. 

Again, not directly. 

 Reddit isn't North Korea. It doesn't seem like Reddit is even remotely listening to it's user base. This change is a horrible, horrible idea. By all means, redesign your site. Create a new system. But do not take away the functionality that is without a doubt better for a CSS platform over something like a Wix system which I'm projecting they're going to implement. 

Reddit doesn't care about it's userbase because *Reddit's userbase isn't making Reddit money.* 

Paraphrasing Spez,

 1. To make Reddit easier to use generally
2. To make Reddit more inviting to new users
3. To increase dev speed. Reddit runs on a lot of old code, and development in the current code base is painfully slow.

We don't know a whole lot about the changes, but I strongly suspect they will be geared towards 

a) Greatly reducing the technical knowledge required to make page customization (remember user pages are coming soon.)

b) Eliminating the ability to make bonafide eyesores or interfere with basic functionality. (I would consider the custom "users" and "users online" names to be interfering with functionality, and CSS allows removing ads, etc.) 

c) Allowing better ad delivery, probably including adblock evasion.

c) is self-explainatory, and a) and b) could go a long way towards attracting a more advertiser-friendly userbase. The difference between Facebook and Reddit are 1) Old people use Facebook, and 2) Facebook makes a shitload of money, despite regular, unpopular interface changes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How about just use what is already there?

Reddit only earned [about twenty million dollars](http://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/04/29/report-reddit-falling-short-on-revenue-may-close-content-aggregation-site-upvoted/) in revenue this year. Between their approximately one hundred employees, San Francisco office space, and server hosting, I doubt Reddit even breaks even. 

 Killing CSS will actually do the opposite of make money by limiting communities, which are the product being sold.

Reddit, right now, isn't advertiser friendly. Reddit's demographics are overwhelmingly young, white, male, tech-savvy, and impatient - people likely to use adblockers, have good bullshit detectors, and not have a lot of disposable income. To make money, Reddit needs to get a wider (not deeper) userbase and better tools to deliver advertising. Reddit is well-entrenched and not likely to use many users unless the new system is horrible, and reddit can afford to lose some of its current users. It's the sixth most visited website in the US and still can't make money.  </TEXT>

 In a theory in which parameters are added to quantum mechanics to determine the results of individual measurements, without changing the statistical predictions, there must be a mechanism whereby the setting of one measuring device can influence the reading of another instrument, however remote. Moreover, the signal involved must propagate instantaneously, so that such a theory could not be Lorentz invariant.

 It included a round-trip Air Canada flight from Toronto to Miami. In Miami, she would meet up with the tour group and continue on to the Galapagos, off the coast of Ecuador. Everything had been booked more than two months in advance.

...

Meanwhile, the tour company has come through with a promising offer. CBC News contacted Lindblad Expeditions and explained why Russell missed her cruise.

The company said it will book another expedition for Russell, covering all costs except her flight to Miami.

As they should. The tour company failed to deliver her to her to her $10,000 cruise by buying bargain-bin tickets.  </TEXT>

True, it's not Star Wars or anything, but "traditionally" hard sci-fi is more like the Expanse or Red Mars than Neuromancer - the science behind the technology should be worked out, not just not-blatantly-impossible.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Why did you like it? I keep hearing its because of the story and that should be one of the last reasons to like a game, I thought. Why shouldn't I just watch the cut scenes online.

Well, because the story isn't linear. It changes depending on what you chose to do or say. And the gameplay doesn't hold up super well today but it was revolutionary in 2003.  </TEXT>

That's interesting, because it suggests these loans could be informal payments related to his work for the campaign (he drew no salary as Trump's campaign manager, but he appeared to need money.) 

That being said, we already know Manafort's history is incredibly shady, this isn't conclusive evidence anything illegal happened, and it doesn't necessarily implicate Trump himself directly in the loans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The customer did his part in paying for a seat and arriving on time, but because the airline screwed up, said passenger ended up being assaulted.

Overbooking isn't "screwing up," it's standard practice.  [Only about eight in ten thousand passengers are bumped from flights, despite overbooking by about 5%.](https://www.airhelp.com/en/blog/why-airlines-overbook-220/) And just over [one in every twenty thousand passengers are **involuntarily** bumped from flights,](https://www.dallasnews.com/business/airlines/2017/03/20/hold-onto-seat-us-airlines-bump-fewest-passengers-two-decades) since nearly always somebody is happy to take the money. 

The fact is, you **agree** that you may be bumped when you buy a plane ticket, and refusing to leave your seat if asked to is both illegal and unreasonable to the airline, your fellow passengers, and the police (who must then remove you forcibly.) There is nothing wrong with overbooking; for every person who needs to accept a fat cheque and wait for their flight, dozens are able to buy a seat that would have been left empty if the flights weren't overbooked. It sucks this guy wasn't able to fly, and it's horrible that the air marshals mistreated him the way they did, but United Airlines didn't do anything wrong.

 We don't have any codified reason to ban Breitbart. None. They're biased, but we don't ban biased sources. They have ties to the Trump administration, but we have no rules against campaign sites for example. If you can think of new objective source guidelines that could be used feel free to pitch them, but in the meantime, it breaks none of our guidelines.

This gets brought up every month - can we at least have an open discussion about banning low-quality sources? An objective criteria could be difficult to come up with, but I think even a list (pulling from left-wing and right-wing sites) would be supported by the subreddit and help clean up the front page.  </TEXT>
