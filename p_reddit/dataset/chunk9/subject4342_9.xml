	<TEXT>  The issue with a universal smartwatch operating system as it currently stands is that manufacturers just have too hard a time distinguishing themselves. I try on a lot of different smartwatches, and its pretty tough to tell one from the next. Even after a couple of years on the market, manufacturers are still facing an uphill battle convincing mainstream consumers that they need such a device in their life. When you add a device with few distinguishing characteristics in the mix, the fight to stand out becomes that much more difficult.

	<TEXT> Pretty barebones when it comes to details

 Magenta is set to offer its own device as well as redefine how you pay for your device plan each month. While we dont have a lot of information about the device itself, we know its going to be a value-based proposition, designed to offer the hot new features of a $650-$850 flagship phone at a much more affordable price.

 Whats the next Uncarrier plan all about we hear you ask? Were not able to reveal everything about this plan but its likely to be commitment free with lifetime warranty and insurance included. So if youve broken your phone, want a new one or have had enough and just want to return it, T-Mobiles plan will have you covered.

Expected timeline for the new plan is rumored to be Q3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/27/15442994/google-assistant-sdk-smart-speaker-actions-gadgets-raspberry-pi):

 I asked Google what the terms of use would be, and the answer from Chris Ramsdale, a product manager for Google Assistant, is unsurprising. If you want to use the Assistant on an Android device, youll end up following the same process phone makers go through. Commercial terms for other types of devices will roll out over the coming year.

 Ramsdales notes that Developers do not currently have to pay a licensing fee to embed the Google Assistant. He characterized todays announcement as a developer preview ... focused prototyping and evaluating. Google points out one company made a fun mocktails mixer (Okay Google, talk to Mocktails and let me pretend to get hammered.).

 Everything discussed here is opt-in and the features will not work if users do not select a photo of themselves, and that means nothing can happen accidentally or without granting permission. Furthermore, most of the features are only slightly modified versions of existing aspects of the app and pose no additional risk to privacy.

	<TEXT>  **Edit text more easily**

 Besides new languages, Gboard now comes with a new text editing mode with buttons for easy cursor control and the ability to select text, cut, copy, and paste right from your keyboard. To access this feature, select the Text Editing icon in the quick features menu by pressing on the G button (or arrow) in the suggestion strip. Pro tip: if youre trying to up your typing speed, you can also move the cursor by sliding your finger back and forth along the spacebar, or delete by swiping to the left from the delete key.


 **New customization options: resize and reposition your keyboard**

 Now you can resize the keyboard and move it to a position that feels the most comfortable for you. In the quick features menu (press on arrow or G in the suggestion strip), click More (the three-dots icon), and click the one-handed mode button, then you can adjust the size and position of the keyboard.

	<TEXT> Conclusion:

 The S8 doesnt have any clear photographic advantage over the Pixel. Maybe it will if it ever finds a way to use Bixby for more than just shopping or AR for more than just face filters. Right now, though, the Pixel simply captures better photos more often than the rest. It produces richer detail across the entire image, and it does this regardless of lighting.

 I was also pleasantly surprised by the LG G6. I think LG applies more aggressive post-processing to its images than the competition, but its not so aggressive that Id hate the images I was getting out of my G6. 

 What surprised me the most is how the iPhone now feels a generation behind. It was harder to see last year when we pit the iPhone 7 against the Pixel and the less capable S7. But the S8, along with the Pixel and the G6, illuminates the extent to which Apple has fallen behind.

	<TEXT>  To help you perfect your kitchen skills, were introducing the ability to cook with the Google Assistant on Google Home.

 Thanks to Bon Appetit, The New York Times, Food Network and more, youll be able to follow step-by-step cooking instructions for more than 5 million recipes.

They note that it will be rolling out over the coming week.



Step 1: Pick a recipe! Go to the Google Assistant on your Android phone or to Google Search (iOS or Android) and find a recipe. Once you pick your favorite, select the Send to Google Home button. Whether youre at home or on the go, your recipe will be saved.

Step 2: Once youre ready to cook, just say Ok Google, start cooking" or "Ok Google, start recipe."

Step 3: And, for those times when youre not sure if you missed a step or just need to repeat the directions, say Ok Google, repeat or Ok Google, whats step two?

Step 4: While you stir and taste test, you can also continue to get things done with your Google Assistant on Google Home. All while youre following the recipe, you can play your favorite music, ask about conversions (teaspoons to tablespoons, tablespoons to cups -- who can remember that stuff?) and set a timer or two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  today were taking the next step toward continuing to surface more high-quality content from the web. This includes improvements in Search ranking, easier ways for people to provide direct feedback, and greater transparency around how Search works.

* **Search Ranking**: To limit the spread of offensive or inaccurate search results, Google recently updated its Search Quality Rater Guidelines, which human evaluators use to gauge the quality of search results. The updated guidelines provide clearer examples of low-quality results, including misleading information, unexpected offensive results, hoaxes and unsupported conspiracy theories, engineering VP Ben Gomes wrote in the blog post. Google has also tweaked its algorithms to prioritize authoritative results. (from [The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/25/15418490/google-search-snippets-changes-fake-news-offensive-results))

* **Direct Feedback Tools**: Starting today, were making it much easier for people to directly flag content that appears in both Autocomplete predictions and Featured Snippets. These new feedback mechanisms include clearly labeled categories so you can inform us directly if you find sensitive or unhelpful content. 

* **Greater transparency about our products**: Now were publishing this policy to the [Help Center](https://support.google.com/websearch/?p=blog_autocomplete_policies) so anyone can learn more about Autocomplete and our approach to removals.  
For those looking to delve a little deeper, we recently updated our [How Search Works site](https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/) to provide more information to users and website owners about the technology behind Search. The site includes a description of how Google ranking systems sort through hundreds of billions of pages to return your results, as well as an overview of our user testing process.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The supply constraint is blamed on the [lack of oled panels](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/10/15242986/google-oled-screen-pixel-phone-android-investment):

 According to the Electronic Times (via Reuters), the lack of a steady supply of OLED panels was one of the main reasons why Google has had such a hard time shipping the current Pixel phone.

As I stated, Google likely saw this becoming an issue. When the mainly oled supplier is Samsung, there's nothing HTC can do to ramp up production.

	<TEXT> If Google is having supply issues in the U.S. supplying just the Google Store (Fi too) and Verizon, I can only imagine how much worse it would be had it been available through other carriers.

	<TEXT> The difference though is that Apple already had a recognizable brand in place from the start of the first iPhone. If the carriers wanted the iPhone, they had to play by Apple's rules. On the Android side of things, every manufacturer started off building phones with brands that didn't have the same prestige. As a result, the U.S. carriers have been able to push them around in order for them to access their network of carrier customers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't seen many Type A (male) to Type C adapters. I came across [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/RG8180TYKYFEX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8 ASIN=B01ABTHI7C) and Benson Leung had the following to say (emphasis mine):

 "USB Type-C receptacle to USB legacy adapters are explicitly not defined or allowed. Such adapters would allow many invalid and potentially unsafe cable connections to be constructed by users."

 This is because if you combine this adapter with a USB Type-A to Type-C cable, you may create a dangerous condition where two power supplies may be connected together opposing each other using the combined cable

 Long story short : This adapter is a type forbidden by the USB Type-C specification, and should NOT exist. It gets my lowest rating of 1-star because **there is no simple thing that the manufacturer can do to make this adapter correct**. As a consumer, DO NOT buy this cable to convert your USB-A chargers or USB-A hub or host ports

Also, I'm sure it comes down to cost as well for Samsung. With the Note 7 situation, it likely resulted in a large amount of type A Fast Chargers sitting around. Instead of disposing them, they probably saw better use pushing the same charger configuration from last year's models. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a consumer friendly move. Shipping with only a C-C cable would limit the accessories people could use. Old chargers sitting around? They would no longer be compatible. Also, Type C to A cables are the ones that tend to have issues with device damage (think Benson Leung). Having that type of cable already in the box ensures that people will at least have one safe cable to charge their S8/S8+.

 This is quite disappointing, as I was hoping that the S8's switch to USB Type-C would spur the movement away from USB Type-A in wall chargers, portable battery packs, laptops, etc.

Type-A will still be around for quite a while. As nice as Type C is, there's no need to rush the change. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [PayPal's](https://www.paypal.com/stories/us/enabling-more-mobile-payments-in-partnership-with-google) press release on it.

 Coming soon, consumers in the U.S. will be able to use PayPal in Android Pay at retailers from Walgreens to Dunkin' Donuts.

 Initially, users will be able to pay using their PayPal balance and over the coming months we will add the ability to use cards that have been stored with PayPal, enabled by our recent tokenization partnerships with major card networks

 The PayPal integration with Android Pay is supported on versions of Android OS 4.4 and higher, including KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat.
