	<TEXT> In the 1920s, astronomers discovered that the universe is [expanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubble%27s_law). Imagine two dots sharpie-d onto the surface of a balloon as the balloon as it is being inflated: at any point in time, the two dots are growing farther apart from each other. This same effect occurs for two galaxies in our expanding universe; the distance between the two is growing, so that from the perspective of one galaxy (i.e., the Milky Way), the other (NGC 1332) is moving away at some velocity.

We can measure the velocity that a galaxy is receding from our view in the same way that you can hear the siren of an ambulance dropping in pitch (frequency) as it travels away from you. In both cases (of the ambulance siren and of the galaxy light), we know the frequency of the (sound and light) waves emitted. This [Doppler shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppler_effect) of frequencies allows us to know how fast the galaxy is moving away from us, which in turn, lets us know its distance precisely.

Finally, we can turn to a bit of [elementary physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_law_of_universal_gravitation#Modern_form) in order to estimate the mass of the black hole. By measuring the speed of the swirling gas around the black hole (again, by the aforementioned method), scientists can estimate the mass of the central black hole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're absolutely correct in saying that the space between stars is vast, and that the likelihood of any two stars colliding is quite low. The interactions become substantial when we focus on the gas and dust content-- although they have far lower densities than the density of Earth or the Sun, they pervade the interstellar medium. So when the Smith Cloud barrels through the Milky Way disk, its gas content will indeed be colliding with the Milky Way's gas and dust. You might interested in checking some of the state-of-the-art [simulations](http://www.space.com/28119-new-universe-evolution-simulation-is-most-realistic-yet-video.html) that keep track of dark matter, stars, and gas properties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Do supernovae eject matter that far?

Yep, and in galaxies less massive than the Milky Way, supernova can eject *most* of the gas from the galactic disk.

 How would individual ejections gather separately from the milky way and then later collide?

Supernovae tend to affect their surroundings in three phases: 

1. The free expansion phase, in which the ejected mass (1-5 solar masses) expands in a blastwave shock.
2. The Sedov-Taylor phase, in which gas from the ambient interstellar medium is swept up. About 1000 solar masses of material can pile up, much of which gets propelled along the low-density channels up- and down-wards out of the galactic plane.
3. The radiative expansion phase, in which the gas cools in its new environment.

Multiple supernovae can eject lots of material out into the gaseous halo of the Milky Way. This small cloud can continue to gravitationally attract infalling gas outside of the galaxy, such that it grows substantially before falling back into the disk.

 I would think jets from quasar or possibly from the milky way during an active phase was more likely.

That wouldn't be a bad idea, except that the [phase space information](http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/smithcloudtrajectory.jpg) (and sulfur-derived metal content) of the Smith Cloud suggests that it originated from the outer disk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that the yellow dot in the [picture in the article](http://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_medium/public/thumbnails/image/2016/01/29/10/smithcloudtrajectory.jpg) shows where the Sun and solar system will be. The solar system takes about [250 million years](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_year) to around the Milky Way center, so it will only have completed 12% of a full rotation in 30 million years when the Smith Cloud reunites the Milky Way disk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This title is not correct. The article states that the gas cloud could trigger the formation of **two** million new stars, not 200 million. 

Also, the [journal article](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04957) states that the cloud itself is two million times the mass of our sun, and composed of the raw material necessary to form stars. Of course, not all of it will actually be converted into stars, but a significant fraction will remain as interstellar gas after it collides with the disk of the Milky Way.

EDIT: Since this comment appears to be gaining traction, I figured I should say a little more about the [original scientific paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.04957) rather than the press release because it's way more interesting (to me)! The Smith Cloud is a massive high-velocity cloud (HVC) that appears to be in a collision course with the Milky Way. 

One question that astronomers tend to ask about an HVC such as the Smith Cloud is: Did it originate from outside of our Milky Way, or was it launched from the disk of our Milky Way and is now falling back into it? If the former scenario is correct, the Smith Cloud could be a parcel of pristine gas that has been hanging around since the beginning of the universe, and only now is encountering a galaxy (aka, our Milky Way) for the first time. Or it could be a very small dwarf galaxy with an unnoticeably small stellar population. In the latter scenario, the Smith Cloud would have formed from gas expelled from the Milky Way's disk by supernovae (exploding stars); the gas then regroups outside of the galaxy via gravitational forces, accretes mass, and finally begins its return journey back into the Milky Way.

The authors of this paper believe that the latter scenario is what created this massive gas cloud. Because supernovae events change the chemical composition of the gas by increasing the abundance of heavy elements, these astronomers report measurements of the Smith Cloud's ionized sulfur content. They believe that its relatively high abundance of sulfur supports their claim that the cloud originated from gas within the Milky Way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No worries, and I hope my last comment didn't come across in any sort of a presumptuous tone! Anyway, to answer your original question, it seems like the current quasar host galaxy is still detectable and I imagine that it would be interesting to compile radio, infrared, and X-ray photometry of whatever is still emitting. Sometimes there are lags in the light curves at different wavelengths because the photons trace different media or radiative processes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently LaMassa et al. 2015, Ruan et al., submitted, and Cales
et al. in prep. also report on these changing-look quasars. LaMassa et al. was actually the paper that reported the first ever changing-look quasar (but not AGN). 

Also, /u/NeuralLotus, the quasar hasn't "died" but rather lost access to its inflow of accreting material. This could be due to quasar-driven outflows or feedback, or because it simply exhausted all of its accretion disk, or perhaps because of some cataclysmic event. </TEXT>
