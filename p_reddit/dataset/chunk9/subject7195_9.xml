	<TEXT> Right? I don't want to sit here and just bash the book relentlessly or anything, like I said I think Rothfuss is a really talented author. But he just needs to reign it in a bit. He's got the potential the blow the fantasy genre out of the water, but I can't fathom how it's going to be worth the time invested at this point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what you mean. I never said it would, but the main conceit of the book is that Kvothe is retelling his story over the course of three days to the scribe. Rothfuss is using Kvothe to stretch this whole unreliable narrator thing to its bounds. At this point, if he doesn't end with Kvothe, or provide some conclusion for him, what was the point of the 1500+ pages of the first two books relating entirely to Kvothe?

Don't get me wrong, I like the books, and think Rothfuss is a fantastic story-teller. But they were some of the most frustrating reads I've ever committed to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In regard to The Name of the Wind, it has never felt "worth it" to me. The structure of the plot is scattered and all over the place, and it's really just Rothfuss telling one tale after another of Kvothe's crazy, wacky adventures. There's this pretension of an underlying plot, and there's a lot that he does well--better than any fantasy writer out there today--but for how long book one and book two are, I expected much more progress to be made in the narrative. Instead, Rothfuss meanders for 1500 pages. I have no idea how he expects to wrap this up as a trilogy, and I don't want to set myself up for a pessimistic viewpoint, but I can't see it ending in a satisfying way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to do the same thing, but instead I subscribed to Goodreads and set a year goal of 32ish books. This creates a tangible checkoff list for me that helps. I have a real hard time both motivating myself to read, and then remaining focused on it when I do open up the cover. I go through spurts of reading now, reading one book while listening to another on my drive to work one week, then nothing for the next. My unspoken goal is to get 3-4 books completed a month, which is like 1 book a week, but more forgiving. Some weeks I'm not in a good mental state, so setting monthly or yearly goals makes me feel better about what could be a hard to maintain rigid weekly schedule.

	<TEXT> I suppose you're right about the Czech Republic, it would just be a change of government, really. It's wishful thinking, haha.

Though, I'm not sure I agree that just because something is ahistorical, it shouldn't be in the game. Scandinavia exists, for example. Westphalia and Hanover are formable nations, too. While Czechoslovakia never lasted as a country, it's still as much a goal to aspire to such as the like of Sweden becoming Scandinavia, or Hesse forming Westphalia. What's really the point of tag-switching to these nations other than something else to do with your nation?

But I do like the idea of Austria-Hungary. Really, anything that could give the Czechs something else to do after the Hussite narrative goes away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never gotten the Burgundian Inheritance to fire for me, mainly because I'm morally opposed to falling in line with the Habsburg/Papal State pressure early on. You get a lot of diplomatic malus for going the Jiri z Podebrad route. But getting a Habsburg on the throne early and sticking with him can open up a whole big, fun can of diplo-worms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prussia, Germany, Poland. Just takes some effort and culture swapping, but I get what you mean. It'd be nice to be able to have the option to form Czechoslovakia or the Czech Republic prematurely just for kicks. I get that they were under Habsburg rule for all of EU4's time period, but if you can form Germany or restore the Roman Empire before 1821, you can at least allow Bohemia to tag switch to Czechoslovakia and maybe add a cultural union with the Slovakia region or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I looked at my statistics post game and was informed that I had no disasters triggered throughout my playthrough. I think I kind of just take their stability for granted sometimes. I usually end up sparking some disaster somewhere along the way playing someone else. (Looking at you Count's Feud...)

I think Bohemia has one of the most interesting early game starts for HRE gameplay. </TEXT>
