Texas is one of most right-wing states and unlike most of the others it has real economic pull and massive influence on Republican party. And right now Republicans hold both chambers and presidency, if they see it as vote winner they might actually pass it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Heroes and Villains by BBC.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_and_Villains_(TV_series)

It covers several important military leaders, from Atilla to Napoleon, each episode is about 50 minutes long but the introduction can be skipped since it mostly just reiterates widely known facts.

Unless they are wrong of course. Anyway I always liked that series for it's production value and I have wondered how much freedom did they take with some of the history. Especially the ancient and medieval parts.

	<TEXT> It's all about concentration of power. If you put all of it in hands of one actor you basically depend on his good will. It can be individual, company or state. 

Now firearms restrictions are in many ways reasonable, but at this point the system works well enough. Recent terrorist attacks were conducted by cars and illegal firearms not guns owned legally.
Restricting access even more is nothing but a cheap way to get points with panicking voters, it won't help at all. 

Now fighting against state with .38 revolver is absurd. Odds of victory are laughable, the point is not victory however.
It's the simple fact that some resistance will be offered and that people will have capability of defending themselves. That even decades after takeover there will be people capable of fighting back against oppression and that every dictator will have to deal with them like with thorn in his back.

Take a look at Chechnya. The rebels lost, bad, a good thing in a way because they were more like Russian Taliban than anything else.
But the uprising led to Putin implementing more hands off approach on Chechnya out of fear of another costly war.

Same goes for Columbia, the rebels were outgunned by order of magnitude but they still brought government to negotiation table. 
Vietnam is another example where relatively small organisation managed to secure political gains.

Same goes for muslims in Mindao, their power was pathetic but they were annoying enough that Phillipines had to make concessions.

I don't judge morality of these movements (I think I would get banned for it), but the fact is that even limited armed resistance can accomplish much more than wider unarmed resistance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These ratings are not exactly objective because they measure what is essentially subjective. 

For example hate speech laws, right to be forgotten and food libel laws have almost no impact on the ratings even though they curtail freedom of speech/press in an enormous way.

Another problem is that control over information/press is directly tied to how people perceive said control. If you convince people that this or that measure is reasonable in civilized society it will not impact your rating as much.

Finally, humans trouble when it comes to non-binary ratings. That's why youtube no longer has stars. People tended to either give five or one star in order to have more impact on the ratings of the video. 

So in conclusion, the ratings should be taken as a valuable but flawed. Good as a rough estimate but not to be taken as ultimate judgement. </TEXT>

Instead people focus on Americans who were involved in the region decades later.

And don't get me started on how the region turned out after all locals got independence. I know it sounds bad but the fact is that local rulers brutalized their people more than 20th century colonial powers (not 19th century mind you, Belgium itself breaks scales in that century). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I do know a lot about history, at least I think so.

I can describe reasons for 100 Year war and tell you how it contributed to establishment of France as continental power, decline of Navarre and ultimately caused War of Roses and radical change of English monarchy from essentially Norman to really English institution. 

I can tell you about all the times France switched alliances just to bring down Holy Roman Empire, I can tell you how Cardinal Richelieu essentially founded realpolitik and how France allied with Turkish sultan to weaken their common foes.

I can tell you why does the British monarch have title Defender of the Faith and about Britain under Cromwell.

So I don't know maybe I'm just ignorant easterner. 

But what I do know is that in past year the climate around here changed from "We are Europeans we like each other now you frogeaters/barbarians-with-no-taste-who-fucked-us-at-Dunkirk" to "Go away we are better without you, you just kept us down anyway, and better go bankrupt and fall apart or we help you with it."

Seems like shooting yourself in a foot with nothing to gain, on the other hand it's not like Germany/EU likes Israel anyway so pissing EU politicians off won't hurt the relationship much.

On the gripping hand, Netanyahu wants to get some domestic support by looking strong and capable, which I guess trumps (pun somewhat intended)  every other consideration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good idea, but it won't happen.

The thing is: Paradox can't make good AI. The games themselves are good, but when it comes to AI decision making, whether it's pathfinding, resource management or diplomacy, frankly sucks.

For example rulers marrying random low ranking nobles with no traits, allies unable to follow wargoals, armies can't find path, mismanagement of Traders and fleets, England, Spain and Portugal unable to cross sea (they had to add straits just to make it easier).

The list goes on. The point is that AI sucks and Paradox knows it, they don't want to burden already malfunctioning process with more variables. You would end up with AI regularly going bankrupt or even unable to properly make armies in first place.

This leads to rise of far-right which offers solutions (wrong solutions mostly), unlike traditional left parties which pretend there is no need for solution in first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those few seats are almost all Labor has left, SNP took Scotland, Tories and UKIP took poor workers in south, LibDems took already lot of urbanites. 

IF there is one thing Labor can't afford right now it's to loose north.

Oh and BTW, I though politicians should listen to electorate in proper democracy and not say:"Screw you, you bigoted little Englanders!". You might not think their grievances are meaningful but these are one of most vulnerable citizens UK has. Ignore their issues and you are directly contributing to Conservatives winning majority. </TEXT>

Both parties were crippled by that, Republicans are now on top but only thanks to several unlikely factors, Democrats might take back the House and Senate or even presidency thanks to brilliant campaign Trump is doing for them. But if they don't embrace rest of the nation they will fall again. And the circle will repeat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I wouldn't support the strike if it DID cause real damage. As bad as Assad is he is much better than ISIS and we still need his military to secure Syria. 

The strike was meant to be a message, that was clear from the start, sure it might have been motivated by Trump trying to divert attention.


But I personally believe, and this is a hunch based on personally knowing several people with it, that he actually has Alzheimer and that ordering the strike might have been simply extreme emotional reaction to seeing pictures of dead children.

Now that doesn't make him a better person or better president, but I very much doubt that he is even capable of conducting any sort of conspiracy with Russian government. The guy has vocabulary of eight year old and seems unable to go week without humiliating himself. Frankly, if anything he is a definition of useful idiot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know it is funny, in a terrible sort of way. That, in order to fight misogyny, your school decided to deprive you of choice and information. Two things that are best weapons against any sort of discrimination. 

It is also interesting that this is not an isolated incident. In past two decades many western progressives decided that, rather than fight real wrongs in society, they should focus on token issues like language (PC culture, pronouns etc.), fabricated issues like wage gap and absolute non-issues like lack of minorities in Academy awards nominations. 

Instead of fighting real injustice like sexual slavery, misogyny in middle eastern law or infanticide in much of the developing world they started to fight for showing their nipples and for right to not feel offended. And thus they caused more damage to their cause than any conservative ever could.

Anyway, at later start dates it's not much better, the authority of Orthodox religion sucks, because two holy sites are already occupied and one is immediate danger from start. If that was not enough, the Patriarch is vassal, which sounds good but the fact is that he will often plot against emperor. So the emperor might have to kill him, a lot, or the patriarch kills him. Which impacts his piety and thus authority of religion.

	<TEXT> -1 does not seem like much for human player, because we are to CK2 AI what Culture Minds or Politys AIs are to us.

We know the rules, we know how to bend them, we have access to knowledge far beyond anything the AI has. When we see factions forming we pay them off, assassinate leaders, imprison members, we even start small civil wars just to prevent larger ones.

AI can not do any of this, it's behavior is determined by traits of the character, opinions it has of other characters, options defined by devs and RNG. 

AI sucks at this game, it plays as five year old or even worse, it can not plan in the future, it has almost no memory and it can hardly even find path for armies. 

So when it gets -1 opinion modifier it sticks, and it has cascading impact on levies, taxes, factions etc.

TLDR: It might be nuisance to us but for them -1 can be dynasty killer. It might take generation or two but in the end it gets them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When it comes to conspiracy theories you shouldn't start with big lies, start with small ones.

First they are what brought that individual to bizzaro world of conspiracy nuts, second the person in question will not act as defensibly when you contradict him on seemingly minor points.

As an example, if someone says that religion stunted science ask him for a specific example and refute that, instead of explaining him why entire thing is bunk.

Now if someone believes in cultural marxism you should attack minor points of his beliefs. Don't focus on history too much. Conspiracy theorists often believe that historians are corrupt and records falsified. Focus on technical points, more recent the better.

More often then not, these people started with genuine grievances and it escalated from there. Try to understand when and how it all started and that gives you power to end it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, you are done.

Well there is a slim hope for you but it is a big risk.

1. Take few counties in north of France, Brittany seems pretty weak, it will do.

2. Stop attacking everyone and send your heir and all other child family members to court of French king for education, failing that try local Christians. Yeah, survival means converting, but it gets worse.

3. Move your capital to your new provinces, pump all money you can into infrastructure in your new capital and give as many titles as you can to your converted family members. If you have spare money upgrade their castles too. 

4. Take your realm apart. Sorry, you have nice kingdom but you can no longer hold it unless you want your hearth torn out and showed down your throat. Release your vassals, one by one, start with northern counts a proceed to south of England. Make as many new realms as possible, it will slow down Aztecs because of the truces and and problems involving multiple duchies.

5.Finally get rid of your kingdom title, doesn't matter how just do it. And then swear fealty to French king.
in a century or so you can get French throne. If you play your cards right you will be able to form Francia or other empire by then and Aztecs will lose some steam.

	<TEXT> Combination of things, government is one because viceroyalities rip opinions to pieces.

 Apart from that there is issue of religion, Byzantium is one of few, well probably only major realm with heretics in charge while rest of the population is still the main religion.

This means that in best case Byzantium loses century converting all it's provinces and nobles and crushing local revolts, while being attacked on all sides by more monolithic realms. Worse option is a civil war, which is pretty much unavoidable because emperor and his heir suck balls. 

The dynasty is replaced but the problem remains because new dynasty has to deal with adventurers for next few decades while being under attack from south and north. Not to mention local revolts from few Iconoclast provinces that you have to convert back.

Last but not least, the lands of Byzantium are incredibly vulnerable. As we all know, enemies with HW CB are both in north and south, and to make things worse they are big, powerful and consolidated. 
Even if emperor wins wars against external aggressors he depletes his forces, making factions powerful enough to challenge him and leading to another civil war.

It's a clusterfuck, and AI has almost no way to manage it because, to be honest, it's barely capable of survival anyway.

So those are the reasons. </TEXT>
