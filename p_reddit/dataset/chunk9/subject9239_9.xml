	<TEXT> Best cure for Plantar's Warts. Had two laser surgeries to rid a cluster of these warts on the bottom of my foot. Both times they grew back. Checked the internet for homemade remedies and found out soaking a small piece of cotton in apple cider vinegar and duct taping it to the wart cured it in 45 days (it was the size of a quarter). </TEXT>
