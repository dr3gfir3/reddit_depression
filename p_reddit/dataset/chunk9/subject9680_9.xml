	<TEXT> It's currently raining and I'm receiving a fair amount of water into my sump pump. The pump is running frequently (every 15-30 seconds) for about 1 second intervals. Does anyone have any ideas what the issue could be? When I hold the floater up the pump will drain the water completely, but it will not do so on it's own. This only began in the last couple days, previously my sump pump would run only as needed and for longer periods of time. Please help!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was a junior in high school the graduating class above me pulled a few pranks. My high school had a statue in front of the building with Nicolaus Copernicus' head on it and early in the year the head went missing. We went almost the entire year with it missing and administrators had no clue where it went. Sometime later that school year, around February or March, the head appeared out of nowhere attached to the top of a sign with our school name (about 20-25 tall) with the head attached to it and a giant dildo glued to the forehead. They never found out who it was. That same group then photoshopped the faces of two assistant principals onto a photo from a porno and dropped a ton of them in the halls all around the school after 9th period that day. In the photo the male principal's face was on the female body getting fucked by the the male body with the female principal's head on it.  </TEXT>
