	<TEXT> I don't like it. I never mute people when they are toxic, sometimes it's funny to read (just don't participate otherwise it hurts your focus). I only use mute for spammers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good link. I should say it another way: I would like everything to be specified (In ideal world it would be), but people like to misuse things, so it can create more bad than good. If it was just another layer of confidence that you know that if it works here with this order it will work with another compiler with the same order then it would be great. But in real world people will try to use it making "compact code", that will be hard to read and without composition cos you cannot take arguments out or change their order without breaking things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice game. Also 4 months for 1st game is good timing. Graphics are minimalistic but they look good, I don't like only 1 thing - line could look better, smooth, antialiased. Rated 5 stars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are just getting into game development then you will make it with unity a lot quicker. It was designed for 3D, but there are lot of games for 2D, so you can do that. However if you want to make more games over time you may consider learning java/c++. You can still make great games with unity, but if you want to have more control over your game or make some advanced stuff you will need to do it with native platform code. So to sum up, try unity, if you grow big you may easily use something else later, if u start with hard stuff you may spend 1 year learning and making your game to just discover that you failed because you didn't promote it well or something else. Better to start with few small titles and build your success over time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they just pretend to make it to prevent kids buying IAPs in mobile games. Truth is, they made it to prevent partners from clearing funds on credit card ;p </TEXT>
