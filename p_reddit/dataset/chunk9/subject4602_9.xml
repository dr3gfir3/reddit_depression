	<TEXT> Oh no I'm all for interpretating the story however you want. Hell, I've done loads of projects along those exact lines. The trouble, in my eyes, comes when you state it as fact. Spreading misinformation can hurt the artist's original intent as well as discourage others from finding their own meaning in the art. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Originally released in early lyrical form in Neil's book, Traveling Music, this song is about his life and the experiences he's had.

___

Factory town = Where he grew up OR (possibly) Cleveland

Close to the edge = Yes album

English winter = England (wrote FBN about this trip)

Moving picture = Moving Pictures (obviously I think)

Razor's edge = possible reference to The Pass?

African village = his motorcycle trip across Africa (wrote Masked Rider book about this and I believe Mystic Rhythms as well)


___
The early lyrics being put in a book about the music throughout his life (more than worth a read by the way, my favorite book of his and I may read it again...) I feel like this is the implication throughout the song. I'd love to know if I missed anything!

	<TEXT> I adored the album upon release and still enjoy it, but I have to completely agree with most of what you say. It's annoying to hear about disliking it making you only a fan of one side of DT, whiny, etc. Do people completely overlook the multiple vocal glitches throughout the album and the fact that they sacrificed multiple minutes of a guitar solo for Nomac songs?! It's just kind of sad to know that there was so much more that could have been. They really could have done better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not doubting you're good there, but we certainly have flopped positions. Most podcasts are popular out of america (Lore, Serial, TAL, NPR, Night Vale, You Made It Weird, and many others). Both places are good at both, not doubting you at all. Hell, the more to enjoy the better! I'm just saying that when it comes to Podcasts it seems that America is the one that exceeds at least in my experience. </TEXT>

I asked why she wasn't trying to go over to [Person]'s house and she said "I just don't really like being around [Person] anymore." That's when our friendship was solidified. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the listen through has had a hell of a run, but with my increased school work load as well as more personal difficulties, I am not going to be able to continue. So what I ask is that if you are interested you let me know and PM me an example of one of your posts.

The other thing, and most important, that I wanted to say is that we are going to be accepting moderator applications for the Subreddit's CSS. You won't have full moderator privileges, but there have been numerous requests to update the look of the sub and, after some convincing, Antidote told me I can go ahead with this post. Below this is a form I'd like you to fill out and PM to me along with a page that shows your ability.

Submissions will close next Friday at 12PM EST and the new moderators/new listen through leader will be announced the next day.

 Cheers!
