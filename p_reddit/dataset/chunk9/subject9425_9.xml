	<TITLE> "rooted" my huawei p9, can't do some features with it now. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-03 09:40:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay I think I fucked up. About a month a go I tried rooting my P9. Now to root it, we have to unlock bootloader and use an external program outside of supersu and kingroot. So I unlocked bootloader installed the recovery mode, then I went to install xposed. Softbricked the phone.

I restored the phone but bootloader is unlocked still and apparently I'm still rooted.

Features I can't do: remove system administrator, use Snapchat (having to use Casper), change background images, install customer recovery. Those are what I've found so far.

I've tried to relock bootloader, but to no avail. So I looked up a factory version of the phone but I don't know how to install it. Or if it would even work.

Is there anything I can do to get my phone back to what it was, or am I screwed?

	<TEXT> Jagex updated the currency pouch so that you can buy a bond from anywhere. People are now speculating that the "Get Bond" button will be put in other places.

If you would like to know more, **Get Bond** </TEXT>

Went to run homebrew using the OOT entry point, and instead of launching the Hombrew Launcher, I got kicked back to the home menu with an error, saying:

 "*An error has occurred, forcing software to close.
The system will now restart.*"

Have I installed OOTHax wrong?
