	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thought it would be fun to create a little EP consisting of my own production along with Aesop Rock's vocals, i don't consider myself to be a great producer but i thought it would be worth posting here. Any feedback is highly appreciated

	<DATE> 2017-03-17 21:00:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, im a big fan of road trip movies, or road trip-esque movies where a character or a group of characters need to go from point A to point B, the movies don't necessarily have to be great, but for some reason these type of movies i find incredibly relaxing and easy to watch.

Here are some of the ones i have seen and enjoyed

- Harold and Kumar (all 3)
- Euro Trip
- Road Trip
- The Guilt Trip (Guilty Pleasure)
- Stan Helsing (Guilty Pleasure)
- Little Miss Sunshine
- Due Date
- Sex Drive
- Crystal Fairy   the Magical Cactus

If anyone can give me suggestions it would be appreciated.  </TEXT>
