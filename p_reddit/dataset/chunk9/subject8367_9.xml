	<TEXT> Yes exactly, the 1 confirmed painting by Caravaggio has a rectilinear trajectory and was painted before Galileo introduced the theory. The others (by known artists) all have a parabolic trajectory and come after the theory. This leaves the unknown painting (supposedly Caravaggio) with a parabolic trajectory in a strange place.

This by no means confirms that it isn't Caravaggio but it's certainly an interesting perspective.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the owners of a house near Toulouse, France went to fix a leak in the ceiling, they discovered a well-preserved canvas depicting the biblical beheading of General Holofernes by Judith. Experts believe the canvas was painted between 1600 and 1610, and that it could be the work of the Italian master Caravaggio. However, this belief is disputed and is currently being investigated by the Louvre Museum in Paris. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could you elaborate on why this was necessary. If there are existing methods of determine how much urine is in pools (I think I read in another article about this there are), why do we need another one? I trust that these guys wouldn't have gone through all this trouble if it wasn't worth doing, but I guess I'm still trying to figure out why it was.  </TEXT>
