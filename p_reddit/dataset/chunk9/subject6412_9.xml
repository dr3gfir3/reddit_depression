	<TEXT> My god, so badly. And not necessarily based on the games (though I'd like to see Revan), but just in the same time period. So far removed that you can really go anywhere with the story while still feeling very much like Star Wars.

It's the perfect place to build a new trilogy that would appeal to new fans and diehards alike.

EDIT: And HK-47 of course :) </TEXT>

"That's the problem," I said. "My name is Daniel. Daniel Rabinovitch."

"Oh," the ranger replied, looking as dazed as I felt. I could tell I was muttering, something I had done since I was 12 under times of duress. I breathed in.

I breathed out.

In less than 24 hours I had gone from laying in my relatively comfortable dorm room, staring at the walls in reckless boredom...

...to being attacked by a goddamn fucking monster in the middle of Bumfuck, PA. 

"Imagine what you'll know tomorrow," I heard Agent K whisper in my mind.

"...truck is outside of town. I think we should just book it, try our best to get back to the closest civilized town and... hell, I don't even know. I mean how deep does this go? Who the fuck is funding this whole... town? That woman? That Thing? Jesus, yesterday I was just..."

He was rambling. I wasn't even sure for how long.

"Hey," I said. "Your name is Sam, right?"

He stopped himself, took a deep breath. I could see the worry in his brow, the shotgun shaking in his grip. He was beginning to look like he was about to lose it. Considering what we'd been through, I certainly didn't blame him. 

But if one of us was going to go ape shit, it probably shouldn't be the guy with the truck and the gun.

"Sam?" I asked again calmly, trying to get his mind to focus.

"Sam," he finally replied. "Yeah. It's... nice to meet you, Daniel."

There was a moment of silence as we took in the surrounding trees and wilderness we found ourselves in. No birds, no buzzing bees. Just dead, sunlit silence.

"That Thing killed my parents,"
I found myself saying. "My sister too."

"I'm... sorry," Sam began. I raised my hand, stopping the stranger's apology, something I was used to hearing throughout my life.

"Why did you come here?" I asked him.

"To stop It," he replied with newfound confidence. "To stop It for good."

"Me too," I said after a moment.

Sam sighed heavily, his grip loosening around his shotgun as he lowered his arms. I could actually see the weight of his stress leaving his body as he looked up, towards the sun shining brightly overhead.

"I'm afraid," he started. "I'm very afraid. But I came here to stop It. I know I did."

"Then that is exactly what we do," I said as I got to my feet. I began to search through my jean pockets.

"That doctor. The woman... she had the same last name as you."

"Yeah," I said, finding the miniature box in my front pocket. "Before you ask, I've never seen her before in my life. Frankly, she gives me the fucking creeps."

"You have no idea," Sam muttered through a defeated smile. "Know anything about this place?"

"Yes, actually," I answered, my hands now looking for the small bottle in my inside jacket pocket. "My parents would take us here when we were kids. It used to be a big coal town. They abandoned it when some mine fire tore through the underground caverns."

Sam grunted something. He began to glare towards the distant town. He seemed to be expecting something. Some monster movie tentacle to peek up over the facade of buildings. Or maybe a hooded army of cult members marching towards us with torches and pitch forks.

It's what I was expecting anyway. But no. Things were quiet, almost peaceful. The vehicles that the doctor's goons arrived in were now missing and any signs of the gory display from earlier were long gone.

"The fire is still burning, you know, to this day. And I know where the mine entrance is."

"Huh," Sam mumbled, still glaring absently at the old town. "Interesting."

"Hey!" I nearly shouted. He turned around to face me.

"Oh," he said for the second time in ten minutes, thought finally registering on his face.

I held up the matches and lighter fluid.

"Let's stop It," I said.
