	<TEXT> In the summer of 2014, Craig Diangelo thought he was on the path to an easy retirement. A veteran of the tech industry, Diangelo got his start as a COBOL programmer in the 1970s. Over the next four decades he learned dozens of new programming languages and kept up with the evolution of the sector from mainframe computers to PCs, from the early days of the web to the advent of cloud computing. He held a position as a senior advisor to the CTO at a major health insurance provider, then took a job as data storage specialist at regional utility Eversource Energy. He lived near his office in Berlin, Connecticut, made a six-figure salary, and was working toward a comfortable pension. And then, in October, he and his fellow staffers were called into an all-hands meeting with the companys chief information officer. </TEXT>

_________________________________________________
Does that mean these devices are internet? I hope they secure them better then everyone else does. What an immensely over-engineered product.  No wonder it costs $400. They claim it can deliver four tons of force and remotely disable Produce Packs.  Now they say that they need to be able to disable the packs because "so we can manage a very tight supply chain, because our product is live, raw produce, and has a limited lifespan of about 8 days."

Only lasts 8 days! What a terrible plan. How many times will a customer keep buying the product if they go bad before their done? </TEXT>

Globally, we produce 300 million tons of plastic every year, 78 percent of which is NOT reclaimed or recycled. And according to a study from Plymouth University, plastic pollution has driven over 700 marine species to the brink of extinction, while some estimates suggest that at least 100 million marine mammals are killed each year from plastic pollution." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mirai, the botnet that threatened the Internet as we knew it last year with record-setting denial-of-service attacks, is facing an existential threat of its own: A competing botnet known as Hajime has infected at least 10,000 home routers, network-connected cameras, and other so-called Internet of Things devices.

FURTHER READING
Why the silencing of KrebsOnSecurity opens a troubling chapter for the Net
Hajime uses a decentralized peer-to-peer network to issue commands and updates to infected devices. This design makes it more resistant to takedowns by ISPs and Internet backbone providers. Hajime uses the same list of user name and password combinations Mirai uses, with the addition of two more. It also takes steps to conceal its running processes and files, a feature that makes detecting infected systems more difficult. Most interesting of all: Hajime appears to be the brainchild of a grayhat hacker, as evidenced by a cryptographically signed message it displays every 10 minutes or so on terminals. The message reads: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The FCC conducts public-interest reviews of mergers when FCC licenses are transferred, but AT T and Time Warner have been trying to structure their $85.4 billion deal to avoid direct transfer of any licenses. That means Time Warner has to get rid of its FCC licenses, including one for a TV station in Atlanta, before it's swallowed up by AT T.

FURTHER READING
AT T says its merger with Time Warner is exactly what customers want
The FCC helped Time Warner achieve that this week by approving a sale of its WPCH-TV license in Atlanta for $70 million to Meredith Corp., which was already operating the station for Time Warner under a separate agreement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Enter a new study device developed by MITs Hyunho Kim. His idea is to work with a unique class of materials called metal-organic frameworks. Organic, carbon-based molecules form links between metallic ions to create interesting 3D structures that can have lots of open space internally. This allows the structures to do strange things, like make a high-pressure tank hold far more hydrogen gas after its first filled with granules of the right metal-organic framework material.

Kim worked with a zirconium oxide paired with an organic molecule. The combination has the useful quality of grabbing and holding onto water vapor at lower temperatures, but also letting go of that water as the heat rises. So the basic idea is that a device based on this material could passively harvest water vapor from the air at night and then release it (to be collected) in the heat of the day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The GPS-guided MOAB weighs 21,700 pounds and is filled with 18,700 pounds of H6 explosive. The thirty foot long aluminum casing weighs only 3,000 pounds, which is an unusually low proportion of the bomb's overall weight. Unlike many bombs, for which steel shrapnel is a primary effect, the MOAB is designed to generate explosive shockwaves and is stuffed as full of as much explosive as possible. A bomb that kills through overpressure, the MOAB is well suited for destroying cave complexes. Waves of pressure entering a cave system cause injuries and fatalities, and the shock can collapse earthen tunnels.

	<TEXT> Alert sirens, especially older ones like those used in Dallas, are usually controlled by tone combinations used by the Emergency Alert System broadcast over the National Weather Service's weather radio. Alternatively, they can also be controlled by Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) or Audio Frequency Shift Keying (AFSK) encoded commands from a dispatcher or command center terminal sent over UHF radio frequencies that were set aside for emergency agencies' use by the FCC in 2004 (these are typically in the 700 MHz range).

If the frequency used by the sirens in Dallas for DTMF or AFSK wasn't monitored, an attacker could conceivably broadcast an endless number of guesses at DTMF or AFSK encoded commands until the sirens were set offand then just play that command signal repeatedly. But it's possible that someone managed to gain access to documentation for the siren system and knew exactly which commands to send. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have to be insane to think Russia is going to use nukes. It called mutual destruction. If Russia hits  anyone then  every will hit them. 

Russia has 1700. The US has 1700 active one, the UK has close to 200, it is rumored that Israel could have as much as 400. With that many nukes there will be no winner.

The company announced in a blog post that starting today it will not serve ads on videos produced by channels with fewer than 10,000 total views. That means any new creators looking to be in the YouTube Partner Program will have to wait until they accrue 10,000 total views on videos on their channel before they can start showing ads and collecting revenue. </TEXT>
