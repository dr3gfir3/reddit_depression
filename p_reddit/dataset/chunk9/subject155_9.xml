It can't be treated as an issue where there are merely two equal opinions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a very relevant story because all of the Russia conspiracy theories and other ideas being circulated are rooted in the inability of the Democrats to accept they lost to a better candidate. They have to face the reality, accept what happened, and then move on, and I know that many Democrats are screaming at them to do that, to recognize what went wrong and ensure the same mistakes are not made the next time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few years ago I went through a premonition phase. I would have intense vivid dreams, and then the events I saw in the dreams would come to pass over the following weeks and months. The final dream was the most vivid of all. It depicted a great war. I was fleeing the destruction while B52 style bombers flew high overhead. I found a newspaper reporting that most of the people of the world had been killed and the survivors only numbered in the tens of thousands. I'm still waiting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the organic fad was first starting there were articles suggesting that organic fruits and vegetables had several times higher vitamin content than those grown with synthetic fertilizers. That was contradicted later and now the consensus seems to be that there is no difference in nutritional content.

Pesticides are a big concern, although in many cases you can discard the outer layer to avoid eating the residue. The biggest concern would probably be the [effects](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBbkwlGM7X0) of pesticides on the environment where the produce is grown. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People wanted to know how much he earned and what percentage he paid in tax. Hillary had started a rumor that he didn't pay any tax and Democrats wanted proof that he paid something before they would consider voting for him. The election has now passed, so anyone who was withholding their vote cannot now vote retroactively.

One of his tax returns was illegally leaked recently though, and it shows he paid about 40 million dollars in tax on an income of 150 million, proof he has paid more than a fair share of tax. </TEXT>
