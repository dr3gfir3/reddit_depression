	<TEXT> That picture looks like Spanish amnesia. Smells and looks great but just don't seem to get me as high as other amnesia I've had. Normally much lighter green colour. The last batch of amnesia I got was as you described in main post. Very dark. Yes it's got a very distinct smell. I actually get spicy more times but you do get that sweet smelling amnesia too. 
Just my experience with this strain  </TEXT>

You see quickly how much the tastes   strength differ. Obviously everyone has different tolerances and tastes. I can't smoke joint of pure dust. Tastes bad.  </TEXT>
