	<TEXT> I've noticed a few times that some of the enemies mainly in the Giants husk are completely immune to damage.

This morning I found a Fallen Walker PE in Giants Husk, ran over to complete it to find that the Walkers legs were immune to damage. Not the whole Walker, just the legs. 

In the 4 minutes I had on the timer I managed to take off about 1/5th of its health.

Anyone else getting this?
