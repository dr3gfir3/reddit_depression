	<TEXT> That show is painfully unfunny. We get it, dog smokes weed and humps a big stuffed animal and gives shitty advice. And Suicidal Frodo just never learns. Ha ha.
It has all the sophisticated humour of an unholy threesome between any character recently portrayed by Adam Sandler, Paul Blart and Ted 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We saw Annie('s Titan) shed a tear when Eren was recovered from her mouth too.
She just killed a lot of people and failed to capture Eren. All that meaningless death has its toll on her aswell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in a similar place. My ex-girlfriend (who i had been together with for almost 3 years) cheated on me abroad and dumped me as soon as she got back in August. I lived with her for about a month and a half after that and she was even going to invite the guy she cheated on me with to stay with her. I was so furious and angry all the time and now, after a few months, i feel nothing but sadness and miss what i had with her so much. I miss cuddling up and watching shows and playing with her pets and hugging and kissing her right before i went to class/work etc.

I just constantly feel like the best part of my life is now over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By the time whatshisface gets here, i'll be gone. Though it is not a very big city, so... 

It's just infuriating that the people around me IRL don't seem to care. It's maddeningly infuriating that she just shamelessly invites this bastard over and keeps lying to me. I can't believe i ever dated such a person, i waited and waited for her to come back from there and the moment i see her again, she dumps me, lies to me, lies to me again and just acts like a completely different person altogether. 

With all this, i can't help but see myself as blind and stupid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as i would absolutely love that - i adore animals, and that makes it even harder to estrange myself from her pets - the new apartment landlord doesn't allow any pets.

I live in Estonia. Sadly i doubt there are many here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My post from about a month ago:
https://www.reddit.com/r/TrollYChromosome/comments/3j2skq/my_so_just_got_back_from_a_month_in_tunisia_broke/


For the past month, i've been living with her and a friend of hers, i moved here 2 years ago, we dated for almost 3. She went to Tunisia for a month and immediately broke up with me as soon as we met up. She lied and didn't tell me about the cheating but a few days later i asked her straight up once more about it and she said that it was true. For the past month i've been trying to deal with this and actually tried to maintain a somewhat friendly relationship on account of her just constantly confirming that it was simply a drunken mistake and she regrets it more than anything else. Though it was tough, i could see us staying as friends anyway and then she drops this on me: the fucking piece of garbage she cheated on me with is coming to visit her and is going to be living here for awhile. Turns out she did have feelings for the guy, so much that i was just non-existent to her there. Needless to say i'm not going to actively pursue a friendship with her constantly lying to my face anymore.

My best friends are almost never around, we finished uni and pretty much went our separate ways. They're mostly in other cities and constantly busy with their own lives, i try to keep in touch but it's never going to be the same.

I'll be moving to my own apartment soon, in a few days. Then i imagine i'll feel even more alone. I'll have nothing and no one there, but at least i'll get the fuck out of here.

I fucking hate the world so much right now. </TEXT>
