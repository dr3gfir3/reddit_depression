	<TEXT> Decades ago most PC games ran on two way Ethernet cabling with a dedicated network switch playing against someone in the same room or directly to an IP.

Your bog standard wireless router today is a one way underpowered device that shares it throughput with TVs, laptops tablets and phones. It usually broadcasts to a central server before broadcasting back to the game on both ends. Saying 'PC games' could do it years ago is like asking why your Telsa can't run on petrol because your car from decades ago could. It is a completely different make up.

And you just need to visit any PC multiplayer forum to see people complain about netcode or hitbox lag to know that this isn't a solved issue for PC either.

I don't know how the Switch handles local multiplayer, or Unity on the Switch and maybe this should be a 'solved' issue. But you can't just imply that something that 'worked' years ago would work today. Especially since companies are now exploring server side code execution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my opinion, that means the responsibility lies in the owner of the car. If I was to see a baby crawling around a room I'm in I don't think 'That kid better be careful around me because I'm 10 times bigger and in steel toed boots. If they get hurt, its there own fault.' I think, 'I better be careful because while I'm relatively safe, that person is at a higher risk of getting hurt than me.'

I think the same if it was a bus or truck versus a car. Being the strongest person in a room doesn't mean you are in charge.

This is the thinking a lot of places have about pedestrians. In Ireland (and also California, I think) pedestrians have instant right of way on most roads. This doesn't mean that pedestrians can just walk out in front of cars. It is to show that vehicles have an extra duty of care to take when in areas a pedestrian could walk in front of your car.

	<TEXT> The cameo's were badly done but at least they made narrative sense. I think they could cut out some dream sequences, the weird time traveling flash thing (seriously had no idea what was happening in that scene until reading about it online), include the scene with Luthor talking to that alien guy, stop Batman from shooting everyone, after the line 'I thought she was with you?' have Wonder Woman say 'Are you serious right now? We were just emailing. You texted me to tell me to come here. What the fuck is your problem?' If you want to add more sass, include a close up right after where she says 'Ugh! MEN!' with the most dramatic hair toss in cinematic history. 

What else, remove Kevin Costner, why is Superman always talking to his dead parents? Have a better reconciliation than that Martha shit. Have a better motivation for Batman in general.

Loads more. Don't try and build a huge Marvel-esque universe on Man of Steel. Seriously, the whole point of Man of Steel was to remove the 'comic book' aspects of Superman. If there are a bunch of other people running around in tights since WWII, doing the same crime fighting stchik why is everyone surprised to see Superman. Enchantress has been around since the dawn of time. Now Man of Steel makes no sense anymore. Well it didn't make much sense to begin with, now it makes less.

Oh, final one. Whose idea was it to put Snyder in charge of everything? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is saying in nearly half of all accidents the cyclist is the offender also like saying in over half of all accidents involving a bike, the cyclist was not at fault? Does this statistic include accidents that only involved a bike?

I only ask because I know how much some drivers like to complain about how dangerous cyclists are, but in reality they are complaining about having to share the road with cyclists. I see far more jerk drivers than I do cyclists, but I hear far more complaints about jerk cyclists. And I see far more cars run red lights than cyclists do, on account of a lot of drivers thinking just turned red means it is still okay to go.

I've also found the most vocal complainers about cyclists are always the shittiest drivers.

Not saying I haven't seen jerk cyclists, but there are far more jerk drivers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Anyway, in the end either they lied and redid their DLC plans when they realized how lucrative their small updates to GTAO are, or they lied and were deliberately misleading to get more people invested in the game and never had any plans to expand singleplayer

Are you warming up for a marathon? Because that is a lot of stretching.

Think about it logically. You are about to announce a new story DLC. Do you make it its own big press release? Or do you throw it as an aside at the bottom of an announcement for different content? I don't work marketing but I presume the first one. Big content, big announcement right?

So either they didn't have story DLC planned and this just refers to new content inside of the existing story OR they fucked up the announcement by making it a small part of announcing other updates. If we decide that a company with all their marketing resources, did fuck up the announcement, isn't it just a likely they they fucked up the wording on the actual announcement?

So we have 2 scenarios. 

1. They fucked up their story content announcement (a big fuck up) by making a small announcement, rather than a larger one. In the long run, this worked out because they cancelled the story content.

2. They fucked up the wording (small fuck up) so it sounded like they are working on a new story DLC, but they just added a small content update.

Now knowing what we know in hindsight and applying Occam's razor, which seems more likely. A marketing blunder that worked itself out in the long run regardless because of a change of plan?

Or that the conservative reading of the statement was correct all along and that there was no announcement for a story based DLC, and they went and did a bonus content release (which is exactly what happened).

So 2 possible outcomes. One happened, the other didn't. One was unlikely and would have been a pretty big marketing blunder. One could have been Kevin writing the copy before having his coffee that morning. I know which one I want to believe and I know which one probably actually happened. </TEXT>

Story mode updates, not new story content. So they didn't officially announce single player DLC. GameSpot interpreted that their press release and said it was coming, but that's because they read it wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is just wrong. They update their engine constantly, like Valve.  There has been a huge update for the new Batman game.

The real problem is they aren't fixing the issues that people have with the engine, which is graphic fidelity, character animations and stuttering. Compare Wolf with Guardians and you will se the difference/ Truth is, they know they rely on story more than graphics. They are putting their money into their selling point. No one loved The Walking Dead for its revolutionary graphics or gameplay mechanics. They loved the story and universe. That's why they will always put more money investing in writers than pushing their engine. </TEXT>

I usually shy away from abridged works but it looks like either read only one book this summer (and maybe autumn) or read an abridged version. And it seems the abridged version has a lot going for it. I guess I don't want to miss out, but I don't want to read something subpar either.

	<TEXT> ~~Is there any advantage to reading the behemoth Journey to the West over the popular abridged version translated by Arthur Waley. 

From what I have heard the full translation contains a lot of Chinese poetry and jokes about Chinese bureaucracy that will fly over most modern people's head. The Waley translation cuts a lot of this out but also cuts out some of the stories over shortening the overall book or cutting out the cultural stuff.

That said Journey to the West is also a huge multi volume undertaking and without taking the relevant studies in Chinese History and Culture might mostly  be nonsense to a modern reader.

Is there a preferred abridgement? Or is it worth tackling the whole thing at once?~~ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you do something at work, on work time, using a work resource, technically it belongs to the company. Especially if you are hired for knowledge work (programming, tech writing, even sales, etc.) If you write your novel on company time, they can claim partial ownership. Same with college.

How invasive that is, is entirely up to the company. Microsoft Exchange and Office 365 (popular mail service applications) both allow for admins to set *Send on behalf* privileges for any email account.

Knowing the login details of a person might be an issue, but most IT services mean that this shouldn't be required to send email on that person's behalf in a way that it looks like that email is coming from a different person. Lots of companies do this for when a person is on holidays or leaves to adjust to a handover period.

If someone was using that in a malicious way to defame you, that might be a criminal issue. But if you are using email in standard day to day business, it isn't.

It looks like OP's boss is a jerk by delivering bad news under his name. But if OP's boss asked him to deliver bad news directly, it's not like he would have the option to say no. Boss sounds like a bad leader. </TEXT>

Genisys changed the lore in a way that made sense. They brought in the whole other worlds element. I would say that Sarah Connor Chronicles shat on the lore, but they did it in a way that worked well for the format.

Salvation was in the Evil Dead school of sequels where they don't even try to pretend there was previous movies and it is just sort of based in the same world. Genisys made an effort to explain why things were different, like an older Arnold and why it was telling the story from 1984 but things will happen differently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well in the Roeper article, he mentions Nico Lang but it looks like he writes more about sexuality and gender politics. (EDIT: [Looks like he is listed on RT as a sometimes critic](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/critic/nico-lang/movies)).

I found this article by Victoria Coren Mitchell who does call out critics for sexism, but for Tom Ford's Nocturnal Animals, not Ghostbusters in [this piece](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/22/nocturnal-animal-film-rape-murder-repulsive) for the Guardian. This is the Comment is Free section where they basically get a new take another side of the subject for a little more balance. The Guardian's Mark Kermode and Nick Lodge both gave it a positive review, but Lodge peppers the whole review with discussion on toxic masculinity. 

Armond White has had [some pieces](https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/01/infamous-contrarian-armond-white-heckles-12-years-slave-director-steve-mcqueen/356770/) written about him for being contrarian. And of course there are [these two guys](https://www.yahoo.com/movies/thumb-war-siskel-and-eberts-best-on-air-arguments-90363063767.html).

So an actual film reviewer calling out another reviewer by name is probably pretty rare (I only found Lang in a quick search), but writers going after specific reviewers not so much. And I have yet to see a piece about reviewers being sexist for not liking the Ghostbusters movie.

Maybe if I go to an extreme lefty Breitbart-esque site or click baity Daily Mail I could find that, but not from anything that has any sort of reputation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I guess I am going a little back on what I said here. I don't think I am contradicting myself, more elaborating. And I'll start by saying most comment sections are shit and full of bile and if you look hard enough you will find every sort of criticism you want to find, if you are willing to look. Same for tweets and others of the great unwashed of the internet. Anyone who can say something, has said something if you look there.

Now that's out of the way, when I said I didn't see any critics get called sexist I meant it. I didn't see movie reviewers go after other movie reviewers. I didn't see think pieces in left leaning publications like The Guardian and I didn't see it on Jezebel or xoJane or any girl centric blogs calling out specific movie critics as sexist in doing their day to day job of reviewing movies. Roeper was called out by rando, unprofessional nobodies. He mentions one article by Nico Lang and specifically says Lang doesn't call him sexist.

Then he goes on to defend his choices and says that he has gone over his previous reviews in search of hidden biases and didn't see it.

Sorry if this appears I was moving the goal posts, I guess I didn't say where they were in the first place. </TEXT>

I saw a few bloggers get called sexist who decided to 'review' or blast the movie before seeing it. I didn't see any professional critics get called sexist for saying they didn't like it. I also saw a lot of genuinely sexist commenters get called sexist for being sexist about the whole thing. Outside of comment sections and tweets, not one professional critic got called sexist for writing a negative review though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Extreme Ghostbusters

Extreme Ghostbusters was pretty shit and also it was based off The Real Ghostbusters, which you may remember couldn't even get the rights to the looks of the actors from the film.

As for your Reitman claim, do you have a source? All I can find is him recommending cast members, including many women. In fact before the reboot was in full swing I read Murray make some suggestions too, including Emma Stone.

Yeah, it isn't as good as the original, but the original is a classic and how many movies get classic status? Few. So saying it isn't as good as one of the best movies ever is a pretty high watermark. And it was a fun movie. Some things were better, most weren't, but jokes hit the mark and it was one of the better big movies of the year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they moved that scene into a flashback after the reveal it might have worked. Also get rid of those giant harvesters because there is no way humanity would still be around with those. Oh and tell Bale he can't do the Batman voice and get to be the main character.

I blame McG totally for the train wreck this movie was. The trailer spoils the movie, the the opening scene also tries to spoil it too. The redirects later with China Moonblood hearing a heartbeat doesn't change that fact.

It could have been a great movie. The story was solid, Yelchin as always was great (albeit a bit more fun than war torn as Reese was), but they needed more time or someone looking over their shoulder to say why things don't work (interfaces for robots, why? USB, why? Spoiling the movie so early on, why?). Usually that person should be the director. McG sounded like he had no control over what was happening on set with the Bale tape. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it may seem mad but so did the smoking ban and plastic bag levy.

It's a different kettle of fish though. People who used plastic bags and who smoked cigarettes were never painted as scum and criminals. People have a very specific image of a 'junkie' in their head, or even a stoner. The news   culture media and politicans pushed this really far. I'm sure a lot of people in their late 40s and early 50s still treat cannabis as a gateway drug, if not worse.

People aren't going to decide drugs aren't for criminals overnight, and many will see this as acquiescing to criminals. The less extreme will complain that it will turn Ireland into a hot spot for drug tourists or becoming the next Amsterdam (Amsterdam is a lovely clean city and really what a European capital should look and feel like, but my gran will never believe that it isn't just sex workers and addicts).

I can't see this as a popular cause that people will rally around like gay marriage. </TEXT>
