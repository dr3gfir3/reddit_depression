	<TEXT> First off, thank you for responding...I'm so glad that I didn't come off as some judgmental jerk and prompt you to ignore the comment. I know where you're coming from because I experience it with my partner's family. They are a similar flavor of weird to what you describe. I also get what you're saying about feeling like you're the outcast (paraphrasing). It's natural that you'd feel that way under the circumstances. 

For what it's worth, It helped my state of mind when I decided to limit myself to a single rejoinder every time something weird came up. It left me feeling like I let it be known that I saw the manipulation for what it is but left too little in terms of material for them to escalate the situation. We aren't friends, but the reduced tension has left things markedly more civil (that was my goal). I hope you all can find a way to meet your goals in this situation. Congratulations also on the baby! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you considered that your parents might have a point? Everyone here seems to agree that your MIL is overbearing and that your husband, while well intentioned, isn't doing enough to keep that at bay. There is little in your post, however, that suggests you're trying to help build a better relationship. To the reader, it's her being intrusive and you being sort of snide in response. Your reaction to her birth control query seemed  inexplicably aggressive to me, frankly. You could have just said "I don't really want to talk about that sort of thing...that's so awkward."

I point this out in an effort to prompt some reflection on your part. What's your goal in this? If it's to have a close relationship with MIL, you're probably not going about that well. I don't think that's what you want, though, because it seems clear you don't like her (I suspect the feeling is mutual). Start from your goal and that will help you and your husband manage things more effectively.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't usually condone this sort of Frank talk with supervisors, but I think it's warranted here. You need to have a way to Jeremy from screwing with your personal and professional life. Given that the two of you seem to have a close relationship, I'd simply tell him these things. You like Matthew already and the talk with Jeremy gets in the way of that. Given that Jeremy wants the best for his son (as evidenced by his manipulations), he'll back off once you make this plain. Once that's settled, the work stuff will...well, work out. 

If it doesn't immediately get better, of course, then see HR. You should be keeping notes on what Jeremy has done...particularly the quid-pro-quo related to your promotion. That's a big legal no-no and could really cause them trouble. Keep the notes but don't use them immediately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two things:

You will be able to identify a company that has been forced to restate their financial statements by reviewing SEC Enforcement actions. Each action tells you why the company he been forced to restate. There are a lot of companies that end up restating for various reasons but those that are forced to restate by the SEC will specifically identify the misstatements as intentional and/or fraudulent. 

You need to have a definition of fraud in order to decide which companies you are going to look at. The papers you are referring to run the gamut from viewing every misstatement as fraud to only the most intentional material misstatements being fraud. If you read the sample selection portion of the paper closely you can figure out the definition they are using and go from there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm interested in what you think of the specific claim that the defendant lacks expertise as a film critic. Is there some precedent that establishes expertise as a precondition to engage in critical fair use under the Fair Use doctrine? 

I also feel like the argument that the defendant engaged in willful infringement due to his familiarity with Fair Use doctrine as a non-lawyer somehow undermines his expertise argument. If defendant isn't expert enough to conduct film criticism without film training, how can he have sufficient expertise to have engaged in willful infringement without legal training? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At first, I saw the Twitter comments by Conservatives and felt bad they had so little empathy for a child-rape victim who is obviously dealing with his trauma in understandable, or dysfunctional, ways (e.g. by normalizing his experience). 

After reading his lie-filled defense, it seems obvious that he isn't deserving of our empathy. Either he's lying about being a victim of child-rape to vilify other gay men (if you believe his defense), or he's lying about not being a victim in order to minimize the experiences of other child-rape victims. Either way, this denial makes it very difficult for me to empathize with Milo.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know why this surprises anybody. The current President was elected despite the vigorous attempts by most reasonable people to point out his many flaws and inconsistencies. He did so while alienating huge swaths of non-white voters, building an overwhelmingly White coalition.  He did so while alienating our allies. 

All this means our President does not need to care about (1) the mainstream press and what they think, (2) non-White Americans, or (3) foreign powers who don't immediately come bowing and scraping to preserve their relationship with the US. He doesn't care what you think because you didn't vote for him anyway. When his jack-booted thugs come for you, the people who voted for him will cheer because they will have won against their opponents. 

The President acts this way because he has no choice. This is his only move.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was looking at the March 1931 Banzuke on the SumoDB site and noticed an unfamiliar notation related to some of the Ozeki listed there. Instead of being listed as "O,", they are listed as "HD." When I dig into their individual profiles, the expanded ranking is listed as "O2wHD." When I looked at other Banzuke from around the same time, you can find similar notation for Komusibi (K2wHD) and Sekiwake (S2eHD).

Can anyone tell me what the HD stands for and why it doesn't seem to be used anymore? Thanks, in advance, for any information you can offer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've identified a very credible explanation for the situation you find yourself in. If you were at my institution, you'd have been assisted with finding another supervisor under the circumstances. That isn't something you get to decide unilaterally, however. Some administrator or senior person may be able to facilitate additional supervision, but I get why you may be reluctant to seek that. 

With respect to your passing, I think that attitude is dangerous to your future prospects. The point of the education is to learn. It's the school's job to provide you with support for that learning. If they've taught you and you haven't learned, that's one thing. If they aren't teaching you or providing appropriate supervision, that's quite another. Only you know which end of that spectrum your situation falls into. The thesis is only valuable in that it helps you apply the concepts and learning the program has provided you. Do it the right way even if you can get away with doing it half-assed. 

PM me if you want to discuss the design in detail. I have a relatively broad background in methods and can discuss alternative analysis plans with you if I know more about what's going on with you work.  </TEXT>

The broader issue is developing the knowledge necessary to independently determine the appropriate tests and techniques to analyze your data and answer your research questions. The Field book will be helpful, but it raises a question regarding the quality of the training you've received in your program. Is there someone you can talk to (a department chair, perhaps) and figure out who should be providing you with supervision? Even if we tell you what we think you should do, who knows if that's what your eventual judges will want you to do.  </TEXT>

Once you say the words, the thinking goes among abuse victims, the truth of what happened to you will be out there. By getting all of what you said out into the world via Reddit, however, you've already overcome the hardest part of the healing process. There are now people who know what happened, even if they don't know you personally. You've said the words. 

Build on that brave first step and find someone to tell this to who can help you. Someone you can trust. A counselor, a teacher, a pastor or priest...just make it someone you trust. Or call the numbers that others will provide you and say the words out loud to someone who can't see you. It gets easier to talk about it and confront things each time you do it.

	<TITLE> Comparing Coefficients Across Independent Samples Using Separate Regression Estimations </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-11 03:23:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am reading a paper where the authors are attempting to draw inferences about separate subgroups of a population. These populations are expected to behave differently with respect to the dependent variable, but the models are constructed using the same predictors. The authors separately (not simultaneously) estimate the two models. They then use a Wald test to test the equality of coefficients across models (i.e. comparing beta1 in model 1 to beta1 in model 2).

Is this the right way to do things? I thought it was more appropriate to use a series of Seemingly Unrelated Equations in order to jointly estimate the coefficients. I've done some searching and have only been able to come up with answers for when it's one model and multiple subgroups or multiple models with different predictors, not multiple models with the same predictors but different populations.

Thanks for any insight you can offer! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel for this Adrian fellow. There are some food smells that just turn individual stomachs. For me, it's the spices in Indian food. I literally will eat any other food, even spicy food, but the smell of most Indian dishes (particularly curries) makes me want to jump out a window. What a "meat" smell is I don't know, but it's certainly possible he's really bothered by it. 

Still, it's up to him to be socially sensitive here. I bet off when my friends go to an Indian restaurant. When they bring it to the office, I do my best to tolerate it in silence. If it were an everyday thing, I might discuss it with them directly. What you don't do, however, is blindside people at a meeting and use the manager as a buffer to get your way. He's going to have to grovel to get back into the in crowd.  </TEXT>

Hahahahahahaha! That shit's hilarious! Take note, HuffPo. You don't have to use a laundry list of the man's faults as a tag line to make him look like the idiot he is! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this isn't the same as saying that the universe could be a simulation? I don't have any type of complex understanding of physics and would appreciate some additional information regarding the difference between saying our universe is simulated versus saying its a hologram.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People respond to rewards much more favorable than penalties. Thus, I'm always careful to frame things as rewards in the classroom. For example, I make tests err toward being too difficult in order to leave room to give back points as a curve. Similarly, I make deadlines which err toward being too tight. That way, I can give them extra time. I end up at the same place in terms of grade distribution, but I have the benefit of students viewing me as generous in spirit. This shows up as comments in my reviews, saying that I'm fair and understanding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bleck! The reason we depreciate assets is to match the expense of our use of the asset (i.e. the reduction in value associated with our use) with the period when we derive the benefit of the expense (i.e. the period when we get revenue by using the truck in operations). That we get smoother earnings is an important benefit, but it doesn't represent the theoretical purpose of depreciation.  </TEXT>

Tl;dw: M2K gets rested several times to go down three stocks in his first match, commits suicide for his last stock. Same thing happens in the second game. Then he goes with the Puff ditto for the third game seemingly out of spite. Classic stuff! </TEXT>
