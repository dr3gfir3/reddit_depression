	<TEXT> quick follow up question! have you ever tried using chia eggs for baking? from what i've seen online, they seem to be pretty interchangeable and chia seeds seem to have more uses and can be bought and stored while ground so i'm kinda leaning towards chia seeds but again, i'm not sure exactly how that'd work out in baked goods. especially since all the comments have been choosing flax eggs over chia seed ones </TEXT>
