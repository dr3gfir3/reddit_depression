	<TEXT> While one would look at the initial behavior of Rose's parents and ask what was racist about their behavior, the movie tries to point out the fact that this is how it exists in the current world. When Rose's dad meets Chris, he starts using words like "thang" and "ma' man". As Rose mentions these are words that he's never used. This happens in real life too, people tend to go out of the way to be "accommodating" towards people of other race that they end up over doing it. Suddenly you have Rose's dad trying to talk like an African-American. Of course, the film shows them in a whole new light later on.

Same thing with the cop. He's simply asking for Chris's ID. But Chris was not driving. Yet he's asking for his ID. It is subtle but it's there.

Can someone explain how Rose's mother was being rude to Georgina, when she spills the tea? What was the implication of asking her to "take some rest"?
