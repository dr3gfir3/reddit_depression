	<TEXT> For me it would have to be the executioner's chariot. I know he isn't considered one of the "harder" bosses in the game but I have trouble with him every time. I can kill Raime and Alonne with relatively no trouble but that damn chariot always manages to kill me. The long trek to him is hard enough, but for the life of me I just can't dodge it's attacks! The hotboxes are huge and it delays some attacks and it just fucks with me (also don't get me started on new game+ version with the RESPAWNING red phantom of doom). So what boss gives you trouble and why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boone is a piece of shit sidekick and I hate him. I think people overstate him just because he is the first available follower (other than ED-E). I feel like I am the only one who doesn't like Boone. Boone is boring, and depressing and completely flat as a character (wife is kil). Even less popular, is Raul Tejada. RAUL IS THE BEST FOLLOWER IN THE GAME! He is funny, 3-D (unlike Boone), and has one of the best perks, available after his quest is done. Weapons degrade 75% slower with him as a follower. Enough said. Also he is voiced by Danny Trejo, and Danny is awesome. 
TL;DR- Boone sucks, Raul is love/life </TEXT>

Do you like the look, the fact that it has a lot of ledges/good fighting environment, or do you like the enemies and ganging up on the host? My personal favorite is easily Aldia's keep, specifically in the giant room where the bone dragon attacks you. It is so wide open I love it. So what about you guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the great club and bandit axe. Good damage on both and despite them both taking some getting used to, they absolutely decimate in PvP and PvE. Also they look quite good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There has to be a few level 838 people out there and I am too curious and I need to know what it is like. Level 99 across the board should make for a pretty badass infusion on the ladle or work hook and I just gotta see it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't really a phrase, but the whole "life is fair" shit you are taught as a kid. Life is LITERALLY the exact opposite of that. We would do well to teach kids that they will not be as fortunate as others, and vise versa. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is anybody else a little disappointed with the bell covenant rank rewards? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First of all I would like to say this covenant is my favorite. I jump at the opportunity to slice some trespassers into the tiniest of pieces! But the rank up rewards are bogus (save rank 3). The first ranks are not super hard to get, I know, but I got a slab from invading before I even reached rank one! Rank 3 gives one of the most unique armor sets in the game, so why can't the other ranks give something cool that isn't just an item you can get easily by farming? Do you guys agree we should get some better stuff for all that bell defendin'? What would we get? </TEXT>
