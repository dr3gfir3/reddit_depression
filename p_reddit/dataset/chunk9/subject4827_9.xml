	<TEXT> Twilight guardian is a core card in dragons you won't regret it if you craft them, but the same is for war leaders.. it all depends on what you want to play.. I don't recommend you to craft umbra now, imo she seems really powerful, but for the moment doesn't fit very well in the top tier decks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't please, you will regret this in the future, just farm some gold, buy pack or enter the arena and in some weeks you will have dust to craft a descent deck. </TEXT>
