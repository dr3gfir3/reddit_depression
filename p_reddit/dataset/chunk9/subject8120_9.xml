	<TEXT> Unfortunately i cannot share the config.

This is a fairly simple setup as this is just a branch office. I have one netgear switch that has two ports VLAN 20. One port is going to a separate interface at 10.10.x.1/24 on the Fortigate, the other untagged port is going to a PC on the network. VLAN1 works fine at 10.20.x.1/24. I've done a flow diagnose and can see it reaching the firewall, but it does nothing with the packets. I can ping the gateway of VLAN1 and VLAN20 from the PC

These are the only things that come out of the fortigate diagnose

	<TITLE> 5.4.4 VLAN routing issue </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-13 22:40:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

I've got a very weird issue that i'm wondering if someone could be of assistance. FGT60E

VLAN1 Primary 

VLAN20 

I have tried tagging the interface off of the internal interface as well as separating a different interface and having the interfaces untagged on the switch with PVID 20
I can get a DHCP from the firewall but cannot access the internet/primary VLAN (I have the policies in place where this should be allowed) Unless I create a policy based route to the internet for this interface it will not go to the internet. Even when i make a policy based route for VLAN20 I still cannot access VLAN1.

Also i can ping the gateway of the fortigate on both interfaces. It looks like something is just silently blocking all traffic from this interface I've tried turning on Asymetric routing as well to no avail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been dealing with WiFi issues for the past week. (I just implemented a  new fortigate solution) I had put together a Wifi Schedule so that the SSID would only broadcast from 730am to 5pm. Had complaints every morning and every after noon that the wifi was down. I had scoured all of the event logs, opened up a ticket with Fortigate tech support, and could not figure this out. I come in this morning and have an epiphany.... I look at the time zone of my Fortigate... Its 2 hours off due to the time zone.... So the SSID was not broadcasting until 930am and then disabling itself at 3pm... Needless to say, multiple facepalms occurred this morning... </TEXT>

Anyone else find that their web-filter has reclassified playboy.com to entertainment or something other than porn?

I did a manual reclassification, but just curious if any other web filters are doing the same. </TEXT>
