	<TEXT> Purchased the beaut last night and only have one complaintthere is no customization available for it whatsoever. While I understand their purpose of keeping it natural for Bruce's sake and the movie, it's a huge disappointment to have BMD's and Painted wheels but not being able to put them into the car. Toppers and trails nonetheless. (Although I can't complain about the trail because quite frankly, it's authentically fitting)

Is this an implausible request? Or is there any possibility of seeing a change in the future? Can you imagine heatwave/20XX/hexed on the bat mobile? It would be absolutely stunning. </TEXT>
