No other country I've ever been to has teens drinking at 14-16 years of age. So it's not even about the law being at 21 to drink versus 18 everywhere else.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You reallly need to have a conversation with your bf. Sit him the fuck down and have a serious conversation about how you can't be with someone who doesn't treat you like you're worth it. Tell him the wrongs he's done and ask him "I don't see you changing, do you?"  based on his response decide to make the break. It seems you're kind of in the middle because he's a "fantastic guy",  but these are relationship breakers and depending on the way he reacts, make your move. I only suggest doing this because at least then, you can say you tried everything and made the most informed decision possible when you decided to break up. Good luck and be strong!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 
 Mom was a homeopathic doctor in her early years. I don't know about America, but in Asia, homeopathy is really big when western medicines don't work. I was not a believe, still not positive if i would try it again to be honest, but when I was 16 I developed junior rheumatoid arthritis. Nothing was working to help alleviate the pain (I live in the US and went to some really great doctors.) My mom eventually took me to see a homeopathic doctor in India who had been known to work miracles. I took his homeopathic medication (hesitant as I was because it made my mom happy.)  3 months later, I was SO MUCH BETTER. I could sit through classes, sleep through the night, etc. 

At least in Asia, a lot of the way homeopathy works is that you believe in it. You have faith that it works. So yea, it might be a placebo I don't really know, but I believe it helped me that once. 

Edit: grammar

	<TEXT> I wanted all those things when I was a little girl. But as a grew I learned there was a difference between having a wedding and getting married. People who want to get married want the memory of close friends and love surrounding them. People who want a giant wedding want the memory of the party itself. Neither are bad necessarily, just very different. I'm on your side though. No big wedding for me. Ever. No.   </TEXT>

If I was around every once in a while on your cuddling sessions or something while you guys watched tv or somethiny and I saw nothing sexual, I'd probably try to back off.  She was being way too strict. Girls cuddle all the time. Glad you broke up with her and kept your best friend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's true. I'm a feminist and had a lot of trouble admitting it until recently bc of loud radicals. Then I realized the solution. If they yell loudly, I just have to yell louder. I don't want to let people think that those radicals are the only type of feminists out there. It's been a scary experience, but once one person speaks up, so many more follow! It's eye-opening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP,
I'm not going to say "dump his ass" straight away. You have feelings involved, and that means you can't just walk away like this is nothing. Here is my honest suggestion? After he cools down, bring it up again and have a serious discussion about where that all came from. Explain your side of the story. Remind him you're not in a good place financially to buy him expensive gifts, but the amount of time u put in is by no means lazy. Ask him if money is the only way to show love? And finally, ask him why he keeps on bringing up this other girl. Straight up ask him if there is anything going on between the two of them. Also explain to him how hurtful for you and out of character that was for him. Lay everything on the table because communication is key here.

IF things go down hill, make sure to remind him that it would be difficult to move out right now because it would difficult, financially. If he's still an asshole about it, see if you can get your parents, other relatives, anyone to help you get out of the situation on the promise that you will pay them back. 
Good luck. Hope you update to let us know how you're doing and if you're ok!

Edit: spelling is hard </TEXT>
