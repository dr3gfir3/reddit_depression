	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What if you're on a airplane that crash lands on an island that for thousands of miles all you can see is vast open blue sea. (The island is also big enough so a plane can crash, skid for hundreds of yards and not just plow into the ocean and you drown in the process) You're the only survivor ( all the bodies  somehow just didn't make it to the crash site)(and for sake of the question, everything the plane could possibly be tracked with disintegrates for some reason that could not be figured out for hundreds of years) and you're searching the wreckage for food. The only things you manage to find is boxes and boxes  and boxes of edibles. (I don't know, make up why an airplane would just have boxes of edibles.) Candies, brownies, cookies, gummies, and for some reason a bunch of frozen pizzas. It could be months before anyone finds you (or if some of you are super hardcore, let's say a few years) How do you go about rationing the food not only for your survival but your sanity? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> David sets his cane by the door, shutting it behind him. He takes a few deep, deep breaths. And heads to the kitchen where he puts his keys and checks the calendar. 

June 27th 

"David, I'm readyyy." a voice calls from upstairs. 

He looks at the plastic bag in his hands, it's all they had left. He wasn't the only husband sent out to fetch--

"David, please hurry." then a pause for effect, "Now."

He take a few breaths and checks his watch, this shouldn't take long, he thinks. Several hours maybe, maybe longer. 

He goes to the bottom of the stair case and stares into a mirror. Same mirror his eyes watched him grow from a boy into a old man. Same mirror he looked into when the news came, that the day that what was normal was to be switched, become opposite. So abiding by this new law, and the good man he is--

"David, I do not want to call your name again. Get up here, now."

He takes a breath, nods his head to himself in the mirror, and heads up stairs. 

He walks into the bedroom and closes the door behind him. He can see easily due to hundreds of lit candles that parade around the walls and flicker still shadows. He sets his coat down on the bed, seeing his wife of forty-five years standing in the doorway of the bathroom. 

"Happy Opposite Day," she says, and her robe falls. She's naked, except for a strap on penis nine inches long and six inches in diameter stands proudly from her waist, it's was like a toddlers arm balled into a fist that was ready to enter him from the tip and all the way down to the base. 

He takes the item out of the plastic bag, handing it to her. 

"All they had was canola oil, they were out of, you know... "

"Lay down, and on your back."

He nods, and slips out of his shoes and pants. He lays on the bed and states at the ceiling fan. Such slow monotonous circles, he thinks. Hoping the spinning of the blades will hypnotize him and take his mind far and away. 

He feels his legs go on her shoulders, his back cracks, and his hips. He should've stretched, but didn't have the time earlier, so he winces on slightly, grabs the edges of the bed on both sides with his hands and calms himself, and relaxes. Calm. And relaxed. 

She enters, and the night begins.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It Was Necessary - /u/KillerSealion has my vote. I thought it was engaging, creative on how it implemented the flashback, the language used in the dialogue, and most importantly, it kept my attention. Details can be a sea of information and sometimes I don't want to drown in it, especially in a short story. The 2000 word count to me also seemed like it was on purpose, so maybe extra words found their way in there to be exactly 2000 word story. a lot of fat that could have been shaved, even saying that, great story. High five, hand shake, hug, long walk on the beach, and so on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great story, was it your aim to have exactly 2000 words?  Because through the story - - for me-- there's so many words that didn't have to be there. There's a lot of fat that could have been shaved, but then again, pacing is also important, every word you cut help the reader speed up and everyone you have helps the reader slow down. Also, the language in the dialogue, I thought it a little rigid in the beginning but it's smoothed out very well later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She's cold. 

Manual Espinoza holds his baby girl walking up the stairs. Passing frames of photos from phones he was able to salvage before the power went out. 

"Daddy," she whispers. 

He knows the question is coming. He holds her tighter. 

"Daddy, do I have to go in there?"

He finishes the last of the steps, and sets her down. Her color is almost all gone. 

But, he thinks, she's still the most beautiful thing in his world. 

"Bonita, sweetie.. " He takes his hands and holds her eyes.  "You're very special to me. Maana, in the morning. You can come back out."

She says," I have nightmares. I want to sleep with you and mommy."

"What nightmares, sweetie," He takes hand and places it on the side of her head, her hand touches his and she whispers. 


"I'm screaming. Except it's not me." She leans in closer, as if to tell a secret, "It looks like me, Daddy. It screams, a lot. I don't like it."

He picks her back up and follows the wall all the way to the end of the hallway. 

10 locks. Five chains. Two doors. 

He sets her down."Stay right here."

He unlocks one lock at a time. Removes the chains. Opens the first door. And then the second. He holds out his hand while turning on a light inside. "Sweetie, come here." 

Red blemishes slowly form around her eyes, arms, and neck. By the second the red becomes deeper, more rich. 

He takes her hand and kneels. He's careful not to touch her hair. Last time a small chunk of it came out. She cried all the next day about how she felt ugly. 


"Both palms, open them."

She opens both her hands, holding them out in front. Miguel slips on leather gloves on both hands. With a velcro strap, he wraps it around her wrists and secures it. He holds her cheeks. The white in her eyes is gone.

"Daddy," she leans in close, "Please, Daddy. I do--" 

She lurches forward. He doesn't even think. He picks her up and sets her inside on her feet. But she falls over, convulsing. Clawing at her face. 

He shuts the first door, then the second. Attaches the chains. Locks the locks. 

He backs away from the door. She's screaming. She's up now and he can hear her feet thumping on the hardwood floor. He takes a breath, turns around and heads back downstairs. 

Miguel walks into the kitchen, and takes a seat at the table. 

"Locked?"

A tender voice comes from behind, and then arms wrap themselves around his neck. 

"Locked." He says.

	<TEXT> Ten days ago I stepped out of that machine. I felt the dirt in my toes. The heat from the sun. I was alive. I made it. 

But made it where? Where was I? Well, we guessed, the desert, they tried to put me there. But downtown San Francisco was where I ended. There, naked, standing in front of hundreds of faces that just stared. Like I was a shooting star. 

It felt good, for a moment. Until I found out what they were staring at.

Currently, my legs and arms are chained to metal that during the day hangs me face down. And I'm what you called "milked" daily. 

Don't worry, I tried to tell them I could do it myself. How it's actually fun. All they had to do was supply pictures of Asian women and their feet and I was locked and loaded. 

The problem.. 

Apparently men are completely extinct , meaning there's no men to take their seed and put into some pretty ladies stink cave and give birth to walking cancer. So. Me, having the wonderful balls I have, came to that point in time where balls have gone extinct and my healthy, hearty coconuts we're looked at like rare precious metals. 

They cum me twenty times a day. A day. In ten hours, they send some in some old lady. Old, haggard ass lady! They send her in, she jerks me until I go into this cup, she pats me on the ass and goes "See you in a bit."  Leaving me in the dark. 

But that's my role now. I'm a time traveler chained and milked the last ten days because my precious man seed will continue the species. 

Should I feel proud? No, not at all. They're not coming in here and milking Arnold Schwarzenegger, you know? I can read, add single digit numbers, but I work at a gas station. I'm 36 years old. I volunteered for this experiment that was supposed to pay my rent for the next three months. I sign some paper work, and... 

Well, ten days so far, and it's not getting any better. I am to be milked over and over again until millions and millions of my children are born. Millions and millions of dumb asses like me. And little do they know their father hangs daily being tugged at by an old woman listening to the sound of my tears hitting the concrete. 

Will it ever end? Who knows...

	<TEXT> It's a mini van. Two adults, three kids. Smiles are pouring out of them because guess where they're going? Yes, Disneyland. (Daddy was able to get the weekend off because Richard needed the hours.)

And they drive laughing, smiling. It's a piece of metal going sixty miles per hour and it's filled with love, okay? Filled with love and dreams and life...You see where I'm going with this? Do you? 

People pretend I don't know they think about me at night, I know they do, everyone does. 

I was human, yeah, I don't remember how long ago. Being Death doesn't free you from empathy. It tears at you just the same. Tears at your gut, like this family that did nothing wrong. They will be rear ended by a drunk driver, and their van will hit a car, flip over, and everyone inside will die. And I take what I need. Pretend I don't hear their souls screaming. And I leave.

It always tears. 

And it's on to the next, on to the next, on to the next.. 

I don't know how long I've been doing this, I don't know how long I'll be doing this for. I know when there's a call, a person to be taken, and I try to fight it, I try to not move, not take another soul, the burning comes. Agony is a back massage compared to the burning I feel if I don't move, if I try and not take another. If I fight it. 


I'm bound by density or the Sands of time. I move with it or burn. I have no choice but to take what's needed. 

You know what's the worst? The absolutely worst fucking thing? The screaming. It never ends. Everyday, for weeks, and hundreds of years, the constant begging and screaming. 

It never goes away.

	<TEXT> When you're in a bad mood, or just pay attention to your emotions when you smoke in general. I know this doesn't apply to everyone, but weed does make you hyper sensitive. So it's going to maybe enhance a emotion or state more than dull it, for example, if you're elated or happy, toke up. If you're depressed, don't go for the weed just yet, try and let the moment pass, because you could be digging yourself a bigger hole than with what you began with. (Not to say that weed doesn't treat depression, because I know it can, but I had to learn the hard way that smoking weed to help combat it just made things worse.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "I didn't say I wanted God's Orgasm,    I said I wanted Infinity and Beyond..." 

Buying bud lately, not going to lie, has been a pain in the ass. 

So, recently, Society has legalized Marijuana, (actually, all drugs.) and now just a hop, skip, and maybe a tumble,( depending on how much I've had to drink that day) away. 

I can go and by myself weed..

But, now, I'm staring at this very angry Mexican woman (who's fuckin hot, all budtenders are, you don't want to woman with a face that looks like it was hit with a fire hydrant trying to sell weed.) with her arms crossed, pretending she can't hear me... 

"Infinity and Beyond?"

"Yes... " I try and say as patiently as possible. She turns around and scans the glass fish tanks filled with various types of weed with honestly the weirdest names (ever since cooperations got involved) : Sour sour, Angelina's Breath, Lights Out, Lights On, Paper Planes and of course, my favorite, Infinity and Beyond. The one I want, she can't seem to navigate and find. And I can't tell if she's doing that on purpose. 

"It's right up there, next to... "

"Sir, please, I'm going to ask you very nicely, do not tell me how to do my job."

"I'm not telling you how to do your--" 

"Sir!" She walks over to me, firming her voice. "Sir, I'm going to ask you again, you're not going to tell me how to do my job... "

"Look, can I talk to your manager? Please?"

"Oh, you want to talk to my manager? Yeah, you can." She turns and yells, "Michael!" 

A man comes out from the back, blue shirt, black tie, smiles and he adjust his glasses reaching to shake my hand. 

"Hey, the names Michael, how can I help you?"

"Hey, Michael, look, I'm not trying to be a pain in the ass, but, uh, Monica over here, I'm trying to show her where the Infinity and Beyond is but--" 

"Wait." Michael stops me, "Just so I'm understanding you correctly, you were trying to tell her how to do her job?" 

"Yes, he was! He was telling me how to do my job."

I shook my head, "Look, I'm just trying to show her, well, more like help--" 

"I'm going to have to ask you leave, sir. I'm sorry." Michael says, pointing to the door, "We can't have you telling our employees how to do their jobs, they are highly trained professionals and we can't have you try and tarnish that, Good day."

He points again, and I turn around and walk out to the store. 

This is the last time I'm ever going to buy weed from a dispensary owned by Comcast.

	<TEXT> I think it's a combination of not knowing what to do in these types of situations and processing the situation. How many times do skaters slam and just bolt right back up? Obviously, nobody is a medical expert there so when someone does slam and it looks bad, they probably tense up and the best they can do IN THAT MOMENT is go, "Hey, dude, you alright?" They just don't know enough to do what you're expecting them to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Pretty Girl** [1000]


"Do you want water? Water? Drink, drink?"





She said it so slowly. I wanted to stop this. This, act. But, I held back. Pulling on my tie, nodding.

"Yes. Yes." I said

And she turned around filling the red plastic cup in her hand with water.

The music bumped, and kids all around me dancing, having fun, laughing. Just completely lost in themselves, I mean it's prom, right? This is an important night for them, and me? I'm just here, with the girl I can't stop staring at, thinking I'm *fucking retarded*.

Well, okay, not like I have down syndrome, but just, how did she say it? She was so direct about it... 

A couple days ago, I was in the library (like usual) on Reddit, just minding my own business. And then I felt someone staring at me, and it was her, Angela Firebaugh. 

She moved over, sat down next to me, and looked me deep into my eyes and asked if I could go to prom.

I just got Star Wars Battlefront. That is what I was going to do during prom. I never had a lot of friends, so I didn't see a point to go and just chill against the wall and have people ask me why I'm not dancing. *Uh, because I'm not desperate for attention and the all the music you guys like, sucks?*  

Nope, I couldn't be honest like that. The plan was to be home, in bed, having people younger and older people call me faggot.

It happened very quickly, she asked if I can go, and then ever so softly, she rested her hand on my knee, and said, "I know you're autistic, that doesn't make you any less cute."

And look, I'm here with this fucking beautiful vessel I try and not glance at during class. And she thinks I have *autism*.

I can't blame her how she's acting, it's not like there's a how to yet on YouTube how to deal with those who are, uh, "different."

"Here, sit, sit, you like sitting?" Angela asked, moving out a chair for me.

I just nodded my head, I don't know how autistic people talk, I saw the documentary on some guy called the Rain Man awhile ago, that's about how far my research goes.

I sat on the chair and took a small sip of the cold water. My classmates still danced all around to the sounds of Lana Del Ray.

"You having fun? Fun?"

I nodded, again. I smiled and looked around.

"Lots of people," I said. 

"Yeah, lots of people." She stared at me for a moment. "You know, you look very handsome."

I couldn't help but smile. As if those were the keywords to control the muscles in my face. Hey, you take what you can get right?

This was a bold move on my end, I looked at her, and tried to say as simply as possible. 

"Pretty girl." 

It felt like I jumped off a cliff, that is the closest I've ever come to complimenting her. I mean, I wanted to say so much more, I didn't even know how to put Angela into words, I would need several encyclopedias to have enough words to begin to describe the magnitude on how beautiful I thought she--"

"Alright, let's cut the bullshit."

My eyes widened immediately, I almost spilled my drink. I retained control of my body, keeping it still.

I tried to ask as innocently as possible, "...bullshit?"

"Yes, look, obviously, I didn't ask you to come to prom to be my date, but I do need you. I'm sorry I didn't notice it before. But when Jeff told me you had autism, it *totally made sense*."

That motherfucker! Jeff, he's in my math class. He's always been a dick to me, and for some dumb reason I told him I had a crush on Angela, and he even said he wouldn't say anything! But he does the next worse thing! He tells her I have autism??

"Look, Charlie, it's okay. I know you're not wired right, there." she said,  pointing to my skull. "But what I care about, is that you're wired right... here...."

I thought my entire body being held. She looked at me right in the eyes, and firmly held in her soft hands, my balls. 

I tried my best to keep my composure, glancing around to see if anyone was capturing this moment, but nope, just me, and her. 

She gripped me a little harder, controlling me and making sure I was listening, pulling me closer.  "I told Nathan Hawkins I would lose my virginity to him, and he said he would lose his to me. But, I don't want to embarrass myself, you understand? I want to blow his fucking mind, and so, since you have that condition, I know you can't judge me. And that means I want to practice on you."

The mellow beats continued, my classmates moved and laughed, and my balls still in this gentle vice grip of the girl from Fantasy and Sci-fi English.

Everything seemed to slow down for a moment, and I pondered my options on how this night was going to end. 

Well, I could, tell her no, tell her the truth. Tell her, I don't have autism, and go right home.

Or, I could tell her last week in the locker room I heard Nathan Hawkins talk about having sex with Marina Garcia in his room, and I can still remembering him barking about it, "Oh my god, man. She let me cum all over her tits, it was amazing!"

Or, I could just play along, and lose my virginity to the most beautiful thing in school.

She still stared into my eyes, slowly beginning to smile as I could see how hungry she was. 

I know I don't know shit, but as I get older, I keep wondering... 

Why, oh, why, is it so hard, to do the right thing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Tony, sit down!"

Tony's mom screamed, again. 

"No!" Eleven year old Tony moved away from the table, pointing at her, "You, silence! You will not tell the great creator what to do!" 

"Mark, are you just going to stand there?"

"Susan. I'm trying. Tony, *come on, man.* Why are you talking like that? Come back and sit down." Mark moved over and extended his arms, reaching for Tony. 

"Father! How dare you try and touch the omniscient one!" Tony moved away from his Dad's hairy hands, moving by the older couple who sat behind them. 

The waitress came over, trying to force a smile, "Hi, ma'am, I'm so sorry, is there any way you can have your son, like, stop screaming?"

"Oh! Who is this blonde goddess?" Tony said, pointing his fork at the waitress, "Would you like to spend an evening with a God?" 

"Tony!" Susan shouted. 

"Son, you can't say that to strangers, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, miss."

The waitress just smiled and turned away. 

The older couple tried their best not to be annoyed as Mark chased his young Tony in and around tables. 

"You will not catch me mortal man! For I am too quick and as fast as ligh--"

Mark clasped his arms under and brought up Tony quickly, turning around and facing the table. "I'm sorry everyone, I'm sorry."

Mark turned and walked with Tony still in his arms. 

"Let me go you, mortal man! I demand you release me!" 

Mark managed to wrestle Tony outside, having him sit on the bench. Mark sighed heavily, "Tony, can I ask you something."

"Yes, mortal man."

"How often do me and your mom get to come here to Outback."

"Maybe.. I don't know.. Not often..." 

"Okay, You see? Tony, you're a great kid. But your mom busts her ass to keep that gel in your hair and that your stomach full. You see where going with this?"

Tony's smiled faded, slowly nodding his head.. 

"You mother doesn't get to go out often. If you ruin this I will... Remember that movie The Human Centipede we found in your room a couple months ago?"

Tony nodded slowly. 

"I will literally sow your mouth to my asshole and shit into your stomach for weeks. Is that clear."

Tony nodded his head. 

"Hey, you guys okay?" Susan said from Outback steakhouse door, "I'm waiting for you in there."

"Tell your mom you're felling better." Mark said, grabbing Tony's shoulder. 

Tony smiled, and turned to his mom and said. 

"No! This horrible hairy man's arm is on my all knowing shoulders! Tell him to back away at once!"

	<TEXT> "Your sword and your shield can be placed right there."

"And my necklace of heads?" 

The tall man asks, not sure to place the necklace of decapitated skulls on my desk, or on the floor. 

"The floor please," I say, pointing to a nice spot for the tall man to put his trophies, "My desk is a mess as it is." 

The tall man sets the necklace down, with the sword and shield, and sits in the chair in front of me. I cycle through paper work on my desk, gosh, it was always a mess. 

I didn't really think anyone would show up, you know? But, we had a deal...

"Alright, so, uh.."

"Thomas.." the tall man says, adjusting himself in the chair. 

"Thomas, okay, so, the world, has ended, and I see you're doing a good...with the whole surviving thing.."

"I had to eat my neighbor, his wife and his kids! I carrying them with me everywhere I go, reminders of my victories.." Thomas looks down at the skulls on the floor.

"Ah, I see, well, it goes great with the... attire you've decided to wear."

Thomas looks down and back to me, "It's made from old bedding, and some of my old hunting gear, you like it?"

"Oh, yes, it's, you know what, it's definitely "in" but let's get down to why you're here."

"Yes," Thomas says, leaning forward, "I paid you guys $150 every month for the last five years."

"Yes," I say looking at the paperwork, "on time, every month too."

"The misses was always all over me about paying the bills on time... You want to meet her?"

"You brought your wife?"

"Half of her, the other half I couldn't find..."

"I'll pass on seeing your wife, well, I don't want to be rude, you did pay on time for so long. Do you have the top half or the bottom half?"

Thomas shook his head, "No, I have half of her, so an arm, head, leg, and some of her ribs, I told her we would be together forever..."

"Ah, and she's not all together." I say. 

"No, not yet, but anyways. I paid, I paid for so long, and I'm here to make a claim."

I nod my head, "Of course, Thomas, of course. Okay, so that we're on the same page, we both know, that money... well doesn't have any value currently."

Thomas nods his head, "Yes, I know, I burned all my saving to keep me and whisper warm."

"Who's Whisper?"

"My horse."

"Of course, well, Thomas, I'm going to be honest with you. Since the world has ended, and being my office is the only place I could hide out, being there was enough food and water here for the next several months, I really didn't think we would, well, I, would be seeing any of our clients."

"I don't understand," Thomas says, leaning closer, "I paid you guys for five years!"

"Hey! I know, I know, take it easy. Here. Look, I took an oath when I took this job that I would do what I can to ensure all your needs are fit. How about this," I lean in close, whispering to Thomas, "There's a group, not far from here, ten people, maybe fifteen. Why don't you and I, take that nice shield and sword, you can wear your lovely necklace, and we go, take over their supplies?"

Thomas stares at me, then slams his fist down onto my desk. "Deal! You and me, we take everything they have!"

"Yes! We can go--"

There's a knock on my office door, it opens slowly and a heavily bearded man with a blood stained face pokes his head through, "Hey," the man says, "Is this *The End* insurance, is this where I make a claim?"

	<TEXT> "... And that.." 

"... that's the heart... is this a joke?"

I shook my head, "No, no, of course not! It's just, a reminder to me, and of course all of you, where all the red, gross, moving stuff is at, that's all.. "

"Doctor, we can't ju--"


I turned, "Short and sweet, she'll understand."

I ditched the gloves in the sink, open the doors, stepped out and as humanly fast as I possibly could, I ran..
