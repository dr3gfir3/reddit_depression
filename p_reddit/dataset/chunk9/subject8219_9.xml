	<TEXT> True psychedelic use, i mean not just taking it for shits and giggles....leads to some revelations. Im talking about when you travel inside yourself. True mind expanding experiences. What did you learn?

Mushrooms made me realise how shit my 10 year relationship was. I realised I was deeply depressed. In one night when I saw things like people as marionette puppets and holes appearing in walls, i made a conscious inner decision to do what was at the time unthinkable and leave that woman. I've since lived on my own for a few years. At time its lonely, but a million  times better than living with a woman that does you down.

For that i thank shrooms.

Peace ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only told this story to one person in real life. And not thought about it for a long time. I'm a pretty fucked up person and when I remember all the parts to my past that made me fucked up its no wonder.

Here is my story of sexual abuse.

I was about 11 and everyone used to hang in a local park. I had a lot of problems at home and had decided to go out and play for a while. 

There was nobody about to play with so I just went down to this park anyway and was amusing myself climbing trees and stuff when this guy came over. The funny thing is to this day i cant even remember what he looked like. He just sort of grabbed my arm and dragged me into these really dense bushes that lined the back side of the park. 

Everything seemed to be a blur. But i remember him sticking a hand down my pants. Then (ill spare you the details). He raped me. I didnt know what it was or anything. I hadn't even discovered masturbation at this point. I was  a fucking kid.

I didnt tell anyone. And i wont. I told my girlfriend when we had been going out for a while. But not mentioned it since. 

I have lived my entire life with anxiety and depression. Been hooked on lots of drugs. And always found relaxing in intimate situations difficult.

I dont know man. Thinking about it. I just feel violated even now over 25 years later. Cunt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chewing tobacco??

Let me tell you a story. My first experience with any sort of chemical or drug was buying a cigarette off another boy at school. He gave me three matches to light it.  But as a complete newbie i broke the matches and looked at the cigarette wondering what to do. 

I had heard of chewing tobacco so assumed you just chewed the tobacco. I broke open the cigarette and put the loose dry tobacco in my mouth and went to my lesson chewing like an imbecile.

The burning sickly feeling came on quickly and within 2 minutes of being in class i threw up all over the table! Literally worst cigarette i ever had.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hannah baker in 13 reasons why.

I just finished it. I liked the series but honestly thought she was such a self indulgent snow flake who honestly put herself in a lot of bad situations.

1. Know you have a stalker peering in your window...have faux lesbian session with curtains open.

2. Entrap the school principle for not giving a shit enough to chase after her when she's behaving moribund. Not empathising he probably has dozens of depressed teenagers to deal with. And cos he didn't give all his attention to her....goes and slashes her wrists.

3. Instead of showing all the people they hurt in a productive way. Kills herself to teach them a lesson. Hence setting a terrible example to all young people watching! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Either way I would throw it. It could be all sorts of things. There was a fad back in the 90s to "smoke" poppers fags. They dipped the end of a fag in poppers (amyl nitrate), then without lighting it people would suck on it like smoking. Poppers were always shit in my opinion. 

I once went on a date to Blackpool with a girl and we were on the seafront, I was a but pissed and had bought a bottle of Poppers,  she was a boring girl and I decided to brighten things up by snorting the bottle repeatedly. I went dizzy and fell and hit my head.  Fuck Poppers. 

But it could also be PCP or some other fucked up chemical! Flush it down the toilet... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in 98 we used to listen to deep trance type stuff. Gatecrasher albums and the likes.

I remember one mix when I was on acid and for quite a few minutes the DJ was mixing in the upcoming song which was called "crazy" and it kept low level saying "im losing my mind...." just in the background. It was so intense i had to turn  it off.

Best album was always screamadelica to me. So psychedelic and trippy but also positive and mellow! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can i ask a sort of related question....

I dont so drugs anymore. I enjoy advising people etc and sharing my 2 decade knowledge of chemicals but one thing I don't understand...

When I used to trip, we used to just drop the blotter or micro dots or gels....we knew it as being "weak" or "strong". Like a dealer would say "that blotters not so strong you might need 2 or 3" or "those micro dots are mind blowing just take one"....but on here I see people saying they took 250 micrograms or whatever...how do people know what the dose is?

	<TEXT> I no longer do drugs and i was a lot younger back then. Whilst I had a great time i do indeed agree that central Amsterdam is a haven of many fucked up people. 

Now psychedelic mushrooms are banned (a tourist died whilst on them and they were promptly banned). 

My holidays did not just revolve around drugs. I got pissed as well  </TEXT>
