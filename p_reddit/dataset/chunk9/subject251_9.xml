	<TEXT> 2.5 g blonde ale batch 

1.055 OG 

1.013 FG

1056 ale yeast pitched 4 days ago 

5lb golden promise 

0.25 lb crystal 10

Fermentation temp 63F wrapped in a blanket 

Krausen appeared and was active but never more than an inch thick or so, much less and shorter than my IPA batches. 

Should I just take a gravity reading to see where we're at?

I can provide a pic but basically looks like solid yeast cake on bottom of carboy and almost clear top of the wort, like it's done fermenting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently have 2 batches - a coffee stout at around 1.012 SG and 5% ABV ready to bottle and an IPA that will finish around 1.025 and 7.25% ABV.  

Both are about 3 gallons or so.  I have 23 swing top 16oz bottles that I plan to use for the IPA.  My question is, can I carb the stout in my 64oz growlers from breweries I have visited?  It'll be low carb (2 volumes or so) so I don't think ill be making bombs?

I'd prefer not to hunt down empty bottles and cap and I don't have CO2/reg for the keg I just bought.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last recipe- DIPA

2 lb oats steeped at 160F for 20 mins in 3.75 gal water. Removed oats, bring water to boil. Stir in 6.6 lb of "Extra Light" LME and added 1 oz Citra for bittering. 60 min boil to about 3.25 gall final wort volume. 

At this point, it's already dark as hell. Has nothing really to do w burning at the bottom. So idk... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried 2x now to get a NEIPA out of a LME brew. Both times, the color is so dark and malty. The first batch was made w Pilsen light and turned out dark. The second batch I used extra light LME, steeped some flaked oats, then proceeded as normal. Still, suuuper dark...  

how the hell do I get the lighter end of the SRM spectrum? The brew tastes pretty great and has a super tropical nose but the color is off putting to me as I'm local to Tree House, NEBCO, Trillium, etc lol  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok got it. Well, my thought would be to add a kidney loop that extends lower beyond the bottom of your current setup. Assuming the coil is in a cylindrical shape, can you make a smaller diameter coil that sits within (and taller) the original? If you can fit a cylinder within a cylinder then you can achieve the longer height and effectively add more cooling surface area. Something like this:
