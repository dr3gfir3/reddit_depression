	<TEXT> I was just scrolling through this subredit and came across a post regarding AP Kog and the new Nasher's Tooth.  This made me wonder how viable he would be as a top lane much like Teemo is now if you play him AP.  Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saying that a remake should be as close to the original as possible would make creating the remake kind of silly wouldn't it?  The whole idea behind the remakes is to appeal to new audiences while keeping as much of the original as possible; they wouldn't make new ones if all they did was appeal to the same fan base. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are still great moral lessons and tales to be told through the new series of Star Trek.  I lament a few of the things missing from the original series as well, but I embrace change and enjoy the new series too.  Enjoy it for what it is, entertainment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Star Trek fans of old miss the intellectual side of Star Trek and while I sort of miss it too, this reboot does great justice to the series.  Stop lamenting and whining about the differences between the old and the new and focus more on what has changed for the better.  Think of the new Star Trek movies as the same universe with a different retelling of the story *cough cough different timeline* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really, in the end I enjoyed this cosplay for a couple of reasons.  First, this is /r/cosplaygirls and lets be honest, most of us come here to see some skin.  Second, she loves cosplay and anime which is awesome and apparent from her profile.  Finally, I don't pick apart someone's cosplay because they don't fit my image of the character.

I'll leave this thread with a thumbs up to the cosplayer, and tell everyone else to lighten up, its cosplay and meant to be enjoyed, not judged. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *shrugs* Cosplay is about whatever the wearer wants it to be.  Its a fun experience whether its building the costume, the attention you get from it, or actually trying to "be" the character.  In the end, its all for personal enjoyment and judging someone because they don't fit someone else's opinion of what Cosplay may or may not be, is a dick move. </TEXT>

Purpose [edit]

The cosplayer's purpose may generally be sorted into one of three categories, or a combination of the three. Most cosplayers draw characteristics from all three categories:
The first is to express adoration for a character, or in feeling similar to a character in personality, seeking to become that character. This type of cosplayer may be associated with being a fan and is often labeled as an otaku. Other characteristics may be an enthusiastic manner and less attention to detail and quality. Such cosplayers are also most likely to adopt the character's personality and are known to criticise other cosplayers for not having a full knowledge of their character, or not also adopting character mannerisms.

The second is those people who enjoy the attention that cosplaying a certain character brings. Within the cultures of anime and manga specifically, as well as science fiction and fantasy, there is a certain level of notoriety that is attached to cosplayers. Such cosplayers are usually characterised by attention to detail in their garments and their choice of popular characters. They are also noted by participation in cosplay competitions.

The third is those who enjoy the creative process, and the sense of personal achievement upon completion. Such people are more likely to have a greater budget dedicated to the project, more complicated and better quality outfits with access to more materials. They are also more likely to engage with professional photographers and cosplay photographers to take high quality images of the cosplayer in their garment posing as the character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the point of cosplay is to dress up like a character from something because its fun, end of story.  You can argue this all you want but in reality you're just being a pretentious, internet dick by over analyzing a cosplay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To all of you over analyzing this for its "over sexualization"... get over yourself.  She's portraying a character, in a sexy way.  Enjoy it for what it is and stop over analyzing it.  I've seen all of Eva, and honestly I could care less if she doesn't "capture" the essence of Asuka.  She's not an actor, she's a cosplayer, stfu. </TEXT>
