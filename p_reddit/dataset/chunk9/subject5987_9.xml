	<TEXT> It's a touchy subject with some people because they might have been spanked when they were a child and they don't want to think of their parents as "abusive". I don't think that's the case when talking about the past because it was the norm back then, although I do think it would have been better if it didn't happen. So those people need to break the chain and not spank their own children, because nowadays it is not normal and we know it's harmful.

It used to be normal for husbands to spank their wives, in a serious way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's an argument that it's associated with youth, but it doesn't really make sense because your hair gets darker when you hit puberty, not when you start aging. It's probably a mix of cultural influences and because it catches your eye more, although obviously not every guy is more attracted to blondes. I hear guys say they like brunettes more often despite the stereotype. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Abortion wouldn't be nearly as controversial of an issue.

Just because I feel like venting, my dad's girlfriend's brother (a very religious former pastor) started going on a rant during Easter dinner about how he thought abortion should be illegal and blah blah blah and that he believed in universal healthcare and thought college education should be free but voted for Donald Trump because "he's pro-life". He then asked all the men at the table for their opinions, (who all agreed with him), and completely ignored all the women at the table, including me, and I was sitting right in front of him and had just been talking to him. Whenever I tried to say something he cut me off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not in my personal experience. The older people in the Boston area are (and really New England in general) the more likely they are to have stronger accents. 

I grew up in a somewhat wealthier town near Boston and people under 40 or so mostly have generic sounding American accents except for saying wicked a lot, while most people over 40ish do generally have accents.

 In the more working class/ townie-ish towns in the Boston area young people will have the accent too, but older people are still more likely to have stronger accents.

In Boston itself it really depends on the neighborhood, but the accent is definitely dying out and you hear it more often in the towns surrounding Boston than actually in the city. </TEXT>

It didn't help that half of the "only 90s kids will remember this" stuff was from the 00s and almost all of it is stuff that even people born in the early 00s would remember. </TEXT>
