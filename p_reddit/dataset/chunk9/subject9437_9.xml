	<TEXT> While it's true the blog post might be barbed in tone, it is still not wrong though. There really is no good evidence that cupping works. The author might have looked at the evidence against it but chosen not to post about it. The burden of proof is on the one making the claim but not otherwise. And, the quacks are the ones making such unsubstantiated claims. 

I understand the author's frustration. There are lots of people getting swindled for an otherwise ineffective procedure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to the article, no evidence tends to back cupping aside from anecdotes and subjective experience. Does anyone here know of any peer-reviewed studies with proper statistical analysis of cohort groups and accurate methodology? Quite surprisingly, WebMD does not seem to criticize it much? http://www.webmd.com/balance/guide/cupping-therapy  </TEXT>
