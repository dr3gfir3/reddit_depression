	<TEXT> May not be exactly related to this case, but I hate those parents who blame their chidrens fault to Apple and Google. I remember reading about a parent who wanted a refund for the apps his or her child bought, and the child knew the password of the account.

So, the parent
1. Let the child use his or her phone
2. Did not warn about making purchases
3. Let the child know the password of his or her account
And then blamed Google or Apple for letting apps "luring" children to pay for apps.

Thanks to that kind of parents, now I have to type password often to buy something on a phone when I have no children at all. </TEXT>
