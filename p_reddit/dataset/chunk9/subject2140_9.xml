	<TEXT> While this person was not a total stranger it was still someone i had only known for a week.  It also seems like r/thathappened material.



I was in high school and was being bullied by someone i knew from middle school.  This kid was harmless basically and not very big just annoying.  This happened in my electronics class and i sat at the same table every time.  This kid was a decently large senior who i generally talked to since it was a mourning class.  He witnessed this for a few days and on the second week when the kid who bullied me started up again like normal he did the following.  He stood up and told the kid too shut the fuck and sit down or he would beat the shit outta him "Right now" and he said if he ever even heard you were bothering him i will beat the shit out of you.  That kid would not even look at me funny for fear of this kid beating the ever loving shit out of him.

He had no real reason to stand up for me and while threatening violence is certainly not the answer it did work in that instance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> pathologically lie about everything constantly.  The worst was he lied and said his aunt owned an apartment and no one else had bought any of the apartments in her building, The apartments were all sold out pretty quickly as it was a pretty wealthy area.  It was always really pointless things to lie about, usually for no reason just for attention.

I actually felt bad for the kid so i was nice too him and did not really call him out, i know that was probably not really gonna help him in the long run though. </TEXT>
