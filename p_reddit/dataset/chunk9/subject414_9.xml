	<TEXT> True, although I think the Brownface amps have cool trem too. I have a '59 2x10 Super (reverse panel) that uses four triodes (12AX7/7025) for tremolo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Different brands of current generation tubes will obviously sound different. We prefer the sound and quality of JJ's and build around their specs.

In vintage amps I spend my money on NOS rectifier tubes and vintage speakers. That's where Ossie and I think the the magic is ;)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice!! I toured with a '65 Vibrolux (2x10) for years and loved it. My modded Princeton has a 12 in it, but I love 10's as well. Those Vibroverb reissues are cool. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have always been a 'maker' since I was a kid, from skateboards to art to furniture. So when trying to transition from touring back to a semi-retired home life I thought about either building guitars or amps or pedals. I had already done pedalboards as a business in the 90's and early 2000's so I wanted to do something different.

My partner Ossie went to college for Electronics Engineering, a more specialized EE, but that was a while ago and may not be applicable to school these days. Most of the great amp builders I know started as repair guys and thats where their knowledge stems from. So if you are interested in amp building I'd suggest trying to apprentice under a skilled amp tech. Also building amp kits and modding amps from schematics on the internet can be helpful, but also dangerous as voltages inside most tube amps run 300+VDC and can kill you. I like learning from someone in person, who can tell me what to do and not do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's easy early 60's Blackface Deluxe Reverb. Although, we built me a modded Princeton Reverb recently that I've been playing a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both the guys in Linkin and Green Day are pretty nice guys. It's always cool to catch up with them when they come through town. 

As far as local band gigs go, one of the main things when guitar teching is to try and make the gear as bullet proof as possible BEFORE the gig. Also, bring a spare guitar if possible, some spare cables, strings, picks, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, still answering questions. I'm gonna leave this AMA open for at least another day to try and answer as many as possible.

OK, to answer yours:

1. I've used Meguiars http://www.meguiars.com/ products over the years to remove scratches with some success. Since most guitars are painted with paint similar to cars. If you have a automotive paint store or high end detail place where you live, ask those guys what they might recommend, they are a wealth of knowledge usually.

2. I've never prepared a guitar specifically to withstand rain or sand. Most guitars are pretty good at combatting it on their own, and when rain has happened on an outdoor show, I've never had a guitar go down due to weather. I do make sure the guitars are dried off as much as possible before putting them away for the night. Repairs get done at the next show if needed, new pickups, output jack, etc. I have had to sweat-proof wireless packs over the years, as some guys will sweat so much the packs go out during the shows. Usually this means wrapping the pack in plastic wrap or putting it in a condom to keep it as dry as possible.

3. I haven't played a ton of the inexpensive stuff, but I did buy a J Mascis Squier Jazzmaster last year and it is one of the better playing guitars I've come across and I have left it completely stock. In fact it has been my main guitar lately and I have plenty of vintage and higher-end guitars. Over the years I have played a few of the LTD, Epiphone, etc. offering and usually find them to be pretty good as well. YMMV and if you have access to a large guitar shop, play as many models/manufacturers as you can and find what fits your playing and budget.

4. I can't really say specifically how the Korean manufacturers are doing. My JM was made in China I believe and the neck is perfect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope. One thing I pride myself on is honesty, if I break something I tell the artist and it gets fixed or replaced. Last thing you want is something to go wrong in front of thousands of people that could have been prevented by owning up to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True. 

The name came from our love of the vintage Orange amps that we were listening to while developing that model.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually neither, more like a smoothie in the morning. But, I do like a banana pancake.
