	<TEXT> I've seen Silver Bokoblins but no other silver enemies so far. I've completed all four Divine Beasts and discovered every region, I've done ~80 shrines and found 11 of the 12 Sheikah Slate memories. Is that not late-game enough for the other silver enemies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Go the furthest southeast you can go on the map. From the Hateno Research Lab you can see a small, isolated island with a Shrine on it--from there you can see Eventide. Honestly, if you've beaten the game you probably have enough heart containers that it won't give you too much trouble.

I found another special challenge in the far northeast corner of the map today, so I'm guessing there are challenges at all corners. Can't wait to see what the other two are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Eventide challenge is the most engaged I've ever been in a Zelda game. I literally stood on a cliff and threw bombs at the boss for 15 minutes until he died because I was so scared of dying and having to start all the way over.

For those wondering, Eventide is (I think) the furthest southeast you can go. You can see it from the tiny island with the Shrine visible from the Hateno Research Lab. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's shocking how much the combat feels like Dark Souls, which is one of my favorite game series of all time. And even with over 200 hours of experience in those games, the Eventide challenge took me three hours.

	<TEXT> Trust me, I felt the EXACT same way in my first several hours, but the more I play it the more I fall in love with the new style. I'm very attached to the 3D Zelda formula, so it's a little disappointing to not have that experience again after waiting so long for a new game, but this game is so engaging in its own special way that I keep forgetting it feels more like The Witcher and Dark Souls than like Zelda. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, clothes are super rare. 20 hours in I think I have 5 clothing items, not including the DLC Switch shirt.

Make sure you retrieve at least one memory and then talk to Impa, and she'll give you the Hero shirt, which allows you to see enemy HP and has way better defense than any of the other early game clothing items.

EDIT: You also should have gotten some basic clothes from the chests in the Shrine of Resurrection... if you've been pants-less this whole time, then yes, you should be worried. </TEXT>

If you're a PC gamer, The Witcher 3 is your best bet. That's the game I'm reminded of the most while playing Breath of the Wild, more so than previous Zelda games, honestly. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (19M) Been on three dates with crush (18F), she wants to date more frequently but "isn't really looking for a relationship," what does it mean? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-08 01:54:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before I start, it's worth mentioning that I've never been in a relationship, I've only been on 11 dates in my life including the three listed below, and overall I just have no clue what the fuck I'm doing. Hope that helps.

So there's this girl at work whom I met in November. I've had a bit of a crush on her ever since I met her and we got along really well right from the first conversation. One day at work, mid-December, I won two tickets to Rogue One in a gift exchange, and she wanted the other one, so I invited her to come with me. We both agreed that it was a date, not just hanging out--she was the first one to call it a date, actually, and obviously I went with it. We went out a second time three weeks later (a simple lunch date) and again last Friday (semi-fancy dinner and then a different movie I'd been wanting her to see).

All three dates went really well, especially the most recent one, and the week leading up to it we had been talking at work even more than usual. It's not a very socialization-friendly work environment, but ever since the first date we've gone out of our way to say hi to each other and we've had a few long conversations when working in the same area. Honestly, she probably figured out that I like her a long time ago, since I'm usually very closed off at work but I talk to her fairly often whereas I rarely talk to any of my other coworkers, and after asking her out three times... yeah, it's probably pretty obvious.

So, since we'd been getting along so well and the third date was so much fun for both of us, I decided to open up a little bit about my feelings at the end. Basically I told her that I love spending time with her and didn't want to wait three weeks to ask her out again. She seemed very flattered and said that she loves spending time with me too and would also love to go out more frequently, but then she said, "you should probably know that I'm not really looking for a relationship right now, because I just got out of a two-year-long one and it kind of ripped my soul apart."

We've texted a little bit since then but I haven't seen her in person yet (she works part-time) and I'm freaking the fuck out trying to decide how to proceed. I ruined my last chance at a relationship because I was too overbearing, so I've been trying really hard not to be, which is why I waited three weeks between each date instead of calling her immediately the next day. But since she gave me the go-ahead on dating more, I'm really tempted to call her tonight even though it's only been a few days.

And of course the part that's been stressing me out the most is the fact that she's apparently not looking for a relationship. I know she isn't lying about the two-year boyfriend, but I don't know how recent it was and I can't help but wonder if she's interested in a relationship, just not with me, and she's trying to let me down slowly. Or maybe she is interested in a relationship with me but she just wants more time away from her last one and more time getting to know me before she makes another commitment...? I can't see why she would want to go out more often if she wasn't at least a little interested, but she's also a very nice person who could definitely be going with it just to make me feel better.

I'm confused. Help pls.

TL;DR - Been on three dates with my coworker whom I am very fond of at this point, told her at the end of the third date that I love spending time with her and would like to go out more frequently, she was flattered and said she loves spending time with me too and also wants to go out more often but she "isn't really looking for a relationship right now" because she just got out of a two-year-long one and it "ripped her soul apart". How to proceed? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about buying the DLC </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-29 09:11:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just beat Mergo's Wet Nurse and I'm aware that I'm not supposed to enter the final boss arena until I've played the DLC. I've held off on buying it just in case it went on sale during my playthrough, but it didn't, so at this point I'm cool with paying full price.

Problem is, I don't know if buying it at this point in the game will automatically add the Eye of a Blood-Drunk Hunter to my inventory, or if the game will require me to beat Vicar Amelia again in a new playthrough. If it doesn't give it to me right away, I'll hold off on buying it until it actually does go on sale, or until I feel like playing Bloodborne again, which may not be for a while. I don't want to waste $20, so if anybody knows the answer to this I'd appreciate it.

TL;DR - Already beat Vicar Amelia, chilling before triggering final boss--does buying the DLC give me the Eye of a Blood-Drunk Hunter right away or nah? </TEXT>
